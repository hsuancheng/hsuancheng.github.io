The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of all forms of IBD including ulcerative  (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and IBD unspecified (IBDU).Pediatric (age -17) and adult (age ≥18) IBD patients were identified from  large claims databases. For each year between 2007 and 2016, prevalence was calculated per 100,000 population and standardized based on the 2016 national Census. A fixed-effects meta-analytical model was used for overall prevalence.The pediatric prevalence of IBD overall increased by 133%, from 33.0/100,000 in 2007 to 77.0/100,000 in 2016. Among children, CD was twice as prevalent as UC (45.9 vs 21.6). Prevalence was higher in boys than girls for all forms of IBD, in contrast to the adult population where the prevalence was higher in women than men. We also found that the 10-17 age subgroup was the major contributor to the rising pediatric IBD prevalence. For adults, the prevalence of IBD overall increased by 123%, from 214.9 in 2007 to 478.4 in 2016. The prevalence rates of UC and CD were similar (181.1 vs 197.7) in 2016.Inflammatory bowel disease continues to affect a substantial proportion of the US population. In 2016, 1 in 209 adults and 1 in 1299 children aged -17 were affected by IBD. Prevalence of IBD has been increasing compared with previously published 2009 data.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

The results revealed that AA-βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing  disease activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing tight junction proteins. Additionally, AA-βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty acids and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to IBD were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and . The results indicated that AA-βG might treat IBD through the regulation of gut microbiota, suggesting that AA-βG has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566409>Status of transition care in inflammatory bowel disease in Spain. Different medical perspectives.</a></h2><p>transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives.a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative  (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition.one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.5% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns). The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about disease and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine.in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637417>Transanal ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative  has comparable long-term functional outcomes to transabdominal approach: a multicentre comparative study.</a></h2><p>The transanal approach to ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (Ta-IPAA) provides better access to the lower pelvis with lower short-term morbidity in ulcerative  (UC). The aim of this study was to assess the long-term functional outcomes after Ta-IPAA versus transabdominal IPAA (Abd-IPAA) in UC.A multicentre cohort analysis was done between March 2002 and September 2017. Patient characteristics, surgical details and postoperative outcomes were compared. CGQL (Cleveland global quality of life) score at 12 months with a functioning pouch was considered the primary endpoint.A total of 374 patients (100 Ta-IPAA vs 274 Abd-IPAA) were included. Ta-IPAA demonstrated a comparable overall quality of life (CGQL score) to Abd-IPAA (0.75 ± 0.11 vs 0.71 ± 0.14; respectively, p=0.1). Quality of life (7.71 ± 1.17 vs 7.30 ± 1.46; p=0.04) and energy level items (7.16 ± 1.52 vs 6.66 ± 1.68; p=0.03) were significantly better after Ta-IPAA, while the quality of health item was comparable (7.68 ± 1.26 vs 7.64 ± 1.44; p=0.96). Analysis excluding anastomotic leaks did not change the overall CGQL scores. Stool frequencies (>10/ 24 hrs:22% vs 21%; p=1.0) and the rate of single episode of major incontinence during the 12-month period (27% vs 26%; p=0.89) were similar. The differences in thirty-day morbidity rates (33% vs 41%; p=0.) and the anastomotic leak rates were not significant (6% vs 13%; p=0.09).This study provides evidence of comparable long-term functional outcome and quality of life after Ta-IPAA and Abd-IPAA for UC.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

For each algorithm, we compared the case identification results from electronic medical records data with the gold standard (chart-based diagnosis). A multiple sampling test verified the validation results from the entire study population.A random nationwide sample of 1697 patients (848 potential cases and 849 negative control cases) from 17 hospitals were included for validation. A combination of the ICD-10 code, ≥ 1 claims for health care encounters, and ≥ 1 prescription claims (reference algorithm) achieved excellent performance (sensitivity, 93.1% [95% confidence interval 91-94.7]; specificity, 98.1% [96.9-98.8]; positive predictive value, 97.5% [96.1-98.5]; negative predictive value, 94.5% [92.8-95.8]) with the lowest error rate (4.% [3.3-5.3]). The multiple sampling test confirmed that the reference algorithm achieves the best performance regarding IBD diagnosis. Algorithms including the RID registration codes exhibited poorer performance compared with that of the reference algorithm, particularly for the diagnosis of patients affiliated with secondary hospitals. The performance of the reference algorithm showed no statistical difference depending on the hospital volume or IBD type, with P-value < 0.05.We strongly recommend the reference algorithm as a uniform standard operational definition for future studies using the NHIS database.© 2019 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583863>Prescription of Antibiotics for Adults with Acute Infectious Diarrhea in Korea: A Population-based Study.</a></h2><p>Acute infectious diarrhea (AID) is a commonly observed condition globally. Several studies recommend against the use of empiric antibiotic therapy for AID, except in some cases of travelers' diarrhea. However, many physicians prescribe antimicrobial agents for AID. We aimed to determine the rate of antibiotic use and the associated prescription patterns among adults with AID.This population-based, retrospective epidemiological study was performed using Korean National Health Insurance claims data from 2016 to 2017. The study population comprised adults (age ≥18 years) who had visited clinics with AID-related complaints. Exclusion criteria were the presence of Crohn's disease, ulcerative , irritable bowel syndrome, and other non-infectious forms of . Patients who underwent surgery during admission were also excluded.The study population comprised 1,613,057 adult patients with AID (767,606 [47.6%] men). Young patients (age 18 - 39 years) accounted for 870,239 (54.0%) of the study population. Overall, 752,536 (46.7%) cases received antibiotic prescriptions. The rate of antibiotic administration tended to be higher among elderly patients (age ≥65 years) than among younger patients (49.5% . 46.4%,  <0.001). The antibiotics most frequently prescribed in both monotherapy and combination regimens were fluoroquinolones (29.8%), rifaximin (26.8%), second-generation cephalosporins (9.%), third-generation cephalosporins (7.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (5.5%), and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (5.3%). Patients who visited tertiary care hospitals had lower rates of antibiotic therapy (n = 14,131, 41.8%) than did those visiting private clinics (n = 532,951, 47.1%). In total, 56,275 (62.3%) admitted patients received antibiotic therapy, whereas outpatients had lower rates of antibiotic prescription (n = 694,204, 46.0%).This study revealed differences between the antibiotics used to treat AID in Korea and those recommended by the guidelines for AID treatment. Multifaceted efforts are necessary to strengthen physicians' adherence to published guidelines.Copyright © 2019 by The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and Korean Society for Antimicrobial Therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental .</a></h2><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced .  was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after  induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73. ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental  even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645725>Structural basis of species-selective antagonist binding to the succinate receptor.</a></h2><p>The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate is involved in metabolic processes and plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation. Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative , liver fibrosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673718>Stereotactic body radiotherapy for ventricular tachycardia (cardiac radiosurgery) : First-in-patient treatment in Germany.</a></h2><p>Single-session cardiac stereotactic body radiotherapy, called cardiac radiosurgery (CRS) or radioablation (RA), may offer a potential treatment option for patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm who are otherwise ineligible for catheter ablation. However, there is only limited clinical experience. We now present the first-in-patient treatment using (CRS/RA) for VT in Germany.A 78-year-old male patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly reduced ejection fraction (15%) presented with monomorphic VT refractory to poly-anti-arrhythmic medication and causing multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions over the course of several weeks, necessitating prolonged treatment on an intensive care unit. Ultra-high-resolution electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) revealed a re-entry circuit in the cardiac septum inaccessible for catheter ablation. Based on the EVM, CRS/RA with a single session dose of 25 Gy (83% isodose) was delivered to the VT substrate (8.1 cc) using a c-arm-based high-precision linear accelerator on November 30, 2018.CRS/RA was performed without incident and dysfunction of the ICD was not observed. Following the procedure, a significant reduction in monomorphic VT from 5.0 to 1.6 episodes per week and of ICD shock interventions by 81.% was observed. Besides periprocedural nausea with a single episode of vomiting, no treatment-associated side effects were noted. Unfortunately, the patient died 57 days after CRS/RA due to sepsis-associated cardiac circulatory failure after Clostridium difficile-associated  developed during rehabilitation. Histopathologic examination of the heart as part of a clinical autopsy revealed diffuse fibrosis on most sections of the heart without apparent differences between the target area and the posterior cardiac wall serving as a control.CRS/RA appears to be a possible treatment option for otherwise untreatable patients suffering from refractory VT and electrical storm. A relevant reduction in VT incidence and ICD interventions was observed, although long-term outcome and consequences of CRS/RA remain unclear. Clinical trials are strongly warranted and have been initiated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644942>Healing effects of Cornus mas L. in experimentally induced ulcerative  in rats: From ethnobotany to pharmacology.</a></h2><p>The ethnobotanical studies conducted in Turkey and other countries have revealed that Cornus mas L., from the family Cornaceae have been used against stomachache, diarrhea and .The objective the present study is to determine the possible activity of C. mas in experimentally induced ulcerative  in rats and to identify its phytochemical feature.,4,6-Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced  model was induced in rats. The rats were orally treated with different doses (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) of C. mas 80% methanol extract for 14 days. Increase in body weight, consumed amount of feed, form of the stool, presence of rectal prolapse were followed every day. At the end of the experiment, colon tissues were removed and wet weights for each animal were measured and colon damages were scored. Total antioxidant and total oxidant status, cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) and protein levels of colon tissues were evaluated and histopathological analyses were carried out. After the detection of the effective dose as 400 mg/kg, the aqueous methanol extract was fractionated by using liquid-liquid fractionation technique and the sub-extracts were also tested for in vivo biological activities. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses were conducted to determine the phytochemical profile of the active crude extract and n-butanol sub-extract.Amount of feed consumed per day and increase in body weight were the lowest in the control group, while those values were determined to be the highest in 80% methanol extract (at 400 mg/kg dose), n-butanol sub-extract and reference groups. Following  induction, it was determined that the fecal form was yellow-slippery in all groups and returned to normal after the treatment with C. mas extracts. Rectal prolapse score was less in the extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract treated groups. Total antioxidant, total oxidant status, cytokine and protein levels were found to be in parallel with macroscopic findings. 80% methanol extract (400 mg/kg) and n-butanol sub-extract provided the best healing according to the wet weight measurements and colon damage scoring performed on the removed colon tissues. These findings supported the results of histopathological analysis.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates  induced by ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic  scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase- (COX-) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating . This article is protected by copyright.

However, the action mechanisms of sword bean have not yet been clearly defined. In the present study, the whole parts of a ripened sword bean (RSB) and the green sword bean (GSB) containing bean pod were extracted with ethanol by reflux extraction. The two crude extracts (RSBE and GSBE) from RSB and GSB were validated by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis of gallic acid as a reference chemical. The anti-inflammatory effects of two sword bean extracts were extensively investigated using LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. First, RSBE and GSBE significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandinE (PGE), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. RSBE and GSBE showed no cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cells. In addition, the overexpression of cyclooxygenase- (COX-) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased by RSBE and GSBE. Western blotting and immunostaining analysis showed that RSBE and GSBE inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-B subunits, which correlated with the inhibitory effects on inhibitor kappa B (IB) degradation. In dextran sulfated sodium (DSS)-induced  mice model, RSBE restored body weight, colon length, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-6, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon- (IFN-).

There are limited data available regarding CDI in hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease-related ileal pouch.This study aimed to evaluate the demographics, clinical features, risk factors, and admission outcomes among hospitalized patients with CDI-related pouchitis (CDP).Retrospective chart review was performed for patients who were admitted to our institute for pouchitis between 2013 and 2016 to identify patients with CDP. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors associated with CDP.A total of 160 subjects with pouchitis had a total of 218 admissions during the study period. Primary admission diagnosis was pouchitis or inflammatory bowel disease flare-up for 202 (93%) admissions. Clostridium difficile was tested at least once for 72 patients, and the diagnosis of CDP was established for 16 (10%) patients. All patients with CDP were symptomatic, 13 (81%) had diarrhea, 8 (50%) had abdominal pain, 7 (44%) had nausea/vomiting, and  (13%) had gastrointestinal bleeding. On multivariable analysis, only body mass index > 25 (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06-0.94, p = 0.048) was significantly associated with decreased risk of CDP. No patients in CDP cohort were admitted to ICU, died at the hospital, or readmitted in 30 days after the discharge.In our cohort, obesity was associated with low risk of CDP among hospitalized patients with pouchitis.

However, the underlying mechanisms that govern the immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are still not fully elucidated. Here, we show that member of the Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family, a group of DNA demethylases, are capable of regulating PDLSC immunomodulatory functions. Tet1 and Tet2 deficiency enhance PDLSC-induced T cell apoptosis and ameliorate the disease phenotype in  mice. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of Tet1 and Tet2 leads to hypermethylation of DKK-1 promoter, leading to the activation of WNT signaling pathway and therefore promoting Fas ligand (FasL) expression, which results in elevated immunomodulatory capacity of PDLSCs. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of Tet1 and Tet2 in regulating immunomodulation of PDLSCs. This Tet/DKK-1/FasL cascade may serve as a promising target for enhancing PDLSC-based immune therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610336>Epstein-Barr Virus-Positive Mucocutaneous Ulcers Complicate  Caused by Immune Checkpoint Regulator Therapy and Associate With Colon Perforation.</a></h2><p>Cancer therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause  and colon perforation. We investigated whether infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associates with development and severity of  in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.We performed a retrospective analysis of fixed colon tissues from 16 patients (12 men, 4 women, median age, 69.5 y) with  after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (9 patients treated with anti-CTLA4, 3 patients treated with anti-PD1, and 4 patients received a combination). Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for colon perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected.Colon tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with colon perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small B cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from  patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory  (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.5% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and colon perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that colon tissues from 4/13 patients with  after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with colon perforation) contained EBVMCUs.

It is part of a larger family of CLCA proteins that share highly conserved features and domain architectures. The CLCA domain arrangement is similar to proteins belonging to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, known to process extracellular matrix proteins. Therefore, CLCA1 is an interesting candidate in the search for proteases that process intestinal mucus. Here, we investigated CLCA1's biochemical properties both in vitro and in mucus from mouse and human colon biopsy samples. Using immunoblotting with CLCA1-specific antibodies and recombinant proteins, we observed that the CLCA1 C-terminal self-cleavage product forms a disulfide-linked dimer that non-covalently interacts with the N terminal part of CLCA1, which further interacts to form oligomers. We also characterized a second, more catalytically active, N-terminal product of CLCA1, encompassing the catalytic domain together with its Willebrand domain type A (VWA). This fragment was unstable but could be identified in freshly prepared mucus. Furthermore, we found that CLCA1 can cleave the N-terminal part of the mucus structural component MUC2. We propose that CLCA1 regulates the structural arrangement of the mucus and thereby takes part in the regulation of mucus processing.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541248>Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma: Is there a difference in survival for Crohn's versus Sporadic cases?</a></h2><p>It is well known that Crohn's disease is a risk factor for the development of small bowel adenocarcinoma. However, the association between Crohn's disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma and survival is less understood. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of Crohn's disease on survival in small bowel adenocarcinoma.Patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma, either associated with Crohn's disease or diagnosed sporadic, were identified in the National Cancer Database from 2004-2016. The primary outcome is overall survival.Of ,668 patients, 493 had Crohn's disease-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma and ,175 had sporadic small bowel adenocarcinoma. Crohn's disease patients were more likely to present at a younger age (62 vs 65, p<0.001), have tumors located in the ileum (62.7% vs 25.0%, p<0.001), and have poorly differentiated tumors (47.0% vs 31.7%, p<0.001) compared to sporadic small bowel adenocarcinoma. Factors associated with significantly decreased survival included older age (HR:1.02, 95%CI:1.02-1.03, p<0.001), higher Charlson score (HR:1.39, 95%CI:1.13-1.72, p=0.002), higher tumor grade (HR:1.09, 95%CI:1.04-1.14, p<0.001), positive surgical margins (HR:1.60, 95%CI:1.39-1.84, p<0.001), and higher stage of disease (HR:1.90, 3.75, 8.13, 95%CI:1.37-.64, .68-5.24, 5.77-11.47, for II, III, IV, respectively, compared to I, all p<0.001) (Table 3).

STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in  development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced  and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven . Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced . Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and  development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and -associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559374>The prognostic nutritional index for postoperative infectious complication in patients with ulcerative  undergoing proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis following subtotal colectomy.</a></h2><p>Restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is frequently performed in patients with ulcerative  and factors suspected of increasing the risk of postoperative infectious complications. Using a three-stage approach may result in improvement in overall outcomes, because this leads to improvement in nutritional status and reduction of immunosuppressive doses. However, the influence of preoperative nutritional status on postoperative infectious complications after this procedure has not been examined. The aim of this study was to clarify the potential associations between nutritional status and postoperative infectious complications in patients with ulcerative  undergoing proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.The records of 110 patients who had undergone proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis from January 2000 to March 2018 in Mie University and met the eligibility criteria were reviewed and possible associations between postoperative infectious complications and clinical factors were assessed.Of the remaining 110 patients, 18 (16.4%) had developed postoperative infectious complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that operative bleeding ≥270 g and prognostic nutritional index <47 were significant predictors of postoperative infectious complications (P = 0.033, 0.0076, respectively). Various variables associated with immunosuppressives before ileal pouch-anal anastomosis were not associated with postoperative infectious complications.Our findings suggest that immunosuppressives have no association with postoperative infectious complications, whereas a poor prognostic nutritional index may be a significant predictor of postoperative infectious complications in patients with ulcerative  undergoing proctectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589357>Therapeutic drug monitoring in Inflammatory Bowel Disease reduces unnecessary use of infliximab with substantial associated cost-savings.</a></h2><p>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of infliximab (IFX) levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients can help to guide dose adjustments or changes to therapy for selected patients in remission or with secondary loss of response.To determine how IFX TDM is utilised in a real-life clinical setting and to quantify the potential for TDM to reduce the unnecessary use of IFX.Data from all public IBD IFX level testing performed across Australia was prospectively collected from June 2016 to July 2017 to assess physician-reported for testing indications (induction, in remission or loss of response) and associated results. The hypothetical influence of IFX TDM was based on an optimal therapeutic range of 6-10 mg/L for mucosal healing.Secondary loss of response (reactive TDM) was the most common indication for TDM. These patients have consistently lower median IFX levels: 3.02 mg/L (IQR 1.14 - 6.67 mg/L) vs. 5.22 mg/L (IQR .70 - 8.12 mg/L), p = 0.0001 compared with patients in remission (proactive TDM). TDM helped to identify unnecessary use of IFX in 30.6% of the TDM tests performed in luminal Crohn's disease and ulcerative  patients, with an associated drug cost saving of $531.38 per IFX TDM test episode. Unnecessary IFX use was identified in 38.9% (96/247) of reactive IFX TDM tests performed and in 19.3% (35/181) of proactive testing.Use of both reactive and proactive IFX TDM is cost-effective for IBD management as it informs the clinician where unnecessary use of IFX can be stopped.

For patients with moderate to severe UC and/or nonresponse to conventional treatment, advanced therapies (immunosuppressants and biologics) are available. We assessed real-world effectiveness of advanced UC therapies.This retrospective analysis of claims data included adult patients with UC initiating immunosuppressant or biologic therapy, with 12 months' continuous enrollment pre- and postinitiation. Patients had no prescription for biologic therapy (and/or immunosuppressant if initiating immunosuppressant) in the previous 12 months. Proportion of patients remaining steroid-free (excluding 14-week tapering period), hospitalizations, and costs in the 12 months postinitiation were assessed.In total, 3562 patients were included in the analysis. Most patients (83.0%) used steroids in the 12 months before initiating advanced therapy. Overall, 47.8% remained steroid-free after 12 months (excluding tapering). After adjusting for patient characteristics, remaining steroid-free was significantly more likely with infliximab (43.9%) than with adalimumab (39.4%; P < 0.05); golimumab (38.%) and vedolizumab (41.4%) were not significantly different vs adalimumab. Overall, 12.% of patients had a UC-related hospitalization within 12 months of initiation, with a mean (SD) total length of stay of 8.

Diseased tissues are heavily vascularized. Surprisingly, the pathogenic impact of the vasculature in IBD and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. IFN-γ is a major cytokine in IBD pathogenesis, but in the context of the disease, it is almost exclusively its immune-modulatory and epithelial cell-directed functions that have been considered. Recent studies by our group demonstrated that IFN-γ also exerts potent effects on blood vessels. Based on these considerations, we analyzed the vessel-directed pathogenic functions of IFN-γ and found that it drives IBD pathogenesis through vascular barrier disruption. Specifically, we show that inhibition of the IFN-γ response in vessels by endothelial-specific knockout of IFN-γ receptor  ameliorates experimentally induced  in mice. IFN-γ acts pathogenic by causing a breakdown of the vascular barrier through disruption of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. Notably, intestinal vascular barrier dysfunction was also confirmed in human IBD patients, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings. Treatment with imatinib restored VE-cadherin/adherens junctions, inhibited vascular permeability, and significantly reduced colonic inflammation in experimental . Our findings inaugurate the pathogenic impact of IFN-γ-mediated intestinal vessel activation in IBD and open new avenues for vascular-directed treatment of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646411>Genipin attenuates dextran sulfate sodium-induced  via suppressing inflammatory and oxidative responses.</a></h2><p>Genipin is one of the major component in Gardenis fruit, which has long been used in the treatment of many chronic diseases, such as .

DSS-induced MPO activity, MDA level, TNF-α, and IL-1β production in colonic tissues were also suppressed by genipin. To investigate the mechanism of genipin on DSS-induced , the NF-κB and Nrf2 signaling pathways were detected. The results showed genipin significantly attenuated DSS-induced NF-κB activation and increased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in a dose-dependent manner.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is involved in various immune responses, with reported proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be associated with  and -associated cancer. IL-33 induces the inflammatory cascade through its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity- (ST-). Binding of IL-33 to membrane-bound ST- (mST-) recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates intracellular signaling pathways. However, whether IL-33/ST- is triggered by  infection and whether this interaction occurs in lipid rafts remain unclear. Our study showed that both IL-33 and ST- expression levels were significantly elevated in -infected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that ST- mobilized into the membrane lipid rafts during infection. Depletion of membrane cholesterol dampened -induced IL-33 and IL-8 production. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed IL-33/ST- upregulation, and severe leukocyte infiltration was observed in gastric tissues infected with .

UC is estimated to afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. In addition to traditional colonoscopy, ultrasonic techniques can detect , but have limited spatial resolution, which frequently results in underdiagnoses. Nevertheless, clinical diagnosis of  is still generally performed via colonoscopy. Optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed to detect UC with higher resolution. However, UC can potentially alter tissue biomechanical properties, providing additional contrast for earlier and potentially more accurate detection. Although clinically available elastography techniques have been immensely useful, they do not have the resolution for imaging small tissues, such as in small mammalian disease models. However, OCT-based elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is well-suited for imaging the biomechanical properties of small mammal colon tissue.In this work, we induced elastic waves in  mouse colon tissue using a focused air-pulse. The elastic waves were detected using a phase-stabilized swept source OCE system, and the wave velocity was translated into stiffness. Measurements were taken at six positions for each sample to assess regional sample elasticity. Additional contrast between the control and diseased tissue was detected by analyzing the dispersion of the elastic wave and tissue optical properties obtained from the OCT structural image.The results show distinct differences (P<0.05) in the stiffness between control and  disease samples, with a Young's modulus of 11.8±8.0 and 5.1±1.5 kPa, respectively. The OCT signal standard deviations for control and diseased samples were 5.8±0.3 and 5.5±0. dB, respectively. The slope of the OCT signal spatial frequency decay in the control samples was 92.7±10.0 and 87.3±4.7 dB∙µm in the  samples. The slope of the linearly fitted dispersion curve in the control samples was 1.5 mm, and 0.8 mm in the  samples.Our results show that OCE can be utilized to distinguish tissue based on stiffness and optical properties. Our estimates of tissue stiffness suggest that the healthy colon tissue was stiffer than diseased tissue. Furthermore, structural analysis of the tissue indicates a distinct difference in tissue optical properties between the healthy and UC-like diseased tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628914>Identification of novel Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in -associated colorectal cancer in Nrf2-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Nuclear factor erythroid -related factor  (Nrf2), a master regulator of many cytoprotective genes, plays a protective role in carcinogenesis. Recent studies have identified a specific gene-expression signature regulated by the Nrf2 pathway in lung adenocarcinoma and head-and-neck squamous cell cancer. However, the roles of Nrf2 in the development of -associated colorectal cancer (CACC) have not been well characterized. Nrf2 target genes as prognostic biomarkers in CACC remain to be explored. Thus, this work aimed to identify the molecular changes that occur during mouse CACC progression to facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.The CACC model was established using azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in BALB/c mice for 3 weeks to induce -associated adenoma (CAA, early stage) and for 9 weeks to induce -associated carcinoma (CAC, late stage). Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses we examined the mRNA expression profiles of 6 groups: wild-type control (WT-C), WT-CAA, WT-CAC, Nrf2 knockout control (Nrf2KO-C), Nrf2KO-CAA, and Nrf2KO-CAC.In the AOM/DSS model of -associated tumorigenesis, Nrf2 mice showed a phenotype similar to WT mice, but with significantly more tumors and a much higher percentage of adenocarcinomas. We identified 47 novel Nrf2 genes via gene expression profiling of tumor samples. Survival analysis showed that 23 of these genes were biomarkers of a poor prognosis in colon cancer patients.Nrf2 target genes deserve exploration as prognostic and therapeutic targets for CRC.Copyright © 2019.

We characterized utilization of imaging and exposure to ionizing radiation.We enumerated abdominal diagnostic imaging in a population-based cohort of IBD patients between 1994 and 2016. Trends in utilization of abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound were characterized. Cumulative doses of ionizing radiation were compared between IBD patients and non-IBD controls and between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) patients. Regression models were constructed to assess predictors of high ionizing radiation exposure.There were 72,933 incident cases of IBD. During the first 5 years of diagnosis, IBD patients were exposed to nearly 6-fold higher exposure to cumulative ionizing radiation attributable to abdominal imaging compared with non-IBD controls (18.6 mSv vs .9 mSv). Cumulative ionizing radiation exposure was higher in CD than UC (26.0 mSv vs 12.0 mSv; P < 0.001). Crohn's disease patients were more than twice as likely as UC patients to exceed 50 mSv (15.6% vs 6.%; P < 0.001) and 100 mSV (5.0% vs .1%; P < 0.001). There was geographic variation in ionizing radiation exposure, and individuals of lower income were more likely to have high exposure. Utilization of abdominal MRI has increased substantially, peaking between 2007 and 2012 and increasing annually at 34%, which coincided with an annual % decline in the use of abdominal CT.Crohn's disease patients are at highest risk for high exposure to ionizing radiation, with a subgroup receiving potentially harmful levels.

A municipal hospital does not indicate a small hospital. The most significant difference between a municipal hospital and a center or university hospital is that most surgeons in a municipal hospital are general surgeons.The first 30 patients who underwent RRS at the municipal hospital were enrolled between April 2015 and June 2016.

In subgroup analysis, low vitamin D status was associated with Crohn's disease activity (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-.03, I  = 0%), mucosal inflammation (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.85, I  = 0%), clinical relapse (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14-1.59, I  = 0%), and low QOL scores (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04-1.50, I  = 0%) and ulcerative  disease activity (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-.09, I  = 0%) and clinical relapse (OR 1.20, 95% 1.01-1.43, I  = 0%).Low 25(OH)D status is a biomarker for disease activity and predictor of poor clinical outcomes in IBD patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562318>TFF3 interacts with LINGO2 to regulate EGFR activation for protection against  and gastrointestinal helminths.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) have important functions in nutrient absorption, barrier integrity, regeneration, pathogen-sensing, and mucus secretion. Goblet cells are a specialized cell type of IEC that secrete Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) to regulate mucus viscosity and wound healing, but whether TFF3-responsiveness requires a receptor is unclear. Here, we show that leucine rich repeat receptor and nogo-interacting protein  (LINGO2) is essential for TFF3-mediated functions. LINGO2 immunoprecipitates with TFF3, co-localizes with TFF3 on the cell membrane of IEC, and allows TFF3 to block apoptosis. We further show that TFF3-LINGO2 interactions disrupt EGFR-LINGO2 complexes resulting in enhanced EGFR signaling. Excessive basal EGFR activation in Lingo2 deficient mice increases disease severity during  and augments immunity against helminth infection. Conversely, TFF3 deficiency reduces helminth immunity. Thus, TFF3-LINGO2 interactions de-repress inhibitory LINGO2-EGFR complexes, allowing TFF3 to drive wound healing and immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536991>Distinct Association of Serum Vitamin D Concentration with Disease Activity and Trough Levels of Infliximab and Adalimumab during Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment.</a></h2><p>Studies of serum vitamin D (Vit-D) levels in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents are scarce. The conjunction of Vit-D as well as zinc levels and anti-TNF-α-trough concentrations (TC) has not yet been explored.To determine the association of serum Vit-D, zinc and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with clinical and biochemical remission and a possible correlation with serum TC and antibody levels of anti-TNF-α.Serum Vit-D and zinc levels as well as Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) TC during the maintenance phase of treatment were measured in 112 IBD patients. Statistical analysis were performed for clinical and biochemical remission.Vit-D and zinc deficiency were detected in 58 and 4.5% of the patients respectively. In IFX-treated patients, IFX-TC, Vit-D and CRP levels were associated independently with clinical remission with an OR of 20 (95% CI 1.3-333, p = 0.03), 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.7, p = 0.02) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.-0.8, p = 0.01) respectively. Serum IFX-TC and Vit-D levels correlated positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.001), while serum IFX-TC and CRP levels showed an inverse correlation (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Only -IFX-TC associated independently with biochemical remission with a threshold of 3.1 µg/mL. In ADA-treated patients, ADA-TC associated independently with clinical and biochemical remission with an OR of .5 (95% CI 1.1-5.0, p = 0.04) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.03) respectively. The serum zinc level was associated neither with clinical nor with biochemical remission in either cohort.Our results indicate that serum Vit-D level may be a predictive marker in addition to drug trough levels in IBD patients treated with IFX. Furthermore, due to the correlation between serum IFX and Vit-D levels, Vit-D substitution should be conducted in patients with low Vit-D levels.© 2019 S.

Disruption of mucosal wound healing may lead to severe complications including intestinal fibrosis. This study examined mucosal gene expression in the healing process of acute UC with a special focus on known mediators of fibrosis.Endoscopic biopsies from patients with acute, moderate to severe UC were analyzed with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction array for 84 genes involved in fibrosis pathways. All patients were treated with infliximab (anti- tumor necrosis factor). Biopsies were taken before therapy and when disease remission was reached, defined as a Mayo score of ≤, with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1. A healthy control group was included. Immunostaining of matrix metallopeptidase 9 and smooth muscle actin was performed.Mucosal biopsies from acute UC (n = 28), remission UC (n = 28), and healthy controls (n = 13) were analyzed. Fibrosis and extracellular matrix-associated genes were upregulated in the endoscopically healed UC mucosa vs controls, with collagen type III alpha 1 chain, actin alpha , lysyl oxidase, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3, and caveolin 1 uniquely showing no overlap with acute disease. Pro- and antifibrotic mediators (interleukin [IL]13 receptor subunit alpha , IL1B, IL10, tumor necrosis factor, snail family transcriptional repressor 1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand ) were upregulated in both acute and healed UC compared with controls. An attenuated pattern of the canonical transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) pathway was observed in acute UC and to a lesser extent in the healed mucosa, except for TGFB2, which was enhanced.The endoscopically healed mucosa of UC showed a persisting dysregulation of fibrosis-associated mediators compared with controls, including extracellular matrix remodeling, profibrotic cytokines, and TGFB signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613968>Impact of Bariatric Surgery on the Long-term Disease Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>An association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity has been observed. Little is known about the effect of weight loss on IBD course. Our aim was to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on long-term clinical course of obese patients with IBD, either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC).Patients with IBD who underwent bariatric surgery subsequent to IBD diagnosis were identified from  tertiary IBD centers. Complications after bariatric surgery were recorded. Patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, IBD subtype, phenotype, and location to patients with IBD who did not undergo bariatric surgery. Controls started follow-up at a time point in their disease similar to the disease duration in the matched case at the time of bariatric surgery. Inflammatory bowel disease medication usage and disease-related complications (need for corticosteroids, hospitalizations, and surgeries) among cases and controls were compared.Forty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Appropriate matches were found for 25 cases. Median follow-up among cases (after bariatric surgery) and controls was 7.69 and 7.89 years, respectively. Median decrease in body mass index after bariatric surgery was 12.. Rescue corticosteroid usage and IBD-related surgeries were numerically less common in cases than controls (24% vs 52%; odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-1.23; 12% vs 28%; OR, 0.; 95% CI, 0.004-1.79). Two cases and 1 control were able to discontinue biologics during follow-up.Inflammatory bowel disease patients with weight loss after bariatric surgery had fewer IBD-related complications compared with matched controls.

Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI), characterized by compromise of the intestinal wall with gas-filled cysts, has rarely been reported with IBD. The presentation, best management and outcomes of PI with IBD are poorly defined.We conducted a search for PI in all abdominal computed tomography (CT) reports at  large tertiary care hospitals from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017, cross referenced to ICD codes for IBD. CT and chart review was performed to confirm PI and IBD respectively. A systematic review excluding case reports was performed for PI with IBD for comparison.Of 5,990 patients with a CT abdomen report mentioning PI, we identified 11 cases of PI with IBD, 4 UC, 6 CD, and 1 indeterminate . PI was limited to the small bowel in 5 patients, the right colon in 5, and small bowel and colonic in 1. All 3 mortalities had CD, small intestinal PI and portal/mesenteric venous gas. The systematic literature search identified 9 articles describing 58 patients with IBD and PI. These cases were mostly included in larger cohorts of PI patients without extractable data on presentation or outcomes in the IBD subpopulation.Ours appears to be the first reporting of presentations and outcomes, outside of case reports, for those with PI and IBD. The high mortality for those with CD and PI of the small bowel appears to define a group requiring more than supportive medical care.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524013>IgE-sensitization to food and inhalant allergens in IBD patients compared with normal blood donors at Oslo University Hospital, Norway.</a></h2><p> Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) have been regarded as autoimmune Th-1/Th-17- and Th--associated conditions, respectively. The aim of the study was to examine possible differences in allergen sensitization between these diseases and relative to normal blood donors (BD).  Plasma from 29 UC and 37 CD patients with moderate disease activity and 100 healthy age- and gender-matched BD, were analyzed for specific IgE to 22 food- and 28 inhalation allergens using EUROLINE atopy screen.  There was significantly higher proportion of allergen sensitized patients in UC compared to BD. Corresponding mean percentages for UC, CD and BD were 8.5, 8.9 ( = .) and 5.9 ( = .04). There was no intergroup difference in sensitization to food allergens. Most prominent result was the double level of sensitization to inhalants in CD (15%) compared to BD (8%) ( = .03). Overall highest levels of sensitization to inhalants were for grass pollens. Interestingly, the number of allergens ( = 50) the subjects were sensitized to, was significantly lower among UC ( = 20; 40%) ( = .0005) than CD ( = 31; 62%) and BD ( = 38; 76%).  The percentage of individuals sensitized to inhalants in CD and to inhalants and foods in UC, were higher than corresponding results in BD. However, whereas allergen positive reactions in CD were comparable to those in BD, they were reduced in UC because of the few UC reactions to food allergens. This contrasts previous data and the study also points to sensitization to inhalants as a potential factor in the complex pathogenesis of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636478>Quality of life, work productivity impairment and healthcare resources in inflammatory bowel diseases in Brazil.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been associated with a low quality of life (QoL) and a negative impact on work productivity compared to the general population. Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative  (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45./44., the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe disease activity compared to patients with mild or no disease activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and 5-ASA compounds (77.5%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe IBD activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of IBD surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study was to report the rates and risk factors of inflammatory pouch conditions.This was a retrospective review of UC or IBD unspecified (IBDU) patients who underwent TPC with IPAA for refractory disease or dysplasia between 2008 and 2017. Pouchoscopy data were used to calculate rates of inflammatory pouch conditions. Factors associated with outcomes in univariable analysis were investigated in multivariable analysis.Of the 621 patients more than 18 years of age who underwent TPC with IPAA between January 2008 and December 2017, pouchoscopy data were available for 386 patients during a median follow-up period of 4 years. Acute pouchitis occurred in 205 patients (53%), 60 of whom (30%) progressed to chronic pouchitis. Cuffitis and Crohn's disease-like condition (CDLC) of the pouch occurred in 119 (30%) patients and 46 (12%) patients, respectively. In multivariable analysis, female sex was associated with a decreased risk of acute pouchitis, and pre-operative steroid use and medically refractory disease were associated with an increased risk; IBDU was associated with chronic pouchitis; rectal cuff length ≥ cm and medically refractory disease were associated with cuffitis; age 45-54 at colectomy was associated with CDLC. Rates of pouch failure were similar in chronic pouchitis and CDLC patients treated with biologics and those who were not.Inflammatory pouch conditions are common. Biologic use for chronic pouchitis and CDLC does not impact the rate of pouch failure.© 2019 Crohn's &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

However, the associations between IBD and prostate cancer (PCa) risk remain conflicting.We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) or relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the relationship of IBD and PCa risk.For cohort studies, the pooled SIR was 1.33 (95% CI = 1.03-1.71). The further subgroup analysis showed that the PCa risk was higher in patients with ulcerative  (UC) (pooled SIR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08-.30), but not in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) (pooled SIR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.97-1.31). Besides, for the three case-control studies, the results indicated that compared with normal group, the pooled RR of PCa was 1.81 for the patients with IBD (95% CI = 1.43-.29). In addition, sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust and no significant publication bias were observed.Our findings based on the large and multicenter samples strongly indicated that men with IBD especial UC have significantly elevated PCa risk.

Sofalcone contains a 1,3-diaryl--propen-1-one moiety, which is a common chemical scaffold in naturally occurring chalcones. The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group (Michael reaction acceptor) has electrophilic properties. We investigated the biochemical mechanisms by which sofalcone activated the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory nuclear factor-erythroid  (NF-E2) p45-related factor  (Nrf2)-heme oxygenase (HO)-1 pathway. Furthermore, we investigated whether the activation of this pathway was involved in sofalcone -mediated protective effects in an experimental  model. Sofalcone induced HO-1 protein expression, which was dependent on increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 in human colon carcinoma cells. In addition, Sofalcone reacted with nucleophilic thiol compounds to form Michael adducts. A reduced form of sofalcone (SFCR) in which the Michael reaction acceptor was deactivated, did not exert biological or chemical activity. Biotin-tagged sofalcone bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), a cytosolic repressor of Nrf2. This binding was prevented by pretreatment with sofalcone and a thiol compound but not with SFCR. Furthermore, sofalcone treatment induced dissociation of the Nrf2-KEAP1 complex. Rectal administration of sofalcone alleviated colon damage and inflammation and increased colon nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 levels in a dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced rat  model. The protective effects of sofalcone against colon damage and inflammation were significantly inhibited by co-administration of an HO-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, sofalcone activated the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway by covalently binding to KEAP1 via Michael addition, and may confer anti-colitic effects by inducing Nrf2 activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Retrospective Comparison of Toxicity and Efficacy on 222 Patients in the First 100 Days After Transplant, On Behalf of the Romanian Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation.</a></h2><p>High-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is widely used in patients with malignant lymphomas. In Europe over 8,000 ASCTs for lymphoma were performed out of a total of 40,000 transplants according to the European Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) activity survey in 2017. ASCT is considered the standard treatment for eligible patients failing to achieve remission after first line chemotherapy or patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas, including classical Hodkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma, as well as consolidation therapy in first remission in mantle cell lymphoma. BEAM (BCNU/carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) is the most commonly used conditioning regimen for ASCT in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) lymphomas in Europe, whereas the CBV (cyclophosphamide, BCNU, and etoposide) regimen is also widely used in North America. Recently, concerns regarding BCNU toxicity as well as restricted availability of BCNU and melphalan has determined an increasing number of transplant centers to use alternative conditioning regimens. Currently, only a few comparative studies, most of them retrospective, between different conditioning protocols regarding efficacy and toxicity have been published. Thus, in the current manuscript, we report the experience of  transplant centers in ASCT in R/R lymphomas with three types of conditioning: BEAM, CLV (cyclophosphamide, lomustine, etoposide) and LEAM (lomustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan), with the aim to evaluate the results of alternative conditioning regimens using lomustine (LEAM and CLV) and compare them with the standard BEAM regarding early toxicity, engraftment, and transplant related mortality (TRM). All patients developed grade IV neutropenia, anemia with/without transfusion necessity. Severe thrombocytopenia with transfusion requirements is reported in most cases. Median time to platelet engraftment and neutrophil engraftment was 13 days (range) and 10 days (range), respectively. Gastrointestinal toxicity was the most common non-hematologic toxicity after all three conditioning regimens. Oral mucositis in various grades from I to IV was diagnosed in most cases. Other side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, , and skin rash but with low severity grades. For the LEAM arm, one patient died after transplant, before engrafting, one patient didn't achieve platelet engraftment in day 100, one patient developed grade 3 upper gastrointestinal bleeding, one patient died (grade 5 toxicity) with acute renal failure, one patient developed hypoxic events up to grade 4 acute respiratory failure and one patient developed grade 3 itchy skin rash. For the CLV arm, one patient died after transplant, before engrafting, one patient developed grade 3 , one patient with grade 3 hepatic cytolysis, one patient with cardiac toxicity followed by death (grade 5) caused by an acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation and one patient with pulmonary toxicity clinically manifested with grade 3 pleurisy. For the BEAM arm, one patient developed grade 3 cardiac toxicity with sinus bradycardia and afterwards grade 4 with acute pulmonary edema, three patients presented a grade 3 pruritic skin rash and two patients developed grade 3 seizures. In the present study we presented the differences that were observed between BEAM, LEAM, and CLV conditioning regimens offering clinical arguments for an SCT practitioner choice in the ideal situation, but also of choice for alternative regimens in the case that one regimen cannot be used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559415>Laryngeal Carcinoma in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Clinical Outcomes and Risk Factors.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk for developing extra-intestinal malignancies, mainly due to immunosuppressive medication.

We aimed (1) to identify risk factors in IBD patients for LC development and () to compare clinical characteristics, outcome, and survival of LC in IBD patients with the general population.All IBD patients with LC (1993-2011) were retrospectively identified using the Dutch Pathology Database. We performed  case-control studies: (1) to identify risk factors, we compared patients with IBD and LC (cases) with the general IBD population; () to analyze LC survival, we compared cases with controls from the general LC population.We included 55 cases, 1800 IBD controls, and 2018 LC controls. Cases were more frequently male compared with IBD controls (P < 0.001). For ulcerative  (UC), cases were older at IBD diagnosis (P < 0.001).

However, data on the natural history of perianal fistulizing CD (pfCD) in this population are scarce. In a population-based cohort study, we described the prevalence, natural history and treatment of pfCD in patients with elderly-onset CD vs. patients with pediatric-onset CD.All patients diagnosed with CD at or after the age of 60 between 1988 and 2006 were included (n=372). Logistic regression, Cox models, and a nested case-control method were used to identify factors associated with pfCD.Thirty-four elderly patients (9%) had pfCD at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 6 years [IQR: 3-10], 59 patients (16%) had pfCD; the same prevalence (16%) was observed in pediatric-onset patients. At last follow-up, anal incontinence was more frequent in elderly patients with pfCD than in elderly patients without pfCD (22% vs. 4%, respectively; p<10-4). Rectal CD at diagnosis was associated with pfCD (hazard ratio [95% CI]=.8 [1.6-5.0]). Although 37% of the patients received immunosuppressants and 17% received anti-tumour necrosis factor agents, 24% (14 out of 59) had a definitive stoma at last follow-up.During the first 6 years of disease, the prevalence of pfCD was similar in elderly and pediatric patients. Rectal involvement was associated with the appearance of pfCD in elderly-onset patients. Around a quarter of patients with elderly-onset CD will have a stoma. Our results suggest that treatment with biologics should be evaluated in these patients.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

However, there is scarce reporting on the onset of UC in patients with NAFLD. A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with UC and referred to us in 2019. His height was 166.0 cm, and body weight was 86.3 kg. The waist circumference was 93.7 cm (normal range <85) and triglyceride was 751 mg/dL. These findings, in addition to hypertension, resulted in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. HbA1c was normal. Ultrasonography disclosed severe fatty liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed. He underwent 12 days of educational hospitalization for UC. A lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet (1400 kcal/day), a kind of plant-based diet (PBD), was provided. He lost 4 kg, which was 4.6% of his base body weight. Triglyceride and total cholesterol decreased to the normal ranges. Transaminases and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase also decreased. His body weight decreased further after discharge. Follow-up ultrasonography indicated an improvement in hepatic enlargement. The shear wave velocity decreased from 1.11 to 0.88 m/s. His soft stool became normal stool by  months after discharge. Records of his health checkups revealed the presence of metabolic syndrome and abnormal liver function tests already in 2015. Thus, it was concluded that UC developed in a patient with NAFLD in this case. Plant-based diet has already been shown to be effective in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the present case, NAFLD parameters were dramatically improved by PBD. Whether the improvement was due to weight loss per se or due to weight loss with PBD is to be clarified.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

At diagnostic colonoscopy, 3 rectal biopsies were collected, and gene expression analysis was performed using Qiagen RT2 Profiler Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain PCR Array. Relative fold difference in gene expression for 84 pain-associated genes was calculated using the -ΔΔ Cq method compared with pain-free controls. Factors affecting pain burden (Pain Burden Interview; PBI) were analyzed, including age, sex, rectal inflammation, and gene expression. Data were analyzed using multiple stepwise linear regression and -tailed t tests (P ≤ 0.05).Thirty-nine newly diagnosed IBD patients were included (65% male, mean age 12.75 years [SD .63], 23 Crohn's disease, 16 ulcerative ), along with 3 controls. Mean PBI score was 7.73 (SD 6.4, range 0 to 23) for all patients. Age and sex were not predictive of pain burden, but disease activity score was (P = 0.03). Expression of TRPV3, OPRM1, P2X3, SCN9A, PTGS2, and MAPK14 were associated with PBI score. Subsequent -tailed t tests comparing patients with no pain (PBI score ≦ , N = 11) to those with pain (PBI > , N = 28) confirmed differential expression of TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 was in patients with pain (all P < 0.05).Pain burden in newly diagnosed IBD patients may be linked to TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 expression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for managing pain in IBD.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s &  Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634907>Improving Quality of Care in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Through Patients' Eyes: IQCARO Project.</a></h2><p>Quality improvement is a major topic in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care, and measuring quality of care (QoC) is necessary for QoC improvement. Most QoC projects or consensus statements are designed from the health care professional point of view. Having QoC indicators designed for and fully evaluable by patients may provide a key tool for external evaluation of QoC improvement measures. The aim of the IQCARO project was to identify indicators to measure QoC from the IBD patient's point of view.An extensive review of the literature to identify indicators of QoC was performed; first the identified indicators were reviewed by a steering committee including patients, nurses, IBD specialists, and methodologists. Then  focus groups of IBD patients analyzed the QoC indicators to determine whether they could be understood and evaluated by patients. The final QoC indicators were selected by a group of IBD patients using a Delphi consensus methodology.An initial list of 54 QoC indicators was selected by the steering committee. The QoC indicators were evaluated by 16 patients who participated in  focus groups. They identified 21 indicators that fulfilled the understandability and evaluability requirements. The 10 most relevant QoC indicators were selected by 26 patients with IBD using a Delphi consensus. The selected items covered important aspects of QoC, including professionalism, patients' autonomy, information, accessibility, and continuity of care.The present Delphi consensus identified QoC indicators that are useful for developing and measuring improvement strategies in the management of IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

We hypothesized that mRNA profiles could (1) identify genes and pathways involved in disease pathogenesis; () identify a molecular signature that differentiates IBD from other conditions; (3) provide insight into systemic and colon-specific dysregulation through study of the concordance of the gene expression.Children (8-18 years) were prospectively recruited at the time of diagnostic colonoscopy for possible IBD. We used transcriptome-wide mRNA profiling to study gene expression in colon biopsies and paired whole blood samples. Using blood mRNA measurements, we fit a regression model for disease state prediction that was validated in an independent test set of adult subjects (GSE3365).Ninety-eight children were recruited [39 Crohn's disease, 18 ulcerative ,  IBDU, 39 non-IBD]. There were 1,118 significantly differentially (IBD vs non-IBD) expressed genes in colon tissue, and 880 in blood. The direction of relative change in expression was concordant for 106/112 genes differentially expressed in both tissue types. The regression model from the blood mRNA measurements distinguished IBD vs non-IBD disease status in the independent test set with 80% accuracy using only 6 genes. The overlap of 5 immune and metabolic pathways in the two tissue types was significant (p<0.001).Blood and colon tissue from patients with IBD share a common transcriptional profile dominated by immune and metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that peripheral blood expression levels of as few as 6 genes (IL7R, UBB, TXNIP, S100A8, ALAS2, and SLC2A3) may distinguish patients with IBD from non-IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602961>Polypharmacy is a risk factor for disease flare in adult patients with ulcerative : a retrospective cohort study.</a></h2><p>Polypharmacy is a common clinical problem with chronic diseases that can be associated with adverse patient outcomes. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and patient-specific characteristics associated with polypharmacy in an ulcerative  (UC) population and to assess the impact of polypharmacy on disease outcomes.A retrospective chart review of patients with UC who visited a tertiary medical center outpatient clinic between 2006 and 2011 was performed. Polypharmacy was defined as major ( ≥ 5 non-UC medications) or minor (-4 non-UC medications). UC medications were excluded in the polypharmacy grouping to minimize the confounding between disease severity and polypharmacy. Outcomes of interest include disease flare, therapy escalation, UC-related hospitalization, and surgery within 5 years of the initial visit.A total of 457 patients with UC were eligible for baseline analysis. Major polypharmacy was identified in 29.8% of patients, and minor polypharmacy was identified in 40.9% of the population. Polypharmacy at baseline was associated with advanced age (P< 0.001), female sex (P= 0.019), functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (P< 0.001), and psychiatric disease (P< 0.001). Over 5 years of follow-up, 265 patients remained eligible for analysis. After adjusting for age, sex, functional GI disorders, and psychiatric disease, major polypharmacy was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of disease flare (odds ratio, 4.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-9.62). However, major polypharmacy was not associated with the risk of therapy escalation, hospitalization, or surgery.Polypharmacy from non-inflammatory bowel disease medications was present in a substantial proportion of adult patients with UC and was associated with an increased risk of disease flare.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567166>High-Definition Chromoendoscopy Versus High-Definition White Light Colonoscopy for Neoplasia Surveillance in Ulcerative : A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Although chromoendoscopy is currently the recommended mode of surveillance in patients with long-standing ulcerative , it is technically challenging and requires a long procedure time. The aim of this study was to compare the dysplasia detection rate of high-definition white light endoscopy with random biopsy (HDWL-R) vs high-definition chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsy (HDCE-T).This was a multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial involving 9 tertiary teaching hospitals in South Korea. A total of 210 patients with long-standing ulcerative  were randomized to undergo either the HDWL-R group (n = 102) or HDCE-T group (n = 108). The detection rates of -associated dysplasia (CAD) or all colorectal neoplasia from each trial arm were compared.There was no significant difference in the CAD detection rate between HDCE-T and HDWL-R groups (4/102, 3.9% vs 6/108, 5.6%, P = 0.749). However, HDCE-T showed a trend toward improved colorectal neoplasia detection compared with HDWL-R (21/102, 20.6% vs 13/108, 12.0%, P = 0.093). The median (range) time for colonoscopy withdrawal between the  groups was similar (17.6 [7.0-43.3] minutes vs 16.5 [6.3-38.1] minutes; P=0.212; for HDWL-R and HDCE-T, respectively). The total number of biopsies was significantly larger in the HDWL-R group (34 [12-72]) compared with the HDCE-T group (9 [1-20]; P < 0.001).On the basis of our prospective randomized controlled trial, HDCE-T was not superior to HDWL-R for detecting CADs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616860>Transforming Access to Specialist Care for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The PACE Telemedicine Program.</a></h2><p>There are significant geographic disparities in the delivery of IBD healthcare in Ontario which may ultimately impact health outcomes. Telemedicine-based health services may potentially bridge gaps in access to gastroenterologists in remote and underserved areas.We conducted a needs assessment for IBD specialist care in Ontario using health administrative data. As part of a separate initiative to address geographic disparities in access to care, we described the development and implementation of our Promoting Access and Care through Centres of Excellence (PACE) Telemedicine Program. Over the first 18 months, we measured wait times and potential cost savings.We found substantial deficiencies in specialist care early in the course of IBD and continuous IBD care in regions where the number of gastroenterologists per capita were low. The PACE Telemedicine Program enabled new IBD consultations within a median time of 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-32 days) and visits for active IBD symptoms with a median time of 8.5 days (IQR, 4-14 days). Forty-five percent of new consultations and 83% of patients with active IBD symptoms were seen within the target wait time of two weeks. Telemedicine services resulted in an estimated cost savings of $47,565 among individuals who qualified for Ontario's Northern Travel Grant.The implementation of telemedicine services for IBD is highly feasible and can reduce wait times to see gastroenterologists that meet nationally recommended targets and can lead to cost savings.© The Author(s) 2018.

However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the risk of new onset IBD in patients with COPD and new onset COPD in IBD patients.We performed a systematic review of observational studies exploring the risk of both associations. Two independent reviewers explored the EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS and DOAJ databases, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBBINS-I tool. Data from included studies was pooled in a random effect meta-analysis following a DerSimonian-Laird method. The quality of the evidence was ranked using GRADE criteria.Four studies including a pooled population of 1355 new cases were included. We found association between new onset IBD in COPD population. The risk of bias was low in most of them. Only one study reported tobacco exposure as a potential confounding factor. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for a new diagnosis of IBD in COPD patients was .02 (CI, 1.56 to .63), I = 72% (GRADE: low). The subgroup analyses for Crohn's disease and ulcerative  yielded RRs of .29 (CI, 1.51 to 3.48; I = 62%), and 1.79 (CI, 1.39 to .29; I = 19%.), respectively.According to our findings, the risk of new onset IBD was higher in populations with COPD compared to the general population without this condition. Based on our analysis, we suggest a potential association between IBD and COPD; however, further research exploring the potential effect of confounding variables, especially cigarette smoking, is still needed.

Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor is a highly regulated, dynamic event in IBD pathogenesis. Using a lentivirus approach, NF-κB-regulated luciferase was expressed in patient macrophages, isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. Following activation, samples could be segregated into three clusters based on the NF-κB-regulated luciferase response. The ulcerative  (UC) samples appeared only in the hypo-responsive Cluster 1, and in Cluster . Conversely, Crohn's disease (CD) patients appeared in all Clusters with their percentage being higher in the hyper-responsive Cluster 3. A positive correlation was seen between NF-κB-induced luciferase activity and the concentrations of cytokines released into medium from stimulated macrophages, but not with serum or biopsy cytokine levels. Confocal imaging of lentivirally-expressed p65 activation revealed that a higher proportion of macrophages from CD patients responded to endotoxin lipid A compared to controls. In contrast, cells from UC patients exhibited a shorter duration of NF-κB p65 subunit nuclear localization compared to healthy controls, and CD donors. Analysis of macrophage cytokine responses and patient metadata revealed a strong correlation between CD patients who smoked and hyper-activation of p65. These  dynamic assays of NF-κB activation in blood-derived macrophages have the potential to segregate IBD patients into groups with different phenotypes and may therefore help determine response to therapy.Copyright © 2019 Papoutsopoulou, Burkitt, Bergey, England, Hough, Schmidt, Spiller, White, Paszek, Jackson, Martins Dos Santos, Sellge, Pritchard, Campbell, Müller and Probert.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638948>Correlation between immune-related adverse events and prognosis in patients with gastric cancer treated with nivolumab.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors were associated with clinical benefit in patients with melanoma or lung cancer. In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30.5 days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.5). The median progression-free survival was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.5) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1. to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001).

Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative  (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-.42) and .29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively.

Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathological variants in HPS1, HPS3, HPS4, and several other genes lead to clinical manifestation of the disease.A 57-year-old female was admitted with congenital oculocutaneous albinism, thrombocytopathy and late-onset accelerated pulmonary fibrosis (first symptoms from age 50 onwards). Chest high-resolution computed tomography identified thickening of peribronchovascular interstitium, bronchiectasis, reticulations, honeycombing, ground glass opacities and lung parenchyma consolidations. HPS was clinically suspected. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES), a form of massive parallel sequencing, of proband-parents trio. Whole exome libraries were processed using KAPA Hyper Prep Kit, SeqCap EZ MedExome Enrichment Kit and HyperCap Bead Kit according to the SeqCap EZ HyperCap Workflow. The paired-end  × 75 bp sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 Sequencer (Illumina Inc., USA). Furthermore, obtained variants by WES were evaluated using a virtual panel of genes: HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1, BLOC1S3, and PLDN. We identified a compound heterozygous genotype in HPS1 gene in the proband. We identified a pathogenic frameshift variant c.1189delC; p.(Gln397Serfs*), resulting in a premature stop codon. This variant has been previously associated with HPS. Furthermore, we characterized previously undescribed nonsense variant c.1507C > T; p.(Gln503*), resulting in a premature stop codon and mRNA degradation through nonsense-mediated decay. Sanger sequencing validated the presence of both variants and simultaneously confirmed the heterozygous carrier status of parents. Unfortunately, the patient died due to fulminant progression of pulmonary fibrosis  months after diagnostics.Compound heterozygous mutations in HPS1 in the proband lead to disruption of HPS1 gene and clinical manifestation of HPS with severe pulmonary fibrosis. This case illustrates the need to consider HPS in differential diagnostics of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a common cause of death in HPS patients.

We used multiplexed mass spectrometry to collect high-content information on protein phosphorylation in two different mouse models of IBD. Because the biological function of the vast majority of phosphorylation sites remains unknown, we developed Substrate-based Kinase Activity Inference (SKAI), a methodology to infer kinase activity from phosphoproteomic data. This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase  (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active  with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced inflammatory signaling in the colon and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in IBD and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the disease.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after  wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term. Future studies are required to assess the impact of  deletion in other conditions such as experimental .-Aranda, C. J., Arredondo-Amador, M., Ocón, B., Lavín, J. L., Aransay, A.

Our previous work synthesized styrene-maleic acid copolymer-encapsulated CORM- (SMA/CORM-) to overcome above-mentioned deficiencies and demonstrated satisfactory effects in . This study is to investigate the function of SMA/CORM- on colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis. CCK-8 experiment is used to clarify the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SMA/CORM- and to detect cell proliferation. Transwell assay coated with or without matrigel was to detect cell invasion and migration. Western blot was used to detect β-catenin, AKT, p-AKT, VEGF, MMP- and MMP-9 proteins. At last, nude mice xenograft was used to further investigate the anti-tumor effect of SMA/CORM- in vivo. After SW480 and C26 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml SMA/CORM-, CRC cells proliferation, migration and invasion were inhibited. In vivo, SMA/CORM- treatment remarkably suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in nude mice. Furthermore, the expression of β-catenin, p-AKT, VEGF, MMP- and MMP-9 proteins could be down-regulated after SMA/CORM- treatment. SMA/CORM- exerted both in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferation and anti-metastatic effects, which may yield a novel therapeutic strategy for CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are lacking.In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative  to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks , 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week , and 40 mg every  weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of ≤ on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52.A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.5%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], .5 to 15.0; P = 0.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3 to 18.5; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and . events per 100 patient-years.In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative , vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco- cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial barrier was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and inflammatory factors in Caco- cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco- cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable. Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 upregulated NF-κB and pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and downregulated ZO-1, occludin and anti-inflammatory factor IL-10.Hsa-miR-375 is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD by upregulating TLR4 and inducing NF-κB activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593973>Changes in Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding Presentation, Management, and Outcomes Over a 10-Year Span.</a></h2><p>There are only limited data available on changes in the etiology, management, and clinical outcomes in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding over the past decade.We compared  groups of consecutive patients hospitalized with lower gastrointestinal bleeding during  time periods: 2005 to 2007 (301 patients) and 2015 to 2017 (249 patients).Compared with the 2005 to 2007 group, the mean Charlson comorbidity index in the 2015 to 2017 group was higher (5.0±.6 vs. 6.0±3.0, P=0.028), whereas the use of computerized tomographic angiography and small bowel capsule endoscopy was more common (12.9% vs. 58.1%, P<0.001, and 28.8% vs. 69.0%, P=0.031, respectively). In 2005 to 2007, ischemic  (12.0%) was the most common confirmed etiology of bleeding and diverticular bleeding the second most common (8.6%), whereas in 2015 to 2017, diverticular bleeding was the most common etiology (10.4%), followed by angiodysplasia (8.4%).

Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and  UK). A systematic review of 88 247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative  and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative  and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and friends.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Diverse studies have shown the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in molecules of the immune system and the occurrence of IBD. Here, several SNPs of the immune system with controversial results for their association with UC and CD were evaluated in a Mexican population.SNPs rs1800896, rs3024505 (IL-10); rs11209026 (IL23R); rs2066844, rs2066845 (NOD-), and rs2241880 (ATG16L1) were assessed in 93 patients with IBD and 200 healthy controls by hybridization probes and quantitative PCR.The AG genotype for rs1800896 was associated with an increased risk for both UC and CD (P = 0.005 and P = 0.026, respectively); whereas the AA genotype presents a negative association (P = 0.011 for UC, and 0.0038 for CD). For this SNP, G allele was associated with risk of UC (P = 0-043) but not for CD. For the rs3024505 in IL-10, T allele was associated with UC (P = 0.011). Moreover, this allele was associated with early onset of UC (P = 0.033) and with the use of steroid treatment (P = 0.019). No significant differences for NOD2 (rs2066844T and rs2066845C), IL23R (rs11209026), and ATG16L1 (rs22411880) were found between cases and controls and the homozygous TT genotype for rs2066844 and CC for rs2066845 were not observed.Our results show both genotypic and phenotypic associations of IL-10 SNPs with IBD but not with the other immune-related SNPs studied in this Mexican cohort.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559263>Predictors of Inadequate Response to Budesonide Multimatrix in Real-World Patients with Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Budesonide multimatrix (MMX) system has been approved for the induction of remission in patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative  (UC), and offers potential safety benefits over more commonly utilized corticosteroid therapies.In a real-world setting we aimed to evaluate the proportion of UC patients treated with budesonide MMX who had an inadequate clinical response, defined as requiring transition to prednisone, and to identify any predictors of inadequate response.We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study evaluating adult patients with UC, ≥18 years of age, who were treated with budesonide MMX. We used bivariate and multivariable analyses to identify predictors of inadequate response to budesonide MMX.Ninety-six patients were treated with budesonide MMX. Before initiation of budesonide MMX 55, 35, and 8% were on aminosalicylate, immunomodulator, and/or biologic therapy or no therapy for UC respectively. While 54% (52/96) of patients responded to budesonide MMX, 46% (44/96) required a transition to prednisone. Patients who required transition to prednisone were more likely to be male (39 vs. 19%,  = 0.035) and younger at the time of diagnosis (median age 23.5 vs. 29.0 years,  = 0.034).

Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- (COX-), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB).

Measures taken to avoid excess were assessed.Of 2385 patients, 28% received steroids in the preceding 12 months. 14.8% had steroid excess or dependency. Steroid use was significantly lower at 'intervention centres' which participated in a quality improvement programme (exposure: 23.8% vs 31.0%, P < .001; excess 11.5% vs 17.1%, P < .001). At intervention centres, steroid use fell from 2015 to 2017 (steroid exposure 30.0%-23.8%, P = .003; steroid excess 13.8%-11.5%, P = .17). Steroid excess was judged avoidable in 50.7%. Factors independently associated with reduced steroid excess in Crohn's disease included maintenance with anti-TNF agents (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.24-0.95]), treatment in a centre with a multi-disciplinary team (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.20-0.86]) and treatment at an intervention centre (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.46-0.97]). Treatment with 5-ASA in CD was associated with higher rates of steroid excess (OR 1.72 [95% CI 1.24-.09]).

Opioid use continues to be more prevalent in IBD than any other chronic gastrointestinal condition, and the majority of IBD patients consume narcotics during hospitalization despite the risks of infection and death.We performed a retrospective review of 57 subjects aimed at quantifying pain and opiate consumption for IBD-related admissions over a 3-month period. For each patient, the average and maximum of each day's pain scores were used to measure changes in pain from admission to discharge using mixed model regression, with opiate use as a time-dependent covariate.The daily average pain score over the entire hospitalization was 4.23 ± .09, and the maximum pain score was 8.28 ± 1.75. Among opioid users (n = 51), the daily average pain score was 4.65 ± .16 and the maximum pain score was 7.53 ± .56. Across all cases from admission to discharge, there was less than a 1-point change in daily average pain (- 0.96 ± .03, p = 0.0009), and no change in maximum pain (- 0.89 ± 3.59, p = 0.0671). Opioid users, a subset of the overall cohort, had a similar less than one-point drop in daily average pain (- 0.94 ± - 0.29, p = 0.0024) and no change in daily maximum pain scores (- 0.81 ± - 0.47, p = 0.0914).

Endoscopy is often inconspicuous, and the diagnosis relies on histopathological assessment of colonic biopsies. Digital Image Analysis (DIA) eliminates interobserver variation. The aim of this study was to establish digital cutoff values for LC and LCi on CD3 stained slides.One hundred and six patients with a hematoxylin and eosin (HE) diagnosis of normal colonic mucosa (N = 19), non-specific reactive changes (N = 24), LCi (N = 23) and LC (N = 40) were eligible for analysis. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) reached by DIA in the total surface epithelium and in hot spots of the biopsies was compared with the diagnostic category assigned by the pathologists based on HE stained slides. The digitalized slides were analyzed for number of IELs using Visiopharm Quantitative Digital Pathology software. All digitalized slides were examined manually to identify differences in the approach to the evaluation of the biopsies by the pathologists and DIA.The median IEL counts and interquartile range in the total surface epithelium were 3.6 (3.-4.3), 4.4 (3.4-5.3), 19.8 (16.6-30.0) and 41.3 (37.0-47.8) in normal colon mucosa, mucosa with non-specific reactive changes, LCi and LC, respectively. Discrimination between normal mucosa and non-specific reactive changes was not possible. Digital cutoff values with the best separation between non-LC, LCi and LC were > 13 IELs/100 epithelial cells for LCi and > 36 IELs/100 epithelial cells for LC. These cutoff values resulted in an agreement between the pathologist's and DIA that was very good with a kappa value of 0.90.Despite differences among the approach of DIA and the pathologist's assessment of IELs in colonic mucosa DIA is able discriminate between the HE based diagnoses of the three subgroups non-LC, LCi and LC with high accuracy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

One class of such receptor-ligand pairs involves formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) that have been shown to influence inflammatory response and repair. Here we explored the role of murine Fpr2/3, an ortholog of human FPR2/receptor for lipoxin A4 (ALX), in orchestrating intestinal mucosal repair.

Decreased numbers of infiltrating monocytes were observed in healing wounds from  mice compared with WT animals. Bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that  monocytes showed a competitive disadvantage when infiltrating colonic wounds. Moreover,  monocytes were defective in chemotactic responses to the chemokine CC chemokine ligand (CCL)20, which is up-regulated during early phases of inflammation. Analysis of  monocytes revealed altered expression of the CCL20 receptor CC chemokine receptor (CCR)6, suggesting that Fpr2/3 regulates CCL20-CCR6-mediated monocyte chemotaxis to sites of mucosal injury in the gut. These findings demonstrate an important contribution of Fpr2/3 in facilitating monocyte recruitment to sites of mucosal injury to influence wound repair.-Birkl, D., O'Leary, M.

The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the prevalence and association between IBD and psoriasis.PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched from database inception through April 2018 for studies reporting data on psoriasis among patients with IBD and vice versa. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate, respectively, the prevalence and association between IBD and psoriasis. Data extraction was according to the PRISMA guideline, and quality assessment was made using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The main outcomes were the proportion of psoriasis patients with IBD and vice versa, as well as the association (odds ratio [OR]) of IBD in psoriasis and psoriasis in IBD, respectively.Based on quantitative analysis of 93 studies, the prevalence of psoriasis in CD and UC was 3.6% (95% CI 3.1%-4.6%) and .8% (95% CI .0%-3.8%) respectively, while the prevalence of CD and UC was 0.7% (95% CI 0.%-1.3%) and 0.5% (95% CI 0.3%-0.8%), respectively, among patients with psoriasis. Presence of CD or UC was significantly associated with psoriasis given by OR=.0 (95% CI 1.4-.9) and OR=1.5 (95% CI 1.-.0), respectively. Presence of psoriasis was significantly associated with CD (OR=., 95% CI 1.6-3.1) and UC (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.3-.0).We found significant bidirectional associations between psoriasis and IBD warranting increased awareness among clinicians in the diagnostic process, especially in children and adolescents with IBD. Lastly, this study showed an increased frequency of paradoxical psoriasis in patients treated with biologics.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Whilst not without limitations, its ability to suppress pathology and rapidly improve patient clinical outcome is key. We were interested in identifying early markers of therapeutic responsiveness in order to identify patients' refractory to therapy. Chronic Th1-driven  was induced in AKR/J mice using a parasite infection, Trichuris muris. 35 days post infection, mice were treated with low dose hydrocortisone ( mg/kg/) i.p. on alternate days. Response to therapy was assessed at a systemic and tissue level day 45 post infection. Histopathology, gene and protein analysis was conducted to determine cytokine and transcriptional profiles. The colonic transcriptional profile in steroid treated mice showed significant upregulation of a small subset of T cell associated genes, in particular C/EBPβ, CD4, IL7R and STAT5a. Despite no change in either transcription or protein production in downstream cytokines IFN γ, TNFα IL-17 and IL-10, hydrocortisone treatment significantly reduced colonic pathology and restored colonic length to naïve levels. As expected, steroid treatment of chronic gut inflammation generated significant immunosuppressive effects characterized by histological improvement. Low dose hydrocortisone induced significant upregulation of a subset of genes associated with T cell maintenance and regulation, including C/EBPβ. These data suggest that enhanced expression of C/EBPβ may be one of a subset of early markers demonstrating an immune regulatory response to hydrocortisone therapy, potentially by stabilization of Treg function. These observations contribute to our understanding of the immune landscape after steroid therapy, providing a potential markers of therapeutic responders and those refractory to hydrocortisone treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523245>Sleep quality and associated factors in Iranian inflammatory bowel disease patients.</a></h2><p>Sleep is essential in maintaining health and quality of life. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients suffer from poor sleep quality. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in Iranian IBD patients as well as the variables which can be attributed to the quality of sleep in IBD patients.Seventy-one patients filled in Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Disease activity was assessed by Crohn's Disease (CD) Activity Index and Ulcerative  (UC) Activity Index. Regression analysis was used to identify the association between sociodemographic and disease characteristics with sleep quality.We found that 32.4% of all patients, 23.1% of patients with "in remission to mild" disease, and 66.7% of patients with "moderate" disease, had poor sleep quality. CD patients were more likely to have poor sleep quality comparing UC ones in crude (odds ratio [OR] =.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-4.04) and adjusted (OR = 6.19; 95% CI 1.13, 34.07) models. Patients with good quality of sleep had lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure ( = 0.09 and 0.035 respectively).Notable percentage of IBD patients suffer from poor sleep quality even in the remission phase.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative  and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± .88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543770>Perforating Granuloma Annulare Appearing as a Psoriasiform Lesion.</a></h2><p>We present a 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history of diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and ulcerative  who presented with nail dystrophy, polyarthralgia in her hands and hips, myalgia, proximal myopathy, dactylitis, and psoriasiform-appearing progressive, painful plaques on the dorsal aspect of her hands.

Chemically induced  models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)  model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's disease. This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced . We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed platform for studies published through December 2018, using MeSH terms (Crohn Disease.kw) OR (Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.kw) OR (, Ulcerative.kw) AND (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.kw) AND (disease models, animal.kw) AND (mice.all).

Chronic TNBS-induced  is made with multiple TNBS intrarectal administrations in an average dose of 1. mg using a volume lower than 150 μL in 50% ethanol. The strains mostly used are Balb/c and C57BL/6 with 5-6 weeks. To characterize the preclinical model the parameters more used include body weight, stool consistency and morbidity, inflammatory biomarkers like interferon (IFN)-γ, myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10, presence of ulcers, thickness or hyperemia in the colon, and histological evaluation of the inflammation.

The pathological findings of ICPI-induced  may vary among drug classes. They show acute or chronic inflammation, but it may depend on the time of  suggested by colonoscopy, including biopsy or treatment intervention.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco- cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS  model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco- cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated -associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

However, the safety and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with preexisting antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are unclear.191 patients treated with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab for unresectable advanced cancers between September 2014 and December 2018 were identified retrospectively. Patients were divided into positive (ANA titers ≥ 1:160) and negative ANA groups (ANA titers < 1:160). Development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), the overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) were monitored.Positive ANA titers were seen in 9 out of 191 patients. Four patients in the positive ANA group and 69 patients in the negative group developed irAEs of any grade without a significant difference between the groups. The development of endocrine, pulmonary, and cutaneous irAEs was not significant, whereas positive ANA was significantly higher in patients who developed  (/9) than in patients who did not (3/182, P = 0.0002). DCR in the positive and negative ANA group was 37.5% and 67.5%, respectively, and was not statistically significant, but had better efficacy in patients without ANA (P = 0.08). ANA-related autoimmune diseases such as SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, MCTD, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis was not induced in either group. However, one patient with preexisting dermatomyositis had a flare up after initiation of atezolizumab.Further studies to identify predictive factors for the development of irAEs are required to provide relevant patient care and maximize the therapeutic benefits of ICIs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553833>Ustekinumab as Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The efficacy of ustekinumab, an antagonist of the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative  is unknown.We evaluated ustekinumab as 8-week induction therapy and 44-week maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative . A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤ on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.5%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (5.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo. Through 52 weeks of exposure, there were two deaths (one each from acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemorrhage from esophageal varices) and seven cases of cancer (one each of prostate, colon, renal papillary, and rectal cancer and three nonmelanoma skin cancers) among 825 patients who received ustekinumab and no deaths and one case of cancer (testicular cancer) among 319 patients who received placebo.Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative .

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are employed to augment cytotoxic anti-cancer activity by inhibiting negative regulatory elements of the immune system. Modulating the immune system to target neoplasms has improved survivability of numerous cancers in many individuals, but forecasting outcomes post therapy is difficult due to insufficient predictive biomarkers. Recently, the tumor and gastrointestinal microbiome and immune milieu have been investigated as predictors and influencers of cancer immune therapy. In this review, we discuss: (1) ways to measure the microbiome including relevant bioinformatic analyses, () recent developments in animal studies and human clinical trials utilizing gut microbial composition and function as biomarkers of cancer immune therapy response and toxicity, and (3) using prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) to modulate immune therapy. We discuss the respective benefits of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing including important considerations in obtaining samples and in designing and interpreting human and animal microbiome studies. We then focus on studies discussing the differences in response to ICIs in relation to the microbiome and inflammatory mediators. ICIs cause  in up to 25% of individuals, and  is often refractory to common immunosuppressive medications. Researchers have measured microbiota composition prior to ICI therapy and correlated baseline microbiota composition with efficacy and . Certain bacterial taxa that appear to enhance therapeutic benefit are also implicated in increased susceptibility to , alluding to a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory tumor killing and anti-inflammatory protection from . Pre-clinical and clinical models have trialed probiotic administration, e.g.  or FMT, to treat  when immune suppressive agents fail.

We detected the expression of circ-SOD2 in Caco2 and NCM460 cells after being treated with inflammatory factors (LPS, TNF-α, IL1-β). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the cellular location of circ-SOD2 in the UC colorectal mucosal tissues. The circ-SOD2 overexpression vector was constructed and produced and then transfected into Caco2 cells to examine the cells' trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), permeability of FITC-dextran and the alterations of epithelial barrier related molecules.We found 264 circRNAs (111 increased and 153 decreased) differentially expressed in the inflamed colon mucosa compared with normal colon mucosa using a P-value <0.05 and a >1.5-fold change cutoff. To validate the circRNA microarray results, we selected some circRNAs to perform qRT-PCR based on the following criteria: (1) circRNAs raw data >100 in each sample, () fold-change >, (3) P<0.05. We identified 10 dysregulated circRNA, among them, circ-SOD2 was upregulated with maximum fold-change in the UC inflamed colorectal mucosa tissues. Then we identified circ-SOD2 was upregulated significantly through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in expanded 30 paired colorectal mucosa tissues(P<0.001). After treatments with LPS, TNF-α and IL1-β, circ-SOD2 was upregulated in Caco2 and NCM460 cells at different points from 1 to 7 h. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that circ-SOD2 located in intestinal epithelium mostly and few in mesenchyme and inflammatory cells. The overexpression of circ-SOD2 in Caco2 cells resulted in a decrease of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), an increase of the FITC-dextran permeability and the downregulation of epithelial barrier related molecule CLDN-8 (P<0.05).The dysregulation of circRNAs existed in UC inflamed colorectal mucosa, among which, the upregulated circ-SOD2 weakened the intestinal epithelial barrier and thus might promote the occurrence of ulcerative .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536729>Analgesic effect of resveratrol on -induced visceral pain via inhibition of TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway in the spinal cord.</a></h2><p>Visceral pain is a complex and common symptom of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Developing novel efficient therapeutics is still a common interest for clinicians. Increasing evidence have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to the pathological pain state in some pain models. Resveratrol (RSV) has showed promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain. However, whether RSV has analgesic effect on visceral pain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established the  model through intrarectal administration of ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and found that TNBS induced colonic inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Meanwhile, astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TRAF6, phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were increased in L6-S1 spinal cord after TNBS enema. Then, intrathecal injection of TRAF6 siRNA attenuated visceral pain, blocked the upregulation of pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the spinal cord in TNBS mice. Furthermore, spinal administration of NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 reversed the pain behavior and suppressed spinal TNF-α and IL-1β expression in TNBS mice. Finally, repeated intrathecal injection of RSV reversed TNBS-induced visceral pain hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TNBS-induced enhancement of spinal GFAP, TRAF6, pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were reduced by the same treatment of RSV. In conclusion, our results suggest that RSV exerts the effects of antinociception on -induced visceral hyperalgesia through inhibition of spinal TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway and the production of inflammatory mediators in the spinal cord, suggesting a new application of RSV for the treatment of visceral pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The agents tested were: alpha-lactoalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan, effective in some animal models of epilepsy and on colon/intestine inflammation, valproic acid (VPA), an effective antiepileptic drug in this seizure model, mesalazine (MSZ) an effective aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory treatment against ulcerative  and sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) normally produced in the intestine by gut microbiota, important in maintaining gut health and reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress. Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration for 6 days. Drug treatment was started on day 3 and lasted 11 days, when seizure susceptibility to PTZ was measured along with intestinal inflammatory markers (i.e. NF-κB, Iκ-Bα, COX-, iNOS), histological damage, disease activity index (DAI) and SCFA concentration in stools. DSS-induced  increased seizure susceptibility and while all treatments were able to reduce intestinal inflammation, only ALAC and NaB exhibited significant antiepileptic properties in mice with induced , while they were ineffective as antiepileptics at the same doses in control mice without . Interestingly, in DSS-treated mice, VPA lost part of its antiepileptic efficacy in comparison to preventing seizures in non-DSS-treated mice while MSZ remained ineffective in both groups. Our study demonstrates that reducing intestinal inflammation through ALAC or NaB administration has specific anticonvulsant effects in PTZ-treated mice. Furthermore, it appears that intestinal inflammation may reduce the antiepileptic effects of VPA, although we confirm that it decreases seizure threshold in this group. Therefore, we suggest that intestinal inflammation may represent a valid antiepileptic target which should also be considered as a participating factor to seizure incidence in susceptible patients and also could be relevant in reducing standard antiepileptic drug efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671425>A Polymorphism in Interleukin-1β Gene Is Associated with the Development of Pouchitis in Japanese Patients with Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Major complications in patients with ulcerative  (UC) include UC-associated cancer (UCAC) and postoperative pouchitis.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age 18-64) with UC in the United States to examine time trends for colectomy and biologic use from 2007 to 2016.We estimated quarterly rates for colectomy and biologic use using the IQVIA Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database. We used interrupted time series methods with segmented regression to assess time trends with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for biologic use and colectomy before and after the emergence of newly available biologic therapies in 2014.Among 93,930 patients with UC, 2275 (.4%) underwent colectomy from 2007 to 2016. Biologic use rates increased significantly from 2007 to 2016, from 131 per 1000 person-years in 2007 (95% CI, 121 to 140) to 589 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 575 to 604; P < 0.001). Colectomy rates decreased significantly between 2007 and 2016, from 7.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.) to 4. per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 3. to 5.1; P < 0.001). An interruption in 2014 was associated with a positive trend deflection for biologic use (+72 treatments per 1000 person-years per year (95% CI, 61 to 83) and a negative trend deflection for colectomy (-0.76 per 1000 person-years per year; 95% CI, -1.47 to -0.05).Among commercially insured patients in the United States from 2007 to 2016, biologic use rates increased, colectomy rates decreased, and both trends were impacted by the interruption in 2014. These findings suggest that new biologic therapies may have contributed to decreased colectomy rates.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

There are  main subsets of Treg cells: FOXP3 (forkhead box protein 3)-positive Treg cells, which do not produce high levels of effector cytokines, and type 1 Treg (Tr1) cells, which are FOXP3-negative and secrete interleukin (IL) 10. IL10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, so Tr1 cells might be used the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. We aimed to develop methods to isolate and expand human Tr1 cells and define their functions.We obtained blood samples and colon biopsy samples from patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative  or healthy individuals (controls). CD4 T cells were isolated from blood samples and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and Tr1 cells were purified by using an IL10 cytokine-capture assay and cell sorting. FOXP3-positive Treg cells were sorted as CD4CD25CD127 cells from unstimulated cells. Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were expanded, and phenotypes and gene expression profiles were compared. T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 beads, and the suppressive abilities of Tr1 and FOXP3-positive Treg cells were measured. Human colon organoid cultures were established, cultured with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and analyzed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. T84 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial cells) were incubated with supernatants from Tr1 or FOXP3-positive cells, and transepithelial electrical resistance was measured to determine epithelial cell barrier function.Phenotypes of Tr1 cells isolated from control individuals vs patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative  did not differ significantly after expansion. Tr1 cells and FOXP3-positive Treg cells suppressed proliferation of effector T cells, but only Tr1 cells suppressed secretion of IL1B and tumor necrosis factor from myeloid cells. Tr1 cells, but not FOXP3-positive Treg cells, isolated from healthy individuals and patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative  secreted IL22, which regulated repair of the epithelium and promoted barrier function of human intestinal epithelial cells. Tr1 cell culture supernatants promoted differentiation of mucin-producing goblet cells in intestinal organoid cultures.Human Tr1 cells suppress proliferation of effector T cells (adaptive immune response) and production of IL1B and TNF by myeloid cells (inmate immune response). They also secrete IL22 to regulate repair of the epithelium and promote barrier function. They might be developed as a cell-based therapy for intestinal inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

'Venetian blinds' technique of plication in combination with mesh reinforcement, is totally intra-corporeal, with hernia defect and sac plication to reduce seroma formation. While laparoscopic suturing of the abdominal wall can represent a technical challenge, pre-operative botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections as an adjunct can assist. This study aims to demonstrate feasibility and efficacy of this technique in abdominal wall hernia repair, with BTA adjunct in midline hernias.A single-centre case series was conducted using minimally invasive 'Venetian blinds' technique for repair of complex ventral abdominal hernias. Twelve patients (seven midline, five non-midline) underwent repair (11 laparoscopic; one robotic). Midline hernias received BTA (200-300 units Botox) 4-6 weeks prior to surgery. Repairs were mesh-reinforced following fascial closure.Twelve (10 female, two male) patients, with a median age 72 years (range 31-83) and body mass index of 27.3 kg/m (range 22.8-61.7) were included. The median length of operation was 133 min (range 45-290) and length of hospital stay 3 days (range 1-28). To date there has been no recurrence of hernia. A single symptomatic seroma was treated with antibiotics and did not require mesh removal. One patient developed hospital-acquired pneumonia and pseudomembranous .Minimally invasive 'Venetian blinds' technique has promising early results with both midline and non-midline ventral hernias. The addition of BTA is a novel and feasible combination for repair of midline ventral hernias.© 2019 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518013>The combination of granulocyte-monocyte apheresis and vedolizumab: A new treatment option for ulcerative ?</a></h2><p>To assess the effectiveness and safety of combining granulocyte-monocyte apheresis (GMA) and vedolizumab (VDZ) in patients with refractory ulcerative  (UC).This retrospective, multicentre pilot study included all UC patients receiving both GMA and VDZ.

Effectiveness was assessed 1 and 6 months after finishing the GMA using the partial Mayo score, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin levels. Data were also compiled on VDZ intensification, use of new immunomodulators and colectomy during follow-up.Eight patients were included (mean age 46 years; 63% female; mean disease duration, 132 months; 50% E3). GMA was started after a loss of response to VDZ in all cases (25% primary nonresponse and 75% secondary loss of response). All had previously received anti-TNF agents. VDZ was prescribed as the second-, third-, or fourth-line biologic in 37%, 50%, and 13% of cases, respectively. Patients had a mean baseline partial Mayo score of 7.5 (SD .1) and received a median of 15 GMA sessions (range 5-38). After a median follow-up of 7.5 months (IQR 5-12), partial Mayo score decreased after 1 and 6 months (P = .01 and .06, respectively). Three patients (38%) achieved steroid-free clinical remission and five (63%) withdrew VDZ. Colectomy rate was 38%. No adverse events were observed during the combination therapy.This small case series suggests that combining GMA with VDZ could be a treatment option in selected cases of UC with an inadequate response to this biologic agent.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498388>Cancer Risk in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A 6-Year Prospective Multicenter Nested Case-Control IG-IBD Study.</a></h2><p>In a 6-year, multicenter, prospective nested case-control study, we aimed to evaluate risk factors for incident cancer in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), when considering clinical characteristics of IBD and immunomodulator use. The secondary end point was to provide characterization of incident cancer types.All incident cases of cancer occurring in IBD patients from December 2011-2017 were prospectively recorded in 16 Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease units. Each of the IBD patients with a new diagnosis of cancer was matched with  IBD patients without cancer, according to IBD phenotype (ulcerative  [UC] vs Crohn's disease [CD]), age (±5 years), sex. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Cancer occurred in 403 IBD patients: 204 CD (CD cases), 199 UC (UC cases). The study population included 1209 patients (403 IBD cases, 806 IBD controls). Cancer (n = 403) more frequently involved the digestive system (DS; 32%), followed by skin (14.9%), urinary tract (9.7%), lung (6.9%), genital tract (6.5%), breast (5.5%), thyroid (1.9%), lymphoma (.7%, only in CD), adenocarcinoma of the small bowel (SBA; 3.9%, 15 CD, 1 pouch in UC), other cancers (15.9%). Among cancers of the DS, colorectal cancer (CRC) more frequently occurred in UC (29% vs 17%; P < 0.005), whereas SBA more frequently occurred in CD (13% vs 6.3% P = 0.039). In CD, perforating (B3) vs non-stricturing non-perforating (B1) behavior represented the only risk factor for any cancer (odds ratio [OR], .33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-4.11). In CD, risk factors for extracolonic cancer (ECC) were a B3 vs B1 and a stricturing (B2) vs B1 behavior (OR, .95; 95% CI, 1.62-5.43; OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.09-.98). In UC, risk factors for ECC and for overall cancer were abdominal surgery for UC (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, .62-8.42; OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.88-5.92) and extensive vs distal UC (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.10-.75; OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16-3.47). Another risk factor for ECC was left-sided vs distal UC (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.00-.86). Inflammatory bowel disease duration was a risk factor for skin and urinary tract cancers.Perforating CD, extensive UC, and abdominal surgery for UC were identified as risk factors for overall incident cancer and for ECC.

We aimed to describe the U.S. experience with vedolizumab in a commercially insured population.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Quintiles-IMS Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database from May 2014 to June 2016. We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first  months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD.

The clinical data of 161 children with IBD was collected from the electronic medical records in the Department of Pediatrics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2017. These patients were divided into Crohn's disease (CD) group and ulcerative  (UC) group, accounting for 82.0% (132 cases) and 18.0%(29 cases), respectively. The incidence of EIMs in each group was analyzed. The potential risk factors of EIMs including the IBD phenotype, gender, age, location of the CD lesion, disease activity of CD, and the presence of perianal lesion were analyzed with logistic regression model.  Eighty-eight patients (54.7%) had EIMs. The main EIMs were immune-mediated EIMs and growth retardation, accounting for 41.0% (66/161) and 24.% (39/161), respectively. Aphthous ulcer (39/161, 23.0%) was the most common symptom among immune-mediated EIMs, followed by arthropathy (20/161, 12.4%) and skin lesions (19/161, 11.8%). Forty-three patients (26.7%) had EIMs before being diagnosed as IBD. Fifty-eight (65.9%) patients had only one EIM during the whole course of IBD. By logistic regression analysis, CD (5.536, 95:1.825-16.788) and perianal disease (1.969, 95:1.035-3.746) were the risk factors of immune-mediated EIMs. Meanwhile, CD (11.319, 95: 1.487-86.179), younger than six-year-old at diagnosis (8.556, 95: 3.109-23.545), moderate to severe activity of CD (3.447, 95: 1.196-9.934) and perianal disease (3.361, 95: 1.720-7.793) increased the risk of growth retardation.

However, the activity and function of mTORC2 in distinct cells within malignant tissue in vivo is insufficiently explored. Surprisingly, in primary human and mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, mTORC2 signaling could not be detected in tumor cells. In contrast, only macrophages in tumor-adjacent areas showed mTORC2 activity, which was downregulated in stromal macrophages residing within human and mouse tumor tissues. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 by specific deletion of Rictor in macrophages stimulated tumorigenesis in a -associated CRC mouse model. This phenotype was driven by a proinflammatory reprogramming of mTORC2-deficient macrophages that promoted  via the cytokine SPP1/osteopontin to stimulate tumor growth. In human CRC patients, high SPP1 levels and low mTORC2 activity in tumor-associated macrophages correlated with a worsened clinical prognosis. Treatment of mice with a second-generation mTOR inhibitor that inhibits mTORC2 and mTORC1 exacerbated experimental colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo. In conclusion, mTORC2 activity is confined to macrophages in CRC and limits tumorigenesis. These results suggest activation but not inhibition of mTORC2 as a therapeutic strategy for -associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545244>Reduction of inflammation and colon injury by a Pennyroyal phenolic extract in experimental inflammatory bowel disease in mice.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the pharmacological effects of the phenolic compounds of Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium). This Mediterranean aromatic plant, used as a gastronomic spice and as food preservative by the food industry has been studied mainly due to its essential oil antibacterial properties, composed primarily by monoterpenes. With this work, we aimed to evaluate the effects of a phenolic extract of pennyroyal in the impairment of inflammatory processes in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) and in the potential inhibition of progression to colorectal cancer (CRC).To that purpose, we evaluated the effect of pennyroyal extract administration in a model of TNBS-induced  in mice and further determined its effect on human colon carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion.The phenolic extract of pennyroyal exhibited antioxidant properties in in vitro assays and administration of the extract in a rat model of carrageenan-induced paw oedema led to significant anti-inflammatory effects. Further results evidenced a beneficial effect of the phenolic extract in the attenuation of experimental  and a potential antiproliferative effect on cultured colon cancer cells, effects not previously described, to our knowledge. A reduction in several markers of colon inflammation was observed following administration of the extract to -induced mice, including functional and histological indicators. A successful inhibition of cancer cell invasion and proliferation was also observed in in vitro studies with HT-29 cells. Furthermore, the extract also led to a reduced expression of iNOS/COX- in the colon of -induced mice, both being crucial mediators of intestinal inflammation.Taking into consideration the central role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of CRC and the recognised connection between inflammatory events and cancer, these results enlighten the relevance of the phenolic constituents of pennyroyal as important pharmacological sources in the investigation of new treatment options for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A total of 137 IBD patients, including 40 patients with ulcerative  (UC) and 97 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and 50 healthy controls (HCs), were recruited. Serum food-specific IgG antibodies were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum food-specific IgE antibodies were measured by Western blot. The value of food-specific IgG antibodies was compared among different groups, and potent factors related to these antibodies were explored by binary logistic regression.Food-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 57.5% of UC patients, in 90.72% of CD patients and in 42% of HCs. A significantly high prevalence and titer of food-specific IgG antibodies were observed in CD patients compared to UC patients and HCs. The number of IgG-positive foods was greater in CD and UC patients than in HCs (CD  HCs,  = 0.000; UC  HCs,  = 0.029). The top five food antigens that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in CD patients were tomato (80.68%), corn (69.32%), egg (63.64%), rice (61.36%), and soybean (46.59%). The foods that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in UC patients were egg (60.87%), corn (47.83%), tomato (47.83%), rice (26.09%), and soybean (21.74%). Significantly higher levels of total food-specific IgG were detected in IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα therapy compared to patients receiving steroids and immunosuppressants (anti-TNFα  steroids,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  immunosuppressants,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  steroids + immunosuppressants,  = 0.003). A decrease in food-specific IgG levels was detected in IBD patients after receiving anti-TNFα therapy ( = 0.007). Patients who smoked and CD patients were prone to developing serum food-specific IgG antibodies [Smoke: OR (95%CI): 17.6 (1.91-162.26),  = 0.011; CD patients: OR (95%CI): 12.48 (3.45-45.09),  = 0.000]. There was no difference in the prevalence of food-specific IgE antibodies among CD patients (57.1%), UC patients (65.%) and HCs (60%) ( = 0.831).CD patients have a higher prevalence of food-specific IgG antibodies than UC patients and HCs. IBD patients are prone to rice, corn, tomato and soybean intolerance. Smoking may be a risk factor in the occurrence of food-specific IgG antibodies.

Changes in lumbar spine BMD (∆L1-4 z-scores) were examined for correlations with clinical characteristics.The cohort included 41 patients (age at diagnosis 12.1 ± 3.5 years, 23 females).The mean interval between the scans was 3.4 ± .0 years. There was a trend towards improvement in L1-4 z-scores (-1.64 ± 1.02 vs -1.45 ± 0.83, P = .12). ∆L1-4 z-scores correlated positively with ∆weight-standard deviation scores (SDS), ∆height-SDS and ∆BMI-SDS, and with age at the second scan (R = .55, P < .01; R = .42, P < .01; R = .42, P = .01; R = .35, P = .02, respectively); and negatively with L1-4 z-scores at the first scan (R = -.63, P < .01). Stepwise linear regression analysis identified the first scan L1-4 z-scores and ∆weight-SDS as independent predictors of ∆L1-4 z-scores.

We utilized the latest available country-specific incidence rates, and aggregate data for 20 determinants, from over 50 countries accounting for more than half of the global population. We presented the associations with exponentiated beta coefficients [exp(β)] indicating the relative increase of disease incidence per unit increase in the predictor variables.Country-specific incidence estimates demonstrate wide variability across the world, with a median of 4.8 new UC cases (IQR .4-9.3), and 3.5 new CD cases (IQR 0.8-5.7) per 100,000 population per year. Latitude [exp(β) 1.05, 95% CI 1.04‒1.06, per degree increase], prevalence of obesity (1.05, 1.02‒1.07, per 1% increase) and of tobacco smoking (0.97, 0.95‒0.99, per 1% increase) explained 71.5% of UC incidence variation across countries in the adjusted analysis. The model for CD included latitude (1.04, 1.02‒1.06), expenditure for health (1.03, 1.01‒1.05, per 100 PPP/year per capita increase) and physical inactivity prevalence (1.03, 1.00‒1.06, per 1% increase) explaining 58.3% of incidence variation across countries. Besides expenditure for health, these associations were consistent in low/middle- and high-income countries.Our analysis highlights factors able to explain a substantial portion of incidence variation across countries.

Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying diseases, disease locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying disease type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at  h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying disease type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

Diagnosis of PSC was confirmed based on a combination of cholestatic biochemical markers and cholangiographic features. The Fisher exact test with Bonferroni correction was used to examine the relationship between categorical variables.We enrolled 95 children with UC/Inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified with a median age at diagnosis of 14 years (IQR: 10.4-15.9 years) and 1399 person-years follow-up. Among them, 9 children developed PSC-UC, with an incidence rate of 6.43 new cases per 1000 person-years. In this cohort, 8 (72.7%) of 11 children with high baseline serum GGT levels developed PSC-UC in comparison with 1 (1.%) of 84 children with normal serum GGT levels at baseline (P < .001). All children with high serum GGT levels at diagnosis had pancolitis in comparison with 63.9% of children with normal serum GGT levels (P = .01). Children with high serum GGT levels were more likely to be perinuclear neutrophil antibodies-positive than those with normal levels (90.9% vs 52.0%, P = .01).Our findings indicated that pediatric patients with UC and with even mild elevations of serum GGT levels, especially at baseline, might be predisposed to develop PSC.Crown Copyright © 2019.

We sought to determine whether putative procarcinogenic bacteria (enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli harboring the colibactin toxin) could be durably transmitted from donors to patients during FMT.METHODSStool samples were collected from 11 pediatric rCDI patients and their respective FMT donors prior to FMT as well as from the patients at -10 weeks, 10-20 weeks, and 6 months after FMT. Bacterial virulence factors in stool DNA extracts and stool cultures were measured by quantitative PCR: Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft), Fusobacterium adhesin A (fadA), and Escherichia coli colibactin (clbB).RESULTSFour of 11 patients demonstrated sustained acquisition of a procarcinogenic bacteria. Whole genome sequencing was performed on colony isolates from one of these donor/recipient pairs and demonstrated that clbB+ E. coli strains present in the recipient after FMT were identical to a strain present in the donor, confirming strain transmission. Conversely,  patients exhibited clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria following FMT from a negative donor.CONCLUSIONBoth durable transmission and clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria occurred following FMT, suggesting that additional studies on appropriate screening measures for FMT donors and the long-term consequences and/or benefits of FMT are warranted.FUNDINGCrohn's &  Foundation, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529606>Opiate Intoxication Caused by Epidural Infusion of Morphine: A Case Report of a Near Fatal Medication Error.</a></h2><p>Epidural infusion of local anesthetics with opioids is widely used for pain control during the perioperative-and peripartum-periods. Selection of the opioid, appropriate dosing, and follow-up by the acute pain service are critical in providing safe postoperative epidural analgesia.A 71-year-old man was scheduled for a parastomal hernia repair with midline laparotomy.

The epidural infusate (0.% ropivacaine with 0.5 µg/mL sufentanil) was prepared and double-checked by holding area nurses. The fact that the right prescription medication label partially covered a morphine label went unnoticed. The intraoperative phase was characterized by stable parameters. Postoperatively, it was not possible to demonstrate an epidural nerve block. No pain was reported, and the patient could be transferred to the ward. The patient developed coma and delayed respiratory depression after discharge to the surgical ward, requiring intensive care unit admission and naloxone administration. Analysis of the syringe content revealed the presence of morphine (1 mg/mL).Color-coded prefilled syringes combined with the use of an epidural specific syringe connector to prevent cross-connections should become standard practice.

While pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a well-defined disease with established guidelines, Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC) remain a clinical enigma with evidence based on limited anecdotal case reports. Large cross-sectional studies in US defined a prevalence of EoG and EoGE ranging from 1,5 to 6,4/100.000 and from ,7 to 8,3/100.000 subjects respectively, while prevalence of EoC ranges from 1,7 to 3,5/100.000 subjects. Regarding the pathogenesis, it is hypothesized that EGIDs result from the interplay between genetic predisposition, intestinal dysbiosis and environmental triggers. Clinically, EGIDs might present with different and nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms depending on the involved intestinal tract and the extension of eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The diagnosis of EGIDs requires: 1. recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms, . increased eosinophils for high power field in biopsy specimens, 3. absence of secondary causes of gastrointestinal eosinophilia. No validated guidelines are available on the clinical management of patients with EGIDs. Evidence from case reports and small uncontrolled case series suggests the use of dietary and corticosteroids as the first-line treatments. Considering the clinical follow-up of EGIDs, three different patterns of disease course are identified: single flare, recurring course-disease and chronic course-disease. This review will focus on pediatric EGIDs distal to esophagus, including Eosinophilic Gastritis (EoG), Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EoGE) and Eosinophilic  (EoC).Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633157>Injury Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease After Trauma: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.</a></h2><p>The clinical course of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after trauma is largely unknown. We sought to compare the clinical course of patients with IBD to those without.We conducted a retrospective case-control study of adult patients admitted to a level-1 trauma center from January 1, 2008, through October 1, 2015. Seventy-five patients with IBD were identified. Cases were matched to controls by age, sex, injury severity, and mechanism using 4:1 propensity score-matching analysis. Injury characteristics, clinical course, and infectious and noninfectious complications were compared using bivariate and multivariate analysis.Participants had a mean age of 56 years and mean injury severity score of 15. Of the 75 cases, 44% had ulcerative , 44% had Crohn's disease, and 12% had undetermined type. More cases were on an immunosuppressant (19% vs %, P < 0.01) or steroids (8% vs %, P = 0.02) on admission compared with controls. More cases had prior abdominal surgery (P = 0.01). Cases had fewer brain injuries (P = 0.02) and higher admission Glasgow Coma Scale (P < 0.01) but required more neurosurgical intervention (P = 0.03). Cases required more orthopedic surgeries (P < 0.01) and more pain management consultations (P = 0.04). In multivariable analysis, IBD was associated with increased odds of operative intervention, pain management consultation, venous thromboembolism, and longer hospital stay (P < 0.05). Patients on immunosuppressants had increased odds of requiring surgery (P = 0.04), particularly orthopedic surgery (P < 0.01).Baseline factors associated with inflammatory bowel disease may place patients at higher risk for surgery and complications after trauma.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

We retrospectively studied all pediatric kidney transplant recipients who required hospitalization for diarrhea between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. We divided the recipients into two groups based on whether they had received oral IgG to treat diarrhea. Sixteen pediatric kidney transplant recipients required hospitalization for diarrhea over 3 years. Median age at admission was 9.25 years (IQR:12.54). Fifty-six percent of recipients were male, and 81% were white. Four patients received oral IgG for prolonged diarrhea. Oral IgG recipients had longer diarrheal duration before admission (median (days) 14.5 vs1; P .02), a trend for greater weight loss at admission (median (kilogram) 1.4 vs 0.; P .3), and a trend for higher acute kidney injury (>75% reduction in glomerular filtration rate: 100% vs 42%; P .36).

Endoscopic outcome data are limited, especially in anti-TNF naïve patients. The present study compared endoscopic outcome in anti-TNF naïve and exposed patients, and explored if this was affected by drug exposure.We retrospectively analysed all patients initiating vedolizumab at our tertiary referral centre since 2015. For UC, endoscopic improvement was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 at week 14. For CD, endoscopic remission was defined as absence of ulcerations at week 22. Vedolizumab trough concentrations were measured at week 6, week 14 and during maintenance.A total of 336 patients were identified (53.3% CD), 20% of them were anti-TNF naïve. Endoscopic improvement was achieved by 56.1% of UC patients and endoscopic remission by 39.1% of CD patients. Endoscopic outcomes were significantly better in anti-TNF naïve vs exposed patients (all 67.% vs 42.0%, p=0.0002; UC 74.4% vs 50.0%, p=0.02; CD: 57.1% vs 35.8%, p=0.03). Achievement of endoscopic endpoints significantly impacted long-term treatment continuation (p=9.7x10-13). A better endoscopic outcome was associated with significant higher drug exposure in both CD and UC.The results of this observational, single-centre real-life study suggest that vedolizumab may induce endoscopic remission in both CD and UC. Although anti-TNF naïve patients had a significantly better outcome, 42% of anti-TNF exposed patients still benefited endoscopically. A clear exposure-endoscopic response relationship exists, however not all patients will benefit from treatment intensification.

Therefore, we investigated the postoperative surgical recurrence outcome and identified risk factors in Korean patients.Clinical data of 372 patients with Crohn's disease who underwent first intestinal resection between January 2004 and August 2014 at 14 hospitals in Korea were retrospectively reviewed.Over the follow-up period, 50 patients (17.1%) showed surgical recurrence. The cumulative surgical recurrence rate was 6.5% at 1 year and 15.4% at 7 years. Age under 16 (p=0.011; hazard ratio [HR], 5.136; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.576 to 16.731), colonic involvement (p=0.023; HR , .011; 95% CI, 1.102 to 3.670), and the presence of perianal disease at surgery (p=0.008; HR, .239; 95% CI, 1.236 to 4.059) were independent risk factors associated with surgical recurrence. Postoperative thiopurine treatment (p=0.002; HR, 0.393; 95% CI, 0.218 to 0.710) was a protective factor for surgical recurrence.Among the disease characteristics at surgery, younger age, colonic location, and perianal lesions were independent risk factors for surgical recurrence. Postoperative thiopurine treatment significantly reduced the incidence of surgical recurrence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635244>β-Caryophyllene in the Essential Oil from  Induces G Phase Cell Cycle Arrest in Human Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p> is a plant widespread in East Asia, used in folk medicine to treat various disorders, such as pneumonia, , stomatitis, and carbuncle. Whether the essential oil from  (ECB) and its active constituents have anti-proliferative activities in lung cancer is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of ECB in A549 and NCI-H358 human lung cancer cells. Culture of A549 and NCI-H358 cells with ECB induced apoptotic cell death, as revealed by an increase in annexin V staining. ECB treatment reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), disrupted the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl- proteins, and activated caspase-8, -9, and -3, as assessed by western blot analysis. Interestingly, pretreatment with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) significantly attenuated ECB-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of ECB identified six compounds. Among them, β-caryophyllene exhibited a potent anti-proliferative effect, and thus was identified as the major active compound. β- Caryophyllene induced G cell cycle arrest by downregulating cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) -, -4, and -6, and RB phosphorylation, and by upregulating p21 and p27. These results indicate that β-caryophyllene exerts cytotoxic activity in lung cancer cells through induction of cell cycle arrest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520828>Ambient air quality as risk factor for microscopic  - A geographic information system (GIS) study.</a></h2><p>Microscopic  (MC) is considered a multifactorial disease, strongly associated with smoking. However, little is known about the role of environmental factors such as ambient air pollution in MC pathophysiology. There is an overlap in components of cigarette smoke and ambient air pollution. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore an independent association between ambient air quality and MC.A case-control study was performed. MC cases in South Limburg, the Netherlands, diagnosed between 2000 and 2012, were retrieved from the national pathology registry and matched to non-MC controls from the same area based on age (± years) and gender. A stable residential address for ≥3 years was required. Residential land use, proximity to major road, and concentrations of air pollution compounds, were determined using a Geographic Information System (GIS). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were corrected for age, gender and smoking status.In total, 345 MC cases (78.6% female) and 583 matched controls (77.% female) were included. In the univariate analyses, the percentage of urban green within a 500 m buffer and residential proximity to the nearest highway were associated with MC (both p < 0.10). On the multivariable level only a higher age at diagnosis (OR 1.02, 95%-CI 1.01-1.04) and current smoking at index date (OR 4.30; 95%-CI 3.01-6.14) were significantly associated with MC.Based on the current findings, ambient air quality does not seem to be an important risk factor for MC, in contrast to the well-known risk factors age and current smoking.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We calculated the cumulative 5-year risk of colectomy after diagnosis and used a Cox regression model for comparison between a historical pre-anti-TNFα cohort 1 (1995-2003) and a cohort  for the era of anti-TNFα (2004-2015). Based on anti-TNFα users, defined as patients who had at least four anti-TNFα treatments within 4 months, we examined the subsequent need for corticosteroids.We identified 3001 patients from 1995 to 2015. The 5-year cumulative proportion of colectomy in cohort  was 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.4-11.1) and 12.3% (95% CI 10.4-14.6) in cohort 1. The adjusted 5-year hazard ratio (HR) was 0.76 (95% CI 0.60-0.96) for colectomy in cohort  compared to cohort 1. A total of 334 patients received anti-TNFα treatments, and 16.8% (56/334) were prescribed corticosteroids in the subsequent 3-month period. Corticosteroid treatment declined with follow-up after 6 and 12 months, 5.4% and 1.%, respectively.In patient's ≤20 years, the HR for colectomy within a period of 5 years from the time of diagnosis was reduced in the era of anti-TNFα compared to a historical cohort.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, .8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with , 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy. In patients with CD, the probability of nonadherence increased as the number of risk factors increased.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s &  Foundation 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660640>Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and dose escalation for patients with ulcerative : results from OCTAVE Open.</a></h2><p>For patients with UC, flexible maintenance dosing therapy may confer advantages for safety, efficacy, costs and patient preference. Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of UC.To assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib dose de-escalation and escalation in patients with UC.We evaluated data (November 2017 data cut-off) from OCTAVE Open, an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study. The dose de-escalation group comprised 66 tofacitinib induction responders in remission following 52 weeks' tofacitinib 10 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently de-escalated to 5 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open. The dose escalation group comprised 57 tofacitinib induction responders who experienced treatment failure while receiving 5 mg b.d. maintenance therapy, subsequently escalated to 10 mg b.d. in OCTAVE Open.After tofacitinib de-escalation, 92.4% (61/66) and 84.1% (53/63) of patients maintained clinical response and 80.3% (53/66) and 74.6% (47/63) maintained remission, at months  and 12, respectively. After dose escalation, 57.9% (33/57) and 64.9% (37/57) of patients recaptured clinical response and 35.1% (20/57) and 49.1% (28/57) were in remission, at months  and 12, respectively. The incidence rate of herpes zoster with dose escalation (7.6 patients with events/100 patient-years) was numerically higher than in the overall tofacitinib UC programme.Following tofacitinib de-escalation in patients already in remission on 10 mg b.d., most maintained remission, although 25.4% lost remission, at month 12.

Whereas several studies report an increase in mast cell density during IBD, others found a decrease. Recently, we observed a reduced response to mast cell degranulation induced by antigen contact in a  model. As the effects of mast cell mediators on epithelial ion transport are mediated indirectly via stimulation of secretomotor neurons, we investigated in vitro whether proinflammatory cytokines change the response to mast cell degranulation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and a mix of proinflammatory cytokines caused an increase of short-circuit current (I) and tissue conductance in rat colon. Anion secretion induced by histamine was downregulated in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the cytokine mix, whereas the response to the mast cell stimulator compound 48/80 was not changed significantly. In a coculture of rat submucosal ganglionic cells with a mast cell line (RBL-2H3), TNFα preincubation for 1 d increased the percentage of neurons responding to mast cell degranulation with an increase of the cytosolic Ca concentration and enhanced the amplitude of this response. Consequently, the downregulation of epithelial secretion is compensated by an increased sensitivity of secretomotor neurons leading to a constant response of the epithelium to compound 48/80. Furthermore, enteric neurons can modify mast cell functions as nicotine inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca concentration of RBL-2H3 cells and the I evoked by compound 48/80. Consequently, these in vitro models deliver new insights into cellular interactions in the gut wall under inflammatory conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In many cases, the diagnosis of ulcerative  or Crohn's disease is straightforward, especially when patients have a typical presentation and characteristic histopathological features. Knowledge of the full clinical history is very important, particularly past and recent medical history, drug history, foreign travel, or known contact with individuals with specific infection. Discussion of all cases of suspected IBD within a multidisciplinary team meeting is required to ensure that clinical, radiological, and pathological features can be correlated. Mimics of IBD can be divided into 4 categories: 1) those due to specific infection, ) those due to a specific localized inflammatory process, 3) those due to iatrogenic causes, and 4) other rarer causes. Accurate diagnosis of IBD and exclusion of these mimics are crucial for patient management. Once a diagnosis of IBD has been proffered by a pathologist, it is very difficult to "undiagnose" the condition when an alternative diagnosis or "mimic" has been subsequently identified. The histological diagnosis of each of these IBD mimics is discussed in detail, with guidance on how to avoid the pitfall of missing these sometimes very subtle and "difficult to diagnose" conditions.© 2019 Crohn's &  Foundation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of locally administered adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in a model of high-risk colonic anastomosis in rats.Seven days after induction of  with ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, Wistar rats were submitted to a transection of the descending colon followed by end-to-end anastomosis and were then treated with ×10 adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (from the preperitoneal fat) or an acellular culture solution instilled onto the surface of the anastomosis. At day 14, after macroscopic survey of the abdominal cavity, the anastomotic area was submitted to histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, evaluation of myeloperoxidase activity, fibrosis, epithelial integrity, NF-κ B activation, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular matrix-related genes.Anastomotic leakage and mortality associated with high-risk anastomosis decreased with treatment with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (P < .03). Application of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in lower histologic scores (P = .011), decreased deposition of collagen fibers (P = .003), preservation of goblet cells (P = .033), decreased myeloperoxidase activity (P = .012), decreased accumulation of CD4+ T-cells (P = .014) and macrophages (P = .011) in the lamina propria, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells (P = .008), and the activation of NF-κ B (P = .036). Overexpression of IL-17, TNF-α , IFN-γ, and metalloproteinases in the acellular culture solution-treated, high-risk anastomosis group decreased (P < .05) to near normal values with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment.Improvements in outcomes of a high-risk colonic anastomosis with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells therapy reflect the immunomodulatory activity and healing effect of these cells, even after just topical administration and reinforces their use in future translational research.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although conventional therapeutic strategies have demonstrated to be effective in the IBD treatment, it is necessary to incorporate novel therapeutic agents that target other mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as oxidative stress. For this reason, the efficacy in vivo of two antioxidant compounds, melatonin and resveratrol, has been investigated in an animal model of TNBS (, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) induced . PET/CT (Positron emission tomography/Computer Tomography) scans were performed to assess disease activity and evaluate treatment response. SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) values, body weight changes and histological evaluation were used as inflammatory indices to measure the efficacy of both treatments. SUV values increased rapidly after induction of , but after the beginning of the treatment (day 3) a statistically significant decrease was observed on days 7 and 10 in treated animals compared to the non-treated group. This remission of the disease was also confirmed by histological analysis of the colon tissue using the Nancy histological index (p value < 0.05 for differences between non-treated and both groups of treated animals). Moreover, statistical analysis showed a correlation (R = 65.52%) between SUV values and weight changes throughout the treatment. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of resveratrol, and melatonin in lower extent, as therapeutic agents in the IBD treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It remains unknown whether DMB can ameliorate ulcerative  (UC). In this study, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  rats were treated with  extract (GAE) or DMB for 10 days. Body weight, food and water intake, rectal bleeding score, diarrhea score, and histopathological parameters were measured. Rat colon were collected to determine myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide levels, and inflammatory cytokines expression. In addition, the role of DMB on lipopolysaccharide stimulated RAW264.7 cell inflammatory response and intestine smooth muscle contraction was determined. The results showed that GAE and DMB treatment could significantly alleviate TNBS-induced UC. Colon morphological alteration, nitric oxide level, and inflammatory cytokines level, such as nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and cyclooxygenase-, were decreased. In addition, DMB attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide release and proinflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells. In isolated mice intestinal tissue, DMB also reduced the intestine smooth muscle spontaneous contraction and inhibited KCl, acetylcholine, BaCl, or histamine-induced intestine smooth muscle active tension, while the active frequency was unaffected. Our results demonstrated that GAE and its active constituent DMB could inhibit TNBS-induced UC, reducing inflammatory response and alleviate colon muscle spasm, suggesting that DMB may be a good candidate for subsequent development as a multitargeting drug for UC treatment.Copyright © 2019 Ni, Liu, Yu, Chen, Liu, Chen, Ruan, Da, Zhang and Wang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579976>Endoscopic activity in asymptomatic patients with an ileal pouch is associated with an increased risk of pouchitis.</a></h2><p>The significance of endoscopic activity in asymptomatic ulcerative  (UC) patients with an ileal pouch is unknown.To investigate understand the association of endoscopic pouch activity in asymptomatic patients with the subsequent development of pouchitis.We analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients with UC or IBD-unspecified who underwent a total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA).

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative  (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activity was identified by ELISA, and the expression level of pNF-kB protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Dexamethasone ( mg/kg) and dapsone (12.5 mg/kg) decreased the macroscopic and microscopic damages compared with acetic acid group ( ˂ .001). Additionally, these agents decreased the activity of MPO ( ˂ .001), TNF-α ( ˂ .001) and the expression level of p-NF-kB ( ˂ .001) in rat colon tissue compared with the acetic acid group.  It is proposed that the anti-inflammatory activity of dapsone on acetic acid-induced  in rats may involve the inhibition of NF-kB pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499013>Comparison of fecal calprotectin and serum C-reactive protein in early prediction of outcome to infliximab induction therapy.</a></h2><p> Fecal calprotectin (FC) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) are biomarkers of disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC). We assessed FC, CRP, Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBi), partial Mayo Clinic Scoring (pMCS) and a cytokine panel during infliximab induction to predict therapy outcome.  FC, CRP and clinical indices were evaluated in 123 (76 CD, 47 UC) patients before infliximab induction and after 12 weeks. Responders were monitored 48 weeks for an 'incident' (dosage increase, shortened dosage interval, surgery). Cutoff values for FC and CRP were obtained using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC). Disease progression was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survivals, log-rank test and logistic regression for combined biomarkers. Cytokines were analyzed with Luminex multiplexing system.  Following infliximab, FC and CRP declined ( < .0001) along with HBi for CD and pMCS for UC. Simultaneously, IL-6 and TNF-α decreased, while IL-10 increased. Optimal FC ROC cutoff was 221 µg/g (sensitivity 66%, specificity 67%, AUC 0.71) and CRP ROC cutoff .1 mg/L (sensitivity 54%, specificity 60%, AUC 0.58). In CD, FC > 221 µg/g ( < .0001), but not CRP > .1 mg/L predicted an 'incident'. However, combined FC and CRP also predicted an 'incident' ( < .042). In UC, both FC > 221 µg/g ( < .0005) and CRP > .1 mg/L ( = .0334) predicted 'incident', as did combined biomarkers ( < .005).  Clinical disease activity is reduced by treatment with infliximab. In CD, persistently high FC, but not CRP, predict a treatment 'incident', whereas in UC both high FC and high CRP predict 'incident'. Combined FC and CRP values also predict an 'incident'.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498319>Murine Appendectomy Model of Chronic  Associated Colorectal Cancer by Precise Localization of Caecal Patch.</a></h2><p>The human appendix has been recently implicated to play important biological roles in the pathogenesis of various complex diseases, such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and Parkinson's disease. To study the function of the appendix, a gut disease-associated murine appendectomy model has been established and its step-by-step protocol is described here. This report introduces a facile protocol for caecal patch removal in mice followed by the chemical induction of chronic -associated colorectal cancer using a combination of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and azoxymethane (AOM). IgA specific cells and IgA concentration were significantly reduced upon removal of the caecal patch in male C57BL/6 mice compared to those in the sham group. Simultaneously administering % DSS and AOM resulted in nearly 80% mice survival in both sham and appendectomy groups without significant body weight loss. Histological results confirmed colonic inflammation and different degrees of adenocarcinoma. This model can be used for the study of the functional role of the appendix in maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis and pathogenesis of gut  and malignancies, as well as for the potential development of drug targeting therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545811>Global smoking trends in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review of inception cohorts.</a></h2><p>The effect of smoking on the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may be heterogeneous across ethnicity and geography. Although trends in smoking for the general population are well described, it is unknown whether these can be extrapolated to the IBD cohort. Smoking prevalence trends specific to the global IBD cohort over time have not been previously reported. This is a systematic review of smoking prevalence specific to the IBD cohort across geography.A systematic literature search was conducted on Medline and Embase from January 1st 1946 to April 5th 2018 to identify population-based studies assessing the prevalence of smoking at diagnosis in inception cohorts of Crohn's disease(CD) or ulcerative (UC). Studies that did not report smoking data from time of diagnosis or the year of IBD diagnosis were excluded. Prevalence of smoking in IBD was stratified by geography and across time.We identified 56 studies that were eligible for inclusion. Smoking prevalence data at diagnosis of CD and UC was collected from twenty and twenty-five countries respectively. Never-smokers in the newly diagnosed CD population in the West has increased over the last two decades, especially in the United Kingdom and Sweden; +26.6% and +11.% respectively. Never-smokers at CD diagnosis in newly industrialised nations have decreased over the 1990s and 2000s; China (-19.36%). Never-smokers at UC diagnosis also decreased in China; -15.4%. The former-smoker population at UC diagnosis in China is expanding; 11%(1990-2006) to 34%(2011-2013).There has been a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in the IBD cohort in the West. This is not consistent globally. Although, smoking prevalence has decreased in the general population of newly industrialised nations, this remains an important risk factor with longer term outcomes awaiting translation in both UC and CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625422>Anorectal function and quality of life in IBD patients with a perianal complaint.</a></h2><p> Anorectal function of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is still poorly understood, with contradictory results. This prospective observational study aimed to analyze the effect of perianal disease on anorectal function and quality of life in IBD patients.  Patient assessment included full clinical examination, validated scores, anorectal manometry, three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography, and endoscopy. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire was adopted to evaluate patients' quality of life.  From January to November 2016, 37 consecutive IBD patients (30 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative ) and 20 controls were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients had a history of perianal fistula, 9 reported fecal incontinence, and  had anal fissure. Fecal incontinent patients were older, had a longer disease duration, and higher bowel movement number than continent patients. Endoanal ultrasound findings were normal in all volunteers, while pathological features were found in 31/37 patients. Rectal sensory testing and anal pressure did not differ between the IBD patients and controls. However, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was normally elicited in all controls vs. 32/37 (86%) IBD patients; 25/37 (68%) IBD patients showed manometric features of dyssynergic defecation. Rectal inflammation and incontinence were associated with low maximum anal resting pressure. The quality of life score was lower in ulcerative  patients than in Crohn's patients and significantly lower in fecal incontinent patients.  Anorectal function is impaired in IBD patients with perianal disease. Fecal incontinence correlates with poorer quality of life. Anorectal manometry and ultrasonography are useful tools for evaluating IBD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619442>A Phase I Trial of Berberine in Chinese with Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The Chinese natural product, berberine, has biological properties supporting potential efficacy as a colon cancer prevention agent. Its longstanding use in China to treat gastrointestinal tract and rheumatologic disorders is generally regarded as safe, supporting initial investigations in an at-risk population, such as individuals with ulcerative  (UC). However, the safety of berberine in this population is not established. Individuals living in China with biopsy-proven UC, ≤ grade  dysplasia, and with a UC disease activity index (UCDAI) score ≤ 1 on mesalamine, were randomized 3:1 in a double-blind phase I trial to berberine 900 mg/day or placebo for 3 months, with the primary objective of assessing safety. Blood samples and biopsies of the colorectum, from prespecified locations, were collected prior to and following therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in UCDAI score, and in tissue and plasma markers of inflammation. Of toxicities at least possibly related, one episode of grade 3 elevation in transaminases and one episode of grade 1 nausea were observed among 12 individuals on berberine, and none were observed among 4 on placebo. The mean plasma berberine concentration was 3.5 nM after berberine treatment, significantly higher than 0.5 nM with placebo. Berberine significantly decreased the Geboes grade in colonic tissue, but had a nonsignificant effect on other tissue or blood biomarkers related to cell growth and inflammation. The combination of berberine and mesalamine is well tolerated in Chinese with UC, and may enhance mesalamine's anti-inflammatory effects in colonic tissue.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546840>Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of a  Mother Tincture for the Treatment of Ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of chronic autoimmune and idiopathic disorders that are characteristic of industrialized countries. In contrast to drug therapies, which exert several side effects, herbal remedies have constantly attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, in the present study, a mother tincture (MT) from fresh, young, non-woody  L. branches with leaves was obtained using distillation-based techniques. Further, this was used to assess its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory properties, and to validate it as a potential phytotherapeutic treatment for IBD. The characterization of the tincture included common phytochemical screening assays for antioxidant capacity measurement, cell viability assays on Caco- colon cells, and in vivo assessment of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of the intestinal mucosa, measurement of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and gene expression of the inflammation markers (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) in intestine after oral administration to an experimental mouse model of colon inflammation () developed by intrarectal administration of ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Our study proved that administration of 25 or 50 mg  MT/kg of body weight/day by gavage for 7 days succeeded in inhibiting the inflammatory process induced by TNBS in the intestine, most probably because of its rich contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. These data could contribute to the formulation of therapeutic products based on  that could come to the aid of IBD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659674>Biofilm Formation and Virulence Determinants of Klebsiella oxytoca Clinical Isolates from Patients with Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p>Biofilm formation has made the therapy of bacterial infections more difficult. The objective our study was assessment of pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Klebsiella oxytoca pathogenicity and virulence factors causing AAHC in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Among a total of 300 healthy and 300 patients with antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic  (AAHC) and CRC, 200 K. oxytoca were identified during May 2015-January 2019. The virulence properties and biofilm formation among the isolates were investigated by phenotypic, PCR, and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques.The bla (20%), bla (11%), bla (33%), and AmpC encoding CIT (%) ESBL genes, carbapenemase-encoding genes blaIM (4%) and bla (%), and colistin-resistant mcr-1 gene (.5%) were detected. The virulence-encoding genes including fimA (80%), pilQ (100%), matB (100%), mrkA (80%), and npsB (100%) were amplified. Therefore, PDR K. oxytoca containing adhesins and toxin-encoding genes with ability of biofilm formation causing AAHC and CRC were isolated. There was a significant difference between healthy and patients with CRC regarding the presence of K. oxytoca (p = 00.221).Bacterial enteric pathogens possibly play a role in CRC. Biofilm formation by K. oxytoca strains prevents the efficient infection elimination; therefore, rapid identification and control measure are chief requirements. Additionally, more investigations are necessary with this regard.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562896>Infliximab clinically treating ulcerative : A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab against ulcerative  (UC).Collection of databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CBM, and CNKI. This meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials comparing infliximab vs. placebo's, steroids, or immunosuppressants.Searching terms were ('infliximab', OR 'anti-tumor necrosis factor', OR 'tumor necrosis factor', OR 'tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody', OR 'tumor necrosis factor antibody', OR 'IFX') and ('ulcerative ' OR 'UC'). Study quality: Independently assessed by two reviewers.Meta-analysis combined the odds ratios (OR).Twenty-two studies (2080 patients) evaluated infliximab therapy in UC, and the patients were randomly assigned into infliximab (1149 cases) and control groups (931 cases). The meta-analysis showed the advantage of infliximab in three endpoints (short/long-term response and long-term remission). The main outcomes considered in this meta-analysis were percentage of response (defined by the authors of each study as partial or complete symptomatic response) and remission (defined by the authors as complete symptomatic response), both at the short-term (the first control performed in the study) and the long-term (the last control performed in the study). Compared to the control group, the infliximab group was significantly more effective (short-term response: OR = 4.01, 95%CI = 3.08-5.23, p < 0.00001; long-term response: OR = 3.53, 95%CI = .55-4.89, p < 0.00001; long-term remission: OR = .80, 95%CI = 1.89-4.14, p < 0.00001; colectomy (3 months): OR = 0.38, 95%CI = 0.19-0.75, P = 0.005; colectomy (12 months): OR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.33-0.67, p < 0.0001), but there were no significant differences in the short-term remission (OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 0.91-3.86, P = 0.09), and infliximab was notably effective in all the subgroups with different treatment doses (all p < 0.00001). In the comparison of differences in adverse effects there was no obvious difference between the two groups (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.48-1.19, P = 0.23).Infliximab is more effective than placebo's, steroids, or immunosuppressants, while the drug safety between the two groups was not obvious.

Presently there is no cure, and many IBD treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved inflammatory changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild IBD rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe IBD induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given % DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro-inflammatory factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti-inflammatory treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614204>Polysaccharides derived from Morinda citrifolia Linn reduce inflammatory markers during experimental .</a></h2><p>There are many reports of pharmacological activities of extracts and fractions of different vegetable-derived products in the scientific literature and in folk medicine.

The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and COX- expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti-inflammatory action against intestinal damage by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory action of cytokines, and COX- expression in the inflamed colon.

Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced  in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco- cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco- cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco- cells.

The animal model Winnie carries a missense mutation in Muc2 that causes Muc2 misfolding, accumulation in goblet cells, and ER stress. Excessive ER stress is a hallmark of many diseases, including ulcerative , cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's disease. However, rather than committing to cell death, which is the typical outcome of unresolved ER stress, Winnie goblet cells are characterized by hyperproliferation, suggesting additional regulation of this cellular stress response.To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ulcerative  in the Winnie model, we isolated goblet cells from Winnie and wild-type mice and used label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics to understand the functional consequences of Muc2 misfolding and accumulation.A large number of changes were identified that highlight a dramatic reprogramming of energy production, including enhanced utilization of butyrate, a key energy source of colonic cells. A major finding was the marked upregulation of the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain proteins Chchd2, Chchd3, and Chchd6. In particular, we identified and confirmed the upregulation and nuclear translocation of Chchd2, a protein known to inhibit oxidative stress induced apoptosis.This study is the first to apply proteome-level analysis to the preclinical Winnie model of ulcerative .

Ten (35%) patients died, 5 from liver-related complications,  from cholangiocarcinoma, 1 each from brain hemorrhage and systemic sepsis and 1 due to unknown cause; 3 underwent liver transplantation. Revised Mayo score of patients who survived was lower than those who died (1.03 vs. 1.86, p value 0.03).PSC commonly presents in young age and rapidly progresses to decompensation. Prevalence of IBD in PSC is lower and the proportion of small-duct PSC is higher than that observed in western populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562739>Systematic review: Clinical utility of gastrointestinal ultrasound in the diagnosis, assessment and management of patients with ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal ultrasound is useful in the assessment of patients with Crohn's disease, but its application in ulcerative  is less well established.To systematically review the role of gastrointestinal ultrasound in patients with ulcerative .Searches of the PUBMED and EMBASE database were performed with the following search strategy: (ultrasound OR sonography) AND (intestinal OR bowel) AND (ulcerative  OR Inflammatory bowel disease). The final search was performed in August 2019.Of 6769 studies identified in the search with  further studies found from other sources, 50 studies met inclusion criteria. Increased bowel wall thickness and detection of increased blood flow by colour Doppler were most often applied criteria for defining disease activity and distribution. When compared with other reference investigations, gastrointestinal ultrasound accurately determined disease extent, severity and response to medical therapy. While further information can be obtained from haemodynamic measurements of the abdominal vessels and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, their clinical value was uncertain. Likewise, hydrocolonic sonography has few advantages over standard GIUS examination. Of several scoring systems proposed, there is disparity between the measures and a general lack of validation. There has been limited application of gastrointestinal ultrasound in acute severe ulcerative  with toxic megacolon, and, while performing well in children, normal limits differ to those in adults.Current evidence indicates that gastrointestinal ultrasound has utility in the non-invasive assessment of patients with ulcerative . Continued advances in technology with better image resolution, validation of scoring systems and application at the point of care by gastroenterologists are likely to contribute to increased use of gastrointestinal ultrasound in routine clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

One CD study (N = 21) showed 45% (5 of 11) of the cannabis cigarette group experienced clinical remission compared with 10% (1 of 10) of the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 4.55; 95% CI, 0.63-32.56). Another CD study (N = 19) did not show significant rates of clinical remission. Forty percent (4 of 10) of participants in the cannabis oil group experienced remission compared with 33% (3 of 9) of the placebo group (RR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.36-3.97). A UC study (N = 60) did not have significant clinical remission rates. Twenty-four percent (7 of 29) of cannabis oil participants experienced remission compared with 26% (8 of 31) of placebo participants (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.39-.25). A second UC study (N = 32) showed the effects on disease activity, C-reactive protein levels, and fecal calprotectin levels were uncertain. Adverse events were more prevalent in the cannabis groups for both CD and UC studies. GRADE analysis for the UC and CD studies ranged from very low to moderate.In summary, no firm conclusions can be made regarding the safety and effectiveness of cannabis and cannabinoids in adults with CD and UC.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early (intervention) and late/no (comparator) biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is reported in Swiss francs (CHF). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed.Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention (CHF384,607; 16.84 QALYs) compared to comparator (CHF340,800; 16.75 QALYs) strategy, resulting in high ICERs (health system: CHF887,450 per QALY; societal: CHF449,130 per QALY). Assuming a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention strategy had a 0.1 and 0.25 probability of being cost-effective from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices (health system: CHF134,502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant).Early biologic use was not cost-effective considering a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY compared to late/no biologic use. However, early identification of patients likely to need biologics and future drug price reductions through increased availability of biosimilars may improve the cost-effectiveness of an early treatment approach.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect disease-specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in IBD.A collaborative of 13 high-volume IBD surgery centers was convened to collect 5 IBD-specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The  most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All 5 novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first disease-specific collaborative within NSQIP. The selected variables were demonstrated to be reliably collected, and this collaborative will facilitate high-quality, large case-volume research specific to the IBD patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Remicade (innovator infliximab [IFX]) may cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Hence, evidence is needed to optimize treatment while carefully weighing benefits and risks to the mother and child. Here, we report on birth and infant outcomes (up to  years) following gestational exposure to IFX based on a summary of cumulative pregnancy reports in women exposed to IFX during pregnancy from the Janssen global safety database.Prospective and medically confirmed safety data on IFX-exposed pregnancies from Janssen's global safety surveillance database since authorization in 1998 are summarized. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize pregnancy and infant outcomes overall, by disease and timing of exposure.As of 23 August 2018, 1850 maternally IFX-exposed pregnancies with known outcomes were identified from the safety database. Of the 1850 pregnancies (mean age 29.7 years), 1526 (82.5%) resulted in live births. When reported, most women had Crohn's disease (67.7%) or ulcerative  (18.4%), and 82.8% of live births were exposed to IFX in the first trimester. Spontaneous abortion/intrauterine death/ectopic pregnancy/molar pregnancy (12.1%), preterm births (9.%), low birth weight infants (3.6%), congenital anomalies (.0%), and infant infections (1.%) were documented. The type of congenital anomalies and frequency of serious infant infections observed were consistent with the general population. Frequencies of congenital anomalies and other adverse outcomes were similar in women exposed to IFX in the first trimester and those exposed in the third trimester. More preterm births (13-18.8%) and infant complications (8.7-12.5%) were reported with concomitant immunosuppressant use.The observed prevalence of adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes including congenital anomalies following exposure to IFX did not exceed estimates reported for the general population and no unexpected patterns were observed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain Fatty Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to explore the characterization of SCFAs in IBD patients and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.Case-control studies investigating SCFAs in IBD patients were identified from several English databases. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effects model.The SMDs of acetate, valerate, and total SCFAs in ulcerative  (UC) patients were -0.51 (95% CI, -0.90 to -0.13), -0.65 (95% CI, -1.02 to -0.28), and -0.51 (95% CI, -0.95 to -0.07), respectively.

Inactive rhomboid protein  (iRhom2) is essential for activating TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) in immune cells, which regulates TNF-α release. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation in IBD.The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in the colonic tissue of IBD patients and ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution (TNBS)-treated mice was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. To assess the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation,  was induced in wild-type and iRhom2-/- mice by the administration of TNBS enema.In LPS-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells, the mRNA and protein levels of TACE and iRhom2 were upregulated. The expression of TACE and iRhom2 in the colon of the IBD patients and TNBS-treated mice was significantly enhanced. The inflammatory cells that expressed high levels of iRhom2 in the colon were identified as macrophages. Finally, iRhom2 deficiency ameliorated TNBS-induced  by inhibiting TNF-α release.iRhom2 has an important role in intestinal inflammation through TNF-α secretion in immune cells, which suggests that iRhom2 could be a novel therapeutic target for IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

However, significant challenges still exist in Latin America to facilitate the access of biological agents for physicians and patients.The aim of this review was to summarize current evidence on penetration of biological agents for CD and UC in Latin America.Data are derived from a previous complete systematic review that explored different characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in Latin America. The studies fully included in this previous systematic review which contained detailed descriptions of the percentage of use of biological agents in different cohorts throughout Latin American and Caribbean countries were included, and descriptive findings were compiled, describing CD and UC penetration of these drugs in different patient cohorts from different countries.From the 61 studies included in the original systematic review, only 19 included data of the percentage of patients treated with biological agents. Anti-TNF use in CD varied from 1.51% in Mexico up to 46.9% in Colombia, with most of the studies describing anti-TNF use in approximately 20%-40% of CD patients. On the other side, the frequency of the use of biologics was clearly lower in UC, varying from 0% in 2009 to up 16.% in 2018, according to two different Mexican studies. Only two studies described the penetration of anti-TNF agents in IBD overall: 13.4% in a Colombian and 37.93% in a Brazilian study. No studies described percentage of use of new biologic agents (vedolizumab and ustekinumab).Penetration of anti-TNF agents in Latin America is comparable to the rest of the world in CD, but lower in UC. With the increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD, specific strategies to increase access to anti-TNF agents in UC and new biological agents overall are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544264>Tutorial on Diarrhea and Enteral Nutrition: A Comprehensive Step-By-Step Approach.</a></h2><p>This tutorial suggests a current strategy toward a multiprofessional therapy based upon a comprehensive step-by-step approach to the course of intensive care unit diarrhea episodes. Evidence published in the last 10 years, obtained through a database search (PubMed), shows that its prevalence is quite variable. Although multicausal, it is often erroneously associated with the supply of enteral nutrition. Several complications affect not only nutrition status but also the development of skin lesions, which can become the focus of infections, and the length of hospital stay. Here, we propose an early, objective, directed, and multimodal approach, aiming at optimizing care for these patients. In a dynamic walkthrough, the reader will find a guide for the general diagnosis and for  resulting from Clostridium difficile infections, as well as current instructions and recommendations for drug treatment and supportive therapy for these  modalities. We also bring together ways to prevent and treat associated skin lesions in this setting. Because it is neglected in the critical environment, diarrhea is still a poorly addressed disease, and its complications bring about a significant worsening in quality of life and hospital stay.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599001>Venous thromboembolic events in the tofacitinib ulcerative  clinical development programme.</a></h2><p>Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule JAK inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative  (UC).To report incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in the tofacitinib UC programme.DVT and PE were evaluated from one phase  and two phase 3 induction studies, one phase 3 maintenance study and an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension (OLE) study (September 2018 datacut). Data were analysed in induction, maintenance and overall (patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg b.d. in any phase , 3 or OLE study) cohorts.1157 patients (2404 patient-years' exposure; ≤ 6.1 years' tofacitinib treatment) were evaluated in the overall cohort. In induction, one placebo-treated patient had DVT and one had PE; no tofacitinib-treated patients had DVT/PE. In maintenance, one placebo-treated patient had DVT and one had PE; no tofacitinib-treated patients had DVT/PE. In the overall cohort, one patient had DVT (incidence rate [patients with events/100 patient-years; 95% CI]: 0.04 [0.00-0.23]); four had PE (0.16 [0.04-0.41]); all received predominant dose tofacitinib 10 mg b.d.; all had venous thromboembolism risk factors alongside UC.In this post hoc analysis of patients with UC, during tofacitinib exposure, one patient had DVT and four had PE, all during the OLE study, on predominant dose 10 mg b.d.

However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative . Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative  owing to the presence of inflammatory polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for  years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in 5 of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative , inflammatory polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the inflammatory polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative  activity, but due to other lesions such as inflammatory polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

Influenza antibody concentration was measured at immunization, at  to 4 weeks postimmunization, and at 6 months.Sixty-nine patients with IBD were recruited into the study, 40 on anti-TNF monotherapy, and 19 on vedolizumab, along with 20 healthy controls (HC). Patients with IBD receiving the HD influenza vaccine had significantly higher H3N2 postimmunization antibodies compared with those who received the SD influenza vaccine (160 [interquartile range 80 to 320] vs 80 [interquartile range 40 to 160]; P = 0.003).

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this disease better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco- cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor  (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco- cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco- cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673529>Expression of CXC Chemokine Receptors in Acute Ulcerative : Initial Study from an Animal Model.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is an inflammatory disease which is characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, crypt abscesses, distortion of the mucosal glands, and goblet cell depletion. The existence of neutrophil-rich inflammation in colon tissues of patients with UC is one of the most significant histological features of this disease. Nonetheless, the expression of CXCR chemokine receptors which appear as the main chemical mediators governing the migration of neutrophils into the mucosal tissue of patients with UC has not been well clarified.In this experimental study, the UC model was induced in Wistar rats by administration of  ml 4% acetic acid into the large colon through the rectum. Animals were anesthetized after 48 h; their colon tissue samples were isolated for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The expression of receptor of CXC chemokine was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique.Heavy infiltration of neutrophils, coagulative necrosis, and ulcers were observed in H and E staining, which pathologically proved the UC model. qRT-PCR results indicated that CXCR2 as one of the important ELR chemokine family receptors bears the highest expression in the UC group (32 fold) than the control group ( ≤ 0.05). In addition, other CXCRs of this group including CXCR1 did not possess any change ( > 0.05). In contrast, RLR negative chemokine family receptors did not show any changes with the normal group.The results showed that CXCR2 is the only receptor for CXCL family which was remarkably upregulated in experimental UC and that CXCR2 might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of UC.Copyright: © 2019 Advanced Biomedical Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632213>A SPECIAL MEETING REVIEW EDITION: Highlights in Inflammatory Bowel Disease From the 14th Congress of ECCO: A Review of Selected Presentations From the 14th Congress of the European Crohn's and  Organisation (ECCO) • March 6-9, 2019 • Copenhagen, Denmark• VARSITY: A Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Randomized Controlled Trial of Vedolizumab Versus Adalimumab in Patients With Active Ulcerative • Analyses of Data From the VISIBLE 1 and  Trials: Vedolizumab in Patients With Ulcerative  or Crohn's Disease• Improved Endoscopic Outcomes and Mucosal Healing of Upadacitinib as an Induction Therapy in Adults With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative : Data From the U-ACHIEVE Study• Long-Term Safety of Vedolizumab in Ulcerative  and Crohn's Disease: Final Results From the GEMINI LTS Study• Pediatric Crohn's Disease Adalimumab Level-Based Optimization Treatment (PAILOT) Randomized Controlled Trial• Maintenance Treatment With Mirikizumab, a P19-Directed IL-23 Antibody: 52-Week Results in Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative • Real-World Effectiveness and Safety of Vedolizumab and Anti-TNF Therapy in Biologic-Naive Patients With Ulcerative  or Crohn's Disease: Results From the EVOLVE Study• A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of a Targeted-Release Oral Cyclosporine Formulation in the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Ulcerative : Efficacy Results• Real-World Analyses of Patients With IBD Treated With Vedolizumab  Professor of MedicineDivision of Gastroenterology and HepatologyMayo ClinicRochester, Minnesota.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552601>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Vedolizumab Compared with Other Biologics in Anti-TNF-Naïve Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Ulcerative  in Japan.</a></h2><p>Vedolizumab (VDZ) was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 2018 for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative  (UC). The comparative cost-effectiveness of VDZ compared with other biologics is unknown in Japan. This information could be useful for decision makers at the time of repricing biologics for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC.The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of VDZ versus other branded biologics for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe UC who were anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naïve, from the Japanese public healthcare payer perspective.A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to predict the number of patients who achieved response and remission at the end of the induction phase and sustained it during the maintenance phase, translating this into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. Treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation and surgery, and their impact on QALYs and costs were also modeled. A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of each treatment versus placebo. Rates of adverse events, surgery, surgery complications, and utilities were from the literature. Costs (2018 Japanese yen) were obtained from the Japanese National Health Insurance drug price list and medical fee table and local claims databases. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over a lifetime and discounted at % annually.Over a lifetime, VDZ yielded greater QALYs and cost savings compared with golimumab and was cost-effective compared with adalimumab and infliximab (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ¥4,821,940 and ¥4,687,692, respectively). Deterministic and probabilistic analyses supported the robustness of the findings in the base-case analysis, indicating that VDZ was either dominant or cost-effective in most scenarios and replications. The main limitations of this analysis include excluding tofacitinib and infliximab biosimilar as comparators, health-state utility estimates were obtained from population studies in the United Kingdom, and the impact of subsequent (i.e., second-line) biologic treatment was not evaluated.Our analysis suggests that VDZ is dominant or cost-effective compared with other branded biologics for the treatment of anti-TNF-naïve patients with moderate-to-severe UC in Japan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593075>Association of rosacea with inflammatory bowel disease: A MOOSE-compliant meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Rosacea has been reported with several systemic comorbidities, but its relationship with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. Thus, our objective is to conduct a meta-analysis on the association of rosacea with IBD.We conduct a meta-analysis and searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase databases for case-controlled and cohort studies that assessed the association of rosacea with IBD from inception to July 2nd, 2018. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. We performed random-effects model meta-analysis to obtain the pooled risk estimates for Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative  (UC) in patients with rosacea.We included three case-control and three cohort studies. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The meta-analysis on case-control studies showed marginally increased odds of CD (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.69) and a significantly increased odds of UC (pooled OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.43-1.89) in patients with rosacea. The meta-analysis on cohort studies demonstrated significant increased risk of CD (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% CI 1.14-.20) and UC (pooled HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37) in patients with rosacea.The evidence indicates an association of rosacea with IBD.

The experience among taTME surgeons beyond their learning curve is limited.A retrospective analysis of all taTME cases performed for rectal cancer at two tertiary care hospitals from 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Transanal surgeons had previously performed > 50 taTME cases. Demographic, perioperative, and short-term outcomes were analyzed.Among 54 taTME patients, 74.1% were male and 27.8% had a BMI ≥ 30. Tumors were stage I (8), II (13), III (29), and IV (4). Complex cases included 4 local recurrences, 4 prior liver resections, and  with prior prostate cancer. Thirty tumors were located ≤ 6 cm from the anal verge. On staging MRI, 12 had a positive predicted circumferential radial margin (+CRM), and 4 had internal anal sphincter involvement (+IAS). Forty-seven patients received neoadjuvant therapy. A -team approach was used in 51 patients with laparoscopic (83.3%) or robotic (16.7%) abdominal assistance with a 9.% conversion rate. Low anterior resection with sphincter salvage was achieved in 87% with 8 patients requiring intersphincteric resection. Anastomoses were hand-sewn in 57.4% and all patients were diverted. Median LOS was 5 days with a 42.6% 30-day morbidity rate and 3 postoperative mortalities (ARDS, pulmonary embolism and pseudomembranous ). Complete and near complete TME grade was achieved in 94.4% with a 3.7% rate of +CRM. At a median follow-up of 28 months, local and distant recurrence rates were 3.9% and 17.6%, respectively, with no cancer-related mortality.Indications for taTME at experienced centers have expanded to include complex reoperative cases, local recurrences, metastatic cancer, and tumors with threatened CRM or IAS with evidence of post-treatment tumor regression. In the latter cases, taTME achieves good short-term outcomes and may facilitate R0 resection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative  in Mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota.

We aimed to (1) examine the rates of emergent colectomy and elective ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) over time among UC patients in the USA and () investigate disparities in surgery rates by patient demographics.Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2000 to 2014 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were admissions with a primary UC ICD-9-CM diagnosis code and age > 18. Emergent cases were defined as those admitted through the emergency room with an outcome ICD-9-CM code for subtotal colectomy. Elective IPAA cases were defined with an outcome ICD-9-CM code for IPAA, used as a surrogate measure of colectomy. Patient and hospital-level demographics were analyzed. Temporal trends of colectomy were analyzed utilizing joinpoint-regression analysis with calculation of annual percentage change (APC).A total of 470,708 admissions were included over the 14-year period. Emergent colectomy rate significantly declined (APC - 7.35%, p = 0.0002), while the rate of elective IPAA remained stable (APC - 0.21%, p = 0.8). Emergent colectomy rates declined similarly across all demographics, though not as marked among patients age 50 and older and Medicare patients. Elective IPAA rates were significantly lower among blacks and patients with public insurance.There has been a significant decline in emergent UC colectomy rates in the USA; however, the overall need for surgery appears unchanged given stable IPAA rates. This suggests a limited impact on overall surgery rates with a shift from emergent to elective procedures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542606>Entrapment of HETS recombinant protein onto PLGA and alginate NPs improves the immunogenicity of the protein against E. coli O157:H7.</a></h2><p>Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are known as the gastrointestinal pathogens and major causes of enterohemorrhagic  since decades ago. There is no efficient approved vaccine against EHEC O157 and non-O157. In the present study, a recombinant candidate vaccine against enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 entrapped in the sodium alginate and PLGA nanoparticles and the efficiency of the immunization of these formulations were investigated. nanoparticles due to their properties like controlled cargoes release, adjuvanticity, cargo protection, increased bioavailability, etc have been noticed for drug delivery. A chimeric protein composed of HcpA, EspA, Tir and Stx2B antigens was designed, recombinantly expressed, purified and entrapped in nanoparticles. BALB/c mice were administrated with nano-formulated and free proteins. IgG titer, EHEC fecal shedding and the ability of the immune sera to neutralize Stx toxin and inhibit the bacterial attachment to Caco- cells were analyzed. Fecal shedding analysis demonstrated that the colonization of the bacteria in the intestine of the mice was reduced significantly (P > 0.01). Immune mice were able to tolerate up to 200 LD of the active Stx toxin. About 80% of the bacterial binding capacity to Caco- cells was declined, especially in groups immunized with nano-formulations. Considering the importance of EHEC, especially O157 serotype, on public health and the other hand, the lack of an efficient vaccine in this regard, delivery of HETS candidate vaccine with NPs can be applied to prevent the infection by the pathogen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was directed to explore the prophylactic effect of  fruit peel extract against irradiation-induced  in rats. GC/MS analysis of the petroleum ether extract led to recognition of 33 compounds in the unsaponifiable fraction and 15 fatty acid methyl esters in the saponifiable part. Thirteen terpenes and sterols were isolated and identified from which ten compounds were not isolated from any part of this species before. Data showed that irradiation induced colon injury as manifested by elevated contents of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, cyclooxygenase-, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nuclear factor kappa B, while it reduced superoxide dismutase activity and interleukin 10 content in colonic tissues, which was confirmed by histopathological examination. Pretreatment with  extract attenuated the alteration in the measured parameters. It could be concluded that  fruit peel extract can be regarded as a potential agent in limiting colonic complications due to irradiation, possibly by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636473>Sirtuin 1 alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent protein deacetylase that is involved in various diseases, including cancers, metabolic diseases, and inflammation-associated diseases. However, the role of SIRT1 in ulcerative  (UC) is still confusing.To investigate the role of SIRT1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in UC and further explore the underlying mechanisms.We developed a coculture model using macrophages and Caco- cells. After treatment with the SIRT1 activator SRT1720 or inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM), the expression of occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) was assessed by Western blot analysis. Annexin V-APC/7-AAD assays were performed to evaluate Caco- apoptosis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  mice were exposed to SRT1720 or NAM for 7 d. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were conducted to assess apoptosis in colon tissues. The expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3 in Caco- cells and the colon tissues of treated mice were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot.SRT1720 treatment increased the protein levels of occludin and ZO-1 and inhibited Caco- apoptosis, whereas NAM administration caused the opposite effects. DSS-induced  mice treated with SRT1720 had a lower disease activity index ( < 0.01), histological score ( < 0.001), inflammatory cytokine levels ( < 0.01), and apoptotic cell rate ( < 0.01), while exposure to NAM caused the opposite effects. Moreover, SIRT1 activation reduced the expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, cleaved caspase-12, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 in Caco- cells and the colon tissues of treated mice.SIRT1 activation reduces apoptosis of IECs  the suppression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis-associated molecules CHOP and caspase-12.

Several stool neutrophil-related proteins are currently used as biomarkers for MH. However, the sensitivity and specificity are not sufficient to avoid unnecessary endoscopic evaluations.Novel serum neutrophil-related markers (neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 [NGAL-MMP-9 complex], cathelicidin LL-37 and chitinase 3-like 1 [CHI3L1]), together with C-reactive protein [CRP] and neutrophil counts were studied. Serum samples were obtained from 176 anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF]-treated UC patients (145 infliximab [IFX] and 31 adalimumab [ADM]) at baseline and after a median of 9.5 weeks. All patients had active disease prior to treatment (Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥ ), and MH was defined as MES ≤ 1. Serum was also obtained from 75 healthy controls. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to generate the Ulcerative  Response Index [UCRI]. The performance of individual markers and UCRI was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis.All neutrophil-related markers were significantly higher in active UC patients compared to healthy controls. In the IFX cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly after treatment and all marker levels were significantly lower in healers compared to non-healers following IFX. In the ADM cohort, CRP, NGAL-MMP-9, CHI3L1 and neutrophil count decreased significantly only in healers. UCRI [including CRP, CHI3L1, neutrophil count and LL-37] accurately detected MH in both IFX-treated (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and ADM-treated [AUC = 0.79] patients.The new UCRI index accurately detects MH after treatment with IFX and ADM. This panel is useful for monitoring MH in UC patients under anti-TNF treatment.This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and  Organisation (ECCO).

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

Alpinetin has been shown to improve intestinal barrier homeostasis under  condition, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, we showed that alpinetin significantly improved transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in TNF-α-stimulated Caco- cells, which was mainly mediated by inhibiting the apoptosis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that alpinetin markedly increased the production of autophagosomes, along with obvious regulation of LC3B-II, beclin-1, p62, Atg7 and Atg5 expressions. In addition, it also markedly repressed the activation of mTORC1 signaling pathway, which was ascribed to TSC2 rather than p-AKT, p-ERK, p-AMPKα or PTEN expressions in Caco- and NCM460 cells. Furthermore, the enrichment of H3K9me3 at TSC2 promoter region was decreased and ubiquitin proteasome degradation of suv39h1 was increased. Additionally, alpinetin activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and promoted co-localization of AhR with suv39h1 in the cytoplasm. The relationship between alpinetin-regulated AhR/suv39h1/TSC2/mTORC1 signals, autophagy and apoptosis of Caco- and NCM460 cells was confirmed by using CH223191, siAhR, siTSC2 and chloroquine.

We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], .35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal 5-aminosalicyte acid (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation.

Most studies focus on sexual dysfunction rather than patient-perceived sexual quality of life (SQoL). We aimed to assess SQoL in IBD patients compared with healthy controls.This is a multicenter, cross-sectional study of IBD patients (n = 575 with Crohn's disease and n = 294 with ulcerative ), compared with healthy controls (n = 398), that used an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. This multimodal questionnaire included sociodemographic data and 4 validated instruments: Short IBD Questionnaire, Social Desirability Scale, Sexual QoL Questionnaire-Male/Female, Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire.Inflammatory bowel disease patients reported lower SQoL (men: 77.29 vs 83.83; P < 0.001; women: 70.40 vs 81.63; P < 0.001) compared with controls. Among IBD patients, SQoL was positively correlated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and negatively correlated with depression symptoms. Perianal disease was associated with lower HRQoL and higher incidence of depression, but only impacted SQoL in men. In linear regression analysis for men, SQoL was associated with age, marital status, and depression (β, -.101; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.505 to -1.696; P < 0.001). In women, SQoL was associated with depression (β, -1.973; 95% CI, -.313 to -1.632; P < 0.001) only.Patients with IBD had impaired SQoL compared with healthy controls. Age, widow status, and depression were independent predictors of SQoL in men with IBD, whereas in women depression was the only independent predictor. Emotional and self-esteem issues were the main concerns reported by IBD patients regarding sexual health.© 2019 Crohn’s &  Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD.We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or ulcerative  and persistent gut symptoms at  large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1., P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable bowel syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no: ISRCTN17061468.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Children who received conventional therapy (including 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up. Higher CRP [1.006 (1.001-1.011)], lower albumin [1.050 (1.012-1.086)] and growth impairment [1.214 (1.014-1.373)] in CD patients and higher PUCAI score [1.038 (1.006-1.072)] and low iron [1.023 (1.003-1.043)] in UC patients were associated with treatment failure (all p < 0.05).Only 32% pediatric IBD patients will remain free of biologics or surgery 5-years after diagnosis. Especially children with a high disease burden at diagnosis were more likely to fail conventional therapy.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></html>
