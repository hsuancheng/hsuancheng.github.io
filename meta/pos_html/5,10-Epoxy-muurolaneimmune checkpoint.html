We evaluated NLR at baseline and within first month during treatment in patients who received ICI for advanced cancer to evaluate the prognostic value of baseline and of changes from baseline to on-treatment NLR.A retrospective review of patients with advanced cancer treated with ICI from 2011 to 2017 at the Ohio State University was performed. NLR was calculated at the initiation of ICI and repeated at median of 21 days. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the initiation of ICI to date of death or censored at last follow-up. Significance of Cox proportional hazards models were evaluated by log-rank test. Calculations were performed using the survival and survminer packages in R, and SPSS.509 patients were identified and included in the analysis. Patients with baseline and on-treatment NLR <  had significantly longer OS (P < 0.001). The change in NLR overtime was a predictor of OS and was observed to be non-linear in nature. This property remained statistically significant with P < 0.05 after adjusting for age, body mass index, sex, cancer type, performance status, and days to repeat NLR measurement. Patients with a moderate decrease in NLR from baseline had the longest OS of 27.8 months (95% CI 21.8-33.8). Patients with significant NLR decrease had OS of 11.4 months (95% CI 6.1-16.7). Patients with a significant increase in NLR had the shortest OS of .0 months (95% CI 0.9-9.1).We confirmed the prognostic value of NLR in patients with advanced cancer treated with ICIs. We found that change in NLR over time is a non-linear predictor of patient outcomes. Patients who had moderate decrease in NLR during treatment with ICI were found to have the longest survival, whereas a significant decrease or increase in NLR was associated with shorter survival. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a non-linear change in NLR over time that correlates with survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399043>Development of a new fusion-enhanced oncolytic immunotherapy platform based on herpes simplex virus type 1.</a></h1><p>Oncolytic viruses preferentially replicate in tumors as compared to normal tissue and promote immunogenic  death and induction of host systemic anti-tumor immunity. HSV-1 was chosen for further development as an oncolytic immunotherapy in this study as it is highly lytic, infects human tumor cells broadly, kills mainly by necrosis and is a potent activator of both innate and adaptive immunity. HSV-1 also has a large capacity for the insertion of additional, potentially therapeutic, exogenous genes. Finally, HSV-1 has a proven safety and efficacy profile in patients with cancer, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an oncolytic HSV-1 which expresses GM-CSF, being the only oncolytic immunotherapy approach that has received FDA approval. As the clinical efficacy of oncolytic immunotherapy has been shown to be further enhanced by combination with   inhibitors, developing improved oncolytic platforms which can synergize with other existing immunotherapies is a high priority. In this study we sought to further optimize HSV-1 based oncolytic immunotherapy through multiple approaches to maximize: (i) the extent of tumor  killing, augmenting the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) factors; (ii) the immunogenicity of tumor  death; and (iii) the resulting systemic anti-tumor  response.To sample the wide diversity amongst clinical strains of HSV-1, twenty nine new clinical strains isolated from cold sores from otherwise healthy volunteers were screened across a panel of human tumor  lines to identify the strain with the most potent tumor  killing ability, which was then used for further development. Following deletion of the genes encoding ICP34. and ICP47 to provide tumor selectivity, the extent of  killing and the immunogenicity of  death was enhanced through insertion of a gene encoding a truncated, constitutively highly fusogenic form of the envelope glycoprotein of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV-GP-R). A number of further armed derivatives of this virus were then constructed intended to further enhance the anti-tumor  response which was generated following fusion-enhanced, oncolytic virus replication-mediated  death. These viruses expressed GMCSF, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule, CD40L, OX40L and/or 4-1BB, each of which is expected to act predominantly at the site and time of  response initiation. Expression of these proteins was confirmed by ELISA and/or western blotting. Immunogenic  death was assessed by measuring the levels of HMGB1 and ATP from  free supernatants from treated cells, and by measuring the surface expression of calreticulin. GALV-GP-R mediated  to  fusion and killing was tested in a range of tumor  lines in vitro. Finally, the in vivo therapeutic potential of these viruses was tested using human A549 (lung cancer) and MDA-MB-231(breast cancer) tumor nude mouse xenograft models and systemic anti-tumor effects tested using dual flank syngeneic 4434 (melanoma), A20 (lymphoma) mouse tumor models alone and in combination with a murine anti-PD1 antibody, and 9 L (gliosarcoma) tumors in rats.The twenty nine clinical strains of HSV-1 isolated and tested demonstrated a broad range of tumor  killing abilities allowing the most potent strain to be identified which was then used for further development. Oncolytic ability was demonstrated to be further augmented by the expression of GALV-GP-R in a range of tumor  lines in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in nude mice. The expression of GALV-GP-R was also demonstrated to lead to enhanced immunogenic  death in vitro as confirmed by the increased release of HMGB1 and ATP and increased levels of calreticulin on the  surface. Experiments using the rat 9 L syngeneic tumor model demonstrated that GALV-GP-R expression increased abscopal uninjected (anenestic) tumor responses and data using mouse 4434 tumors demonstrated that virus treatment increased CD8+ T  levels both in the injected and uninjected tumor, and also led to increased expression of PD-L1. A combination study using varying doses of a virus expressing GALV-GP-R and mGM-CSF and an anti-murine PD1 antibody showed enhanced anti-tumor effects with the combination which was most evident at low virus doses, and also lead to immunological memory. Finally, treatment of mice with derivatives of this virus which additionally expressed anti-mCTLA-4, mCD40L, m4-1BBL, or mOX40L demonstrated enhanced activity, particularly in uninjected tumors.The new HSV-1 based platform described provides a potent and versatile approach to developing new oncolytic immunotherapies for clinical use. Each of the modifications employed was demonstrated to aid in optimizing the potential of the virus to both directly kill tumors and to lead to systemic therapeutic benefit. For clinical use, these viruses are expected to be most effective in combination with other anti-cancer agents, in particular PD1/L1-targeted   blockade. The first virus from this program (expressing GALV-GP-R and hGM-CSF) has entered clinical development alone and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in a number of tumor types ().</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518074>Endocrine-related adverse events associated with - inhibitors in patients with melanoma.</a></h1><p>- inhibitors have been shown to improve survival in melanoma patients, but can also trigger -related endocrinopathies, especially hypophysitis and thyroid dysfunction.To assess the incidence and the spectrum of endocrinopathies in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy a prospective observational study was conducted. Forty out of 339 patients, treated with - inhibitors, developed endocrinopathies. All patients had hormonal functional tests at screening (before the initiation of immunotherapy) and during follow-up.The total incidence of endocrinopathies was 11.8%, 13.4% due to anti-PD1/PDL1, % due to anti-CTLA4, and 18.% due to sequential and/or combination treatment. Twenty-one patients (6.2%) presented with isolated anterior hypophysitis, eleven (3.2%) with primary thyroid dysfunction and eight (2.4%) with both abnormalities. The most frequent anterior pituitary hormone deficiency was central adrenal insufficiency, followed by central hypothyroidism and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. None of the patients with corticotroph axis failure recovered during follow-up. Endocrinopathies occurred after a median of 22 weeks (range: 4-156) from treatment initiation. Of note, sequential and/or combination therapy with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 led to an almost threefold incidence of hypophysitis compared to either monotherapy. Only one of 120 patients receiving anti-CTLA4 monotherapy developed primary hypothyroidism.Our cohort demonstrated an increased incidence of hypophysitis with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 in contrast to the rarity of primary thyroid dysfunction with anti-CTLA4 treatment. These results could be attributed to genetic/ethnic differences. Sequential treatment is, for the first time to our knowledge, reported to increase the risk of developing hypophysitis to a level as high as that of combination therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

However, in the past few years a more effective combination chemotherapy has raised the bar of curability of about 10% in resectable disease. Morever, a deeper knowledge of GC biology have unveiled biomarkers to help personalize adjunctive treatments in patients candidate to surgery. Despite a plateau in efficacy of fist-line treatment, incremental survival advantages have been recorded in unresectable advanced disease. The growing number of effective drugs in second and later lines along with a more judicious delivery of cytotoxics and early supportive interventions have enabled more patients to proceed beyond first-line. The continuum of care has become a reality in a considerable proportion of patients that offer opportunities to improve outcomes. Finally, the advent of the   inhibitors has brought great expectations in molecularly-defined subset of patients. This Review summarizes the state-of-the art in the management of GC together with novel concepts that have entered clinical development with the potential of change practice in the foreseeable future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Current mIHC techniques involve long staining and assay times, require dedicated and/or captive instrumentation, and entail tedious assay optimization, hindering their establishment as routine methods. Here, we demonstrate the use of the InSituPlex method for spatial profiling of immuno-oncology targets in FFPE tumor tissue with the UltiMapper™ I/O PD-L1 multiplex assay. The panel consists of five protein markers to profile  infiltration and PD-L1 expression and includes CD8, CD68, PD-L1, pan CK, and SOX10 markers. The assay shows benefits of high and low expression of markers, coexpression and colocalization of proteins in single cells, and completion of staining and image acquisition in . h. Through the combination of multiplexed characterization of protein expression in whole tissue sections, fast staining workflow, and compatibility with existing instrumentation, the InSituPlex method provides a robust modality for deep phenotyping of the tumor and its microenvironment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31413914>Metastatic sarcomatoid renal  carcinoma treated with   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>: Renal  carcinoma (RCC) with sarcomatoid component carries a poor prognosis.   inhibitors (CPIs) have been approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC, but their efficacy in patients with sarcomatoid component is not known. : We conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 consecutive patients at our center who were treated for metastatic RCC with sarcomatoid component. : Ten patients were treated with CPI group while 20 patients were in No-CPI group.

TauT is also found to be overexpressed in variety type of human cancers, such as leukemia. This study showed that expression of TauT was upregulated by c-Myc and c-Jun oncogenes. To explore whether blocking of TauT inhibits tumor development, the RNA interference (RNAi) and  targeting approaches were tested in tumor cells in vitro and in p53 mutant mice in vivo. Knockdown of TauT expression by RNAi resulted in   G2 arrest and suppressed human breast cancer MCF-7 cells proliferation determined by colonies production and  migration assays. Knockdown of TauT also rendered MCF-7 cells more susceptible to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. An antibody specifically against TauT blocked taurine uptake and induced   G2 arrest leading to  death of variety type of tumor cells without affecting the viability of normal mammalian cells. TauT peptide vaccination significantly increased median lifespan (1.-fold) of the p53 null mice and rescued p53+/- mice by extending the median lifespan from 315 days to 621 days. Furthermore, single dose treatment of tumor-bearing (thymic lymphoma) p53 null mice with TauT peptide reduced tumor size by about 50% and significantly prolonged survival of these mice from average 7 days (after observing the thymic lymphoma) to 21 days. This finding demonstrates that a novel TauT peptide vaccine can delay, inhibit, and/or treat p53 mutation related spontaneous tumorigenesis in vivo. Therefore, TauT peptide may be used as a universal cancer vaccine to prevent and/or treat patients with p53 mutation-mediated cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526549>-Mediated Therapies in Lymphoma.</a></h1><p>To review types of lymphoma, risk factors, and evaluate novel -mediated therapies, including side effects and management of -mediated toxicities.Published literature, national statistics, and Web sites.Novel biologic agents are being developed with the potential to improve outcomes.

Antinuclear antibodies were detected in two patients at a low titre (1/80), and serum IgG concentrations were also only mildly elevated in two patients. Liver biopsies showed panlobular hepatitis (n=), cholangiopathic changes (n=2), granulomatous injury (n=2), and bland cholestasis (n=1). Two cases of cholangiopathy (both pembrolizumab-treated) showed diffuse sclerosing cholangitis on imaging, and one also presented lymphocytic cholangitis resembling primary biliary cholangitis on biopsy. In two atezolizumab-treated cases, Kupffer cells were hyperplastic and aggregated, forming microgranulomas. Confluent necrosis and eosinophilic or plasma- infiltration were rare. On immunostaining, the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ cells was 12.2 ± .1, which was significantly higher than that in autoimmune hepatitis (2.7 ± 1.1; p<0.001) or idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (.0 ± 1.1; p=0.014). All patients responded to steroid therapy, but it was less effective in patients with sclerosing cholangitis.Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab manifested not only lobular hepatitis but also sclerosing cholangitis, lymphocytic duct injury, and granulomatous hepatitis, probably representing various impaired cellular functions in CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages due to blockage of PD-1-PD-L1 interaction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604779>Lynch syndrome-associated ultra-hypermutated pediatric glioblastoma mimicking a constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome.</a></h1><p>Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a poor prognosis as a result of recurrence after treatment of surgery and radiochemotherapy. A small subset of pediatric GBMs presenting with an ultra-high tumor mutational burden (TMB) may be sensitive to   inhibition. Here we report a 16-yr-old male with an ultra-hypermutated GBM.

However, they also induce a plethora of unique -related adverse events (irAEs). Since for many organ systems symptoms can be unspecific, differential diagnosis with progression of disease or infection may be difficult. C-reactive protein (CRP) has been suggested as a marker for infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of CRP in differentiating infectious causes from autoimmune side effects induced by ICIs.In order to investigate the role of CRP in irAEs, we screened our patient data base. Only events with full infectious workup were included. In total 88 events of irAEs in 37 melanoma patients were analyzed. CRP levels before and during irAEs were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Chi-square test for categorical variables.At the onset of irAE, CRP rose in 93% of cases to a mean of 52.7 mg/L (CI 35.1-70.3) from 8.4 mg/L at baseline (normal <  mg/L) (P < 0.0001). Other causes of CRP elevation including infectious diseases were excluded, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels were normal in 92% of events. Importantly, in 42% of cases CRP elevations preceded clinical symptoms.CRP elevation can predict the onset of irAEs in patients treated with ICIs in the absence of infectious disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31348579>Efficacy and safety of nivolumab in Japanese patients with uterine cervical cancer, uterine corpus cancer, or soft tissue sarcoma: Multicenter, open-label phase 2 trial.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody against the   receptor programmed death-1, inhibiting binding to programmed death-ligand 1 or 2 (PD-L1 or PD-L2). This phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with advanced/recurrent uterine cervical cancer, uterine corpus cancer, or soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Patients received nivolumab 240 mg at 2-week intervals. Primary endpoint was objective response rate; secondary endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, and safety. PD-L1 expression and microsatellite-instability (MSI) status were analyzed as potential efficacy biomarkers. Objective response rate was 25%, 23%, and 0% in patients with cervical cancer (n = 20), corpus cancer (n = 22), and STS (n = 21), respectively. The lower 80% confidence intervals of objective response rates in patients with cervical or corpus cancer exceeded the threshold rate (%); the primary endpoint was met in cervical and corpus cancer, but not in STS. Median progression-free survival was .6, 3.4, and 1.4 months, and 6-month overall survival was 84%, 73%, and 86% in cervical cancer, corpus cancer, and STS, respectively. The objective response rate was higher in patients with cervical cancer with PD-L1-positive (n = /15; 33%) versus PD-L1-negative (n = 0/; 0%) tumors. The two patients with corpus cancer classified as MSI-high responded; the six patients classified as microsatellite stable did not respond. Overall, nivolumab showed acceptable toxicity in all cohorts, with evidence of clinical activity in uterine cervical or corpus cancer, but not in STS. PD-L1 expression in cervical cancer and MSI-high in corpus cancer may predict clinical activity of nivolumab in these cancers.© 2019 The Authors.

Skin-directed therapies, such as phototherapy, radiation therapy, or topical nitrogen mustard, provide only short-term remissions. Numerous attempts with different chemotherapeutic regimes failed to achieve meaningful clinical responses. Immunotherapy seems to be a promising avenue to achieve long-term disease control in CTCL. There is compelling evidence indicating that MF and SS are immunogenic lymphomas, which can be recognized by the patient's  system. However, CTCL uses different strategies to impair host's immunity, eg, via repolarizing the T- differentiation from type I to type II, recruiting immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells, and limiting the repertoire of lymphocytes in the circulation. Many currently used therapies, such as interferon-α, imiquimod, extracorporeal phototherapy, and allogeneic bone marrow transplant, seem to exert their therapeutic effect via activation of the antitumor cytotoxic response and reconstitution of the host's  system. It is likely that novel immunotherapies such as   inhibitors, cancer vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor-T cells will help to manage CTCL more efficiently. We also discuss how current genomic techniques, such as estimating the mutational load by whole genome sequencing and neoantigen calling, are likely to provide clinically useful information facilitating personalized immunotherapy of CTCL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360140>Current and Future Systemic Therapies for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer with unmet needs and limited effective therapeutic options. The management strategy for diagnosed HCC is based on Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging. Advanced HCC is treated with systemic therapy comprising oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and intravenous   inhibitors, provided that liver function is reasonable. Five new agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the past 2 years for the treatment of HCC: lenvatinib in the first-line setting, and regorafenib, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and cabozantinib as second-line therapies. The FDA is considering a label expansion of ramucirumab to include its use in HCC. These therapies have all been shown to extend overall patient survival and appear to have a reasonable safety profile. Multiple ongoing trials are studying   inhibition alone or in combination with TKIs. The results of these trials will help determine the optimal choice, timing, and sequence of agents. This article reviews the role of currently approved systemic therapies for HCC and highlights potential future combination therapeutic strategies. The article also brings forward the concept of a developing shift to the left for therapy, as mapped out in the BCLC staging and treatment algorithm, marking earlier use of systemic therapy prior to advanced progression of the disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut microbiota and cancer: How gut microbiota modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis.

We investigated whether infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associates with development and severity of colitis in patients receiving   inhibitor therapies.We performed a retrospective analysis of fixed colon tissues from 16 patients (12 men, 4 women, median age, 69. y) with colitis after   inhibitor therapy (9 patients treated with anti-CTLA4, 3 patients treated with anti-PD1, and 4 patients received a combination). Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for colon perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected.Colon tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with colon perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small B cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from 2 patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory colitis (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and colon perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that colon tissues from 4/13 patients with colitis after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with colon perforation) contained EBVMCUs. EBVMCUs seem to arise secondarily in areas of inflamed colon due to immunosuppressive treatment for colitis.

This study aimed at identifying the mutational assets of -wt GBMs in patients aged 18-54 years for which limited data are available.Sixteen -wt GBMs from adults < 55 years old were explored for mutations, copy number variations, tumour mutational load (TML), and mutational spectrum by a 409 genes TML panel.Eight (50%) -wt GBMs were hypermutated (TML > 9 mutations/Mb) and two (12.%) were ultra-mutated (TML > 100 mutations/Mb). One ultra-mutated GBM had microsatellite instability (MSI), a somatic MSH6 mutation, and a germline POLE mutation. The other ultra-mutated GBMs had MSI and two somatic mutations in MSH2. Both ultra-mutated GBMs featured at least 25% giant cells. The overall survival of eight patients with hypermutated GBMs was significantly longer than that of patients with non-hypermutated GBMs ( = 0.04).We identified a hyper-mutated subgroup among IDH-wt GBMs in adults < 55 years that had improved prognosis. Two cases were ultra-mutated and characterized by the presence of at least 25% giant cells, MMR mutations, and MSI. Since high TML has been associated with response to   inhibition in paediatric gliomas, the identification of a subtype of ultra-mutated IDH-wt GBM may have implications for immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634647>Haematological -related adverse events with   inhibitors, how to manage?</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) are changing the treatments of many patients with cancer. These immunotherapies are generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, and their adverse events are -related mimicking autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Although these -related adverse events mainly affect the skin, endocrine glands, digestive tract, joints, liver or lungs, all the organs can be theoretically affected, and the haematopoietic system is not spared. This review of the literature will focus on the haematological -related adverse events (Haem-irAEs). By reviewing the largest clinical trials of ICIs, we estimate the frequency of Haem-irAEs at 3.6% for all grades and 0.7% for grades III-IV. Frequency of Haem-irAEs of all grades was found to be higher with anti-programmed  death 1 (4.1%) or anti-programmed  death ligand 1 (4.7%) than with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (0.%) (p < 0.0001). From the 63 cases with Haem-irAEs reported in the literature, the mean time to the onset was found to be 10 weeks after ICI initiation, and the large range for occurrence (1-84 weeks) and the regular incidence suggest that Haem-irAEs could occur at any time after ICI therapy. Among the 63 reported cases with Haem-irAEs, the distribution was  thrombocytopenia (n = 18, 29%), pancytopenia or  aplastic anaemia (n = 12, 19%), neutropenia (n = 11, 17%), haemolytic anaemia (n = 10, 16%), cytokine release syndrome with haemophagocytic syndrome (n = 7, 11%) and other Haem-irAEs including bicytopenia or pure red  aplasia (n = , 8%). Haem-irAEs are generally highly severe adverse reactions with a mortality rate of Haem-irAEs reported to be 14% (9 deaths among the 63 cases reported). The more severe and life-threatening Haem-irAEs were both cytokine release syndrome with haemophagocytic syndrome and pancytopenia or aplastic anaemia. Haem-irAEs induced by ICIs are potentially life-threatening. By discussing their pathophysiological aspects and clinical picture, we propose in this review clinical guidelines for management.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A key underlying mechanism is programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1)-mediated T- function impairment. This is one of the first clinical safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) assessments of the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab and its effect on  biomarkers in sepsis.Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase 1b study in 31 adults at 10 US hospital ICUs with sepsis diagnosed ≥ 24 h before study treatment, ≥ 1 organ dysfunction, and absolute lymphocyte count ≤ 1.1 × 10 cells/μL. Participants received one nivolumab dose [480 mg (n = 15) or 960 mg (n = 16)]; follow-up was 90 days. Primary endpoints were safety and PK parameters.Twelve deaths occurred [n = 6 per study arm; 40% (480 mg) and 37.% (960 mg)]. Serious AEs occurred in eight participants [n = 1, 6.7% (480 mg); n = 7, 43.8% (960 mg)]. AEs considered by the investigator to be possibly drug-related and -mediated occurred in five participants [n = 2, 13.3% (480 mg); n = 3, 18.8% (960 mg)]. Mean ± SD terminal half-life was 14.7 ± .3 (480 mg) and 15.8 ± 7.9 (960 mg) days. All participants maintained > 90% receptor occupancy (RO) 28 days post-infusion. Median (Q1, Q3) mHLA-DR levels increased to 11,531 (6528, 19,495) and 11,449 (6225, 16,698) mAbs/ in the 480- and 960-mg arms by day 14, respectively. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels did not increase.In this sepsis population, nivolumab administration did not result in unexpected safety findings or indicate any 'cytokine storm'. The PK profile maintained RO > 90% for ≥ 28 days. Further efficacy and safety studies are warranted.

By contrast, owing to their heterogeneous manifestations, unpredictable timing, and clinical overlap with other conditions, -related adverse events (irAE) may be more difficult to diagnose and characterize.To determine concordance of algorithm-driven medical record review by medical oncologists for the characterization of 8 irAE in patients treated with   inhibitors.Cross-sectional study of patients treated with   inhibitors at a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center from November 30, 2015, to March 7, 2018. A sample size of 52 patients provided 80% power to distinguish substantial agreement (κ = 0.85) from poor agreement (κ = 0.) based on the Cohen κ.Interrater agreement of 2 observers in the occurrence and grade of irAE.Of 52 patients (32 [61.%] male; mean [SD] age, 69 [9] years) analyzed, 42 (80.8%) had non-small  lung cancer and all received anti-programmed  death 1 or anti-programmed  death ligand 1 antibodies, with 3 patients (.8%) receiving combinations with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibodies. A median (interquartile range) of 82 (47-180) documents were reviewed per case. There was limited or poor interrater agreement on irAE occurrence (Cohen κ, 0.37-0.64), with the exception of hypothyroidism (κ = 0.8). Weighted κ similarly showed limited or poor agreement for irAE grade (κ = 0.31-0.75). Differences in assessed time of onset ranged from  to 188 days. As a control for data availability and access, observers had a high degree of agreement for the exact start date (98%) and end date (96%) of immunotherapy administration, suggesting that information interpretation rather than identification largely accounted for assessment differences. In multivariable analysis, therapy duration (adjusted odds ratio, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.34-17.17; P = .02) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (adjusted odds ratio, 4.09; 95% CI, 1.10-15.18; P = .03) were significantly associated with discordant irAE assessment.These findings underscore critical challenges in assessing the occurrence, type, timing, and severity of irAE. Apart from hypothyroidism (a condition that has a discrete diagnostic laboratory test and few other likely etiologies during immunotherapy treatment), interobserver agreement was poor. Given the importance of accurate and timely assessment of toxic effects for clinical trials and real-world disease management, efforts to improve irAE diagnosis and characterization are needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346755>Prognostic and theranostic 18F-FDG PET biomarkers for anti-PD1 immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma: association with outcome and transcriptomics.</a></h1><p>An imaging-based stratification tool is needed to identify melanoma patients who will benefit from anti Programmed Death-1 antibody (anti-PD1). We aimed at identifying biomarkers for survival and response evaluated in lymphoid tissue metabolism in spleen and bone marrow before initiation of therapy.This retrospective study included 55 patients from two institutions who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before anti-PD1. Parameters extracted were SUVmax, SUVmean, HISUV (SUV-based Heterogeneity Index), TMTV (total metabolic tumor volume), TLG (total lesion glycolysis), BLR (Bone marrow-to-Liver SUVmax ratio), and SLR (Spleen-to-Liver SUVmax ratio). Each parameter was dichotomized using the median as a threshold. Association with survival, best overall response (BOR), and transcriptomic analyses (NanoString assay) were evaluated using Cox prediction models, Wilcoxon tests, and Spearman's correlation, respectively.At 20.7 months median follow-up, 33 patients had responded, and 29 patients died. Median PFS and OS were 11.4 (95%CI 2.7-20.2) and 28. (95%CI 13.4-43.8) months. TMTV (>25cm), SLR (>0.77), and BLR (>0.79) correlated with shorter survival. High TMTV (>25 cm3), SLR (>0.77), and BLR (>0.79) correlated with shorter survival, with TMTV (HR PFS 2.2, p = 0.02, and HR OS 2., p = 0.02) and BLR (HR OS 2.3, p = 0.04) remaining significant in a multivariable analysis. Low TMTV and TLG correlated with BOR (p = 0.03). Increased glucose metabolism in bone marrow (BLR) was associated with transcriptomic profiles including regulatory T  markers (p < 0.05).Low tumor burden correlates with survival and objective response while hematopoietic tissue metabolism correlates inversely with survival. These biomarkers should be further evaluated for potential clinical application.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583120>The splicing FK506-binding protein-51 isoform plays a role in glioblastoma resistance through programmed  death ligand-1 expression regulation.</a></h1><p>Gliomas aberrantly express programmed  death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which has a pivotal role in immunoevasion. The splicing isoform of , termed FKBP51s, is a PD-L1 foldase, assisting the   molecule in maturation and expression on the plasma membrane. The concept that PD-L1 supports tumor-intrinsic properties is increasingly emerging. The aim of the present work was to confirm the pro-tumoral effect of PD-L1 on human glioma  survival, stemness capacity and resistance, and to address the issue of whether, by targeting its foldase either chemically or by silencing, the aggressive tumor features could be attenuated. PD-L1-depleted glioma cells have a reduced threshold for apoptosis, while PD-L1 forced expression increases resistance. Similar results were obtained with FKBP51s modulation. The ability of PD-L1 to counteract  death was hampered by FKBP51s silencing. PD-L1 expression was particularly high in glioma cells with a cancer-stem- profile. Moreover, PD-L1 sustained the spheroid formation capability of glioma cells. Targeting of FKBP51s by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) or the specific inhibitor SAFit2, reduced the number of formed spheroids, along with PD-L1 expression. Finally, in an orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma, daily treatment with SAFit2 significantly reduced tumor PD-L1 expression, and tumor growth. In treated mice, caspase-3 activation and reduced vimentin expression were observed in excised tumors. In conclusion, targeting of FKBP51s hampers PD-L1 and its pro-tumoral properties, thereby affecting the self-renewal and growth capacities of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31410774>Sex differences in the therapeutic effects of anti-PDL2 neutralizing antibody on stroke.</a></h1><p>Inflammation involving migration of  cells across the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB), activation of resident innate microglia and production of inflammatory humoral mediators such as cytokines and chemokines play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. - signaling involved in the process also includes  interaction between programmed death receptor (PD1) and programmed death ligands, PDL1 and PDL2. Based on our previous studies showing reduced MCAO infarct volumes in PDL2 deficient mice, we evaluated the ability of anti-PDL2 mAb to treat MCAO in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We found that anti-PDL2 neutralizing antibody treatment of MCAO significantly reduced infarct volumes in male mice but had no protective effects in female mice even at a -fold increased dose of anti-PDL2 mAb. The protection in male mice was likely mediated by reduced percentages in the spleen of PDL2CD19 B cells, PDL1CD4 T cells and CD86CD11b macrophages in concert with reduced expression of PDL1 and TNFα and continued expression of CD206, in the injured ipsilateral brain hemisphere. The lack of a therapeutic benefit of anti-PDL2 on stroke-induced infarct volumes in female mice was reflected by no detectable reduction in expressed PDL2 or PDL1 and an increased frequency of Th and Th pro-inflammatory T  subsets in the spleen, an effect not seen in PDL2 mAb treated males. This result potentially limits the utility of anti-PDL2 mAb therapy in stroke to males but underscores the importance of meeting the STAIR requirements for development of new stroke therapies for both sexes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616632>Current Advances in Immunotherapy for Acute Leukemia: An Overview of Antibody, Chimeric Antigen Receptor,  , and Natural Killer.</a></h1><p>Recently, due to the application of hematopoietic stem  transplantation and small molecule inhibitor, the survival of acute leukemia is prolonged.

This is a retrospective study in a tertiary center from 2010-2017. We reviewed the charts of patients with melanoma that developed thyroid dysfunction after  inhibitor therapy. Cases with thyroid irAEs were grouped by recovery of thyroid function at one year. We collected a timeline of thyroid function tests, medication exposure, and survival and compared variables between the groups. We studied survival in comparison to a matched group without thyroid dysfunction.  186 melanoma patients received  inhibitors and 17 (9%) had thyroid irAEs. Median time to abnormal TSH was 38 days and followed a pattern of thyroiditis. Seven of 17 had thyroid recovery. In the no recovery group, free T4 was often above 2 ng/dL (/10 in no recovery, 0/7 in recovery: p=0.040). In the recovery group, irAE grade was significantly lower with 7/7 grade 1 (p=0.004). Exposure to glucocorticoids was associated with recovery (3/10 in no recovery, 6/7 in recovery: p= 0.049). There was no difference in overall survival between the thyroid dysfunction group and controls, or between those that received glucocorticoids or not.  Certain aspects of thyroid irAEs may correlate with thyroid recovery, including grade 1 thyroid irAEs, exposure to glucocorticoids, and peak free T4 levels less than 2 ng/dL. Thyroid irAEs did not appear to be associated with change in survival nor did exposure to glucocorticoids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621883>MRI radiomic features are associated with survival in melanoma brain metastases treated with   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Melanoma brain metastases historically portend a dismal prognosis, but recent advances in   inhibitors (ICIs) have been associated with durable responses in some patients. There are no validated imaging biomarkers associated with outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICIs. We hypothesized that radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) could identify higher-order features associated with survival.Between 2010 and 2019, we retrospectively reviewed patients with melanoma brain metastases who received ICI. After volumes of interest were drawn, several texture and edge descriptors, including first-order, Haralick, Gabor, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) features were extracted. Progression was determined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases. Univariate Cox regression was performed for each radiomic feature with adjustment for multiple comparisons followed by Lasso regression and multivariate analysis.Eighty-eight patients with 196 total brain metastases were identified. Median age was 63. years (range, 19-91 y). Ninety percent of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Sixty-three patients (72%) received ipilimumab, 11 patients (13%) received programmed  death protein 1 blockade, and 14 patients (16%) received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Multiple features were associated with increased overall survival (OS), and LoG edge features best explained the variation in outcome (hazard ratio: 0.68, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, a similar trend with LoG was seen, but no longer significant with OS. Findings were confirmed in an independent cohort.Higher-order MRI radiomic features in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICI were associated with a trend toward improved OS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Given the low prevalence of MSI-high status in GC and its association with other positive prognostic variables, large data sets are needed to draw robust evidence of its prognostic/predictive value.We performed a multinational, individual-patient-data meta-analysis of the prognostic/predictive role of MSI in patients with resectable GC enrolled in the MAGIC, CLASSIC, ARTIST, and ITACA-S trials. Prognostic analyses used multivariable Cox models (MVM). The predictive role of MSI was assessed both in an all-comer population and in MAGIC and CLASSIC trials by MVM testing of the interaction of treatment (chemotherapy plus surgery  surgery) with MSI.MSI status was available for 1,556 patients: 121 (7.8%) had MSI-high status; 576 were European, and 980 were Asian. In MSI-high versus MSI-low/microsatellite stable (MSS) comparisons, the -year disease-free survival (DFS) was 71.8% (95% CI, 63.8% to 80.7%) versus 52.3% (95% CI, 49.7% to 55.1%); the -year overall survival (OS) was 77.% (95% CI, 70.0% to 85.8%) versus 59.3% (95% CI, 56.6% to 62.1%). In MVM, MSI was associated with longer DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.76;  < .001) and OS (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.73;  = .008), as were pT, pN, ethnicity, and treatment. Patients with MSI-low/MSS GC benefitted from chemotherapy plus surgery: the -year DFS compared with surgery only was 57% versus 41% (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79), and the -year OS was 62% versus 53% (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.94). Conversely, those with MSI-high GC did not: the -year DFS was 70% versus 77% (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.04), and the -year OS was 75% versus 83% (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.12).In patients with resectable primary GC, MSI is a robust prognostic marker that should be adopted as a stratification factor by clinical trials.

While patients who respond to  inhibitors tend to develop a durable response, <15% of patients with HNSCC respond to   inhibitors, underscoring the critical need to alleviate cancer resistance to immunotherapy. Major advances have been made to elucidate the intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy. Central genomic events in HNSCC have been found to possess previously unknown roles in suppressing  sensing. Such inhibitory function affects both the innate and adaptive arms of tumor-specific immunity. While  blockade effectively reinvigorates adaptive T- responses, additional targeting of the oncogenic inhibitors of innate  sensing likely informs a novel and potent strategy for  priming. This review discusses the recent advances on the identification of key HNSCC oncogenes that impair antitumor immunity and emerging -priming approaches that sensitize poorly immunogenic HNSCCs to  blockade. These approaches include but are not limited to cancer vaccine systems utilizing novel type I interferon agonists as  adjuvants, radiation, DNA damage-inducing agents, and metabolic reprogramming. The goal of these multipronged approaches is to expand tumor-specific effector T-cells, break  receptor-mediated tolerance, and metabolically support sustained T- activation. The translation of therapeutics that reverses oncogenic inhibition of  sensing requires thorough characterization of the HNSCC regulators of innate  sensors, development of additional immunocompetent HNSCC mouse models, as well as engineering of more robust  adjuvant delivery systems. Built on the success of  blockade, validation of novel -priming approaches holds key promises to expand the pool of responders to immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654203>Therapy Line and Associated Predictors of Response to PD-1/PD-L1-Inhibitor Monotherapy in Advanced Non-small- Lung Cancer: A Retrospective Bi-centric Cohort Study.</a></h1><p>Evidence on PD-1/PD-L1-directed   inhibitor (ICI) therapy for advanced non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC) is mainly based on clinical trials in first- or second-line settings.We aimed to investigate response and prognostic factors with special regard to third- or later-line therapy.We retrospectively analyzed all patients who had received ICI monotherapy with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab for advanced NSCLC. Computed tomography evaluations were analyzed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to calculate progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival; the impact of influencing variables was evaluated using uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analyses.Among 153 patients (59% men, mean age 66 years), median PFS was 4 months [mo; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3-], OS was 13 mo (10-17), and objective response rate (ORR) was 22%. Therapy line ≥ 3 was associated with significantly inferior PFS (p = 0.003) and OS (p = 0.001). In first-line therapy PFS, OS, and ORR were 7 mo (3-11), 17 mo [9-not evaluable (n.e.)], and 36%; in second-line 4 mo (3-7), 18 mo (13-n.e.) and 19%, and in ≥ third-line 2 mo (1-3), 9 mo (4-12), and 13%. PFS was significantly influenced by PD-L1 expression in first-line therapy (p = 0.006). In ≥ third-line patients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status significantly affected PFS and OS (both p < 0.001).Third- or later-line single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is less efficacious as compared to first- and second-line treatment. In that setting, ECOG performance status predominates known predictors like PD-L1 expression or presence of an alteration in EGFR or ALK.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646161>Nonbullous pemphigoid secondary to PD-1 inhibition.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613799>Targeting tumor-intrinsic hexosamine biosynthesis sensitizes pancreatic cancer to anti-PD1 therapy.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered to be a highly immunosuppressive and heterogenous neoplasm. Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment,   inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA4, PD1, PDL1) has not been very successful against PDAC. The robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this  evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize UDP-GlcNAc. In the current manuscript, we targeted this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo--oxo-L-norleucine or DON). Our results showed that DON decreased the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor . Further, treatment with DON decreased hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM, and an increased infiltration CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, treatment with DON sensitized pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy resulting in tumor regression and prolonged survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409745>An Accurate and Comprehensive Clinical Sequencing Assay for Cancer Targeted and Immunotherapies.</a></h1><p>Incorporation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology into clinical utility in targeted and immunotherapies requires stringent validation, including the assessment of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status by NGS as important biomarkers for response to   inhibitors.We designed an NGS assay, Cancer Sequencing YS panel (CSYS), and applied algorithms to detect five classes of genomic alterations and two genomic features of TMB and MSI.By stringent validation, CSYS exhibited high sensitivity and predictive positive value of 99.7% and 99.9%, respectively, for single nucleotide variation; 100% and 99.9%, respectively, for short insertion and deletion (indel); and 95.% and 100%, respectively, for copy number alteration (CNA). Moreover, CSYS achieved 100% specificity for both long indel (50-3,000 bp insertion and deletion) and gene rearrangement. Overall, we used 33  lines and 208 clinical samples to validate CSYS's NGS performance, and genomic alterations in clinical samples were also confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Importantly, the landscape of TMB across different cancers of Chinese patients ( = 3,309) was studied. TMB by CSYS exhibited a high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient  = 0.98) with TMB by whole exome sequencing (WES). MSI measurement showed 98% accuracy and was confirmed by PCR. Application of CSYS in a clinical setting showed an unexpectedly high occurrence of long indel (6.3%) in a cohort of tumors from Chinese patients with cancer ( = 3,309), including , , , , and other cancer driver genes with clinical impact.CSYS proves to be clinically applicable and useful in disclosing genomic alterations relevant to cancer target therapies and revealing biomarkers for   inhibitors.The study describes a specially designed sequencing panel assay to detect genomic alterations and features of 450 cancer genes, including its overall workflow and rigorous clinical and analytical validations. The distribution of pan-cancer tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, gene rearrangement, and long insertion and deletion mutations was assessed for the first time by this assay in a broad array of Chinese patients with cancer.

The baseline FTV of all 30 patients ranged from 9.6 to 1570 ml (median 439 ml). The FTV 8 weeks post-treatment was 56-6296 ml (median 448 ml) from 19 available patients. Patients with higher TLF at baseline had shorter OS than patients with lower TLF (3.4 vs 14 m; p = 0.022). Patients with higher SUVmax at follow-up had shorter OS than patients with lower SUVmax (.6 vs 24 m; p = 0.010). However, FTV and TLF 8 weeks post-treatment did not show a significant difference between groups (.6 vs 17 m; p = 0.49), and the percent changes in FTV (12 vs 14 m; p = 0.49) and TLF (.6 vs 17 m; p = 0.54) also were not significant.Higher TLF at baseline and higher SUVmax at follow-up NaF PET/CT corresponded with shorter survival in patients with bone metastases from urological malignancies who underwent treatment. NaF PET/CT may be a useful predictor of OS in this population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623302>Real-World Impact of   Inhibitors in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.</a></h1><p>Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignancy in adults and shows a high rate of metastatic spread. As randomized clinical trials with   inhibitors (ICI) have not been performed in patients with metastatic UM, we analyzed the real-world outcomes in a nationwide population-based study. Clinical data of patients with UM were extracted from the Danish Metastatic Melanoma database, a nationwide database containing unselected records of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in Denmark. Survival before (pre-ICI,  = 32) and after (post-ICI,  = 94) the approval of first-line treatment with ICI was analyzed. A partial response to first-line treatment was observed in 7% of patients treated with anti-programmed  death protein (PD)-1 monotherapy and in 21% with combined anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy. Median progression-free survival was 2. months for patients treated in the pre-ICI era compared to 3. months in the post-ICI era (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.67;  < 0.001). The estimated one-year overall survival rate increased from 25.0% to 41.9% and the median overall survival improved from 7.8 months to 10.0 months, respectively (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34-0.79;  = 0.003). Thus, the introduction of ICI as first-line treatment appears to have significantly improved the real-world survival of patients with metastatic UM, despite relatively low response rates compared to cutaneous melanoma. With the lack of therapies proven effective in randomized trials, these data support the current treatment with ICI in patients with metastatic UM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399482>Therapeutic targeting of Notch signaling and   blockade in a spontaneous, genetically heterogeneous mouse model of T- acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</a></h1><p>T- acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic cancer derived from the malignant transformation of T- progenitors. Outcomes remain poor for T-ALL patients who have either primary resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy or disease relapse. Notably, there are currently no targeted therapies available in T-ALL. This lack of next-generation therapies highlights the need for relevant preclinical disease modeling to identify and validate new targets and treatment approaches. Here, we adapted a spontaneously arising, genetically heterogeneous, thymic transplantation-based murine model of T-ALL, recapitulating key histopathological and genetic features of the human disease, to the preclinical testing of targeted and -directed therapies. Genetic engineering of the murine  locus aligned the spectrum of  mutations in the mouse model to that of human T-ALL and confirmed aberrant, recombination-activating gene (RAG)-mediated '  recombination events as the preferred pathway in murine T-ALL development. Testing of Notch1-targeting therapeutic antibodies demonstrated T-ALL sensitivity to different classes of Notch1 blockers based on Notch1 mutational status. In contrast, genetic ablation of Notch3 did not impact T-ALL development. The T-ALL model was further applied to the testing of immunotherapeutic agents in fully immunocompetent, syngeneic mice. In line with recent clinical experience in T- malignancies, programmed  death 1 (PD-1) blockade alone lacked anti-tumor activity against murine T-ALL tumors. Overall, the unique features of the spontaneous T-ALL model coupled with genetic manipulations and the application to therapeutic testing in immunocompetent backgrounds will be of great utility for the preclinical evaluation of novel therapies against T-ALL.© 2019.

However, previous studies have suggested conflicting results on the conditions of occurrence of ICI-induced vitiligo.The aim of this study was to describe the occurrences and outcomes of several cases of ICI-induced vitiligo.A retrospective study was carried out using the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPD) between the beginning of the commercialization of ICI in France and 1 January 2019, selecting for analysis the vitiligo reactions of patients due to treatment with ICI.Among the 95 case patients identified in the FPD, the median times to onset of vitiligo after the start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab therapies were .4, .0, and 3.8 months, respectively. Furthermore, 37 patients (45%) discontinued ICI treatment due to disease progression. The median follow-up time of all patients was 33 months (interquartile range 2-56).This study provided an overall picture of ICI-induced vitiligo in daily medical practice on a large number of pharmacovigilance observations of case patients. Among the observations of ICI-induced vitiligo, the diagnosed cancer was melanoma for almost all patients. Most patients in the study experienced other associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as colitis, pruritus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and gastritis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the resolution of pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-induced vitiligo could be a marker of disease progression. Future studies evaluating vitiligo outcomes are warranted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664934>Severe colitis after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients: potential role of Th1-dominant  response in -related adverse events: two case reports.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab is an   inhibitor specific to the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although -related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report 2 patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response. CRP as well as IL-6 was found to be a potential biomarker for irAEs.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature to assess the outcome for cancer patients treated with ICIs who develop irAEs. Two independent reviewers selected prospective or retrospective studies from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database from their inception to November 2018. Data were pooled using hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival or progression-free survival or odds ratio for overall response rate of irAEs versus no irAEs according to fixed or random-effect model. HRs for OS (the primary outcome measure) were pooled to provide an aggregate value. A total of 30 studies that included a total of 4324 patients treated with ICIs were selected. Patients who developed irAEs presented a reduced risk of death [HR=0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.62; P<0.001]. Similarly, the occurrence of irAEs was associated with a reduced risk of progression (HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.42-0.64; P<0.001). The odds of response was 4.56 (95% CI: 3.72-.59; P<0.001). In patients treated with ICIs, irAEs predict survival and response. Although this correlation cannot be fully explained, it may be related to the strongest T- activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469305>Treatment patterns of malignant melanoma in the United States from 2011 to 2016: a retrospective cohort study.</a></h1><p> Since 2011, the approval of several new agents has improved treatment options for malignant melanoma. We describe treatment patterns for malignant melanoma in the United States from the MarketScan database from 2011 to 2016.  Treatments used for patients aged >18 years diagnosed with malignant melanoma after January 1, 2011 and enrolled in the Truven MarketScan database were analyzed. Patient data were collected for the 12-month period from the date of the first melanoma diagnosis to either death, the pre-specified study end date (August 31, 2016), or date of termination of health insurance. Treatment patterns from 2011-2013 and 2014-2016 were analyzed according to agent, year of drug administration, and line of therapy.  From 2011 to 2016, use of cytokines (63.8; 13.3%) and chemotherapy (19.6; 12.9%) decreased, and use of  inhibitors increased (2.0; 49.9%).  inhibitor use also increased across all lines of therapy from 2011-2013 and 2014-2016. Use of BRAF/MEK inhibitors remained relatively stable from 2011 to 2016 (6.-12.%); however, the use of vemurafenib monotherapy decreased (6.; 0.8%), and treatment with combination regimens increased (0; 10.9%) from 2011-2016. BRAF/MEK inhibitor use only increased in the first line setting from 2011-2013 (9.7%) to 2014-2016 (11.2%).  With the approval of   inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and targeted therapies, the therapeutic landscape for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has shifted dramatically away from cytokines and chemotherapy.

Our objective was to evaluate the utility of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with nivolumab as well as the prognostic impact of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level.Sixty-five mRCC patients treated with nivolumab were enrolled. We retrospectively investigated several factors, including the NLR and the CRP level, for their association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In addition, we evaluated their impact on the objective response.The CRP level was confirmed to be positively correlated with the NLR in a correlation analysis. An NLR ≥  was significantly associated with a worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.93-10.7; p < 0.001), and an NLR ≥  and a CRP ≥ 2.1 mg/dL were identified as a significant factors predicting worse OS with HRs of 4.88 (95% CI 1.35-17.7; p < 0.016) and 3.89 (95% CI 1.01-15.0; p = 0.049), respectively. In addition, patients with a ≥ 25% decrease in the NLR and CRP level showed a significantly better response to nivolumab than those without a ≥ 25% decrease in the NLR and CRP level, with odds ratios of 9.54 (95% CI 2.09-49.8, p = 0.001) and 4.36 (95% CI 1.03-18.9, p = 0.032), respectively.Both the NLR and CRP levels were significantly associated with the clinical outcome of nivolumab in mRCC patients.

However, the majority of cancer types, including high-risk neuroblastoma remain immunologically unresponsive. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive technique that can mechanically fractionate tumors, transforming immunologically 'cold' tumors into responsive 'hot' tumors.We treated <2% of tumor volume in previously unresponsive, large, refractory murine neuroblastoma tumors with mechanical HIFU, and assessed systemic  response using flow-cytometry, ELISA, and gene sequencing. In addition, we combined this treatment with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 to study its effect on the  response and long-term survival.Combining HIFU with αCTLA-4 and αPD-L1 significantly enhances anti-tumor response, improving survival from 0 to 62.%. HIFU alone causes upregulation of splenic and lymph node NK cells and circulating IL-2, IFN-Ɣ, and DAMPs, whereas  regulators like CD4+Foxp3+, IL-10, and VEGF-A are significantly reduced. HIFU combined with  inhibitors induced significant increases in intratumoral CD4+, CD8ɑ+, and CD8α+CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ in regional lymph nodes, and decrease in circulating IL-10 compared to untreated group. We also report significant abscopal effect following unilateral treatment of mice with large, established bilateral tumors using HIFU and  inhibitors compared to tumors treated with HIFU or  inhibitors alone (61.1% survival, p<0.0001). This combination treatment significantly also induces CD4+CD44+CD62L+ and, CD8α+CD44+CD62L+ population and are adoptively transferable imparting immunity, slowing subsequent  tumor engraftment.Mechanical fractionation of tumors using HIFU can effectively induce  sensitization in a previously unresponsive murine neuroblastoma model, and promises a novel yet efficacious immuno-adjuvant modality to overcome therapeutic resistance.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666701>The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour immunity.</a></h1><p>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and encodes a key signalling protein in tumours. The KRAS(G12C) mutant has a cysteine residue that has been exploited to design covalent inhibitors that have promising preclinical activity. Here we optimized a series of inhibitors, using novel binding interactions to markedly enhance their potency and selectivity. Our efforts have led to the discovery of AMG 510, which is, to our knowledge, the first KRAS(G12C) inhibitor in clinical development. In preclinical analyses, treatment with AMG 510 led to the regression of KRAS tumours and improved the anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents. In -competent mice, treatment with AMG 510 resulted in a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and produced durable cures alone as well as in combination with - inhibitors. Cured mice rejected the growth of isogenic KRAS tumours, which suggests adaptive immunity against shared antigens. Furthermore, in clinical trials, AMG 510 demonstrated anti-tumour activity in the first dosing cohorts and represents a potentially transformative therapy for patients for whom effective treatments are lacking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358424> inhibitor-induced liver injury: A novel form of liver disease emerging in the era of cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Liver injury triggered by   inhibitors has been increasingly seen in clinical practice, and the incidence is likely to rise further in the next several years because of expanded indications for cancer immunotherapy. Tissue damage driven by disrupted  tolerance against self-antigens is called an -related adverse event (irAE). irAEs in the liver histologically presents panlobular hepatitis (∼70%), isolated central zonal necrosis (∼20%), primarily granulomatous hepatitis (∼%), and other minor forms of tissue injury (∼%). Infiltrating cells are mainly lymphocytes and occasional eosinophils. Unlike classic autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), plasma  infiltration is not conspicuous. Immunostaining reveals a large number of CD8+ T lymphocytes and a markedly smaller number of CD4+ cells or CD20+ B lymphocytes. The unique CD3+/CD20+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratios shifted in favor of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are helpful to discriminate irAEs from other conditions (e.g., AIH, idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury). Another hepatobiliary manifestation of irAEs is sclerosing cholangitis clinically characterized by elevations of biliary enzymes, diffuse duct wall thickening, and duct dilatation. Lymphocytic infiltration can be observed by endoscopic biopsies from the thick extrahepatic bile ducts, and liver needle biopsies may also show severe lymphocytic cholangitis resembling primary biliary cholangitis. An important differential diagnosis of irAEs is previously asymptomatic or subclinical liver disease unmasked by cancer immunotherapy, which is often challenging and requires close clinicopathological correlations.Copyright © 2019.

NCCN guidelines for kidney cancer initiated a major shift in risk categorization and now include emerging treatments in the neoadjuvant setting. Updates of European Association of Urology clinical guidelines also include   inhibition as the first-line treatment. Randomized trials have demonstrated a survival benefit for ipilimumab and nivolumab combination in the intermediate and poor-risk group, while pembrolizumab plus axitinib combination is recommended not only for unfavorable disease but also for patients who fit the favorable risk category. Currently vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), sunitinib and pazopanib is the alternative regimen for patients who cannot tolerate   inhibitors (ICI). Cabozantinib remains a valid alternative option for the intermediate and high-risk group. For previously treated patients with TKI with progression, nivolumab, cabozantinib, axitinib, or the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab appear the most plausible alternatives. For patients previously treated with ICI, any VEGF-targeted therapy, not previously used in combination with ICI therapy, seems to be a valid option, although the strength of this recommendation is weak. The indication for cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) is also changing. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy does not add perioperative morbidity and can help identify non-responders, avoiding unnecessary surgery. However, the role of CN should be investigated under the light of new immunotherapeutic interventions. Also, markers of response to ICI need to be identified before the optimal selection of therapy could be determined for a particular patient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31345267>A phase I study of the PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, in combination with a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, and a VEGFR1-3 inhibitor, cediranib, in recurrent women's cancers with biomarker analyses.</a></h1><p>Strategies to improve activity of   inhibitors are needed. We hypothesized enhanced DNA damage by olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, and reduced VEGF signaling by cediranib, a VEGFR1-3 inhibitor, would complement anti-tumor activity of durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, and the 3-drug combination would be tolerable.This phase 1 study tested the 3-drug combination in a 3 + 3 dose escalation. Cediranib was taken intermittently ( days on/2 days off) at 15 or 20 mg (dose levels 1 and 2, respectively) with durvalumab 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks, and olaparib tablets 300 mg twice daily. The primary end point was the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Response rate, pharmacokinetic (PK), and correlative analyses were secondary endpoints.Nine patients (7 ovarian/1 endometrial/1 triple negative breast cancers, median 3 prior therapies [2-6]) were treated. Grade 3/4 adverse events include hypertension (1/9), anemia (1/9) and lymphopenia (3/9). No patients experienced dose limiting toxicities. The RP2D is cediranib, 20 mg ( days on/2 days off) with full doses of durvalumab and olaparib. Four patients had partial responses (44%) and 3 had stable disease lasting ≥6 months, yielding a 67% clinical benefit rate. No significant effects on olaparib or cediranib PK parameters from the presence of durvalumab, or the co-administration of cediranib or olaparib were identified. Tumoral PD-L1 expression correlated with clinical benefit but cytokines and peripheral  subsets did not.The RP2D is tolerable and has preliminary activity in recurrent women's cancers.

CRCs greatly benefit from this testing as approximately 15% of them are dMMR but only 3% to % are at a metastatic stage. MMR status can be determined by two different methods, microsatellite instability (MSI) testing on tumor DNA, and immunohistochemistry of the MMR proteins on tumor tissue. Recent studies have reported a rate of 3% to 10% of discordance between these two tests. Moreover, some reports suggest possible intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of MMR and MSI status. These issues are important to know and to clarify in order to define therapeutic strategy in CRC. This review aims to detail the standard techniques used for the determination of MMR and MSI status, along with their advantages and limits. We review the discordances that may arise between these two tests, tumor heterogeneity of MMR and MSI status, and possible explanations.

Here, we demonstrate that immunotherapy with anti-CTLA-4 and its combination with anti-PD-1 rely on tumor -intrinsic activation of the cytosolic RNA receptor RIG-I. Mechanistically, tumor -intrinsic RIG-I signaling induced caspase-3-mediated tumor  death, cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigen by CD103 dendritic cells, subsequent expansion of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and their accumulation within the tumor tissue. Consistently, therapeutic targeting of RIG-I with '- triphosphorylated RNA in both tumor and nonmalignant host cells potently augmented the efficacy of CTLA-4  blockade in several preclinical cancer models. In humans, transcriptome analysis of primary melanoma samples revealed a strong association between high expression of  (the gene encoding RIG-I), T  receptor and antigen presentation pathway activity, and prolonged overall survival. Moreover, in patients with melanoma treated with anti-CTLA-4  blockade, high  RIG-I transcriptional activity significantly associated with durable clinical responses. Our data thus identify activation of RIG-I signaling in tumors and their microenvironment as a crucial component for  inhibitor-mediated immunotherapy of cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Cisplatin-ineligible patients experience a high frequency of adverse events from the most commonly used standard of care treatment, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, or alternative treatment with gemcitabine monotherapy. Pembrolizumab is a potent, highly selective humanised monoclonal antibody that releases  inhibition of the  response system, and provides a new alternative for these patients.To assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of urothelial carcinoma ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy in patients with strongly PD-L1-positive tumours in Sweden.Parametric survival curves were fitted to overall survival, progression-free survival, and time on treatment data from KEYNOTE-052 to extrapolate clinical outcomes. A simulated treatment comparison and a network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the comparative efficacy of pembrolizumab versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy. EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE-052 were used to estimate utility, while resource use and cost inputs were estimated using Swedish regional pricing lists and clinician opinion.The model reported costs, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and results were tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.We estimated that pembrolizumab would improve survival by 2.11 and 2.16 years and increase QALYs by 1.71 and 1.75 compared to carboplatin plus gemcitabine and gemcitabine monotherapy, respectively. Pembrolizumab was associated with a cost increase of €90520 versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and €95055 versus gemcitabine, with corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of €53055/QALY and €54415/QALY.At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €100000/QALY, pembrolizumab is a cost-effective treatment versus carboplatin plus gemcitabine and versus gemcitabine.This is the first analysis to show that pembrolizumab is a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in Sweden.Copyright © 2018 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp and The Authors.

It is well-known that tumor microenvironment plays a key role in the efficacy of various immunotherapies such as DC vaccine. Accordingly, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on DCs, which interacts with PD-1 on T cells, leads to inhibition of anti-tumor responses following presentation of tumor antigens by DCs to T cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that down-regulation of PD-L1 in DCs in association with silencing of PD-1 on T cells may lead to the enhancement of T- priming by DCs to have efficient anti-tumor T- responses. In this study, we silenced the expression of PD-L1 in DCs and programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) in T cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) -loaded chitosan-dextran sulfate nanoparticles (NPs) and evaluated the DC phenotypic and functional characteristics and T- functions following tumor antigen recognition on DCs, ex vivo. Our results showed that synthesized NPs had good physicochemical characteristics (size 77· nm and zeta potential of 14·3) that were associated with efficient cellular uptake and target gene silencing. Moreover, PD-L1 silencing was associated with stimulatory characteristics of DCs. On the other hand, presentation of tumor antigens by PD-L1-negative DCs to PD-1-silenced T cells led to induction of potent T- responses. Our findings imply that PD-L1-silenced DCs can be considered as a potent immunotherapeutic approach in combination with PD-1-siRNA loaded NPs, however; further in vivo investigation is required in animal models.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439556>Combined radio-immunotherapy leads to complete clinical regression of stage IV Merkel  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Merkel  carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine tumour of the skin.

We report the first combined analysis using RNA sequencing, whole-exome sequencing (WES), and flow cytometry of multiple tumor specimens over a -yr period for a patient undergoing anti-PD-L1 therapy. Initial sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy was associated with conversion to a basal molecular subtype and a rising tumor mutational burden. We found that as the tumor became more resistant to anti-PD-L1, the proportion of regulatory T cells and CD8 T cells expressing alternative   including CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 increased. This suggests that alternative   upregulation may be one form of anti-PD-L1 resistance in urothelial carcinoma. These data support the concept of combined   blockade for urothelial carcinoma, a concept that is being evaluated in prospective clinical trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study we characterized how a patient with metastatic urothelial cancer became resistant to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. By tracking changes in protein and gene expression over time, we found that as urothelial carcinoma becomes resistant to PD-L1 blockade, additional   may be upregulated. These data support the concept of combined  blockade for urothelial carcinoma.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recently,  inhibitors have been approved for use in MMR-deficient cancers of any type (Prasad et al. in JAMA Oncol 4:157-158, 2018). Functional studies in breast cancer have shown associations between MMR loss, resistance to aromatase inhibitors and sensitivity to palbociclib (Haricharan et al. in Cancer Discov 7:1168-1183, 2017). Herein, we investigate the clinical meaning of MMR deficiency in breast cancer by immunohistochemical assessment of MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 on a large series of breast cancers linked to detailed biomarker and long-term outcome data.Cases were classified as MMR intact when all four markers expressed nuclear reactivity, but MMR-deficient when at least one of the four biomarkers displayed loss of nuclear staining in the presence of positive internal stromal controls on the tissue microarray core.Among the 1635 cases with interpretable staining, we identified 31 (1.9%) as MMR-deficient. In our cohort, MMR deficiency was present across all major breast cancer subtypes, and was associated with high-grade, low-progesterone receptor expression and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte counts. MMR deficiency is significantly associated with inferior overall (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.02-.17, p = 0.040) and disease-specific survival (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.00-7.35, p = 0.042) in the 431 estrogen receptor-positive patients who were uniformly treated with tamoxifen as their sole adjuvant systemic therapy.Overall, this study supports the concept that breast cancer patients with MMR deficiency as assessed by immunohistochemistry may be good candidates for alternative treatment approaches such as   or CDK4 inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477413>The Future of Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Cancer.</a></h1><p>To discuss future direction and present an overview of the evolution of immunotherapy long-term toxicity issues, financial toxicity, and new emerging survivorship considerations.Peer-reviewed manuscripts, Web sites.Cancer treatments involving immunotherapy have had a major impact on long-term survival, toxicity, and survivorship issues.Nurses play a pivotal role in the care of the cancer patient across the continuum.

We examined whether this ligand is a prognostic marker for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and whether it is associated with accumulation of  cells in the tumor. Serum s-CD95L levels in 51 patients with advanced ovarian cancer were tested by ELISA. IHC staining of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD163, CD31, FoxP3, CCR6, IL-17, Granzyme B, PD-L1, and membrane CD95L was used to assess tumor-infiltrating  cells. Although the intensity of CD3, CD8, CD4, CD20, and CD163 in tumor tissues remained constant regardless of membrane CD95L expression, tumors in patients with HGSOC with s-CD95L levels ≥516 pg/mL showed increased infiltration by CD3 T cells ( = 0.001), comprising both cytotoxic CD8 ( = 0.01) and CD4 ( = 0.0062) cells including FoxP3 regulatory T cells ( = 0.0044). Also, the number of tumor-infiltrating CD20 B cells ( = 0.0094) increased in these patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that low s-CD95L concentrations [<516 pg/mL, HR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-11.11), and <1,200 activated CD8 (Granzyme B) cells (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.16-.95) were independent poor prognostic factors for recurrence, whereas >6,000 CD3 cells (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.79) was a good prognostic factor. Thus, low levels of s-CD95L (<516 pg/mL) are correlated with lower numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3 and CD8, and also CD4 and FoxP3 T cells) in advanced HGSOC and are a poor prognostic marker. IMPLICATIONS: Serum s-CD95L is correlated with a number of tumor-infiltrating  cells in HGSOC and could be used as a noninvasive marker of tumor  infiltration to select patients referred for immunotherapy trials that evaluate  inhibitor treatment.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561846>  Inhibitors in Lung Cancer and Melanoma.</a></h1><p>To provide a synopsis of   inhibition in solid tumors with a focus on lung cancer and melanoma for the oncology nurse.A literature search was conducted from 2012 to the present using key search terms including: ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab,   inhibitor, NSCLC or SCLC, melanoma, incidence, toxicity, and -related adverse events (irAEs).  inhibition has caused a pivotal shift in the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer. Additionally, it has supported the use of immunotherapy as a modality and pillar of cancer treatment. The interdisciplinary team plays an integral role in facilitating patients' understanding of their treatment modality, symptom management, and guidance through their cancer journey. As more research continues in various tumor types to understand how -modulated agents can impact tumor burden, disease control, and quality of life, it is hoped that more patients will have access to these therapies.Patient safety is paramount and nurses are aligned to educate, assess, and guide patients during   inhibitor therapy.

In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of   inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30. days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.). The median progression-free survival was 7. months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached) in the irAE group and 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.17, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of metastatic sites ≥2 (HR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.54), high ALP level (HR = 2.50; 95% CI, 1.27 to 4.54), and absence of irAEs (HR = 9.54, 95% CI, 3.34 to 27.30 for yes vs. no) were associated with a poor prognosis. The most frequent irAEs was diarrhea/colitis (n = ). Grade 3 adverse events were observed in 6 patients; hyperglycemia (n = 2), diarrhea/colitis (n = 1), adrenal insufficiency (n = 1), aspartate aminotransferase increased (n = 1), peripheral motor neuropathy (n = 1). There were no grade 4 or  adverse events related to nivolumab.Development of irAEs was associated with clinical benefit for AGC patients receiving nivolumab monotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362898>Effectiveness of First-line   Blockade Versus Carboplatin-based Chemotherapy for Metastatic Urothelial Cancer.</a></h1><p>Limited data compare first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy and   blockade in cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) patients. The primary evidence guiding treatment decisions was a recent Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency safety alert based on emerging data from two ongoing phase III trials, reporting shorter survival in programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative patients receiving immunotherapy. Final results from these trials are unknown.To compare survival in cisplatin-ineligible mUC patients receiving first-line immunotherapy versus those receiving carboplatin-based chemotherapy.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2017 mUC patients receiving first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy (n = 1530) or immunotherapy (n = 487) from January 1, 2011 to May 18, 2018 using the Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived database.The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), comparing 12- and 36-mo OS, and hazard ratios before and after 12 mo. Propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to address confounding in Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model estimates of comparative effectiveness.IPTW-adjusted OS rates in the immunotherapy group were lower at 12 mo (39.6% [95% confidence interval {CI} 34.0-45.3%] vs 46.1% [95% CI 43.4-48.8%]) but higher at 36 mo (28.3% [95% CI 21.8-34.7%] vs 13.3% [95% CI 11.1-15.%]) relative to the chemotherapy group. Immunotherapy treatment demonstrated inferior OS during the first 12 mo relative to carboplatin-based chemotherapy (IPTW-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.62), but superior OS beyond 12 mo (IPTW-adjusted HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.85). Limitations include retrospective design and potential unmeasured confounding.In the setting of mUC, clinicians and patients should carefully consider how to balance the short-term benefit of chemotherapy against the long-term benefit of immunotherapy.To determine the optimal first-line therapy for metastatic bladder cancer patients who are unfit for cisplatin, we compared carboplatin-based chemotherapy versus immunotherapy using real-world data. Survival in the 1st year of treatment was lower with immunotherapy relative to chemotherapy, but for patients surviving beyond the 1st year, immunotherapy was superior.Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology.

Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a predictive biomarker for patients treated with ICIs. Here, we evaluated the predictive power of TMB measured by the Oncomine™ Tumor Mutational Load targeted sequencing assay in 76 NSCLC patients treated with ICIs. TMB was assessed retrospectively in 76 NSCLC patients receiving ICI therapy. Clinical data (RECIST 1.1) were collected and patients were classified as having either durable clinical benefit (DCB) or no durable benefit (NDB). Additionally, genetic alterations and PD-L1 expression were assessed and compared with TMB and response rate. TMB was significantly higher in patients with DCB than in patients with NDB (median TMB = 8. versus 6.0 mutations/Mb, Mann-Whitney p = 0.0244). 64% of patients with high TMB (cut-off = third tertile, TMB ≥ 9) were responders (DCB) compared to 33% and 29% of patients with intermediate and low TMB, respectively (cut-off = second and first tertile, TMB = -9 and TMB ≤ 4, respectively). TMB-high patients showed significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (log-rank test p = 0.0014 for PFS and 0.0197 for OS). While identifying different subgroups of patients, combining PD-L1 expression and TMB increased the predictive power (from AUC 0.63 to AUC 0.65). Our results show that the TML panel is an effective tool to stratify patients for ICI treatment. A combination of biomarkers might maximize the predictive precision for patient stratification. Our study supports TMB evaluation through targeted NGS in NSCLC patient samples as a tool to predict response to ICI therapy. We offer recommendations for a reliable and cost-effective assessment of TMB in a routine diagnostic setting. © 2019 The Authors.

Overall survival in patients with non-small  lung cancer (2. vs 26 months, P < .001), melanoma (3.9 vs 14 months, P < .001), and other tumor types (1.1 vs 11, P < .001) was consistently worse in those who received pATBs vs those who did not. Multivariate analyses confirmed that pATB therapy (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9-6.1; P < .001) and response to ICI therapy (HR, 8.2; 95% CI, 4.0-16.9; P < .001) were associated with OS independent of tumor site, disease burden, and performance status.Despite being limited by sample size, geographic origin, and the lack of correlative analyses on patients' gut microbiota, this study suggests that pATB therapy but not cATB therapy is associated with a worse treatment response and OS in unselected patients treated with ICIs in routine clinical practice. Mechanistic studies are urgently required to investigate ATB-mediated alterations of gut microbiota as a determinant of poorer outcome following ICI treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378579>Immunogenomics of Metastatic Clear- Renal  Carcinoma: Remarkable Response to Nivolumab in a Patient With a Pathogenic Germ Line BRCA1 Mutation.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518968>Acute vascular events as a possibly related adverse event of immunotherapy: a single-institute retrospective study.</a></h1><p>-related toxicities of   inhibitors (CPIs) require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Atherosclerosis has an inflammatory component; we speculated this inflammation could be enhanced by CPIs. We aimed to evaluate the risk of acute vascular events (AVEs) on CPIs.Patients treated by CPIs in Sheba Medical Center (Israel) between January 2015 and May 2018 were retrospectively identified from electronic medical records. AVEs were identified and verified by chart review. Age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, previous AVE, renal failure, cancer type and specific treatments were evaluated as potential risk factors. AVE rate on CPIs was compared with that on chemotherapy or on combined chemo-immunotherapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Survival of patients with AVEs was compared with that of patients without AVEs.CPI was administered to 1215 patients. AVEs within six months after CPI initiation occurred in 2.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-3.6) of patients, more common than in later time periods. In lung adenocarcinoma, event rate was .2% (95% CI: 2.8-9.2). Lung adenocarcinoma, prior AVE, hypertension and dyslipidemia were correlated with AVEs. AVE rate in patients with non-small  lung cancer adenocarcinoma was similar whether on chemotherapy or on CPI. Survival of patients with AVEs was worse than that of those without AVEs.The similarly increased rates of AVEs for patients on CPI, on chemotherapy or on both suggest that although CPI may not augment the risk of AVE over that of chemotherapy, it carries a similar and significant risk of such adverse event. Caution should be exercised for patients with risk factors for AVEs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Pembrolizumab is used for non-small  lung carcinoma with high programmed  death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. It has been found that better overall survival can be obtained using pembrolizumab compared to the existing chemotherapy. We report a case of perforation of small intestinal metastasis after pembrolizumab treatment.A 62-year-old man was treated by pembrolizumab for PD-L1 highly expressed lung adenocarcinoma, with multiple metastasis (small intestinal, lymph nodes, and bone). The treatment was stopped owing to drug-induced pneumonitis. One month after drug withdrawal, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital with the complaint of severe stomachache. He had a rigid abdomen and generalized tenderness, and computed tomography scans showed free air within the abdomen. We diagnosed bowel perforation and performed emergency surgery. Surgical findings revealed multiple small intestine metastasis and mesenteric lymph node metastasis. Perforation was found in the metastatic site in the jejunum located around 40 cm anal to Treitz's ligament. This perforated part was resected, and functional end-to-end anastomosis was performed using linear staplers. The post-operative course was uneventful. Pathological examination revealed lung adenocarcinoma metastasis at the perforation site, and the effectiveness of pembrolizumab was grade 1b (Japanese Classification of the Colorectal Carcinoma, seventh edition).This is the first report of perforation of small intestinal metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma after pembrolizumab treatment.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics of this extremely rare disease. A total of 6 out of 2,093 patients with PMME treated in our institution between 1995 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed and their clinicopathological parameters including treatment course and long-term survival were investigated. The major clinicopathological characteristics of patients were that they were >70 years of age, male sex, dysphagia at first diagnosis, and macroscopic black protruding tumors located in the lower third of the thoracic esophagus. Four of the five patients receiving pretherapeutic endoscopic biopsy were correctly diagnosed with PMME, and two patients received preoperative treatment with ineffective histopathological responses. There were two unresectable cases, one was treated with an - inhibitor and the other received palliative care. Three of the four patients receiving curative surgery developed hematogenous recurrence within two years of surgery and only one patient with pT1aN0M0 achieved long-term survival. The median overall survival of all six patients was 19.6 (6.4-40.) months. Patients with stage I disease exhibited significantly more favorable prognoses than those with stage II-IV (P=0.025) and surgically-treated patients had significantly better prognoses than those who did not receive surgery (P=0.018). In conclusion, PMME was associated with highly malignant features and tended to develop hematogenous metastases even after radical resection.

Intrinsic molecular genetics, cancer characteristics, and breast tissue  responses in diverse metastases to the breast have not been previously studied. We identified 64 patients with cancers metastatic to the breast: 51 carcinomas and 13 melanomas. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), steroid receptors, and HER2/neu expressions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Gene sequencing, copy number alterations, microsatellite instability, and tumor mutational burden were performed using next-generation sequencing platforms. The 3 most common primary sites for metastatic carcinomas were lung (37%), ovary (29%), and fallopian tubes/peritoneum (14%). TP53 mutations were commonly (50%) observed among the carcinoma cases, while other mutations were characteristic for the primary cancers (VHL in renal, BRCA1 in the fallopian tube, and BRAF in melanomas). High tumor mutational burden was detected in /14 carcinomas and 3/7 melanomas. Tumor  PD-L1 expression was detected in 6 carcinomas, but not in any of the melanomas, whereas  cells' expression of PD-L1 was seen in 17 carcinomas and 6 melanomas. Estrogen receptor status was positive in 13/49 carcinomas including 12 adenocarcinomas originating from the ovary and fallopian tube or peritoneum and 1 duodenal neuroendocrine carcinoma. No carcinoma was HER2/neu positive. Intrinsic genetic characteristics of the metastases to the breast followed the pattern commonly seen in primary tumors.

Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway inflammation prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of -related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (.35%); 50% were grade 2 and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small- lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can provide additional information to standard diagnostic techniques and can identify therapeutic targets. A 32-yr-old male with xeroderma pigmentosum developed metastatic angiosarcoma that was unresponsive to three lines of conventional sarcoma therapies. WGS was performed on his primary cancer revealing a hypermutated tumor, including clonal ultraviolet radiation-induced mutational patterns (Signature 7) and subclonal signatures of mutated DNA polymerase epsilon () (Signature 10). These signatures are associated with response to   blockade. Immunohistochemistry confirmed high PD-L1 expression in metastatic deposits. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab was commenced off-label given the  mutation and high mutational load. After four cycles, there was a significant reduction in his disease with almost complete resolution of the metastatic deposits. This case highlights the importance of WGS in the analysis, interpretation, and treatment of cancers. We anticipate that as WGS becomes integral to the cancer diagnostic pathway, treatments will be stratified to the individual based on their unique genomic and/or transcriptomic profile, enhancing classical approaches of histologically driven treatment decisions.© 2019 Momen et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582259>Current concepts of non-coding RNA regulation of   in cancer.</a></h1><p>The discovery of   molecules as important regulators of  responses in healthy individuals as well as  escape of malignant tumours has led to profound changes in understanding, research and treatment of human cancer.

These advances come with a significant caveat: most of the world population does not have access to their benefits, because the yearly cost of a novel anticancer medication can routinely exceed $100,000. There is a large amount of data showing that  inhibitors have significant activity at doses much lower than those currently approved. We review the evidence for reduced drug dosing as a strategy to increase the number of patients who can be treated and what would be needed to further validate this approach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343662>Prognostic Value of the Lung  Prognostic Index for Patients Treated for Metastatic Non-Small  Lung Cancer.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have suggested the importance of the baseline derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level as prognostic markers. The lung  prognostic index (LIPI) was shown to be associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer (mNSCLC) treated with   inhibitors (ICIs) but not cytotoxic chemotherapy (CCT).To determine whether the LIPI is associated with long-term outcomes in pooled analyses of clinical studies of ICI and targeted therapy (TT) for patients with mNSCLC.An exploratory pooled analysis was performed of the LIPI on data from 11 randomized clinical multinational trials evaluating ICIs and TT submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, for 4914 patients with mNSCLC. Lung  prognostic index scores were calculated based on the dNLR and the LDH level per previous publications to generate good, intermediate, and poor composite scores. Multivariable Cox proportional PFS and OS hazard ratios were generated for the dNLR, the LDH level, age, smoking status, histologic characteristics, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score.Overall survival and PFS and their association with good, intermediate, or poor prognostic LIPI scores.Eleven mNSCLC randomized trials were analyzed, including 3987 patients with available data. In  ICI trials comprising 2440 patients, 1368 patients received ICIs and 1072 patients received CCT. In 6 TT trials comprising 1547 patients, 1110 patients received TT and 437 patients received CCT. A good LIPI score was associated with better OS among patients receiving ICIs (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.28-0.42), TT (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21-0.37), and CCT (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.40-0.60 in ICI trials; hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.61 in TT trials) than those with poor LIPI scores. Similar findings were observed in terms of PFS (ICIs: hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.48-0.72; TT: hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37-0.57; and CCT: hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45-0.68 in ICI trials; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.69 in TT trials).The baseline LDH level and dNLR are important prognostic biomarkers irrespective of treatment modality for patients with mNSCLC. As further prospective clinical trial information is collected, the role of the LIPI score can be better defined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634190>  inhibitors in people living with HIV: what about anti-HIV effects?</a></h1><p>:   inhibitors (ICPi) have shown major therapeutic successes when used in various cancers. In the HIV field a double benefit of such ICPi should result from their dual ability to restore in-vitro HIV-specific CD8 T- functions and to enhance HIV production from reservoir cells, thus fulfilling the goals of the 'shock and kill' concept proposed as an HIV cure therapeutic strategy.We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting the tolerance profile of ICPi and their effects on HIV plasma loads (pVL), CD4 count, HIV reservoirs (-associated HIV-DNA) and/or HIV-specific CD8 T in PLWH.Thirty-four articles were included for a total 176 participants. 12.1% participants experienced severe adverse events and 49.4% nonsevere adverse events. pVL remained stable in 91.9% participant, showed increases in .8% participant, and decreases in 2.3%. CD4 count remained stable in 60.7% participants, showed increases in 24.6%, and decreases in 14.7%. Regarding ICPi effects on HIV-DNA and HIV-specific immunity, we identified three distinct profiles: profile I, transient pVL increases followed by a boost in HIV-specific CD8 T cells concomitant to a decrease in HIV-DNA, reported in one participant. Profile II: increase in HIV-specific CD8 T cells without changes in pVL or HIV-DNA, reported in three participants. III: no effect, reported in five participants.In conclusion, the clinical, virological and immunological safety profiles of ICPi reported in about 200 PLWH appear to be favorable but their still modest results in terms of HIV cure strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652572>Screening a Broad Range of Solid and Haematological Tumour Types for CD70 Expression Using a Uniform IHC Methodology as Potential Patient Stratification Method.</a></h1><p>The constitutive expression of CD70 has been described in various haematological and solid tumour types. In addition, the co-expression of its receptor in tumours has been demonstrated, mediating tumour  proliferation. Although CD70 expression is a prerequisite to enrol patients in solid tumour clinical trials using anti-CD70 immunotherapy, there is currently no standardised test to evaluate CD70 expression. These differences in immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols make it challenging to compare the expression levels that were obtained in different studies, pointing out the need for one uniform methodology. In this retrospective study, over 600 tumour samples from different solid and haematological malignancies were analysed while using one validated IHC method. CD70 and CD27 expression was demonstrated in a broad range of tumour types. In solid tumours, 43% demonstrated CD70 positivity with the highest degree in renal  carcinoma (79.%). Kaposi sarcoma showed no CD70 expression on the tumour cells. In lymphoma samples, 58% demonstrated CD70 positivity. Moreover, the co-expression of CD70 and CD27 was observed in 39% of lymphoma samples. These findings highlight the need to further explore anti-CD70 therapies in a broad range of CD70 expressing tumour types and in doing so, implementing one standardised protocol to define CD70 overexpression to use it as a diagnostic tool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601857>Fucosylated α-acid glycoprotein as a biomarker to predict prognosis following tumor immunotherapy of patients with lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Immunotherapy targeting   molecules has provided remarkable clinical benefits in cancer patients but no clinically relevant biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes exists. Recently, we demonstrated that glycan structures of serum α-acid glycoprotein (AGP) changed dramatically in cancer patients and that α1,3fucosylated AGP (fAGP) levels increased along with disease progression and decreased responding to chemotherapy treatments. Here, the fAGP was analyzed in sera prospectively obtained from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer who underwent immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab. Twenty-three patients had significantly high fAGP levels above the cut-off value (H-fAGP) at one month after starting the treatment and 20 patients in this group, whose tumor sizes did not decrease, maintained high fAGP levels continuously and subsequently died. However, the other 16 patients, whose fAGP levels decreased or maintained below the cut-off value (L-fAGP), survived during a 2-year observation even though  patients in this group had no tumor shrinkage. Accordingly, the overall survival rate was found to significantly correlate with the fAGP level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the H-fAGP was an independent risk factor for cancer progression. Therefore, the fAGP level appeared to be a reliable biomarker for predicting clinical efficacy of immunotherapy with nivolumab.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352593>Clinical immunology and immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: current progress and challenges.</a></h1><p>At the time of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis, patients are most often at an advanced stage; however, the current treatment regimens remain unsatisfactory. Thus, novel and more powerful therapeutic approaches for advanced HCC are urgently required. Exacerbation of immunotolerant signals and/or escaping immunosurveillance leads to the development of HCC, which appears to be a rational reason to use immunotherapy to restore anticancer immunity. Several novel immunotherapeutic methods, including the use of   inhibitors, new types of   adoption [e.g., chimeric antigen receptor T  (CAR-T), TCR gene-modified T cells and stem cells], and microRNAs have been used in clinical trials for the treatment of HCC. However, some crucial issues remain to be addressed for such novel immunotherapy techniques. Finally, immunotherapy is now standing on the threshold of great advances in the fight against HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514992>Acute and Long-term Adverse Events Associated With  Blockade.</a></h1><p>To provide an overview of the spectrum of -related adverse events associated with   therapy, including presentation, evaluation, management, and nursing considerations.Peer-reviewed articles, published literature, national guidelines, Internet.  inhibitor therapies are have become a therapeutic treatment options for many cancers. These therapies promote activity of a patient's adaptive  system to eradicate cancer. The agents are associated with a unique side-effect profile called -related adverse events. Most of these are low severity. However, if they become more severe, they can be life-threatening or result in permanent organ dysfunction. The key to optimizing therapies is collaborative monitoring, evaluation, documentation, management, communication.Oncology nurses are the front line of patient care. Nurses must have a thorough understanding of the mechanism of action, potential -related adverse events, clinical implications, and management strategies. They are responsible for educating patients about   therapies and the potential side effects that may develop, triage management strategies, and coordination of care.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Antibiotic therapy,especially that with anaerobic activity, has profound effects on the gut microbiome. Therefore, we sought to assess the effect of antibiotics on the development of IMDC.Patients who received ICI therapy from January 2016 to January 2018 were examined retrospectively. A Cox regression model was used to assess factors associated with overall survival.A total of 826 patients were included. Of these patients, 51.6% received inhibitors of programmed  death protein-1 or its ligand, 32.0% received inhibitors of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and 16.% received a combination of the two. IMDC occurred in 52.% of the patients after a median of 8 weeks. Overall, 569 patients (68.9%) received antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic use at any time was associated with reduced IMDC occurrence and recurrence rates but also with frequent hospitalization and intensive care unit admission for IMDC as well as increased IMDC severity. Compared with patients who received antibiotic therapy only before ICI therapy initiation, those receiving it after ICI had a higher IMDC rate and more often needed immunosuppressive therapy and hospitalization for IMDC. Antibiotics with anaerobic activity were included in 51% of the antibiotic therapy regimens and were associated with increased immunosuppressant use, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission for IMDC, and severe IMDC grades. Forty-one patients received empiric prophylactic antibiotic therapy at IMDC onset. These patients more often needed immunosuppressive therapy, intravenous steroids, and infliximab/vedolizumab; had more frequent and longer hospitalization for IMDC and higher IMDC grades; and more frequently had IMDC recurrence than did patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy at the time of IMDC symptom onset.Whereas antibiotic therapy appeared to be protective against IMDC onset, use of antibiotics, especially those with anaerobic activity, after ICI therapy was associated with increased risk of severe IMDC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516997>Talimogene laherparepvec induces durable response of regionally advanced Merkel  carcinoma in 4 consecutive patients.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555448>Proposed diagnostic and treatment paradigm for high-grade neurological complications of   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors such as antibodies to cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (ipilimumab) and programmed -death 1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) molecules have been used in non-small  lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and renal- carcinoma, among others. With these agents, -related adverse events (irAEs) can occur, including those affecting the neurological axis. In this review, high-grade neurological irAEs associated with   inhibitors including cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and myasthenia gravis (MG) are analyzed. Based on current literature and experience at our institution with 4 cases of high-grade neurological irAEs associated with   inhibitors (2 cases of GBS, 1 case of meningo-radiculitis, and 1 case of myelitis), we propose an algorithm for the investigation and treatment of high-grade neurological irAEs. Our algorithm incorporates both peripheral nervous system (meningo-radiculitis, GBS, MG) and central nervous system presentations (myelitis, encephalopathy). It is anticipated that our algorithm will be useful both to oncologists and neurologists who are likely to encounter neurological irAEs more frequently in the future as   inhibitors become more widely used.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600397>Assessment of Combined Nivolumab and Bevacizumab in Relapsed Ovarian Cancer: A Phase 2 Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>To date, single-agent programmed  death 1 protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)   blockade has shown limited activity in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Combination strategies of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition with antiangiogenic therapy have the potential for synergistic activity through modulation of the microenvironment and represent a potential therapeutic opportunity in this disease.To evaluate the activity of combined nivolumab and bevacizumab in women with relapsed ovarian cancer.A single-arm, phase 2 study enrolled patients between February 8, 2017, and December 29, 2017, at 2 sites in the United States; the primary data analysis was completed July 27, 2018. Thirty-eight women with relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer were enrolled in this study. Participants had disease recurrence within 12 months of their last platinum-based therapy and had received between 1 and 3 lines of prior therapy.Participants received intravenous nivolumab and intravenous bevacizumab once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Secondary end points included evaluation of the ORR by platinum sensitivity, assessment of progression-free survival, assessment of safety data, and investigation of the association of tumor PD-L1 with response to therapy.Of the 38 women enrolled, 18 had platinum-resistant and 20 had platinum-sensitive disease; mean (SD) age was 63.0 (9.1) years. Eleven patients experienced a confirmed response to nivolumab with bevacizumab (ORR, 28.9%; 95% exact binomial CI, 15.4%-45.9%), with 1 additional unconfirmed response. The ORR was 40.0% (19.1%-64.0%) in platinum-sensitive and 16.7% (95% CI 3.6%-41.4%) in platinum-resistant participants. Thirty-four participants (89.%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related adverse event; 9 participants (23.7%) experienced a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event. Median progression-free survival was 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.3-14.7 months). In 36 histologic samples for which PD-L1 testing could be performed, 22 samples (61.1%) had a PD-L1 tumoral percentage less than 1, and 14 samples (38.9%) had a PD-L1 tumoral percentage of 1 or greater. Ten responses occurred in patients with PD-L1 tumor percentage less than 1, and 2 in patients with PD-L1 tumor percentages of 1 or greater.The nivolumab with bevacizumab combination appeared to show activity in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, with greater activity in the platinum-sensitive setting. Alternative combinational strategies may be necessary in the platinum-resistant setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454018>Systemic Therapy for Locally Advanced and Metastatic Non-Small  Lung Cancer: A Review.</a></h1><p>Non-small  lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Until the last decade, the -year overall survival rate for patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer was less than %. Improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer has resulted in the development of new biomarker-targeted therapies and led to improvements in overall survival for patients with advanced or metastatic disease.Systemic therapy for metastatic non-small  lung cancer is selected according to the presence of specific biomarkers. Therefore, all patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer should undergo molecular testing for relevant mutations and expression of the protein PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1). Molecular alterations that predict response to treatment (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and BRAF V600E mutations) are present in approximately 30% of patients with non-small  lung cancer. Targeted therapy for these alterations improves progression-free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. For example, somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene are present in approximately 20% of patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib improve progression-free survival in patients with susceptible EGFR mutations. In patients with overexpression of ALK protein, the response rate was significantly better with crizotinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) than with the combination of pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-based chemotherapy) (74% vs 45%, respectively; P < .001) and progression-free survival (median, 10.9 months vs 7.0 months; P < .001). Subsequent generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have improved these agents. For patients without biomarkers indicating susceptibility to specific targeted treatments,   inhibitor-containing regimens either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are superior vs chemotherapy alone. These advances in biomarker-directed therapy have led to improvements in overall survival. For example, the -year overall survival rate currently exceeds 25% among patients whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of ≥50%) and 40% among patients with ALK-positive tumors.Improved understanding of the biology and molecular subtypes of non-small  lung cancer have led to more biomarker-directed therapies for patients with metastatic disease. These biomarker-directed therapies and newer empirical treatment regimens have improved overall survival for patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533297>Immunotherapy for Uterine Cervical Cancer.</a></h1><p>Cervical cancer is a malignant neoplastic disease that is the fourth most commonly occurring cancer in women worldwide. Since the introduction of angiogenesis inhibitors, treatments for recurrent and advanced cervical cancers have improved significantly in the past five years. However, the median overall survival in advanced cervical cancer is 16.8 months, with a -year overall survival rate of 68% for all stages, indicating that the effects of the treatment are still unsatisfactory. The development of a new treatment method is therefore imperative. Recently, in the clinical oncology field, remarkable progress has been made in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is already established as standard therapy in some fields and in some types of cancers, and its clinical role in all areas, including the gynecology field, will change further based on the outcomes of currently ongoing clinical trials.

Poly(l-glutamic acid)-combretastatin A4 conjugate (PLG-CA4) is a novel class of VDAs. Though it has notable antitumor activity, it can induce host  responses that promote tumor growth. Here, PLG-CA4 induces the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the M2-like phenotype in 4T1 metastatic breast cancer (Control 30% vs PLG-CA4 53%;  < 0.05). Compared to the monotherapy of PLG-CA4, inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) attenuates the immunosuppressive effect of PLG-CA4 treatment by decreasing the number of M2-like TAMs (2.0 × 10 to 1. × 10 per tumor) and potential enhancement of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (3.0 × 10 to .7 × 10 per tumor). Importantly, PI3Kγ inhibitor synergizing with PLG-CA4 significantly extends the mean survival time from 52 days in monotherapy-treated mice to 61.8 days. Additionally, the combination of PLG-CA4 and PI3Kγ inhibitor improves the tumor therapeutic effect of NLG919, an inhibitor of   indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As far as it is known, this is the first demonstrated study that VDAs induce the reshaping of macrophages to the M2-like phenotype. The findings also indicate a potential therapeutic strategy of the combination VDAs with an accurate  modifier in the tumor to reverse the  resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576495>Safety and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with preexisting antinuclear antibodies.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) show promising clinical activity in advanced cancers. However, the safety and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with preexisting antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are unclear.191 patients treated with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, or durvalumab for unresectable advanced cancers between September 2014 and December 2018 were identified retrospectively. Patients were divided into positive (ANA titers ≥ 1:160) and negative ANA groups (ANA titers < 1:160). Development of -related adverse events (irAEs), the overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) were monitored.Positive ANA titers were seen in 9 out of 191 patients. Four patients in the positive ANA group and 69 patients in the negative group developed irAEs of any grade without a significant difference between the groups. The development of endocrine, pulmonary, and cutaneous irAEs was not significant, whereas positive ANA was significantly higher in patients who developed colitis (2/9) than in patients who did not (3/182, P = 0.0002). DCR in the positive and negative ANA group was 37.% and 67.%, respectively, and was not statistically significant, but had better efficacy in patients without ANA (P = 0.08). ANA-related autoimmune diseases such as SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, MCTD, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis was not induced in either group. However, one patient with preexisting dermatomyositis had a flare up after initiation of atezolizumab.Further studies to identify predictive factors for the development of irAEs are required to provide relevant patient care and maximize the therapeutic benefits of ICIs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438923>Nintedanib allows retreatment with atezolizumab of combined non-small  lung cancer/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after atezolizumab-induced pneumonitis: a case report.</a></h1><p>Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that efficiently slows the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and has an acceptable tolerability profile. In contrast,   inhibitors (ICIs) such as programmed death 1 and programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors have shown clinical activity and marked efficacy in the treatment of non-small  lung cancer. However, it is unclear whether nintedanib reduces the risk of ICI-induced pneumonitis in IPF.A 78-year-old man with squamous  lung carcinoma in IPF underwent second-line treatment with pembrolizumab. He was diagnosed as having pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis after two cycles. He was administered prednisolone (PSL) and then improved immediately. Thereafter, his lung cancer lesion enlarged despite treatment with TS-1. Atezolizumab was then administered as 4th-line chemotherapy, but he immediately developed atezolizumab-induced pneumonitis after 1 . The re-escalated dosage of PSL improved the pneumonitis, and then nintedanib was started as additional therapy. Under careful observation with nintedanib, atezolizumab was re-administered on day 1 of an every-21-day . After three cycles, it remained stable without exacerbation of drug-induced pneumonitis.This case indicates the possibility that the addition of nintedanib to ICI therapy might prevent drug-induced pneumonitis or acute exacerbation of IPF. However, whether anti-fibrotic agents such as nintedanib are actually effective in preventing ICI-induced pneumonitis in ILD remains unknown and additional research is greatly needed to identify effective therapies for ILD combined with lung cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361166>Pseudoprogression: an indicator for cure in combined immunotherapy?</a></h1><p>Pseudoprogression is a unique, uncommon phenomenon that often hints at good prognosis.

Preclinical studies suggest immunotherapy may enhance response to chemotherapy. We sought to evaluate the impact of ICIs on subsequent therapies and survival in recurrent OC.A retrospective review was conducted to identify women with recurrent OC who received ICI from 01/2013 to /2017 and ≥1 subsequent treatment. Treatment duration after ICI was calculated using time-to-event analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate overall survival (OS) from first treatment after ICI and to assess survival differences by clinical benefit from ICI, defined by long (≥24 weeks) versus short (<24 weeks) ICI treatment duration.Of 79 evaluable women identified, 66 (84%) had platinum-resistant OC. Median age at diagnosis was 57 years. Median time from diagnosis to ICI was 39.7 months, with median of 4 prior treatments (range, 1-12). Median number of treatments after ICI was 2 (range, 1-8). Median duration of first-line treatment after ICI was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.9-6.0) and declined with each subsequent line. The most common therapies after ICI were taxanes, platinum-based regimens, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Bevacizumab was used in 47 women (59%). Median OS after ICI was 18.3 months (95% CI, 11.8-22.7) and did not differ between long versus short ICI.In this heavily pretreated population of patients with recurrent OC, therapies after ICI resulted in promising survival, suggesting that ICI may improve efficacy of subsequent chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Severe colitis has been reported in approximately % of patients treated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, such as ipilimumab. Standard management for those with severe colitis includes administration of systemic corticosteroids with the reservation of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, such as infliximab, if there has been no improvement. Rarely, immunotherapy-induced colitis can become life-threatening and result in bowel perforation requiring surgical intervention. Yet, there are no specific recommendations for medical management following colectomy in these situations. In cases of severe colitis from Crohn's disease, postoperative treatment with infliximab has been found to be safe when administered shortly after intestinal resection. However, there remains limited data to support administration of infliximab following bowel perforation due to immunotherapy-induced colitis. Our case illustrates management of a severe adverse reaction to  inhibitor therapy and the need to further evaluate the role of infliximab postoperatively in patients who develop colitis complicated by bowel perforation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464670>Sicca/Sjögren's syndrome triggered by PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors. Data from the International ImmunoCancer Registry (ICIR).</a></h1><p>To analyse the worldwide occurrence of sicca/Sjögren's (SS) syndrome associated with the use of   inhibitors (ICI) in patients with cancer.The ImmunoCancer International Registry (ICIR) is a Big Data-Sharing multidisciplinary network composed by 40 specialists in Rheumatology, Internal Medicine, Immunology and Oncology from 18 countries focused on the clinical and basic research of the -related adverse events (irAEs) related to cancer immunotherapies. For this study, patients who were investigated for a clinical suspicion of SS after being exposed to ICI were included.We identified 26 patients (11 women and 15 men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 63.57 years). Underlying cancer included lung (n=12), renal (n=7), melanoma (n=4), and other (n=3) neoplasia. Cancer immunotherapies consisted of monotherapy (77%) and combined regimens (23%). In those patients receiving monotherapy, all patients were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab in 9, pembrolizumab in 7 and durvalumab in 4); no cases associated with CTLA-4 inhibitors were identified. The main SS-related features consisted of dry mouth in 25 (96%) patients, dry eye in 17 (65%), abnormal ocular tests in 10/16 (62%) and abnormal oral diagnostic tests in 12/14 (86%) patients. Minor salivary gland biopsy was carried out in 15 patients: histopathological findings consisted of mild chronic sialadenitis in 8 (53%) patients and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in the remaining 7 (47%); a focus score was measured in  of the 6 patients (mean of 1.8, range 1-4). Immunological markers included positive ANA in 13/25 (52%), anti-Ro/ SS-A in /25 (20%), RF in 2/22 (9%), anti-La/SS-B in 2/25 (8%), low C3/C4 levels in 1/17 (6%) and positive cryoglobulins in 1/10 (10%). Classification criteria for SS were fulfilled by 10 (62%) out of 16 patients in whom the two key classificatory features were carried out. Among the 26 patients, there were only 3 (11%) who presented exclusively with sicca syndrome without organ-specific autoimmune manifestations. Therapeutic management included measures directed to treat sicca symptoms and therapies against autoimmune-mediated manifestations (glucocorticoids in 42%, second/third-line therapies in 31%); therapeutic response for systemic features was observed in 8/11 (73%). No patient died due to autoimmune involvement.Patients with Sjögren's syndrome triggered by ICI display a very specific profile different from that reported in idiopathic primary SS, including more frequent occurrence in men, a higher mean age, a predominant immunonegative serological profile, and a notable development of organ-specific autoimmune involvement in spite of the poor immunological profile. The close association found between sicca/Sjögren's syndrome and primarily PD-1 blockade requires further specific investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593039>The Programmed Death Pathway in Ocular Adnexal Sebaceous Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Sebaceous carcinoma can be highly malignant and difficult to treat. Surgical excision followed by periocular reconstruction is the primary method of treatment. In aggressive cases, radiation, topical chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy have been explored as adjuvant therapy. Immunotherapy, through   inhibitors, has proven to have significant antitumor effect in many cancer types, including melanoma, non-small  lung cancer, renal  carcinoma, and cutaneous squamous  carcinoma. Little is known about endogenous  response directed against sebaceous carcinoma. In this study, we aim to characterize the expression pattern of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 in both sebaceous carcinoma and in infiltrating  cells to explore the potential use of  blockade as therapy.We performed a retrospective chart and histology review of patients with sebaceous carcinoma between 1990 and 2017 at the University of Wisconsin. Tissue microarrays were made from paraffin blocks. Immunohistochemistry was performed for evaluation of tumor and   infiltration for expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Tumor or infiltrating  cells were considered positive if ≥% of cells had membranous ( surface) expression.Twenty-eight patients were included. PD-L1 and PD-1 were not significantly expressed on tumor cells; however, PD-L1 and PD-1 were expressed on infiltrating  cells in 46% and 25% of patients, respectively. In contrast, PD-L2 demonstrated positive expression on tumor cells in 46% of the cases along with positive expression on infiltrating  cells in 38% of the cases.Sebaceous carcinoma currently has few effective adjuvant treatment options. The expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 on infiltrating  cells and PD-L2 on tumor cells restrains T-cells from full activation and proliferation, therefore limiting the antitumor effect of T-cells, tipping the balance toward unopposed tumor progression. Consequently, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors may have a role in sebaceous carcinoma treatment. Given the prevalence of PD-L2 expression in sebaceous carcinoma and the lack of PD-L2 blockade therapy available, PD-1 blockade may provide benefit over PD-L1 inhibitors. PD-1 blockade in combination with current methods may be a viable therapeutic option for patients with sebaceous carcinoma and deserves further study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547532>Current Possibilities of Gynecologic Cancer Treatment with the Use of   Inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Despite the ongoing progress in cancer research, the global cancer burden has increased to 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Gynecological cancers, such as ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers, considerably contribute to global cancer burden, leading to $,862.6, $2,945.7, and $1,543.9 million of annual costs of cancer care, respectively. Thus, the development of effective therapies against gynecological cancers is still a largely unmet medical need. One of the novel therapeutic approaches is to induce anti-cancer immunity by the inhibition of the   pathways using monoclonal antibodies. The molecular targets for monoclonal antibodies are cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The rationale for the use of   inhibitors in patients with gynecological cancers was based on the immunohistological studies showing high expression levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 in those cancers. Currently available   inhibitors include nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab. The efficacy and safety of these inhibitors, used as monotherapy and with combination with chemotherapy, is being currently evaluated in several clinical studies. As the results are promising, more clinical trials are being planned, which may lead to the development of efficient therapies for gynecological cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498030>Treatment-Free Survival: A Novel Outcome Measure of the Effects of   Inhibition-A Pooled Analysis of Patients With Advanced Melanoma.</a></h1><p>Outcome measures that comprehensively capture attributes of immuno-oncology agents, including prolonged treatment-free time and persistent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), are needed to complement conventional survival end points.We pooled data from the CheckMate 067 and 069 clinical trials of nivolumab and ipilimumab, as monotherapies or in combination, for patients with advanced melanoma. Treatment-free survival (TFS) was defined as the area between Kaplan-Meier curves for two conventional time-to-event end points, each defined from random assignment: time to   inhibitor (ICI) protocol therapy cessation and time to subsequent systemic therapy initiation or death. TFS was partitioned as time with and without toxicity by a third end point, time to cessation of both ICI therapy and toxicity. Toxicity included persistent and late-onset grade 3 or higher TRAEs. The area under each Kaplan-Meier curve was estimated by the 36-month restricted mean time.At 36 months, many of the 1,077 patients who initiated ICI therapy were surviving free of subsequent therapy initiation (47% nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 37% nivolumab, 15% ipilimumab). The restricted mean TFS was longer for nivolumab plus ipilimumab (11.1 months) compared with nivolumab (4.6 months; difference, 6. months; 95% CI, .0 to 8.0 months) or ipilimumab (8.7 months; difference, 2.4 months; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.1 months); restricted mean TFS represented 31% (3% with and 28% without toxicity), 13% (1% and 11%), and 24% (less than 1% and 23%) of the 36-month period, respectively, in the three treatment groups. TFS without toxicity was longer for nivolumab plus ipilimumab than nivolumab (difference, 6.0 months) or ipilimumab (difference, 1.7 months).The analysis of TFS between ICI cessation and subsequent therapy initiation revealed longer TFS without toxicity for patients with advanced melanoma who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with nivolumab or ipilimumab. Regardless of treatment, a small proportion of the TFS involved grade 3 or higher TRAEs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651263>Publication statuses of clinical trials supporting FDA-approved   inhibitors: a meta-epidemiological investigation.</a></h1><p>The low data publication rate for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, and discrepancies between FDA-submitted versus published data, remain a concern. We investigated the publication statuses of sponsor-submitted clinical trials supporting recent anticancer drugs approved by the FDA, with a focus on   inhibitors (ICPis).We identified all ICPis approved between 2011 and 2014, thereby obtaining 3 years of follow-up data. We assessed the clinical trials performed for each drug indication and matched each trial with publications in the literature. The primary benchmark was the publication status 2 years post-approval. We examined the association between time to publication and drug type using a multilevel Cox regression model that was adjusted for clustering within drug indications and individual covariates.Between 2011 and 2014, 36 anticancer drugs including 3 ICPis were newly approved by the FDA. Of 19 trials investigating the 3 ICPis, 11 (58%) were published within 2 years post-approval. We randomly selected 10 of the 33 remaining anticancer drugs; 68 of 101 trials investigating these drugs (67%) were published. Overall, the publication rate was 66% at 2 years post-approval with a median time to publication of 2.3 years. There was no significant difference in the time to trial publication between ICPis and other anticancer drugs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.7; P = 0.55). However, findings related to non-ICPis investigated specifically in randomized phase 2 or phase 3 trials were significantly more likely to be published earlier than those related to ICPis (adjusted HR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.8-29.; P = 0.005).One in 3 sponsor-submitted trials of the most recently approved anticancer drugs remained unpublished 2 years post-FDA approval. We found no evidence that the drug type was associated with the time to overall trial publication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567999>Immunohistochemistry of   markers PD-1 and PD-L1 in prostate cancer.</a></h1><p>Recent availability of   inhibitors has facilitated research involving programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). However, the incidence and clinical implication of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer remain poorly understood. The current study aimed to determine the status of PD-1/PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer specimens and its prognostic significance.We immunohistochemically stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 in our tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of radical prostatectomy specimens. The expression of PD-1/PD-L1 was designated as positive when moderate to strong staining or weak staining was seen in at least 1% or 10%, respectively, of tumor cells and/or associated  cells. We then evaluated the relationship between the expression of each protein and clinicopathological features available for our patient cohort.PD-1 and PD-L1 were positive in 3 (1.%) and 1 (0.%) of 201 non-neoplastic prostate tissues, and also in 17 (7.7%) and 29 (13.2%) of 220 prostate cancers, respectively. PD-1 and PD-L1 were also expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages in 172 (78.2%) and 33 (15.0%) cases, respectively. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was more often seen in high pT stage (pT2: 10.8% vs pT3/4: 20.4%; P = .072; pT2/3a: 11.4% vs pT3b/4: 31.6%; P = .013) or lymph node-positive (pN0: 10.1% vs pN1: 27.3%; P = .086) cases, whereas PD-1 expression in tumor cells was not significantly associated with pT/pN stage. In addition, there were no statistically significant associations between PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages versus patient age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, or Gleason score. Kaplan-Meier analysis coupled with log-rank test further revealed no significant associations between PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (P = .619/P = .315), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes/macrophages (P = .954/P = .155), or either or both of them (P = .964/P = .767) versus disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.PD-1/PD-L1 expression was detected in a subset of prostate cancers. In particular, PD-L1 expression was considerably up-regulated in nonorgan-confined tumors. However, PD-1/PD-L1 expression in our TMA was found to be not very helpful in predicting tumor recurrence in prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657376>Single droplet detection of   on a multiplexed electrohydrodynamic biosensor.</a></h1><p>Monitoring soluble   in circulating fluids has the potential for minimally-invasive diagnostics and personalised therapy in precision medicine. Yet, the sensitive detection of multiple   from small volumes of liquid biopsy samples is challenging. In this study, we develop a multiplexed   biosensor (MICB) for parallel detection of soluble   PD-1, PD-L1, and LAG-3. MICB integrates a microfluidic sandwich immunoassay using engineered single chain variable fragments and alternating current electrohydrodynamic in situ nanofluidic mixing for promoting biosensor-target interaction and reducing non-specific non-target binding. MICB provides advantages of simultaneous analysis of up to 28 samples in <2 h, requires as little as a single sample drop (i.e., 20 μL) per target  , and applies high-affinity yeast -derived single chain variable fragments as a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies. We investigate the assay performance of MICB and demonstrate its capability for accurate   detection in simulated patient serum samples at clinically-relevant levels. MICB provides a dynamic range of  to 200 pg mL-1 for PD-1 and PD-L1, and 50 to 1000 pg mL-1 for LAG-3 with a coefficient of variation <13.8%. Sensitive   detection was achieved with limits of detection values of  pg mL-1 for PD-1,  pg mL-1 for PD-L1, and 50 pg mL-1 for LAG-3. The multiplexing capability, sensitivity, and relative assay simplicity of MICB make it capable of serving as a bioanalytical tool for   therapy monitoring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614500>Detailed Characterization of   Infiltrate and Expression of   Molecules PD-L1/CTLA-4 and MMR Proteins in Testicular Germ  Tumors Disclose Novel Disease Biomarkers.</a></h1><p> The  infiltrate plays an important part in testicular germ  tumors, but it remains scarcely studied. We aimed at thoroughly characterizing the  infiltrate and expression of   PD-L1/CTLA-4 and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in these neoplasms, seeking for associations with patient outcome.  A total of 162 consecutively diagnosed patients (2005-2018) were included. Immunostaining for PD-L1, CTLA-4 and MMR proteins was independently assessed both in  cells (ICs) and tumor cells (TCs) of primary tumors and metastases, and characterization of IC populations was pursued.  PD-L1 and CTLA-4 positivity in ICs was frequent (85.% and 96.3%). Patients with absent PD-L1 positive ICs exhibited significantly worse relapse-free survival (hazard ratio = 4.481, 95% CI 1.366-14.697,  = 0.013), both in univariable and multivariable analysis.

Patients had preserved liver function (Child-Pugh scores A-B7) and either advanced HCC due to macrovascular invasion or limited extrahepatic disease (21 patients) or aggressive intermediate stage HCC that resulted in earlier incorporation of systemic immunotherapy ( patients). Clinical documentation, laboratory results, and imaging results at 1- and 3-month follow-up intervals were reviewed to assess treatment-related adverse events and treatment responses.The median follow-up period after radioembolization was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], .6-11.8). There were no early (30-day) mortality or grades 3/4 hepatobiliary or immunotherapy-related toxicities. Delayed grades 3/4 hepatobiliary toxicities (1-3 months) occurred in 2 patients in the setting of HCC disease progression. One patient developed pneumonitis. The median overall survival from first immunotherapy was 17.2 months (95% CI, 10.9-23.4). The median overall survival from first radioembolization was 16. months (95% CI, 6.6-26.4). From first radioembolization, time to tumor progression was .7 months (95% CI, 4.2-7.2), and progression-free survival was .7 months (95% CI, 4.3-7.1).Radioembolization combined with  inhibitor immunotherapy in cases of HCC appears to be safe and causes limited treatment-related toxicity.

Cancer cells are capable of evading clearance by macrophages through the overexpression of anti-phagocytic surface proteins called 'don't eat me' signals-including CD47, programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the beta-2 microglobulin subunit of the major histocompatibility class I complex (B2M). Monoclonal antibodies that antagonize the interaction of 'don't eat me' signals with their macrophage-expressed receptors have demonstrated therapeutic potential in several cancers. However, variability in the magnitude and durability of the response to these agents has suggested the presence of additional, as yet unknown 'don't eat me' signals. Here we show that CD24 can be the dominant innate   in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, and is a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate a role for tumour-expressed CD24 in promoting  evasion through its interaction with the inhibitory receptor sialic-acid-binding Ig-like lectin 10 (Siglec-10), which is expressed by tumour-associated macrophages. We find that many tumours overexpress CD24 and that tumour-associated macrophages express high levels of Siglec-10. Genetic ablation of either CD24 or Siglec-10, as well as blockade of the CD24-Siglec-10 interaction using monoclonal antibodies, robustly augment the phagocytosis of all CD24-expressing human tumours that we tested. Genetic ablation and therapeutic blockade of CD24 resulted in a macrophage-dependent reduction of tumour growth in vivo and an increase in survival time. These data reveal CD24 as a highly expressed, anti-phagocytic signal in several cancers and demonstrate the therapeutic potential for CD24 blockade in cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540116>NK Cells as Potential Targets for Immunotherapy in Endometriosis.</a></h1><p>Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, most frequently on the pelvic viscera and ovaries, which is associated with pelvic pains and infertility. It is an inflammatory disorder with some features of autoimmunity. It is accepted that ectopic endometriotic tissue originates from endometrial cells exfoliated during menstruation and disseminating into the peritoneum by retrograde menstrual blood flow. It is assumed that the survival of endometriotic cells in the peritoneal cavity may be partially due to their abrogated elimination by natural killer (NK) cells. The decrease of NK  cytotoxic activity in endometriosis is associated with an increased expression of some inhibitory NK  receptors. It may be also related to the expression of human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G), a ligand for inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 1 (LILRB1) receptors. The downregulated cytotoxic activity of NK cells may be due to inhibitory cytokines present in the peritoneal milieu of patients with endometriosis. The role of NK  receptors and their ligands in endometriosis is also confirmed by genetic association studies. Thus, endometriosis may be a subject of immunotherapy by blocking NK  negative control  including inhibitory NK  receptors. Immunotherapies with genetically modified NK cells also cannot be excluded.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509890>The efficacy of   inhibitors in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small  lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Despite recent advances in treating non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) with   inhibitors (ICIs), their role in ALK-positive NSCLC patients is unclear. We investigated the efficacy of ICIs in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.Between 2011 and 2018, a total of 14 ALK-positive NSCLC patients treated with ICIs were evaluated retrospectively. Clinicopathologic features including age, PD-L1 expression, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. RNA expression level and cytolytic activity by ALK positivity were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and National Cancer Center Research Institute (NCCRI) data sets.A total of 13 patients (92.9%) received ALK inhibitors. Patients received a median of three (range 2-8) courses of therapy. The study included nine patients (64.3%) who were PD-L1-high (>50%) and four (28.6%) who were PD-L1-low (<50%). The objective response rate was 14.3% (2/14). The median progression-free survival time was 2.18 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13 months-not reached [NR]). The median overall survival time was .67 months (95% CI 3.00 months-NR). RNA expression levels of CD274 were similar between the ALK-positive and negative groups in both TCGA and NCCRI datasets. RNA levels of CD8A in both TCGA and NCCRI data sets were nonsignificantly lower in the ALK-positive group. Cytolytic activity scores including interferon-γ-related response were lower in the ALK-positive group in the NCCRI but not TCGA dataset.Despite high PD-L1-positive rates, ICIs show limited efficacy in ALK-positive NSCLC. Decreased interferon-γ-related response may underlie these findings.© 2019 The Authors.

Recently, anti-PD-1 antibody therapy became a key treatment for stage IV NSCLC as the combination of   inhibitors (ICIs) and platinum doublet chemotherapy. However, the efficacy and toxicity of anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT in stage III NSCLC are not well examined.Patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT were identified in our clinical database. The safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy were retrospectively analyzed.From March 1, 2013 to April 30, 2018, there were 20 patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy for recurrence after CRT. The median duration from CRT to initial anti-PD-1 therapy was 9.3 months. 12 patients (60%) were alive and 7 patients (35%) were still receiving anti-PD-1 therapy at the data cutoff point (median follow-up, 13. months). The ORR for anti-PD-1 therapy was 45.0%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy was 8.4 months and 26.2 months, respectively. PFS in patients who had a short interval from last CRT to initial anti-PD-1 therapy seemed to have better outcomes (duration from last CRT to initial anti-PD-1 therapy < 9.3 months vs. ≥ 9.3 months; median PFS, 17.0 months vs. 4.9 months). Grade 3 or 4 -related adverse events occurred in % of patients.

The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival (PFS) and -related adverse events (irAEs) were secondary end-points. The impact of age was assessed using the threshold of 70 years.A total of 410 patients were included, for 435 lines of treatment, including 150 lines (34%) given to patients aged 70 years or older. The primary tumour types were lung cancer (n = 304, 74%), melanoma (n = 79, 19%) and urologic cancer (n = 27, 7%). Most of the administered treatments were PD(L)-1 inhibitors (n = 356, 82%). Median follow-up reached 46 months in the CTLA-4 cohort, and 20 months in the PD(L)-1 cohort. In both treatment cohorts, age did not impact OS (respectively, HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.-1.4; log-rank P = 0.49 and HR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.7-1.1; log-rank P = 0.27) or PFS (HR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.1; log-rank P = 0.13 and HR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.7-1.1; log-rank P = 0.19). Grade 3-4 irAEs rates were not statistically different between older and younger patients (11% vs 12%, P = 0.87).In a large real-world series of patients treated by ICI monotherapy, the long-term clinical outcomes were not statistically different between older or younger patients, with no increased -related toxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

B7x belongs to the Immunoglobulin superfamily and its protein structure is similar to other members with a N terminus peptide, IgV and IgC like extracellular domain with four cysteine residues. Its receptor is yet to be identified. B7x inhibits T  proliferation and expansion by IL-2 dependent and non-IL-2 dependent pathways. Even though high levels of B7x mRNA can be detected in most tissues its protein expression is highly limited suggesting significant post translational control. In vivo data, show that B7x plays an important role in limiting autoimmunity in the peripheral tissues and fine-tuning autoimmune responses. B7x is highly expressed in various cancers and in prostate cancer its expression is corelated with poorer outcomes. Local production of IL-6 and IL-10 in various cancers promotes B7x expression and tumor  evasion. B7x is especially expressed in PD-L1 negative tumors suggesting that this may be an important method of  evasion in these tumors. Currently drug development, targeting B7x through various mechanisms including monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates are in development in cancers and increasing B7x expression with fusion proteins in autoimmune diseases is underway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553168>Near-Infrared II Phototherapy Induces Deep Tissue Immunogenic  Death and Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>The deep and inner beds of solid tumors lack lymphocytic infiltration and are subjected to various  escape mechanisms. Reversing immunosuppression deep within the tumor is vital in clinical cancer therapy, however it remains a huge challenge. In this work, we have demonstrated the use of a second window near-infrared (NIR(II)) photothermal treatment to trigger more homogeneous and deeper immunogenic cancer  death in solid tumors, thereby eliciting both innate and adaptive  responses for tumor control and metastasis prevention. Specifically, photothermal transducers with similar components, structures, and photothermal conversion efficiencies, but different absorptions in red light, NIR(I), and NIR(II) biowindows, were constructed by controlling the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles on fluidic liposomes. , photothermal treatments induced immunogenic  death (ICD) that were accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) regardless of the wavelength of incident lasers. , NIR(II) light resulted in a more homogeneous release and distribution of DAMPs in the deeper parts of the tumors. With the induction of ICD, NIR(II) photothermal therapy simultaneously triggered both innate and adaptive  responses and enabled efficient tumor control with /8 of the mice remaining tumor-free in the cancer vaccination assay. Additionally, the NIR(II) photothermal treatment in combination with  blockade therapy exerted long-term tumor control over both primary and distant tumors. Finally, using systemically administered two-dimensional polypyrrole nanosheets as a NIR(II) transducer, we achieved striking therapeutic effects against whole-body tumor metastasis  a synergistic photothermal-immunological response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31458997>Au-CGKRK Nanoconjugates for Combating Cancer through T--Driven Therapeutic RNA Interference.</a></h1><p>Numerous prior studies on fighting cancer have been based on using inhibitors of JAK-STAT pathway (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor in particular), a signaling pathway responsible for progression of many types of cancer cells. However, recent studies have shown that STAT3 activation leads to upregulation of program death receptor-ligand 1 (PD-L1, an   protein that plays a major role behind evasion of  systems by growing tumors) expression levels in tumor cells, leading to enhanced  suppression. This is why global efforts are being witnessed in combating cancer through use of   inhibitors. Herein, we report on the design, synthesis, physicochemical characterizations, and bioactivity evaluation of novel tumor- and tumor-vasculature-targeting noncytotoxic Au-CGKRK nanoconjugates (17-80 nm) for combating tumor. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model, we show that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the Au-CGKRK nanoparticles (NPs) complexed with both PD-L1siRNA (the   inhibitor) and STAT3siRNA (the JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor) results in significant (>70%) enhancement in overall survivability (OS) in melanoma-bearing mice ( = ) when compared to the OS in the untreated mice group. The expression levels of CD8 and CD4 proteins in the tumor lysates of differently treated mice groups (by Western blotting) are consistent with the observed OS enhancement being a T--driven process. Biodistribution study using near-infrared dye-loaded Au-CGKRK nanoconjugates revealed selective accumulation of the dye in mouse tumor. Notably, the overall survival benefits were significantly less (∼35%) when melanoma-bearing mice were treated (i.p.) with Au-CGKRK NPs complexed with only PD-L1siRNA or with STAT3siRNA alone. The presently described Au-CGKRK nanoconjugates are expected to find future use in therapeutic RNA-interference-based cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31398081>Nivolumab Combined With Brentuximab Vedotin for Relapsed/Refractory Primary Mediastinal Large B- Lymphoma: Efficacy and Safety From the Phase II CheckMate 436 Study.</a></h1><p>Primary mediastinal B- lymphoma (PMBL) is a rare but aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with poor outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. PMBL is characterized by high expression of programmed death-1 ligand and variable expression of CD30. Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1   inhibitor, and brentuximab vedotin (BV), an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate, may have synergistic activity in R/R PMBL.The expansion cohort of the open-label, phase I/II CheckMate 436 study enrolled patients with confirmed R/R PMBL who were previously treated with either autologous hematopoietic  transplantation or two or more prior chemotherapy regimens if ineligible for autologous hematopoietic  transplantation. Patients received nivolumab (240 mg intravenously) and BV (1.8 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end points were investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per the Lugano 2014 criteria and safety.Thirty patients with PMBL were treated and evaluable. At a median follow-up of 11.1 months, ORR (95% CI) was 73% (54% to 88%), with a 37% complete remission rate per investigator, and ORR of 70% (51% to 85%), with a 43% complete metabolic response rate per independent review. Median duration of response, median progression-free survival, and median overall survival have not been reached. Eleven responders had consolidation with autologous (n = ) or allogeneic (n = 6) transplantation. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 25 patients (83%). Sixteen patients (53%) had grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events; the most common were neutropenia (n = 9), thrombocytopenia (n = 3), and peripheral neuropathy (n = 3). There were no treatment-related deaths.In patients with R/R PMBL, the combination of nivolumab plus BV represents a promising option, with high antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670091>Potential use of edaravone to reduce specific side effects of chemo-, radio- and immuno-therapy of cancers.</a></h1><p>The drug edaravone (EDA) is prescribed for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or after an acute cerebral infarction. This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the   PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The use of anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 /PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies to block the tumor signaling pathway has shown excellent anti-tumor efficacy in a variety of solid tumors, and it is expected that immunotherapy will be available for the treatment of 60% advanced tumors in the next decade. Esophageal cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and its -year survival rate is generally low. Currently, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery are the standard treatments for esophageal cancer, and there is no effective treatment scheme for patients with esophageal cancer who fail to respond to standard treatment. Due to the diversity of somatic  gene mutations and the generation of neo-antigens in esophageal cancer, immunotherapy has become a feasible treatment scheme to improve the prognosis of esophageal cancer. In this situation, the application of immunotherapy for esophageal cancer or more specific   inhibitors has gradually become the focus of the treatment of esophageal cancer. Nowadays, the research of   inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab and avelumab on esophageal cancer is proceeding at an amazing speed. The phase Ⅰ b clinical study of immunotherapy for esophageal cancer, which previously attracted great interest, has been replaced by the phase Ⅲ clinical study, and the results of the relevant studies also show a good prospect for the application of   inhibitors for esophageal cancer. However, the prediction of therapeutic effect and the selection of the best candidates still need to be further studied.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361169>The estrogen pathway as a modulator of response to immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with a -year survival rate of about 18%.

Given that these tumor features are associated with the response to   inhibitors, we administered nivolumab to a CRC patient who carried two inactive MUTYH alleles (p.Y179C and p.G396D) and previously experienced failure of chemotherapy. This experimental treatment resulted in a pronounced tumor response. We further compared tumor lymphocyte infiltration in MUTYH-associated (n = 3), high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H, n = 8) and microsatellite stable (MSS, n = 6) CRCs. Both MUTYH-driven and MSI-H CRCs showed noticeably higher lymphocyte densities than those of microsatellite stable tumors; this difference reached the level of statistical significance for the comparison of central areas of the tumors (p = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively) but not for the invasive tumor margins. Although MUTYH-associated tumors are exceptionally rare among unselected CRC cases, their share in CRC patients with somatic KRAS p.G12C substitution approaches -25%.

The primary endpoint was the lower endpoint of the 95% credibility interval for the information component (IC ).A total of 127 reports had significant IC values for drug-induced sarcoidosis, and 110 were included in the final analysis, accounting for 2,425 adverse drug reactions. Overall, 2,074 (85.%) reactions were considered "serious", and 86 (3.%) were fatal. Most of the drugs that led to sarcoidosis adverse reactions were TNF-alpha antagonists, interferon or peg-interferon therapeutics, and   inhibitors. Other biologic drugs were less frequently associated with sarcoidosis adverse events. Cancer-targeted therapies such as BRAF or MEK inhibitors were associated with sarcoidosis reactions in 37 cases.

Here, we report on the treatment efficacy of ICI and prognosis in NSCLC patients with severe grade CIP.In this retrospective cohort study, CIP severity, CIP-related mortality, and ICI efficacy in 71 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with ICIs were evaluated. Data was obtained from the patients' medical charts.All grade and severe grade CIP were observed in 22 and 11 patients, respectively. The CIP-related mortality rate was 22.7% (N = ). An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of ≥2 and pre-existing interstitial lung disease (ILD) were significantly associated with the development of severe grade CIP (P = 0.001 and P = 0.035, respectively). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly shorter in patients with severe grade CIP than in those without severe grade CIP (PFS 1.0 month, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.-2.0 vs. 3. months, 95% CI 2.0-.0 months, P = 0.003; OS 3.0 months, 95% CI 0.-13 vs. 12.7 months, 95% CI 8.0-21.0 months, P = 0.011).CIP is a serious complication with a poor prognosis associated with high mortality. The efficacy of ICI is significantly worse in patients with severe grade CIP than in those without severe grade CIP.

There are still no effective targeted therapies in SCLC despite improved understanding of the molecular steps leading to SCLC development and progression these last years. After four decades, the only modest improvement in OS of patients suffering from ES-SCLC has recently been shown in a trial combining atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1   inhibitor, with carboplatin and etoposide, chemotherapy agents. This highlights the need to pursue research efforts in this field. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed and activated in several cancers, including SCLC, and contributing to cancer progression and metastasis through its important role in  proliferation, survival, adhesion, spreading, migration, and invasion. FAK also plays a role in tumor  evasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA damage repair, radioresistance, and regulation of cancer stem cells. FAK is of particular interest in SCLC, being known for its aggressiveness. The inhibition of FAK in SCLC  lines demonstrated significative decrease in  proliferation, invasion, and migration, and induced   arrest and apoptosis. In this review, we will focus on the role of FAK in cancer cells and their microenvironment, and its potential as a therapeutic target in SCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503428>  Inhibitors for Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma in Brentuximab Vedotin-naïve Patients: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness, and Guidelines [Internet].</a></h1><p>Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare form of cancer that affects the white blood cells of the lymphatic system. Across Canada, an estimated 1000 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are diagnosed each year with more than 70% occurring in patients younger than 55 years. Prognosis is generally dependent on the stage at which Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed and treated. Early Hodgkin lymphoma refers to the disease in stages 1 and 2, while advanced Hodgkin lymphoma refers to the disease in stages 2B, 3 and 4. The average -year relative survival rate in Canada is higher than 90% for patients diagnosed with stages 1 and 2 Hodgkin lymphoma and 65% for those diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma. Approximately 95% of cases are classified as classical Hodgkin lymphoma which manifests in a variety of forms, namely, nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte-rich and lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma. The remaining % of cases are classified as nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment options vary with the type and stage of Hodgkin lymphoma as well as with the patient’s age and overall health. The first line of treatment is typically chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, although in cases where Hodgkin lymphoma is localized, radiation may be administered as first line therapy. Second-line therapy may include autologous stem  therapy or transplantation (auto-SCT), allogeneic stem  therapy or transplantation (allo-SCT), anti-CD30 antibodies (such as brentuximab vedotin), and anti-CD20 antibodies (such as rituximab). For those whose cancer does not adequately respond to second-line therapy, those who do not have access to therapies like brentuximab vedotin, or those who are ineligible for SCT,   inhibitors (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) may be potential options. This review aims to summarize the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of   inhibitors in brentuximab vedotin-naïve patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma who either failed or are not eligible for auto-SCT. The review also aims to summarize relevant evidence-based guidelines.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612012>Combination of  inhibitors with radiotherapy in esophageal squamous  carcinoma treatment: A novel strategy.</a></h1><p>Despite the rapid development of numerous types of treatment, including radiotherapy (RT) as the main strategy, esophageal squamous  carcinoma (ESCC) has a poor prognosis. Recent studies demonstrated that immunotherapy can improve the survival of patients with locally advanced and metastatic ESCC. Furthermore, previous studies reported that the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 is significantly associated with esophageal cancer prognosis. At present, several ongoing clinical trials have extended the use of immunotherapy from palliative and salvage treatments to neoadjuvant treatment with concurrent chemoradiation. The first- or second-line treatments were used to explore antitumor efficacy with reduced adverse events.

Despite advances in surgical techniques and optimization of chemoradiotherapy regimens, overall survival benefits have been incremental at best. Esophageal cancer requires a concerted multidisciplinary approach, perhaps more so than any other tumor type given the integral role played by the esophagus in maintaining calorific intake and the propensity for early spread through the lymphatics. This review describes the latest in surgical techniques to minimize postoperative complications and examines previous and ongoing systemic therapy approaches. Strategies that harness a patient's own  system hold great promise, and shifting  inhibitors from the metastatic setting to the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting is currently being evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials. In addition, a much better understanding of the interplay between tumors and their  microenvironment is clearly needed to better judge how best to engage each patient's  system, and there will be likely demonstrable differences between early-stage tumors and metastatic disease. This review highlights emerging data, which demonstrate that, in addition to The Cancer Genome Atlas classification of esophageal squamous  carcinoma having a distinct molecular makeup compared with esophageal adenocarcinoma, there are also differing responses to PD-1 inhibitors. Histology and the underlying  milieu may have important ramifications for the management of localized disease in the future, above and beyond PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability status, and tumor mutational burden.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498181>-related Neutropenia Following Treatment With   Inhibitors.</a></h1><p>The existing data with regard to -related neutropenia (irN), a rare (incidence-1%) -related adverse event of   inhibitors, are scarce. Eight patients with irN were identified through internal databases of 3 participating Israeli cancer centers. In addition, 11 original articles focusing on the clinical course of 24 patients with irN were selected during the PubMed search. Descriptive analysis of clinical and pathologic factors related to irN was performed (n=32); the effect of these on the irN outcomes was assessed. An algorithm for irN evaluation and treatment was proposed. The median time-to-onset of irN (n=32) was 60 days (range, 10-465 d). Grade 3- irN, febrile neutropenia, and irN-related death occurred in 81%, 50%, and 9% of patients, respectively. In all, 56%, 22%, 62%, and 25% of patients received PO corticosteroids, IV corticosteroids, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), respectively, with an improvement/resolution rate of 84%. Odds ratios for irN improvement/resolution were as follows: 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.03-68.72], 0.43 (95% CI, 0.04-4.22), 2.60 (95% CI, 0.07-97.24), 0.36 (95% CI, 0.03-4.38), 4.02 (95% CI, 0.16-99.48), 2.01 (95% CI, 0.32-12.70), 1.08 (95% CI, 0.02-49.89), 0.42 (95% CI, 0.06-2.91), and 2.73 (95% CI, 0.42-17.51) for granulocyte hyperplasia, granulocyte/all lineage hypoplasia, granulocyte maturation blockade, lymphocyte infiltration on bone marrow biopsy, IV corticosteroids, PO corticosteroids, cyclosporine, IVIG, and GCSF, respectively (P>0.05 for all factors). IrN recurrence rate following   inhibitors rechallenge was 80%. IrN is a rare, life-threatening, early-onset -related adverse event.

Underlying malignancies included melanoma (n = 15), lung adenocarcinoma (n = 3), and cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1). Neuropathy phenotypes were cranial neuropathies with or without meningitis (n = 7), nonlength-dependent polyradiculoneuropathies with and without cranial nerve involvement (n = 6), small-fiber/autonomic neuropathy (n = 2), ANCA-associated mononeuritis multiplex (n = 1), sensory neuronopathy (n = 1), length-dependent sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy (n = 1), and neuralgic amyotrophy (n = 1). -related adverse events involving other organ systems were common (58%). Corticosteroid use for management of neuropathy was associated with improvement in median modified Rankin Scale score (1 vs 0,  = 0.001) and Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment Disability score (2 vs 0.,  = 0.012) (Class IV). Significantly higher proportion of irNeuropathies had acute or subacute and nonlength-dependent presentations ( < 0.001) and rate of hospitalization for irNeuropathy was also higher ( = 0.002) compared to toxic neuropathy from chemotherapy.Neuropathy is a rare complication of ICIs that often responds to immunosuppression.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for  escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for   inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or  cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to   blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of   inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small  lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with   inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, , and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating  cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561518>  as Promising Targets for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?</a></h1><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a rare, progressive and fatal lung disease which affects approximately  million persons worldwide. Although pirfenidone and/or nintedanib treatment improves patients' wellbeing, the prognosis of IPF remains poor with -year mortality rates still ranging from 70 to 80%. The promise of the anti-cancer agent nintedanib in IPF, in combination with the recent notion that IPF shares several pathogenic pathways with cancer, raised hope that   inhibitors, the novel revolutionary anticancer agents, could also be the eagerly awaited ground-breaking and unconventional novel treatment modality limiting IPF-related morbidity/mortality. In the current review, we analyse the available literature on   proteins in IPF to explore whether   inhibition may be as promising in IPF as it is in cancer. We conclude that despite several promising papers showing that inhibiting specific   proteins limits pulmonary fibrosis, overall the data seem to argue against a general role of   inhibition in IPF and suggest that only PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition may be beneficial.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452071>Neurological and related adverse events in   inhibitors: a pharmacovigilance study from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICPI), a breakthrough immunotherapy for cancer, can cause serious neurological adverse events (AEs).

Among the ICPI subtypes, when compared to nivolumab as a reference, number of hypophysitis, hypopituitarism, and meningitis reports from the use of ipilimumab and number of encephalitis/myelitis and meningitis reports from the use of anti-programmed  death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) agents were significantly higher. Additionally, time to AE onset of symptoms post administration was short in meningitis (median 21 days), MG (median 28 days), myositis (median 28 days), and encephalitis/myelitis (median 32. days), while it was longer in peripheral neuropathy (median 42 days), hypophysitis (median 94 days), and hypopituitarism (median 112 days).Our results showed characteristic features of neurological and related AEs associated with each ICPI subtype, reported in a large number of Japanese patients.

Previously, we demonstrated that treatment of mice with subcutaneous melanoma with -aminolevurinic acid (-ALA) and X-rays in combination, ("radiodynamic therapy (RDT)"), instead of with -ALA and laser beams ("photodynamic therapy"), improved tumor suppression in vivo. Here, using the B16-Luc melanoma brain metastasis model, we demonstrate that -ALA RDT effectively treats brain metastasis. We also studied how -ALA RDT damages cells in vitro using a B16 melanoma culture.  culture preincubated with -ALA alone increased intracellular photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX.

Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597674>Pulmonary complications of   inhibitors in patients with nonsmall  lung cancer.</a></h1><p>  inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICI-P) during cancer treatment is rarely observed (<%). ICI-P is more often observed in patients with nonsmall  lung cancer (NSCLC) than in those with other cancers. Likewise, it is more common in those receiving programmed  death (PD)-1/PD-1 ligand inhibitors rather than cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 inhibitors alone. The frequency of ICI-P is higher when anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 are administered concomitantly. Despite the low fatality rate (≈13%), ICI-P is the leading cause of ICI-related deaths. This narrative review focuses on the epidemiology, clinical and radiological presentation and prognosis of ICI-P occurring in patients, especially those with advanced NSCLC. Emphasis is placed on the differences in terms of frequency or clinical picture observed depending on whether the ICI is used as monotherapy or in combination with another ICI or chemotherapy. Other pulmonary complications observed in cancer patients, yet not necessarily -related, are reviewed, such as sarcoid-like granulomatosis, tuberculosis or other infections. A proposal for pragmatic management, including differential diagnosis and therapeutic strategies, is presented, based on the ICI-P series reported in the literature and published guidelines.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576688>Investigating the role of immunotherapy in advanced/recurrent female genital tract melanoma: a preliminary experience.</a></h1><p>immunotherapy with   inhibitors has become one of the standard therapeutic modalities for patients with advanced melanoma. Melanoma of the female lower genital tract is a rare and aggressive disease, with poor long-term clinical outcomes. To date, no study evaluated the role of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract.Data of women with metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract were prospectively collected. Survival outcomes over time was assessed using Kaplan-Meier model.Seven cases of metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract (vulva [n=2], vagina [n=4], and uterine cervix [n=1]) treated with   inhibitors are reviewed. Two patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis, while  patients developed metastatic disease at a mean (standard deviation) time of 9.9 (±3.0) months from primary diagnosis. Four patients received an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) (ipilimumab) and 3 received an anti-programmed  death 1 (PD-1) (pembrolizumab [n=2], nivolumab [n=1]) therapy. The response rate to immunotherapy was 28.%. Patients receiving an anti-PD-1 experienced a better progression-free survival than patients treated with anti-CTLA4 (p=0.01, log-rank test). Although not reaching statistical significance, overall survival was better in patients having an anti-PD-1 therapy in comparison to anti-CTLA4 (p=0.15, log-rank test).Results from our series confirm the poor prognosis of women with metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract, thus supporting the need of exploring new treatment modalities. Further studies are warranted to improve knowledge on the role of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma of the lower genital tract.Copyright © 2019.

PD-1 levels on T  subsets, inflammation, and  markers in peripheral blood were examined before the induction of anesthesia (T0) and 24 hours (T1), 72 hours (T2), and 1 week (T3) after surgery. A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the changes from baseline values (T0) between groups were significantly different.The increases in the percentage of PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells observed at T1 and T2 in the control group were higher than those in the flurbiprofen group (T1: 12.91% ± 1.65% versus 7.86% ± .71%, p = 0.031; T2: 11.54% ± 1.54% versus 8.75% ± 1.73%, p = 0.004), whereas no differences were observed in the changes in the percentage of PD-1(+)CD4(+) T cells at T1 and T2 between the groups. Moreover, extensive changes in the percentage of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory marker concentrations were observed at T1 and T2 after surgery and flurbiprofen attenuated most of these changes.Perioperative administration of flurbiprofen attenuated the postoperative increase in PD-1 levels on CD8(+) T cells up to 72 hours after surgery, but not after this duration. The clinical relevance of changes in PD-1 levels to long-term surgical outcome remains unknown.© 2019 The Author(s). Published by S.

Expression of PD-L1 in UC tumors has been investigated using different antibody clones, staining protocols, and scoring algorithms. The aim was to establish the extent of concordance among PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays.Tumor biopsy samples (N = 335) were assessed using four commercially available PD-L1 assays: VENTANA SP263, VENTANA SP142, PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx, and PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx. PD-L1 analytical staining and classification concordance, including agreement between clinically relevant scoring algorithms, were investigated using overall/positive/negative percentage agreement (OPA/PPA/NPA).Good analytical correlation was observed among the VENTANA SP263, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx, and PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assays for tumor  (TC) and   (IC) PD-L1 staining with Spearman rank coefficients of 0.92-0.93 for TCs and 0.88-0.91 for ICs. However, concordance (preset criterion: ≥85%) between patient PD-L1 status when applying the TC or IC ≥ 25% (VENTANA SP263) cutoff was only achieved for PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx versus VENTANA SP263 (OPA 92.2%, PPA 86.4%, NPA 95.4%). Differences were observed between patient populations with UC tumors classified as PD-L1 high versus PD-L1 low/negative using combined positive score (CPS) ≥1, CPS ≥10, IC ≥%, and TC/IC ≥25%.The VENTANA SP263 and PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assays are analytically similar in UC. When the different PD-L1 assays were combined with their specified clinical scoring algorithms, differences were seen in patient classification driven by substantial differences in scoring approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31349225>Stereotactic radiosurgery with and without  inhibition for patients with metastatic non-small  lung cancer to the brain: a matched cohort study.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) improve survival in patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical trials examining the efficacy of ICIs in patients with NSCLC excluded patients with untreated brain metastases (BMs). As stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly employed for NSCLC-BMs, the authors sought to define the safety and radiological and clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC-BMs treated with concurrent ICI and SRS.A retrospective matched cohort study was performed on patients who had undergone SRS for one or more NSCLC-derived BMs. Two matched cohorts were identified: one that received ICI before or after SRS within a 3-month period (concurrent ICI) and one that did not (ICI naive). Locoregional tumor control, peritumoral edema, and central nervous system (CNS) adverse events were compared between the two cohorts.Seventeen patients (45 BMs) and 34 patients (92 BMs) composed the concurrent-ICI and ICI-naive cohorts, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39-2.52, p = 0.99) or CNS progression-free survival (HR 2.18, 95% CI 0.72-6.62, p = 0.11) between the two groups. Similarly, the 12-month local tumor control rate was 84.9% for tumors in the concurrent-ICI cohort versus 76.3% for tumors in the ICI-naive cohort (p = 0.94). Further analysis did reveal that patients receiving concurrent ICI had increased rates of CNS complete response for BMs treated with SRS (8/16 [50%] vs /32 [15.6%], p = 0.012) per the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. There was also a shorter median time to BM regression in the concurrent-ICI cohort (2. vs 3.1 months, p < 0.0001). There was no increased rate of radiation necrosis or intratumoral hemorrhage in the patients receiving concurrent ICI (.9% vs 2.9% in ICI-naive cohort, p = 0.99). There was no significant difference in the rate of peritumoral edema progression between the two groups (concurrent ICI: 11.1%, ICI naive: 21.7%, p = 0.162).The concurrent use of ICI and SRS to treat NSCLC-BM was well tolerated while providing more rapid BM regression. Concurrent ICI did not increase peritumoral edema or rates of radiation necrosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether combined ICI and SRS improves progression-free survival and overall survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578274>Prevalence of NRAS Mutation, PD-L1 Expression and Amplification, and Overall Survival Analysis in 36 Primary Vaginal Melanomas.</a></h1><p>Primary vaginal melanomas are uncommon and aggressive tumors with poor prognosis, and the development of new targeted therapies is essential. This study aimed to identify the molecular markers occurring in these patients and potentially improve treatment strategies.The clinicopathological characteristics of 36 patients with primary vaginal melanomas were reviewed. Oncogenic mutations in , , ,  and  and the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase () were investigated using the Sanger sequencing. The expression and copy number of programmed death-ligand 1 () were also assessed.Mutations in , , and  promoter were identified in 13.9% (/36), 2.9% (1/34), and .6% (2/36) of the primary vaginal melanomas, respectively.  expression and amplification were observed in 27.8% (10/36) and .6% (2/36) of cases, respectively.  positive expression and/or amplification was associated with older patients ( = .008). Patients who had  mutations had a poorer overall survival compared with those with a wild-type  (33. vs. 14.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 3.09; 95% CI, 1.08-8.83). Strikingly, two patients with/without  expression receiving   inhibitors had a satisfying outcome. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that >10 mitoses per mm (HR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.03-8.51) was an independent prognostic factor. mutations and  expression were most prevalent in our cohort of primary vaginal melanomas and can be potentially considered as therapeutic targets.This study used the Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization methods to detect common genetic mutations and  expression and copy number in 36 primary vaginal melanomas.  mutations and  expression were the most prevalent, but  and  mutations occurred at a lower occurrence in this rare malignancy. Two patients receiving   inhibitors had a satisfying outcome, signifying that the  expression and amplification can be a possible predictive marker of clinical response.

Search terms included renal  carcinoma, systemic therapy, targeted therapy (TT), and immunotherapy.Marked advances in the treatment of mRCC have been made with novel VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and multiple ICIs that have been included in the current treatment paradigm of mRCC. Remarkable advance has been made with the combination of double  blockade. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab compared with sunitinib has shown to increase the overall survival in the intermediate- and poor-risk patients based on the International Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) model.Double  blockade with ipilimumab and nivolumab has reported overall survival benefit in IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients, providing a durable response for a subset of patients. VEGF inhibitors remain the standard of care for favorable-risk patients in the first line. In the immediate future, more consolidated data on combination of VEGF-TT plus ICIs may show similar robust benefit with different safety profiles.Multiple drugs and sequences are now accepted as effective treatment for metastatic renal  carcinoma (mRCC). Combination of   inhibitors has shown to increase the overall survival in treatment-naïve mRCC patients. Combinations of immunotherapy and antiangiogenics may be another option in the near future. Outcomes of the first line will determine the sequence, although the best sequence has yet to be defined.Copyright © 2019.

However, the extent to which platelet activation shapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and whether platelet inhibition can be leveraged to improve  blockade are unknown. We show in this study that platelet function in mice mediates suppression of CD8 T  function within the TME but not in the draining lymph nodes. Tempering platelet activation genetically reduced TGF-β signaling in both  and nonimmune cells in the TME, enhanced T  frequency and function, and decreased CD11b myeloid  infiltration in the tumor. Targeting platelet function pharmacologically in tumor-bearing mice with aspirin and clopidogrel in combination with PD-1 blockade improved tumor control. These results suggest that platelet function represents a continuous, supplemental mechanism of  evasion co-opted by tumors to evade antitumor immunity and offers an attractive target for combination with immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612217>Engineering of a novel subnanomolar affinity fibronectin III domain binder targeting human programmed death-ligand 1.</a></h1><p>The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a major  protein that helps cancer cells evade the  system. A non-invasive imaging agent with rapid clearance rate would be an ideal tool to predict and monitor the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. The aim of this research was to engineer a subnanomolar, high-affinity fibronectin type 3 domain (FN3)-based small binder targeted against human PD-L1 (hPD-L1) present on tumor cells. A naive yeast G4 library containing the FN3 gene with three binding loop sequences was used to isolate high-affinity binders targeted to purified full-length hPD-L1. The selected binder clones displayed several mutations in the loop regions of the FN3 domain. One unique clone (FN3hPD-L1-01) with a 6x His-tag at the C-terminus had a protein yield of > mg/L and a protein mass of 12 kDa. In vitro binding assays on six different human cancer  lines (MDA-MB-231, DLD1, U87, 293 T, Raji and Jurkat) and murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells stably expressing hPD-L1 showed that CT26/hPD-L1 cells had the highest expression of hPD-L1 in both basal and IFN-γ-induced states, with a binding affinity of 2.38 ± 0.26 nM for FN3hPD-L1-01. The binding ability of FN3hPD-L1-01 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on ex vivo CT26/hPD-L1 tumors sections. The FN3hPD-L1-01 binder represents a novel, small, high-affinity binder for imaging hPD-L1 expression on tumor cells and would aid in earlier imaging of tumors. Future clinical validation studies of the labeled FN3hPD-L1 binder(s) have the potential to monitor   inhibitors therapy and predict responders.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, most patients eventually develop resistance. With the development of   inhibitors targeting the programmed  death receptor/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1), there is a growing interest in developing combination strategies. However, there are concerns that the combination of a PD-(L)1 inhibitor and EGFR-TKI may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis. Therefore, we utilized an established EGFR-driven tumor-bearing mouse model to investigate whether the combination would induce pneumonitis in mouse lung tissue.Mice were treated with monotherapy or combined therapy of PD-L1 antibody and EGFR-TKIs including first-generation gefitinib and third-generation osimertinib. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and lung tissues were collected for analysis at the end of treatment.The osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group had the highest inflammation scores in pathologic grades of H&E staining of lung tissue and had the highest percentages of myeloperoxidase positive cells. However, combining gefitinib and anti-PD-L1 treatment appeared to not increase the level of pneumonitis in mice. Total  counts, neutrophil counts and total protein concentration in BALFs were also significantly increased in the osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. We next evaluated proinflammatory factors in BALFs. The levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-, TNF-α and IL-12p70 were increased in osimertinib and anti-PD-L1 combined treatment group. Comparison of different sequences of drug administration demonstrated that mice treated with osimertinib followed by PD-L1 antibody did not show evident lung inflammation. Our findings indicate that osimertinib, rather than gefitinib combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment could lead to lung injury in an EGFR mutated tumor-bearing mouse model. The sequence and timing of combining EGFR-TKI and PD-L1 antibody may influence the severity of pneumonitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Programmed death ligand-2 (PD-L2) is a less studied ligand to PD-1 and has yet to be fully explored, especially in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).In this study, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect the PD-L2, CD3, CD8, transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) and FOXP3 levels in paraffin sections from 305 patients with resected PDAC as a training set. Expression levels of intratumoral and stromal  markers were compared in relation to survival using Kaplan-Meier curves, random survival forest model and survival tree analysis. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model of associated markers was used to calculate the risk scores.PD-L2 was expressed in 71.% of PDAC samples and showed strong correlations with CD3+, CD8+ T cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T  densities. High levels of intratumoral PD-L2 and FOXP3 were related to poor survival; only stromal FOXP3 overexpression was associated with worse prognosis. Four patterns generated from survival tree analysis demonstrated that PD-L2FOXP3 patients had the longest survival, while PD-L2CD3 patients had the shortest survival (P <  0.001). The area under the curve was 0.631(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.447-0.826) for the  marker-based signature and 0.549 (95% CI: 0.323-0.829; P <  0.001) for the clinical parameter-based signature, which was consistent with the results in the validation set including 150 patients (P <  0.001). A higher risk score indicated shorter survival and could serve as an independent prognostic factor.

Clinical syndromes comprised a combination of limbic encephalitis and diencephalitis (n = 3), isolated limbic encephalitis (n = 2), and a syndrome characterized by ophthalmoplegia and head drop (n = 1). No significant clinical difference was observed between our 6 patients and the overall cohort of Ma2-PNS cases.

Eight cases had been detected in the preceding biennium 2015-2016, corresponding to a 112% increase of Ma2-PNS frequency since the implementation of ICIs in France. Despite ICI withdrawal and immunotherapy, 4/6 patients died, and the remaining 2 showed a moderate to severe disability.We show a clear association between ICI use and increased diagnosis of Ma2-PNS.

An important target of these drugs is the PD-L1/PD-1 ligand/receptor pair and several clinically available inhibitors of this pair exist.A search of the literature until April 20, 2019 was performed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database, the Embase database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The clinical studies describing treatment with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors as monotherapy in HCC patients were retrieved. Patient characteristics with relevance for treatment efficacy, such as liver function, disease extend and previous treatment, were extracted from identified articles. Response and survival outcomes were the primary focus of the meta-analysis. Summary estimates of response rates and survival were calculated using a random or fixed effect model, depending on heterogeneity. Most common adverse effects were also recorded and summarized.Three studies (two on nivolumab and one on pembrolizumab) with a total of 400 patients were included in the analysis. The summary response rate (RR) was 17.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.2%-21.4%]. The summary disease control rate (DCR) was 56.6% (95% CI: 44.7%-68.%). Summary progression free survival (PFS) was 3. months (95% CI: 2.8-4.2 months). Summary overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months (95% CI: 3.-17.2 months). Adverse effect rate was low and also consistent with the adverse effect profile of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors in other disease locations.Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are the only  inhibitors with data in HCC. Meta-analysis of their effectiveness discloses rates not dissimilar to other systemic therapies available for this disease. Of interest also are the observed long responses in a sub-set of responders. Further development is clearly warranted.Copyright © 2019.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab (240 mg for 30 min every 2 weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 100 mg/m for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given intravenously. Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing.Between Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy. At the time of data cutoff on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10· months (IQR 4·-19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6-15·2) in the chemotherapy group. At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 10·9 months, 95% CI 9·2-13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·2-9·9; hazard ratio for death 0·77, 95% CI 0·62-0·96; p=0·019). 38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [2%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group. Five deaths were deemed treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one each of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one each of pneumonia, spinal cord abscess, and interstitial lung disease).Nivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survivaland a favourable safety profile compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced oesophageal squamous  carcinoma, and might represent a new standard second-line treatment option for these patients.ONO Pharmaceutical Company and Bristol-Myers Squibb.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

T  immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is an inhibitory   receptor in analogy to PD-1, and drugs targeting TIGIT are currently being investigated in clinical trials. Little is known about the expression of these proteins in testicular seminomas. Therefore the present study performed immunohistochemical analysis to determine the relative abundance of TIGIT and PD-1 in relation to the total CD3   infiltration in a tissue microarray (TMA) constructed from 78 seminoma patients. The fraction of TIGIT and PD-1 lymphocytes was highly variable in individual cancers and ranged from 2.3 to 69.4% (mean: 32.2±14.7%) for TIGIT and from 0.8 to 56.% (mean: 21.6±13.2%) for PD-1. The same high degree of variability was also identified for the ratio of PD-1 to TIGIT positive cells, which varied from a dominance of TIGIT (PD-1: TIGIT ratio=0.02) in 74% of patients, to a predominance of PD-1 (PD-1: TIGIT ratio=12.) in 23% of patients. In summary, the   receptors TIGIT and PD-1 are abundantly expressed in human seminomas. Once available, anti-TIGIT antibodies, possibly in combination with anti-PD-1 drugs, may be a reasonable therapeutic strategy for this type of cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511065>Recovery from secondary adrenal insufficiency in a patient with   inhibitor therapy induced hypophysitis.</a></h1><p>Hypophysitis is a well-recognized -related adverse event in patients treated with   inhibitors for cancer. Some anterior pituitary hormones may recover; however, secondary adrenal insufficiency is usually permanent.A 26-year old male with metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma was started on treatment with the anti-programmed  death-1 monoclonal antibody (anti-PD-1 mAb) nivolumab, followed by combined nivolumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) mAb, ipilimumab. After starting nivolumab monotherapy the patient developed thyroiditis, which resolved without treatment. Prior to commencing combined ICI therapy, a random serum cortisol drawn at 1:30 pm and was 15.0 μg/dL (414 nmol/L). Three weeks after starting combined ICI therapy he developed sudden onset of severe fatigue and 1 pm serum cortisol was 2.0 μg/dL (55.2 nmol/L), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 16 pg/mL (3.52 pmol/L). A diagnosis of hypophysitis was made, and he was immediately started on prednisone 1 mg/kg. His symptoms resolved rapidly, and he continued   inhibitor therapy. He was noted to also have low gonadotropic hormones and testosterone (nadir testosterone 81.19 ng/dL). The prednisone was tapered slowly over the next six weeks to a maintenance dose of  mg daily. Four months after the initial presentation his cortisol remained low, but his testosterone level had increased to 973.43 ng/dL. After five months his random serum cortisol (1 pm) increased to 11.0 μg/dL (303.6 nmol/L). The prednisone was cautiously discontinued with close monitoring. Two months off glucocorticoid replacement he remained asymptomatic with an ACTH of 24.1 pg/mL (.3 pmol/L), and cortisol of 13.0 μg/dL (358.8 nmol/L).This case documents the unusual recovery from secondary adrenal insufficiency in a patient who developed hypophysitis from   inhibitor therapy. Repeated pituitary hormone testing every three months for the first year after the development of hypophysitis may identify more patients with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396557>Heterocellular gene signatures reveal luminal-A breast cancer heterogeneity and differential therapeutic responses.</a></h1><p>Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Although differences between intrinsic breast cancer subtypes have been well studied, heterogeneity within each subtype, especially luminal-A cancers, requires further interrogation to personalize disease management. Here, we applied well-characterized and cancer-associated heterocellular signatures representing stem, mesenchymal, stromal, , and epithelial  types to breast cancer. This analysis stratified the luminal-A breast cancer samples into five subtypes with a majority of them enriched for a subtype (stem-like) that has increased stem and stromal  gene signatures, representing potential luminal progenitor origin. The enrichment of   genes and other   types in two (including stem-like) of the five heterocellular subtypes of luminal-A tumors suggest their potential response to immunotherapy. These -enriched subtypes of luminal-A tumors (containing only estrogen receptor positive samples) showed good or intermediate prognosis along with the two other differentiated subtypes as assessed using recurrence-free and distant metastasis-free patient survival outcomes. On the other hand, a partially differentiated subtype of luminal-A breast cancer with transit-amplifying colon-crypt characteristics showed poor prognosis. Furthermore, published luminal-A subtypes associated with specific somatic copy number alterations and mutations shared similar cellular and mutational characteristics to colorectal cancer subtypes where the heterocellular signatures were derived. These heterocellular subtypes reveal transcriptome and -type based heterogeneity of luminal-A and other breast cancer subtypes that may be useful for additional understanding of the cancer type and potential patient stratification and personalized medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378459>Pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced solid tumours: results from the dose-escalation stage of a multicentre, open-label, phase 1a/b trial.</a></h1><p>Rationale exists for combined treatment with   inhibitors and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in a variety of solid tumours. This study aimed to investigate the safety and antitumour effects of pamiparib, an oral PARP 1/2 inhibitor, combined with tislelizumab, a humanised anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumours and to determine the optimum doses for further evaluation.We did a multicentre, open-label, phase 1a/b study at five academic sites or community oncology centres in Australia. We recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with advanced solid tumours who had received one or more previous lines of therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1 or less, and a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more. Patients were enrolled into one of five dose-escalation cohorts, with dose-escalation done in a 3 + 3 design. Cohorts 1-3 received intravenous tislelizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus 20, 40, or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice daily, respectively; cohorts 4 and  received 200 mg intravenous tislelizumab every 3 weeks plus 40 or 60 mg oral pamiparib twice daily, respectively. The primary endpoints of the phase 1a dose-escalation part of the study were safety and tolerability, including the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities and determination of the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose. All primary endpoints were analysed in the safety analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of tislelizumab or pamiparib, with the exception of the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities, which was analysed in the dose-limiting toxicity analysis set, which included all patients who received at least 90% of the first scheduled tislelizumab dose and at least 75% of scheduled pamiparib doses, or who had a dose-limiting toxicity event during  1. Reported here are results of the phase 1a dose-escalation stage of the trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is ongoing.Between Jan 22, 2016, and May 16, 2017, we enrolled 49 patients (median age 63 years [IQR 55-67]), all of whom received at least one dose of pamiparib or tiselzumab. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities (intractable grade 2 nausea [n=1] and grade 3 rash [n=1] in cohort 4, and grade 2 nausea and vomiting [n=1] and grade 4 -mediated hepatitis [n=1] in cohort ). The recommended phase 2 dose was tislelizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks plus pamiparib 40 mg twice daily (the dose given in cohort 4). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (in 31 [63%] of 49 patients), fatigue (26 [53%]), diarrhoea (17 [35%]), and vomiting (15 [31%]). 23 (47%) of 49 patients had -related adverse events, of whom nine (39%) had asymptomatic grade 3-4 hepatic -related adverse events, which were reversible with corticosteroid treatment. The most common adverse event of grade 3 or worse severity was anaemia (in six [12%] patients) and no grade  adverse events were reported. Hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis was the only serious adverse event to occur in two or more patients (in four [8%] patients). At a median follow-up of 8·3 months (IQR 4·8-12·8), ten (20%) of 49 patients achieved an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, including two complete responses and eight partial responses.Pamiparib with tislelizumab was generally well tolerated and associated with antitumour responses and clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumours supporting further investigation of the combination of pamiparib with tislelizumab.BeiGene.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Blocking PD-1 and its ligand's pathways enhances antileukaemia responses by enabling T cells in murine models. We aimed to assess the addition of nivolumab to frontline therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.This single-arm, phase 2 part of the phase 1-2 study of nivolumab in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Eligible patients were aged 18-60 years (or >60 years if suitable for intensive chemotherapy), and had newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Induction included cytarabine 1· g/m by 24-h continuous infusion daily on days 1-4 (3 days in patients >60 years) and idarubicin 12 mg/m daily on days 1-3. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was started on day 24 (range 22-26) and continued every 2 weeks for up to a year in responders. Responders received either up to five consolidation cycles of attenuated doses of idarubicin and cytarabine, or allogeneic stem  transplantation if eligible. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival and overall survival. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between Aug 7, 2015, and June 2, 2018, 44 patients were enrolled of whom 22 (50%) had adverse genetic risk by European Leukaemia Network classification. All patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy. At a median follow-up of 17·25 months (IQR 0·50-30·40), median event-free survival was not reached (95% CI 7·93-NR). Median relapse-free survival of responders was 18·54 months (95% CI 8·20-23·22). The median overall survival was 18·54 months (95% CI 10·81-28·81). Six patients had seven grade 3-4 -related adverse events with two cases of rash, two of colitis, and one each of transaminitis, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis. 19 (43%) of 44 patients achieved a response and proceeded to allogeneic stem  transplantation, with grade 3-4 graft-versus-host disease observed in five (26%). No treatment related deaths were attributed to nivolumab.Addition of nivolumab to induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine is feasible in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Post-transplant severe graft-versus-host disease could be improved, and earlier initiation of  inhibitor therapy is warranted in future studies.The MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant CA016672, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center Leukaemia SPORE CA100632 from the National Cancer Institute, Bristol Myers Squibb.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we aimed to assess and compare the utility of serum -S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels as markers for predicting the effects of nivolumab in advanced malignant melanoma.Baseline serum -S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients with unresectable stage IIIC and IV malignant melanoma treated with nivolumab ( = 21) were analyzed to determine their utility as predictive markers for survival. We also analyzed the prognostic value of these markers among patients with only stage IV malignant melanoma ( = 17).Our analysis showed that patients with baseline serum -S-CD levels >25.0 nmol/L had significantly poor prognosis. In contrast, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at the upper limit of the normal range did not exhibit such changes.Serum -S-CD levels have the potential to be an excellent predictive marker for the efficacy of nivolumab therapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420468>A Phase Ib Trial of Durvalumab in Combination with Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (CCTG IND.229).</a></h1><p>  inhibitors are active in a broad range of cancers, including programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive, triple-negative, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Antibody-dependent -mediated cytotoxicity is a mechanism of action of trastuzumab. We performed a phase Ib trial of durvalumab and trastuzumab in HER2-positive MBC previously treated with chemotherapy and anti-HER2 antibodies to assess safety, efficacy, and correlative endpoints.Patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled on a standard 3 + 3 design. Dose level 1 was durvalumab (1,125 mg intravenously day 1) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg intravenously loading, then 6 mg/kg day 1) on a q3 weekly . An expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) performed tumor biopsies at baseline and after  1. The primary endpoint was to establish the RP2D.Fifteen patients were accrued from April to December 2016, of which 14 were evaluable for response. Median age was 54 years (range 40-86); the majority had visceral disease (87%) and at least three prior (adjuvant and/or metastatic) lines of chemotherapy (73%), including trastuzumab (93%), pertuzumab (60%), and trastuzumab-emtansine (93%) for MBC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at dose level 1 ( = 6) or dose expansion ( = 9) during  1. One patient developed a grade ≥3 -related adverse event (grade 4 diabetes mellitus). No responses by RECIST were seen, with 4 of 14 patients (29%) demonstrating stable disease as best response at week 6 (median duration, 2.7 months). All patients had <1% PD-L1 expression on either archival tissue (7/15) or prestudy biopsy (8/15). In the dose expansion cohort, evaluable pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies ( = ) showed minimal CD8  infiltration.The RP2D of durvalumab and trastuzumab is standard full doses of both agents. No significant clinical activity was observed in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive PD-L1-negative MBC.This phase Ib trial with associated correlative endpoints provides insights into the lack of activity of the combination of durvalumab and trastuzumab in heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). No significant clinical activity was observed in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative MBC with evidence of cytotoxic T- exhaustion. Furthermore, all patients had no expression of PD-L1 in the tumor cells. These data support the importance of PD-L1 as an important selection biomarker and the need to assess the tumor microenvironment for  regulatory cells.

Drugs can be harmful to the liver in susceptible individuals owing to genetic and environmental risk factors. These risk factors modify hepatic metabolism and excretion of the DILI-causative agent leading to cellular stress,  death, activation of an adaptive  response and a failure to adapt, with progression to overt liver injury. Idiosyncratic DILI is a relative rare hepatic disorder but can be severe and, in some cases, fatal, presenting with a variety of phenotypes, which mimic other hepatic diseases. The diagnosis of DILI relies on the exclusion of other aetiologies of liver disease as specific biomarkers are still lacking. Clinical scales such as CIOMS/RUCAM can support the diagnostic process but need refinement. A number of clinical variables, validated in prospective cohorts, can be used to predict a more severe DILI outcome. Although no pharmacological therapy has been adequately tested in randomized clinical trials, corticosteroids can be useful, particularly in the emergent form of DILI related to - inhibitors in patients with cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594913>A Phase I Trial Using a Multitargeted Recombinant Adenovirus  (CEA/MUC1/Brachyury)-Based Immunotherapy Vaccine Regimen in Patients with Advanced Cancer.</a></h1><p>Concurrent ETBX-011, ETBX-051, and ETBX-061 can be safely administered to patients with advanced cancer.All patients developed CD4 and/or CD8 T- responses after vaccination to at least one tumor-associated antigen (TAA) encoded by the vaccine; /6 patients (83%) developed MUC1-specific T cells, 4/6 (67%) developed CEA-specific T cells, and 3/6 (50%) developed brachyury-specific T cells.The presence of adenovirus -neutralizing antibodies did not prevent the generation of TAA-specific T cells.A novel adenovirus-based vaccine targeting three human tumor-associated antigens-CEA, MUC1, and brachyury-has demonstrated antitumor cytolytic T- responses in preclinical animal models of cancer.This open-label, phase I trial evaluated concurrent administration of three therapeutic vaccines (ETBX-011 = CEA, ETBX-051 = MUC1, and ETBX-061 = brachyury). All three vaccines used the same modified adenovirus  (Ad5) vector backbone and were administered at a single dose level (DL) of  × 10 viral particles (VP) per vector. The vaccine regimen consisting of all three vaccines was given every 3 weeks for three doses then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year.

Traditional therapies have not significantly improved survival, and recently pancreatic cancer has been deemed a "cold" tumor due to its poor response to immunotherapy. Strategies to improve survival of pancreatic cancer are desperately needed. In the current investigation, we studied the effects of an anti-gastrin cancer vaccine, polyclonal antibody stimulator (PAS; formerly called G17DT and Gastrimmune), used alone or in combination with a programmed  death receptor (PD)-1   antibody on pancreatic cancer growth, metastases, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). -competent female C57BL/6 mice bearing syngeneic orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer treated with PAS had significantly smaller tumors and fewer metastases. Examination of the TME demonstrated decreased fibrosis with fewer M2 and more M1 tumor-associated macrophages. Expression of the  gene was significantly increased and expression of the  gene was decreased compared with controls. Mice treated with PAS or the combination of PAS and PD-1 antibody exhibited significantly less tumor expression of phospho-paxillin, the focal adhesion protein β-catenin, and matrix metalloproteinase-7. This study suggests that inhibition of the cancer-promoting effects of gastrin in pancreatic cancer can decrease metastases by altering the TME and decreasing pathways that activate the epithelial mesenchymal transition. The PAS vaccine appears to change the TME, making it more susceptible to therapy with an   antibody. This novel combination of two immunotherapies may improve survival of pancreatic cancer by decreasing both tumor growth and metastasis formation. Survival from advanced pancreatic cancer is poor, in part due to dense fibrosis of the tumor microenvironment, increased number of M2-polarized macrophages that promote angiogenesis and invasion, and lack of "target-specific" therapy. Herein, we report that a tumor vaccine that selectively targets gastrin decreases pancreatic cancer growth and metastases. Furthermore, the gastrin vaccine polyclonal antibody stimulator alters the tumor microenvironment rendering it more responsive to immunotherapy with a programmed  death receptor-1   antibody.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645894>Clinical outcomes in non-small- lung cancer patients receiving concurrent metformin and   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>To study the clinical benefits of concurrent metformin and   inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small- lung cancer patients.This is a retrospective review of 50 non-small- lung cancer patients receiving ICIs with metformin (cohort A) or without metformin (cohort B).

Eligibility criteria included histologically or citologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IIIB and IV, evaluable disease, sufficient organ function and at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The endpoints included Overall Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). Safety analysis was performed with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, and -related Adverse Events (irAEs) were treated according to protocol treatment guidelines. Tumour response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Data was analysed using SPSS, version 21.0 (IBM Statistics).From June 2015 to December 2016, a total of 229 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled at 30 Portuguese centres. Clinical data were collected up to the end of July 2018. The baseline median age was 64 years (range 37-83) and the majority of patients were males (70.3%) and former/current smokers (69.4%). Patients with non-squamous histology predominated (88.1%), and 67.6% of the patients had received 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Out of 229 patients, data was available for 219 patients (3 patients did not start treatment, while data was unavailable in 7 patients); of the 219 patients, 15.% were not evaluated for radiological tumour assessment, 1.4% had complete response (CR), 21% partial response (PR), 31% stable disease (SD) and 31.1% progressive disease (PD). Thus, the ORR was 22.4% and DCR was 53.4% in this population. At the time of survival analysis the median PFS was 4.91 months (95% CI, 3.89-6.11) and median OS was 13.21 months (95% CI, 9.89-16.53). The safety profile was in line with clinical trial data.Efficacy and safety results observed in this retrospective analysis were consistent with observations reported in clinical trials and from other centres.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

They are commonly unilateral and are reflective of poorer prognosis. Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) account for 4-% of all invasive cancers. These are metastatic tumors in which the primary is unknown despite an extensive medical evaluation. About 11% of MPE are from CUP. These MPEs present a clinical dilemma to physicians as there is a paucity of literature on their management and no consensus or guideline statement. This paper provides an overview of MPE from CUP in regard to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options. A selective search was performed in Medline and PubMed, with the keywords "Malignant pleural effusion" and "Cancer of unknown primary" up to December 2018. A review of literature would suggest that a thoracentesis is the first step in all cases but additional work up such as thoracoscopy & pleural biopsies is frequently warranted. With advances in immunohistochemical staining and biomarker development, MPE with CUP maybe profiled in a similar manner as lung cancer. Similarly, liquid biopsy or identification of circulating tumor  free DNA may have a role in the work up of CUP in the future. There is some experience in managing these patients with gene directed therapies and   inhibitors, however, with mixed results. Given the poor prognosis associated with MPE from CUP, symptom alleviating measures such as indwelling pleural catheters should be part of the management strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of   Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small  Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h1><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of   inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with immunotherapy were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18. months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Solid tumors with low levels of intratumoral  infiltration have inferior outcomes. It is unknown whether a similar relationship exists between POD24 in FL.Digital gene expression using a custom code set-five  effector, six  , one macrophage molecules-was applied to a discovery cohort of patients with early- and advanced-stage FL (n = 132). T- receptor repertoire analysis, flow cytometry, multispectral immunofluorescence, and next-generation sequencing were performed. The  infiltration profile was validated in two independent cohorts of patients with advanced-stage FL requiring systemic treatment (n = 138, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone; n = 45, rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with the latter selected to permit comparison of patients experiencing a POD24 event with those having no progression at  years or more. molecules showed distinct clustering, characterized by either high or low expression regardless of categorization as an  effector,  , or macrophage molecule. Low programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) was the most sensitive/specific marker to segregate patients with adverse outcomes; therefore, PD-L2 expression was chosen to distinguish  infiltration (ie, high PD-L2) FL biopsies from  infiltration (ie, low PD-L2) tumors.  infiltration tissues were highly infiltrated with macrophages and expanded populations of T- clones. Of note, the  infiltration subset of patients with FL was enriched for POD24 events (odds ratio [OR], 4.32; c-statistic, 0.81;  = .001), validated in the independent cohorts (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone: OR, 2.95; c-statistic, 0.75;  = .011; and rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone: OR, 7.09; c-statistic, 0.88;  = .011). Mutations were equally proportioned across tissues, which indicated that degree of  infiltration is capturing aspects of FL biology distinct from its mutational profile.Assessment of -infiltration by PD-L2 expression is a promising tool with which to help identify patients who are at risk for POD24.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385529>Advances in the management of brain metastases from cancer of unknown primary.</a></h1><p>Cancer of unknown primary accounts for 3-% of all cancers for which an adequate investigation does not identify the primary tumor. The particular subset of brain metastasis in cancer of unknown primary (BMCUP) is a clinical challenge that lacks standardized diagnostic and therapeutic options. It is diagnosed predominantly in male patients in the sixth decade of age with complaints of headache, neurological dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances and seizures. The therapeutic approach to patients with BMCUP relies on local control and systemic treatment. Surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiation therapy seems to be the cornerstone of the treatment approach to BMCUP. Systemic therapy remains essential as cancers of unknown primary are conceptually metastatic tumors. The benefits of chemotherapy were disappointing whereas those of targeted therapies and   inhibitors remain to be evaluated. In this Review, we address the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of BMCUP.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662794>Prognostic value of PD-L1 expression for surgically treated localized renal  carcinoma: implications for risk stratification and adjuvant therapies.</a></h1><p>We aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of programmed-death receptor ligand (PD-L1) in a multinational cohort of patients with localized renal  carcinoma (RCC).Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of 1017 patients from the Latin American Renal Cancer Group were analyzed. Tissue microarrays were immunostained for PD-L1 using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Expression of PD-L1 in ⩾% tumor cells was considered positive. PD-1 expression in  cells was also assessed. All cases were reviewed twice based on antibody expression and compared with a positive control. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).A total of 738 cases with complete follow up met criteria. Median age was 57 [interquartile range (IQR): 49-64] years, and median follow up was 34 (IQR: 15-62.9) months. Median tumor size was  cm (IQR: 3.0-7. cm). Approximately 8.2% and 7.6% of tumors were PD-L1 and programmed -death 1 (PD-1) positive, respectively. PD-L1 and PD-1 positivity were significantly associated with higher tumor stage (both  < 0.001), and presence of tumor necrosis and lymphovascular multivariable analyses; PD-L1 positivity was found as a predictor of worse RFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.08,  = 0.05] and OS (HR = 2.61,  = 0.02).PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with worse outcomes for patients with localized RCC at intermediate follow up. This marker may help stratify patients for stricter surveillance after surgical treatment and provide a basis for -inhibitor therapy in the adjuvant setting.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395100>Angiosarcoma patients treated with   inhibitors: a case series of seven patients from a single institution.</a></h1><p>Angiosarcoma is an uncommon endothelial malignancy and a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma. Due to its infiltrative nature, successful management of localized angiosarcoma is often challenging. Systemic chemotherapy is used in the metastatic setting and occasionally in patients with high-risk localized disease in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. However, responses tend to be short-lived and most patients succumb to metastatic disease. Novel therapies are needed for patients with angiosarcomas.We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with locally advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma, who were treated with  inhibitors at our institution. We collected their clinical information and outcome measurements. In one patient with achieved complete response, we analyzed circulating and infiltrating T cells within peripheral blood and tumor tissue.We have treated seven angiosarcoma (AS) patients with  inhibitors either in the context of clinical trials or off label [Pembrolizumab + Axitinib (; n = 1), AGEN1884, a CTLA-4 inhibitor (; n = 2), Pembrolizumab (n = 4)]. Five patients had cutaneous angiosarcoma, one primary breast angiosarcoma and one radiation-associated breast angiosarcoma. At 12 weeks, /7 patients (71%) had partial response of their lesions either on imaging and/or clinical exam and two (29%) had progressive disease. 6/7 patients are alive to date and, thus far, 3/7 patients (43%) have progressed (median 3.4 months)- one achieved partial response after pembrolizumab was switched to ongoing Nivolumab/Ipilimumab, one died of progressive disease at 31 weeks (primary breast angiosarcoma) and one was placed on pazopanib. One patient had a complete response (CR) following extended treatment with monotherapy AGEN1884. No patient experienced any ≥ grade 2 toxicities.This case series underscores the value of targeted immunotherapy in treating angiosarcoma. It also identifies genetic heterogeneity of cutaneous angiosarcomas and discusses specific genetic findings that may explain reported benefits from immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535338>  Inhibitors as Switch or Continuation Maintenance Therapy in Solid Tumors: Rationale and Current State.</a></h1><p>First-line chemotherapy for many solid tumors is limited by toxicity. There is a growing interest in maintenance therapy as a strategy for prolonging the benefits of first-line therapy while minimizing toxicity. Maintenance therapy can comprise either continuation of an agent given as part of the first-line regimen (continuation maintenance) or treatment with a new agent (switch maintenance). Maintenance therapy is already established in several solid tumors, including lung, breast, gastric, colorectal, and ovarian cancer.   inhibitor treatment has been shown to prolong duration of response and overall survival, but efficacy is generally restricted to a limited proportion of patients with selected tumors. Thus, efforts are ongoing to determine whether the clinical benefits of   inhibitors can be extended using novel treatment schedules and settings, including maintenance therapy. Early- and late-phase clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of   inhibitors as switch and continuation maintenance in different tumors, and a range of phase III trials are ongoing. Interpretation of results requires consideration of trial designs, eligibility criteria, and primary endpoints, in addition to biomarker exploration, and assessment of quality of life and cost effectiveness. Findings from ongoing trials will help further define the role of   inhibitors as maintenance therapy across a spectrum of solid tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564188>Programmed death-ligand 1 and survival in colorectal cancers: A meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a programmed death 1 (PD-1) ligand that plays a pivotal role in the inhibition of the T--mediated  response. The expression of PD-L1 is associated with the prognosis and clinical outcomes of multiple tumors. However, the prognostic value of PD-L1 overexpression in colorectal cancer is still controversial. In this study, we sought to clarify this by presenting a meta-analysis of relevant studies.Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematically searched for studies concerning the expression of PD-L1 and survival in colorectal cancer. The reported hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival in the included studies were analyzed by fixed effects/random effects models.Fifteen studies involving 3078 patients with colorectal cancer were included in our meta-analysis. Overexpression of PD-L1 was found to be associated with poor overall survival (HR 1.83; 95% CI 1.21, 2.79;  = 0.005) and poor recurrence-free survival (HR 2.78; 95% CI 1.43, .42;  = 0.003). However, no correlation was found between PD-L1 overexpression and poor disease-free survival (HR 1.23; 95% CI 0.83, 1.82;  = 0.305). Overexpression of PD-L1 indicating poor survival held true across different geographical areas, sample sizes, analysis types, sources of HRs, and  types.Overexpression of PD-L1 is associated with worse prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer and can guide physicians in the application of PD-1/PD-L1  -targeted therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519605>Previous   Inhibitor Treatment to Increase the Efficacy of Docetaxel and Ramucirumab Combination Chemotherapy.</a></h1><p>For   inhibitor (ICI)-pretreated patients, docetaxel and ramucirumab (DOC+RAM) combination therapy may be more effective compared to patients not receiving ICI treatment.From June 2013 to July 2018, 39 patients with advanced/recurrent non-small  lung cancer underwent DOC+RAM therapy. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of DOC+RAM therapy based on the presence (pre-ICI+) or absence (pre-ICI-) of ICI pretreatment history.Of the 39 patients treated with DOC+RAM, we identified 18 (46%) pre-ICI+ patients. Overall response rates for DOC+RAM concerning pre-ICI+ and pre-ICI- patients were 38.9% vs. 19.0%, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was .7 vs. 2.3 months [hazard ratio(HR)=0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.16-0.80]. Adverse events such as fever, myalgia, arthritis, pleural effusion, and pneumonitis tended to be increased in pre-ICI+ patients.Despite increased toxicity concerns, DOC+RAM therapy in pre-ICI+ patients showed a trend for tumor regression improvement and statistically significant prolongation of PFS.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Among EBV-related malignancies, EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) has the largest patient's number. We screened for EBV infection in 1067 GC lesions of 1132 patients who underwent surgical resection from 2007 to 2017 in Japan and examined clinicopathological features of EBVaGC. EBV infection was detected by  hybridization with EBV-encoded small RNA 1(EBER-1 ISH). EBV was infected in 80 GC lesions (7.1%). Mean age was significantly lower in patients with EBVaGC than with EBV-negative GC. EBVaGC was more frequent in men than in women. EBVaGC was found twice as frequent in the upper or middle stomach as in the lower stomach. Early EBVaGC was more frequent, and submucosally invaded cases were dominant. The presence of lymphatic vessel invasion was less in EBVaGC, but frequency of lymph node metastasis was similar. Carcinoma with lymphoid stroma (CLS) was found in 3.8% (43/1132) of all lesions with 60.% of EBV positivity. The synchronous or metachronous multiple GC was frequent in EBVaGC. We clarified clinicopathologic characteristics of EBVaGC over the past decade in Japan.

In a melanoma patient in whom programmed-death 1 (PD-1) blockade resulted in organ rejection and colitis, the addition of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus resulted in ongoing anti-tumor efficacy while promoting allograft tolerance. Strong granzyme B, interferon (IFN)-γ CD8 cytotoxic T  and circulating regulatory T (T)  responses were noted during allograft rejection, along with significant eosinophilia and elevated serum IL- and eotaxin levels. Co-treatment with sirolimus abated cytotoxic T  numbers and eosinophilia, while elevated T  numbers in the peripheral blood were maintained. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-γ CD4 T cells and serum IFN-γ levels increased with the addition of sirolimus treatment likely promoting ongoing anti-PD-1 efficacy. Thus, our results indicate that sirolimus has the potential to uncouple anti-PD-1 therapy toxicity and efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501270>Workup and Management of -Mediated Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Toxicities That Develop During   Inhibitor Treatment.</a></h1><p>  inhibitor treatment has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Workup and management of -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis that develops during   inhibitor treatment can be challenging. -mediated hepatitis can be particularly challenging if patients have underlying viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with positive hepatitis B virus DNA should be referred to a hepatologist for antiviral therapy prior to   inhibitor treatment. With untreated hepatitis C virus (HCV) and elevated liver enzymes, a liver biopsy should be obtained to differentiate between HCV infection and -mediated hepatitis due to anti-programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. If autoimmune serologies are negative, then this supports a case of -mediated hepatitis secondary to anti-PD-1 therapy, rather than autoimmune hepatitis. In this case, an empiric steroid therapy is reasonable; however, if the patient does not respond to steroid therapy in 3- days, then liver biopsy should be pursued. The incidence of  -induced pancreatitis is low, but when it does occur, diagnosis is not straightforward. Although routine monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is not generally recommended, when pancreatitis is suspected, serum levels of amylase and lipase should be checked. Once confirmed, a steroid or other immunosuppressant (if steroids are contraindicated) should be administered along with close monitoring, and a slow tapering dosage once the pancreatitis is under control. Patients should then be monitored for recurrent pancreatitis. Finally,  therapy-related cholangitis involves elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and, once diagnosed, is managed in the same way as -mediated hepatitis. KEY POINTS: -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis are found in patients receiving or who have previously received   inhibitors.To work up -mediated hepatitis, viral, and autoimmune serologies, liver imaging will help to differentiate -mediated hepatitis from hepatitis of other etiology.Hepatology consult may be considered in patients with a history of chronic liver disease who developed hepatitis during   inhibitor treatment.Liver biopsy should be considered to clarify the diagnosis for case in which the hepatitis is refractory to steroid or immunosuppressant treatment.-mediated pancreatitis is treated with steroid or other immunosuppressant with a slow tapering and should be monitored for recurrence. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: All patient receiving or who have previously received   inhibitors should be monitored closely for -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis. Workup and management of -mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis should follow the package insert of   inhibitors. Hepatology consultation should be considered in patients with a history of chronic liver disease.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608159> inhibitors plus chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced non-small  lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.</a></h1><p>We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upfront add-on immunotherapy for advanced non-small  lung cancers (NSCLC).We performed a literature search on first-line chemotherapy ± immunotherapy in NSCLC.

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of complications and hospitalizations from influenza; therefore, it is recommended that they receive inactivated influenza vaccination. However, efficacy and safety of inactivated influenza vaccination in patients receiving   inhibitors is uncertain. The objective of this prospective case series was to evaluate the incidence of -mediated adverse events (imAEs) following inactivated influenza vaccination in patients receiving   inhibitors. Changes in cytokine and chemokine levels were also evaluated.Patients receiving   inhibitors during the 2017-2018 influenza season were eligible for study participation. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to administration of inactivated influenza vaccine and two post-vaccination time points. Evaluation of new or worsening imAEs occurred via patient questionnaire and review of medical records for 60 days following inactivated influenza vaccination. Baseline imAEs were evaluated from review of medical records for 60 days prior to inactivated influenza vaccination. Serum cytokines and chemokines were measured using a multiplex Luminex assay.Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. Seven patients experienced any grade imAE (one patient having 2) within 60 days following inactivated influenza vaccination. The majority were Grades 1-2, including rash ( = 3), hypothyroidism, myalgia, and colitis ( = 1 each). Two patients experienced severe imAEs (grade 3 nephritis and grade 4 diabetes). No significant changes ( > 0.05) in serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations were observed.Although small, our study suggests that inactivated influenza vaccine may be safely administered to patients receiving   inhibitors. The majority of imAEs following inactivated influenza vaccination were Grades 1-2 and did not require changes in   inhibitor therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616428>Immunopathogenesis of   Inhibitor-Related Adverse Events: Roles of the Intestinal Microbiome and Th17 Cells.</a></h1><p>The advent of novel, innovative, and effective anti-cancer immunotherapies has engendered an era of renewed optimism among cancer specialists and their patients. Foremost among these successful immunotherapies are monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which target   inhibitor (ICI) molecules, most prominently cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA-4) and programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1) and its major ligand, PD-L1. These immunotherapeutic agents are, however, often associated with the occurrence of -mediated toxicities known as -related adverse events (IRAEs). The incidence of severe toxicities increases substantially when these agents are used together, particularly with CTLA-4 in combination with PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonists. Accordingly, dissociating the beneficial anti-tumor therapeutic activity of these agents from the emergence of IRAEs represents a significant challenge to attaining the optimum efficacy of ICI-targeted immunotherapy of cancer. This situation is compounded by an increasing awareness, possibly unsurprising, that both the beneficial and harmful effects of ICI-targeted therapies appear to result from an over-reactive  system. Nevertheless, this challenge may not be insurmountable. This contention is based on acquisition of recent insights into the role of the gut microbiome and its products as determinants of the efficacy of ICI-targeted immunotherapy, as well as an increasing realization of the enigmatic involvement of Th17 cells in both anti-tumor activity and the pathogenesis of some types of IRAEs. Evidence linking the beneficial and harmful activities of ICI-targeted immunotherapy, recent mechanistic insights focusing on the gut microbiome and Th17 cells, as well as strategies to attenuate IRAEs in the setting of retention of therapeutic activity, therefore represent the major thrusts of this review.Copyright © 2019 Anderson, Theron and Rapoport.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648568>Updates and advancements in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy.</a></h1><p>: The -year recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatic resection or local ablation is up to 70%.

The resulting increase in immunologic activity is responsible for a variety of adverse cutaneous reactions, which sometimes include neutrophilic dermatoses. We queried the PubMed database for existing cases of  inhibitors causing neutrophilic dermatoses. The literature search identified four cases of Sweet syndrome, four cases of pustular eruptions, two cases of pyoderma gangrenosum, and one case of bullous lupus erythematosus secondary to  inhibitors. All neutrophilic dermatoses were treated with topical or systemic steroids and most (9 of 11) completely resolved.

CAFs have frequent opportunities to interact with  cells infiltrating the tumor stroma, but the process remains to be determined. In this study, we focused on   mechanism. We also examined the induction of programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on CAFs by  , and the clinical significance of PD-L1-expressed CAFs in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC).CAFs were isolated from human NSCLC tissues, and PD-L1 expression levels in CAFs were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow-cytometry. Following immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 in surgically resected pN0M0 NSCLC (n = 125, including 88 invasive adenocarcinomas and 37 squamous  carcinomas), the correlation of PD-L1-positive CAFs with clinicopathological features was investigated.PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression on CAFs was upregulated by exogenously supplemented interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and downregulated through the depletion of IFN-γ. PD-L1 expression on CAFs was upregulated by co-culture with activated lymphocytes releasing IFN-γ. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PD-L1-positive CAFs were observed in 31 cases (24.8%). Postoperative relapse-free survival was significantly prolonged in patients with PD-L1-positive CAFs as compared with those with PD-L1-negative CAFs, with -year relapse-free probabilities of 84.% and 66.3%, respectively (P = 0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression on CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of longer relapse-free survival after surgery (hazard ratio: 3.225, P = 0.027).PD-L1 expression on CAFs is reversibly regulated by environmental stimuli including IFN-γ from activated lymphocytes. In the non-metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 expression on CAFs suggests the induction of anti-tumor  responses, contributing to better prognosis after surgery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

[10.] years; 1168 [57.8%] men), 1031 patients in TCGA cohort (mean [SD] age, 66.2 [9.] years; 579 [56.2%] men), 1527 patients in the MSKCC cohort (662 [43.4%] men), 350 patients in the MSKCC cohort who were treated with ICIs (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [13.8] years; 170 [48.6%] men), and 853 patients in the POPLAR and OAK cohort (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [9.1] years; 527 [61.8%] men). Sites of TP53 and ATM comutation were found scattered throughout the genes, and no significant difference was observed in the frequency of TP53 and ATM comutation within the histologic subtypes and driver genes. In  independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC, TP53 and ATM comutation was associated with a significantly higher tumor mutation burden compared with the sole mutation and with no mutation (TCGA, MSKCC, Geneplus, and POPLAR and OAK cohort). Among patients treated with ICIs in the MSKCC cohort, TP53 and ATM comutation was associated with better OS than a single mutation and no mutation among patients with any cancer (median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, not reached; TP53 mutation alone, 14.0 months; ATM mutation alone, 40.0 months; no mutation, 22.0 months; P = .001; NSCLC median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, not reached; TP53 mutation alone, 11.0 months; ATM mutation alone, 16.0 months; no mutation, 14.0 months; P = .24). Similar results were found in the POPLAR and OAK cohort in which the disease control benefit rate, progression-free survival, and OS were all greater in patients with the TP53 and ATM comutation compared with the other 3 groups (median progression-free survival: TP53 and ATM comutation, 10.4 months; TP53 mutation, 1.6 months; ATM mutation, 3. months; no mutation, 2.8 months; P = .01; median OS: TP53 and ATM comutation, 22.1 months; TP53 mutation, 8.3 months; ATM mutation, 15.8 months; no mutation, 15.3 months; P = .002).This study's findings suggest that the TP53 and ATM comutation occurs in a subgroup of patients with NSCLC and is associated with an increased tumor mutation burden and response to ICIs. This suggests that TP53 and ATM comutation may have implications as a biomarker for guiding ICI treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501271>Nivolumab for the Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Clear  Renal  Carcinoma (nccRCC): A Single-Institutional Experience and Literature Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal  carcinoma (RCC) who received prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKI) and those who are treatment naive, respectively. However, the clinical activity of nivolumab in non-clear  RCC (nccRCC) is unknown, as these patients were excluded from the trials.We reviewed the records of patients who received nivolumab for nccRCC and ccRCC with >20% rhabdoid with the primary endpoint to assess the objective response rate (ORR). We assessed radiographic response using RECIST, v1.1. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We also reviewed the literature to identify studies reporting on the clinical activity of   inhibitors in nccRCC, and performed a meta-analysis of proportions for ORR and disease control rate (DCR).Twelve patients (30%) had papillary histology, 11 (27.%) had unclassified, 8 (20%) had ccRCC with rhabdoid component,  (12.%) had chromophobe, 3 (7.%) had translocation, and 1 (2.%) had mucinous tubular and spindle  carcinoma. Overall, seven patients (21.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.7%-37.9%) had an objective response, including three patients (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-23.7%) who achieved a complete remission. At a median follow-up of 24. monoths (95% CI, 17.7-32.6), median PFS was 4.9 monoths (95% CI, 3.53-10.27) and median OS was 21.7 monoths (95% CI, 7.83 mo to not reached). There were no treatment-related deaths. We also identified two retrospective studies reporting best ORR in patients with nccRCC receiving PD-1/PD-L1  blockade. The ORR and DCR for the total cohort were, respectively, 18.6% (95% CI, 11.9%-26.4%) and 53.4% (95% CI, 44.2%-62.%).Nivolumab demonstrated activity in unclassified nccRCC and ccRCC with >20% rhabdoid; further randomized clinical trials are warranted.This article reports on the clinical activity and safety of   inhibitors in non-clear  kidney cancer.

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the primary ligand of PD-1 and is constitutively expressed on antigen presenting cells, mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells. In addition, PD-L1 is also expressed on a wide range of tumor cells, including lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. PD-1 and PD-L1 are important members of the immunoglobulin super-family and participate in  regulation. In the present study, the -suppressive effects of a number of tumor  lines were determined. The breast tumor  lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 displayed the largest inhibitory effects on T- activation and cytokine secretion in a co-culture system. The HepG2, A549 and A375 cells displayed limited inhibitory effects. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressed the highest level of PD-L1 among the cells used, which may explain their higher immuno-suppressive effects. Compound A0-L, a small molecule inhibitor of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, restored T  functions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the tumor cells with higher levels of PD-L1 expression suppressed signaling pathways involved in T- activation, such as the T- receptor- zeta chain of T  receptor associated protein kinase ZAP70-RAS-GTPase-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases and CD28-PI3K-Akt serine/threonine kinases pathways. These findings suggest that tumor cells with higher expression levels of PD-L1 may exhibit higher immuno-suppressive activity, and that drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction may have improved therapeutic effects on tumors expressing higher levels of PD-L1.Copyright: © Zheng et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453084>Severe tracheal stenosis after first administration of pembrolizumab rescued by Dumon Y-stent in a lung cancer patient.</a></h1><p>A 70-year-old woman diagnosed with advanced, non-resectable programmed  death ligand 1-positive-non-small- lung carcinoma was treated with pembrolizumab as first-line therapy.

We sought to determine the frequency, severity, cause, and predictors of AKI in a real-world population receiving  inhibitors.We included all patients who received  inhibitor therapy from May 2011 to December 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Baseline serum creatinine, averaged 6 months before  inhibitor start date, was compared with all subsequent creatinine values within 12 months of starting therapy. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria for fold changes in creatinine from baseline. Sustained AKI events lasted at least 3 days and was our primary outcome. The cause of sustained AKI was determined by chart review. Cumulative incidence and subdistribution hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline demographics, comorbidities, and medications, and sustained AKI and potential  inhibitor-related AKI.We included 1016 patients in the analysis. Average age was 63 (SD 13) years, 61% were men, and 91% were white. Mean baseline creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl (SD 0.4 mg/dl), and 169 (17%) had CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m) at baseline. A total of 169 patients (17%) experienced AKI, defined by an increase in creatinine at least 1. times the baseline within 12 months; 82 patients (8%) experienced sustained AKI and 30 patients (3%) had potential  inhibitor-related AKI. The first episode of sustained AKI occurred, on average, 106 days (SD 85) after  inhibitor initiation. Sixteen (2%) patients experienced stage 3 sustained AKI and four patients required dialysis. Proton pump inhibitor use at baseline was associated with sustained AKI.AKI is common in patients receiving  inhibitor therapy. The causes of sustained AKI in this population are heterogenous and merit thorough evaluation. The role of PPI and other nephritis-inducing drugs in the development of sustained AKI needs to be better defined.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616560>Nivolumab-induced cholangitis in patients with non-small  lung cancer: Case series and a review of literature.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs), including nivolumab, have exhibited substantial benefits in the treatment of several types of cancers. However, treatment with ICIs is often accompanied by -related adverse events (irAEs), and a clear understanding of the precise indications and management of irAEs is important for harnessing the full potential of these agents. While skin- or gastrointestinal-associated irAEs have been relatively well studied, there are few reports regarding nivolumab-induced cholangitis. We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with advanced or recurrent non-small  lung cancer who were treated with nivolumab between December 2015 and December 2018 at Tottori University in Japan. Among the 59 patients, we identified four patients who experienced nivolumab-induced cholangitis. Of these four patients, stable disease (SD) was observed in two patients (50%), while partial response (PR) was achieved in two patients (50%) under nivolumab treatment. Patients were treated with corticosteroid alone (n=2) or in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (n=2); these treatments resulted in improvements in nivolumab-induced cholangitis in three patients. In conclusion, the present retrospective study identified four cases of nivolumab-induced cholangitis. The combination of corticosteroid and MMF was effective in two cases with grade 4 nivolumab-induced cholangitis. Further reports are needed to establish the optimal management of patients with this irAE.Copyright: © Izumi et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653980> subtyping of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma: a new biomarker and an  shift during disease progression.</a></h1><p>Extranodal NK/T- lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although some extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients have shown responses to   blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patient response to immunotherapy have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor  microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 -related genes and characterized the  cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an  subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor  microenvironment subgroups were named  tolerance,  evasion-A,  evasion-B, and  silenced. The  tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T- lymphoma. The  evasion group showed high cytotoxic T- counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the -silenced group, almost all  responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor  microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor  microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the  tolerance group, 60% (3/) in the  evasion group, and 0% (0/) in the -silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T- lymphoma into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system. In conclusion, we propose that the tumor  microenvironment of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31394557>Thymic malignancies: emerging systemic therapies.</a></h1><p>The management of thymic malignancies is based on multidisciplinary collaboration. Systemic agents may be administered as an exclusive treatment if local treatment is not achievable. Novel and innovative agents are needed. Integrated genomic analyses reported the activation of targetable signaling pathways in thymomas and thymic carcinomas.Phase II trials reported the antitumor activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase inhibitors, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, and antiangiogenic agents in advanced, refractory thymic malignancies. Meanwhile, a major challenge is the use of   inhibitors, given the frequent association of those tumors with autoimmune disorders.Although those innovative agents were assessed in phase II trials reporting on variable antitumor efficacy in terms of response and survival, in selected and limited cohorts of patients, a better understanding of systemic treatment sequences in a real-life setting is mandatory to analyze the actual efficacy of each line of treatment one after another, define the best clinical-pathological selection of patients for the administration of chemotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapy, and develop individualized decision-making to optimize the survival of patients with advanced thymic malignancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586491>Prognostic significance of PD-L1 protein expression and copy number gains in locally advanced cervical cancer.</a></h1><p>Although   inhibitors against programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have demonstrated promising results in several solid malignancies, including cervical cancer, there are some limitations to using PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression as a predictive biomarker for selecting patients who may benefit from such therapy.To examine the protein expression and genetic status of PD?L1 with clinical outcomes in locally advanced cer- vical cancer.We investigated the PD-L1 gene copy number gains assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PD-L1 expression using immunohistochemistry in 123 patients with locally advanced cervical cancers between December 2008 and December 2016.The prevalence of PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression was detected in 103/123(83%) cases. PD-L1 gene am- plification and polysomy were detected in 7% and 40% of cases, respectively. PD-L1 gene amplification and polysomy were associated with positive PD-L1 immunostaining (score 1+ to 3+) in 88% and 68% of cases, respectively. Clinically, PD-L1 immunopositivity was associated with parametrial invasion at diagnosis. In contrast, PD-L1 polysomy was associated with parametrial invasion and FIGO stages III-IV, whereas PD-L1 amplification was associated with nodal metastasis. In multi- variate analysis, PD-L1 amplification was predictive of worse RFS (HR, .68; 95%CI, 1.98-16.28; p = 0.001), whereas PD-L1 polysomy was predictive of worse LRR (HR, 4.13; 95%CI, 1.63-10.49; p = 0.003). PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression was not associated with worse outcomes in Cox models.Our results showed that an increase in PD-L1 gene copy number could be a novel prognostic and possible predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519206>Clinical and  profiling for cancer of unknown primary site.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) confer a survival benefit in many cancer types. Given that the survival outcome for cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) remains poor, we investigated the potential of CUP for immunotherapy.A total of 164 patients with CUP (favorable subset, 34 patients; unfavorable subset, 130 patients) who were treated between January 2009 and March 2017 was identified from a review of medical records at Kindai University Hospital. They included 92 patients for whom pretreatment tumor tissue was available both for determination of programmed  death-ligand 1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and for -related gene expression profiling (irGEP). The results of irGEP for CUP were compared with published data for ICI-treated solid cancers classified into progressive disease (PD) and non-PD subsets according to their best response to ICIs.The median overall survival of all CUP patients was 29.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.7-not reached) and 7.1 months (95% CI, .0-9.4) for favorable and unfavorable subsets, respectively. IHC and irGEP revealed that pretreatment  activity-including expression of   molecules-for CUP was similar to that for ICI-responsive malignancies (antitumor   signatures: CUP versus PD, P = 0.002-0.067; CUP versus non-PD, P = 0.591-0.999), although VEGFA expression was associated with suppression of antitumor immunity in CUP (P = 0.008, false discovery rate = 0.010). In addition, one case of CUP in the unfavorable subset that was associated with prominent PD-L1 expression on TILs and showed a durable response to nivolumab is presented.The survival outcome of CUP remains unsatisfactory. However, our clinical and  profiling of CUP has revealed a potential to benefit from immunotherapy, with ICIs thus being a potential option for CUP treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611635>A pilot trial of pembrolizumab plus prostatic cryotherapy for men with newly diagnosed oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.</a></h1><p>Monotherapy with   inhibitors has generally been unsuccessful in men with advanced prostate cancer. Preclinical data support the notion that cryotherapy may improve -mediated and anti-tumor responses. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of whole-prostate gland cryotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and androgen deprivation in men with oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.This single-institution, pilot trial recruited 12 patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer between 2015 and 2016. Patients underwent whole-prostate cryoablation combined with short-term androgen deprivation (eight months) and pembrolizumab (6 doses). The primary clinical endpoints were the number of patients with a PSA level of <0.6 ng/mL at one year and the frequency of adverse events. Other outcome measures included progression-free survival and systemic therapy-free survival. Exploratory analyses included PD-L1 protein expression.Forty two percent (/12) of patients had a PSAs of <0.6 ng/mL at one year though only 2 of these patients had recovered their testosterone at this time point. Median progression-free survival was 14 months, and median systemic therapy-free survival was 17. months. PD-L1 expression was not detectable by IHC in patients with evaluable tissue. All adverse events were grade ≤2, and there were no apparent complications from cryotherapy.Whole-prostate cryoablation combined with short-term androgen deprivation and pembrolizumab treatment was well tolerated and no safety concerns were observed in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Though local disease appeared effectively treated in the majority of men, the regimen only infrequency led to sustained disease control following testosterone recovery.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414534>Letter:   inhibitor-induced colitis-shouldn't we be checking more often?

We prospectively monitored blood  cells from 35 patients with advanced non-small  lung cancer undergoing  inhibitor monotherapy. The aim was to identify parameters correlating with better/worse outcome. Peripheral blood was serially collected before each infusion at the onset and at  3 and  of immunotherapy. A complete leukocyte blood count, the lymphocytic subpopulations and the percentages of both HLA-DR monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) were monitored. Disease control was defined as partial/complete response and stable disease on computed tomography scan according to RECIST 1.1. The predictive value of the   parameters investigated was evaluated by patients' survival analysis. Forty percent of patients showed a clinical response, and the global median overall survival was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval: 3.-10.). Patients with an initial neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥.2, and/or an amount of HLA-DR monocytes ≥11% and/or a total DC level ≤0.4% of leukocytes did rarely respond to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Otherwise, the immunotherapy-induced decrease of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and/or HLA-DR monocytes and the increase of total DC frequencies were correlated with improved therapy response and prolonged overall survival. Blood values in the third  of immunotherapy did already reflect the effects observed. On the basis of the 3   parameters identified we created 3 different variants of scores that enable to stratify patients into groups of risk/therapy response. Our results warrant further investigation in larger prospective clinical trials for validation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578439>RNA Transcription and Splicing Errors as a Source of Cancer Frameshift Neoantigens for Vaccines.</a></h1><p>The success of  inhibitors in cancer therapy is largely attributed to activating the patient's  response to their tumor's neoantigens arising from DNA mutations. This realization has motivated the interest in personal cancer vaccines based on sequencing the patient's tumor DNA to discover neoantigens. Here we propose an additional, unrecognized source of tumor neoantigens. We show that errors in transcription of microsatellites (MS) and mis-splicing of exons create highly immunogenic frameshift (FS) neoantigens in tumors. The sequence of these FS neoantigens are predictable, allowing creation of a peptide array representing all possible neoantigen FS peptides. This array can be used to detect the antibody response in a patient to the FS peptides. A survey of  types of cancers reveals peptides that are personally reactive for each patient. This source of neoantigens and the method to discover them may be useful in developing cancer vaccines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612329>Perioperative chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer in Japan: current and future perspectives.</a></h1><p>The standard treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer differs across the world. In western countries, perioperative chemotherapy or postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy are the preferred treatment options, whereas in Asia, D2 gastrectomy followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is standard. In Japan, adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 is the standard treatment for pStage II gastric cancer, whereas adjuvant chemotherapy with a doublet regimen is preferred for pStage III gastric cancer. The efficacy of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy using S-1 plus cisplatin, has been investigated in selected patients with expected poor survival outcomes. To expand the indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of preoperative S-1 plus oxaliplatin in patients with cStage III (cT3-4N1-3) gastric cancer (JCOG1509) is ongoing in Japan. The addition of   inhibitors to cytotoxic chemotherapy also seems promising and is being investigated in international randomized clinical trials.

The times to onset and fatality rates of myocarditis following different ICI regimens were also compared.A total of 315 reports of myocarditis adverse events were identified with ICIs. Among 6 ICI monotherapies, avelumab had the highest association with myocarditis based on the highest reporting odds ratio (ROR = 42.65, 95% two-sided CI = 15.86-114.72), proportional reporting ratio (PRR = 42.61, χ2 = 159.63) and empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM = 41.87, 95% one-sided CI = 15.57). The combination therapies of ipilimumab plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab had higher RORs, PRRs and EBGMs than did pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Myocarditis associated with the ipilimumab plus nivolumab treatment appeared to have earlier onset (16.

Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of -related liver dysfunction between in patients treated by programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors exclusively and chemotherapy.  A comprehensive search of multiple databases identified eligible studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusively and chemotherapy in patients with different solid tumors was carried out. The elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartic aminotransferase (AST) were used to evaluate liver dysfunction. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and analyzed by Review Manager .3 and STATA version 12.0 statistical software.  After screening and eligibility assessment, a total of 5638 patients from 12 RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. In comparison with chemotherapy, patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusively showed an increased incidence of all-grade ALT/AST elevations (ALT: RR, 1.52, 95% CI, 1.09-2.13;  = 0.01; AST: RR, 1.96, 95% CI, 1.37-2.81;  0.0002). Patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors showed the significantly higher risk of all-grade ALT/AST elevations incidence than those receiving chemotherapy (ALT: RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05-2.07;  0.03; AST: RR, 1.90, 95% CI, 1.32-2.73;  = 0.0005). However, no significant difference was found between PD-L1 inhibitor and chemotherapy group. Moreover, for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC), patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusively exhibited a significant higher risk of all-grade ALT elevation incidence (NSCLC: RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.23-3.02;  = 0.004; UC: RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.12-10.06,  = 0.03) and all-grade AST elevation incidence (NSCLC: RR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.45-3.87,  = 0.0005; UC: RR, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.30-15.38,  0.02) than chemotherapy.  The meta-analysis confirms that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors exclusive pose an increased risk of -related liver dysfunction than chemotherapy. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in NSCLC and UC increase the risk of -related liver dysfunction, but not in melanoma (MM) and head-neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC).Copyright © 2019 Deng, Yang, Shu, Lang and Lu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31386608>-Related Adverse Events Requiring Hospitalization: Spectrum of Toxicity, Treatment, and Outcomes.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) cause -related adverse events (irAEs). The proportion of patients who are hospitalized for irAEs and their spectrum, management, and outcomes are not well described.We report the proportion of hospitalized patients in an academic center who were treated with ICIs from May to December 2017. Patient characteristics, toxicities, management, and outcomes for confirmed irAE admissions are reported. Associations between patient features and irAE hospitalizations are examined.Twenty-three percent (n = 100) of 443 patients who were admitted to an academic oncology center over 6 months had ever received ICIs. Of these patients, 41% were admitted for suspected irAEs and 23% were confirmed irAEs. IrAEs accounted for % of all oncology hospitalizations (n = 23). Ninety-one percent of patients with confirmed irAEs prompted a medicine subspecialist consultation, most commonly gastroenterology (22%). Fifteen patients (65%) had their irAEs improve/resolve, seven (30%) had worsening irAEs, and three (13%) died of their irAEs. The majority of patients (n = 20; 87%) discontinued ICIs after discharge. Among ICI-treated patients who required admission, an increased likelihood of irAE-related hospitalization was associated with patient age older than 65 years (odds ratio, .4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 17.8) and receipt of combination immunotherapy (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 2.0 to 23.2).A notable proportion of ICI-treated patients are hospitalized for irAEs, and these patients have a high demand for multidisciplinary management. Older age and combination ICI treatment were associated with an increased risk of irAE-related hospitalization. Whereas these data are from an academic center and include patients in clinical trials, with expanding use of ICIs, these data have important implications for inpatient service planning and risk stratification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494725>Microsatellite instability and   inhibitors: toward precision medicine against gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers.</a></h1><p>Recent innovations in the next-generation sequencing technologies have unveiled that the accumulation of genetic alterations results in the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. Accurate and timely repair of DNA is, therefore, essential for maintaining genetic stability. Among various DNA repair pathways, the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway plays a pivotal role. MMR deficiency leads to a molecular feature of microsatellite instability (MSI) and predisposes to cancer. Recent studies revealed that MSI-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors, regardless of their primary site, have a promising response to   inhibitors (ICIs), leading to the approval of the anti-programmed  death protein 1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab for the treatment of advanced or recurrent MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors that continue to progress after conventional chemotherapies. This new indication marks a paradigm shift in the therapeutic strategy of cancers; however, when considering the optimum indication for ICIs and their safe and effective usage, it is important for clinicians to understand the genetic and immunologic features of each tumor. In this review, we describe the molecular basis of the MMR pathway, diagnostics of MSI status, and the clinical importance of MSI status and the tumor mutation burden in developing therapeutic strategies against gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary malignancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648184>  inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction: a disproportionality analysis using the WHO adverse drug reaction database VigiBase.</a></h1><p>Our study aimed to identify and characterize thyroid dysfunctions associated with immume  inhibitors (ICIs).Data were obtained from VigiBase, between January 1, 2011 to March 6, 2019.All thyroid drug-adverse events are classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were considered as measures of disproportionality for the assessment of association between ICIs and thyroid dysfunctions. We used IC to identify meaningful drug-adverse events while using ROR to compare differences in the reporting of drug-adverse events caused by different ICI subgroups. Positive IC values are deemed significant.Compared with the full database, the following ICI-associated thyroid dysfunctions were over-reported: hypothyroidism (1125 reports for ICIs vs 12495 for all drugs; Information Component 4.28 [95% CI 4.18-4.35]), hyperthyroidism (926 vs 7538; 4.66 [95% CI 4.55-4.74]), thyroiditis (294 vs 1237; .40 [95% CI .21-.54]), thyrotoxic crisis (11 vs 288; 3.55 [95% CI 2.61-4.20]). Hypothyroidism was over-reported for patients treated with ICI combination therapy versus those treated with ICI monotherapy (ROR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), and the same was observed for hyperthyroidism (ROR 1.9 [95% CI 1.-2.4]), thyroiditis (ROR 3.3 [95% CI 2.3-4.8]), thyrotoxic crisis (ROR 11. [95% CI 2.4-53.8]). All 11 thyrotoxic crisis cases were malignant melanoma patients, of which 7 occurred under ICI combination therapy.Thyroid dysfunction may occur after ICI therapies, and severe thyrotoxic crisis may even occurs. Raising awareness of ICI-associated thyroid dysfunction can improve the detection and treatment of these diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625630>Association of combined PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes features with survival and treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma.</a></h1><p>Recent advances obtained with   inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the Programmed  death-1 (PD-1) protein have significantly improved the outcome of patients with metastatic melanoma. The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry is a predictive biomarker in some solid tumors, but appears insufficient as prognostic or predictive factor of response to ICIs in metastatic melanomas.We investigated whether the presence and the features of pretreatment CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) could be a complementary prognostic or predictive biomarker in patients with metastatic melanoma.In this retrospective study, we evaluated the association of PD-L1 expression ≥% of tumor cells combined with TILs features (CD8, CD28, Ki67) with the overall survival (OS) among 51 patients treated with ICIs and 54 patients treated with other treatment options (non-ICIs).PD-L1 positivity was observed in 33% and 39% of primary melanomas and matched metastases, respectively, with, however, poor concordance between the primary and the matched metastatic site (κ=0.283). No significant association was noted between PD-L1 expression and CD8+TILs profile analyzed as single markers and OS or response to immunotherapy. Instead, their combined analysis in primary melanoma samples showed that the PD-L1-/CD8+ status was significantly associated with prolonged OS in the whole population (P=0.04) and in the subgroup treated with non-ICIs (P=0.009). Conversely, the PD-L1+/CD8+ status was a good prognostic factor in patients treated with ICIs (P=0.022), whereas was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with non-ICIs (P=0.014). While the expression of CD28 was not related to outcome, the Ki67 expression was significantly associated to poor OS in the subgroup CD8+TIL+/PD-L1- (P=0.02).The pre-treatment combination of PD-L1 expression with the level of CD8+TILs could better assess OS and predict therapeutic response of patients with metastatic melanoma treated either by immunotherapy or other treatments regimens.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522865>Pathologic response and surgical outcomes in patients undergoing nephrectomy following receipt of   inhibitors for renal  carcinoma.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the pathologic response, safety, and feasibility of nephrectomy following receipt of   inhibition (ICI) for renal  carcinoma (RCC).Patients who underwent nephrectomy for RCC after exposure to nivolumab monotherapy or combination ipilimumab/nivolumab were reviewed. Primary surgical outcomes included operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), readmission rates, and complication rates. Pathologic response in the primary and metastatic sites constituted secondary outcomes.Eleven nephrectomies (10 radical, 1 partial) were performed in 10 patients after ICI with median postoperative follow-up 180 days. Six patients received 1 to 4 cycles of ipilimumab/nivolumab, while  received 2 to 12 infusions of nivolumab preoperatively. Five surgeries were performed laparoscopically, and 4 patients underwent concomitant thrombectomy. One patient exhibited complete response (pT0) to ICI, and 3/4 patients who underwent metastasectomy for hepatic, pulmonary, or adrenal lesions exhibited no detectable malignancy in any of the metastases resected. No patients experienced any major intraoperative complications, and all surgical margins were negative. Median OT, EBL, and LOS were 180 minutes, 100 ml, and 4 days, respectively. Four patients experienced a complication, including 3 that were addressed with interventional radiology procedures. One patient died of progressive disease >3 months after surgery, and 1 patient succumbed to pulmonary embolism complicated by sepsis. No complications or readmissions were noted in 6 patients.Nephrectomy following ICI for RCC is safe and technically feasible with favorable surgical outcomes and pathologic response. Timing of the nephrectomy relative to  dosing did not seem to impact outcome. Biopsies of lesions responding radiographically to ICI may warrant attention prior to surgical excision.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
