The peculiarities of their immunoregulatory effects are demonstrated with two of the six synthesized MPs, MP-1 (-Leu-Gly--Pro-) and MP-2 (Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp). It is shown that MP action is directed to the damaged links of immunity. MP-1 enhances a decreased level of antibody production in cyclophosphamide (Cy)-treated mice, but does not influence the antibody formation in normal animals. MP-2 inhibits the tumor growth more in a tumor-bearing organism as the tumor size gets larger, insofar as MP-2 antitumor effect is concerned, by its ability to recover functional activity of T lymphocytes suppressed by tumor products. Selective immunocorrective effects of MPs are based on ligand-receptor interactions. Using FITC-labeled MP-1 and [3H]-labeled MP-2, specific binding of these peptides with appropriate cell populations is shown. The cytofluorimetric analysis revealed a target cell for MP-1--CD4+ T lymphocyte (T helper). The data obtained suggest that MPs are endogenic immunoregulators which participate in the maintenance of immune homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649778>In silico design of small peptides antagonist against leptin receptor for the treatment of obesity and its associated immune-mediated diseases.</a></h1><p>Excess adiposity in obese inhibits negatively impacts immune function and host defence. Obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. The impact of metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related co-morbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decades. Thus, treatment of obesity and its associated immune-mediated diseases is challenging due to impaired function of leptin system. These disorders are managed through antibiotics and by cytokines replacement. However, the effectiveness of cytokines coupled to the complexity of the cytokine network leads to severe side-effects, which can still occur after careful preclinical evaluation. In addition, synthetic immunotherapeutics carry a degree of risk, time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the complexity of existing therapy and adverse effects emphasizes the need for an alternative approach for the management of immune dysfunction associated with obesity. Computer-aided small molecule antibody technology has been successful in the design of novel biologicals for the diagnosis of diseases and therapeutic interventions. In this study, the crystal structure of leptin receptor (LEPR) complex with monoclonal antibody (9F8 Fab) was explored to predict Ag-Ab interactions using bioinformatics tools. The LEPR of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops were mutated with published positive control residues of Ser, , Tyr, Trp, and  to design a set of 678 peptides which were evaluated through Ag-peptide docking, binding free-energies, and interaction energies. Thus, hypothesized novel peptides can be explored as clinically applicable antagonists for the treatment of obesity and associated immune-mediated diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed effects of  (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass , fat percentage, and uterus  of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter , average individual fetal , fetal , and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7531575>Mapping thyroid peroxidase epitopes using recombinant protein fragments.</a></h1><p>The identification of autoantibody epitopes is important to the understanding of autoimmune thyroid diseases. In the case of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab), recent reports have disagreed about the number and type of autoantibody epitopes found in human TPO. In order to clarify the nature of these epitopes, we used an approach that provides recombinant human TPO produced by bacterial cells. The cDNA of four slightly overlapping fragments of human TPO-TPO 1(Glu 17-Ser 227), TPO 2(Tyr 226- 476), TPO 3(Glu 471-Ser 720) and TPO 4( 709-Leu 993)--were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the expression vector pMAL. In addition, a TPO 3 species for an alternatively spliced form of TPO of 876 amino acids was constructed (TPO 3M). Each of these constructs encodes a fusion protein, in which the amino terminal portion is maltose-binding protein, followed by the sequence of the fragment of human TPO. The plasmid constructs were transformed in Escherichia coli and, after growth, bacterial cells were harvested, lysed and the lysate was passed over an amylose affinity column and eluted with maltose. Western blots were performed using 33 sera from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (group 1) and 17 sera from patients with nodular goiter and focal thyroiditis (group 2), all positive for TPO-ab measured by radio-immunoassay; sera from 10 healthy people with no clinical evidence of thyroiditis and positive for TPO-ab measured by radioimmunoassay (group 3) and sera from 30 patients with antigastric parietal cell antibodies without signs or symptoms of thyroiditis, 16 negative for TPO-ab (group 4a) and 14 positive for TPO-ab (group 4b), were included in the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8899805>Identification of proxenin as a precursor of the peptide xenin with sequence homology to yeast and mammalian coat protein alpha.</a></h1><p>Proxenin a precursor of the bioactive peptide xenin, was isolated from canine pancreas by HPLC and identified by mass spectrometry and sequence analysis as a pentatriacontapeptide with a molecular  of 4035: Met Leu- Lys--Glu--Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Val-Lys-Gly-Leu-Ser- -His-Pro-Lys-Arg-Pro-Trp.Ile-Leu--Ser-Leu-His-Asn-Gly-Val-Ile-Glo- Leu-OH. Treatment with pepsin cleaved off 10 C-terminal amino acids and released xenin. Data base search showed amino acid sequence homology of xenin and proxenin with the sequence of coal protein alpha of yeast (62%) and humans (100%). Concentration of the coatomer complex from rabbit liver led to an equimolar enrichment of extractable proxenin. We conclude, therefore, that xenin and proxenin are peptide sequences highly conserved during evolution within the alpha-subunit of the coatomer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24122785>Serine protease identification (in vitro) and molecular structure predictions (in silico) from a phytopathogenic fungus, Alternaria solani.</a></h1><p>Serine proteases are involved in an enormous number of biological processes. The present study aims at characterizing three-dimensional (3D) molecular architecture of serine proteases from early blight pathogen, Alternaria solani that are hypothesized to be markers of phytopathogenicity. A serine protease was purified to homogeneity and MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis revealed that protease produced by A. solani belongs to alkaline serine proteases (AsP). AsP is made up of 403 amino acid residues with molecular  of 42.1 kDa (Isoelectric point - 6.51) and its molecular formula was C1859 H2930 N516 O595 S4 . AsP structure model was built based on its comparative homology with serine protease using the program, MODELER. AsP had 16 β-sheets and 10 α-helices, with Ser(350) (G347-G357), Asp(158) (D158-H169), and His(193) (H193-G203) in separate turn/coil structures. Biological metal binding region situated near 6th-helix and His(193) residue is responsible for metal binding site. Also, calcium ion (Ca(2+)) is coordinated by the carboxyl groups of Lys(84), Ile(85), Lys(86), Asp(87), (88), Ala(89), Ala(90) (K84-A90) for first Ca(2+) binding site and carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys(244), Gly(245), Arg(246), (247), Lys(248), Lys(249), and Ala(250) (K244-A250), for second Ca(2+) binding site. Moreover, Ramachandran plot analysis of protein residues falling into most favored secondary structures were determined (83.3%). The predicted molecular 3D structural model was further verified using PROCHECK, ERRAT, and VADAR servers to confirm the geometry and stereo-chemical parameters of the molecular structural design. The functional analysis of AsP 3D molecular structure predictions familiar in the current study may provide a new perspective in the understanding and identification of antifungal protease inhibitor designing.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The molecular  of the purified peptide was found to be 9,853 Da and the amino acid sequences of the purified peptide was Met-Gln-Ile--Val-Lys--Leu--Gly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of APVPH I against H2O2-induced neuronal cells damage in PC-12 cells. Antioxidative enzyme levels in cultured neuronal cells were increased in the presence of the peptide. In addition, APVPH I inhibited productions of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and cell death against H2O2-induced neuronal cells damage in PC-12 cells. It was presumed to be APVPH I involved in regulating the apoptosis-related gene expression in the cell environment. Present results indicate APVPH I substantially contribute to antioxidative properties in neuronal cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8512070>A continuous fluorescence assay of renin activity.</a></h1><p>A sensitive fluorescence assay that employs a new fluorogenic peptide substrate has been developed to continuously measure the proteolytic activity of human renin. The substrate, DABCYL-gaba-Ile-His-Pro--His-Leu-Val-Ile-His--EDANS, has been designed to incorporate the renin cleavage site that occurs in the N-terminal peptide of human angiotensinogen. The assay relies upon resonance energy transfer-mediated, intramolecular fluorescence quenching that occurs in the intact peptide substrate. Efficient fluorescence quenching occurs as a result of favorable energetic overlap of the EDANS excited state and the DABCYL absorption, and the relatively long excited state lifetime of the EDANS fluorophore. Cleavage of the substrate by renin liberates the peptidyl-EDANS fragment from proximity with the DABCYL acceptor, restoring the higher, unattenuated fluorescence of the EDANS moiety. This leads to a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity, directly related to the extent of substrate consumed by renin cleavage. The kinetics of renin-catalyzed hydrolysis of this substrate have been shown to be consistent with a simple substrate inhibition model with a substrate Km approximately equal to 1.5 microM at physiological pH; Cleavage of the substrate occurs specifically at the Leu-Val bond and corresponds to the renin cleavage site of angiotensinogen, as reported earlier. In this report, we describe in detail the synthesis of the fluorogenic renin substrate and its application in assays of renin activity. Assay sensitivity has been evaluated by a series of enzyme dilution experiments using the continuous assay format, showing that the assay can detect renin as low as 30 ng/ml after a incubation of only 3-5 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8183950>Purification to homogeneity of an active opioid receptor from rat brain by affinity chromatography.</a></h1><p>Active opioid binding proteins were solubilized from rat brain membranes in high yield with sodium deoxycholate in the presence of NaCl. Purification of opioid binding proteins was accomplished by opioid antagonist affinity chromatography. Chromatography using the delta-opioid antagonist N,N-diallyl-Tyr-D-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu attached to omega-aminododecyl-agarose (Affi-G) (procedure A) yielded a partially purified protein that binds selectively the delta-opioid agonist [3H]Tyr-D-Ser-Gly--Leu- ([3H]DSLET), with a Kd of 19 +/- 3 nM and a Bmax of 5.1 +/- 0.4 nmol/mg of protein. Subsequently, Lens culinaris agglutinin-Sepharose 4B chromatography of the Affi-G eluate resulted in isolation of an electrophoretically homogeneous protein of 58 kDa that binds selectively [3H]DSLET with a Kd of 21 +/- 3 nM and a Bmax of 16.5 +/- 1.0 nmol/mg of protein. Chromatography using the nonselective antagonist 6-aminonaloxone coupled to 6-aminohexanoic acid-Sepharose 4B (Affi-NAL) (procedure B) resulted in isolation of a protein that binds selectively [3H]DSLET with a Kd of 32 +/- 2 nM and a Bmax of 12.4 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg of protein, and NaDodSO4/PAGE revealed a major band of apparent molecular mass 58 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies (Anti-R IgG) raised against the Affi-NAL protein inhibit the specific [3H]DSLET binding to the Affi-NAL eluate and to the solubilized membranes. Moreover, the Anti-R IgG inhibits the specific binding of radiolabeled Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-methyl--Gly-ol (DAMGO; mu-agonist), DSLET (delta-agonist), and naloxone to homogenates of rat brain membranes with equal potency. Furthermore, immunoaffinity chromatography of solubilized membranes resulted in the retention of a major protein of apparent molecular mass 58 kDa. In addition, immunoblotting of solubilized membranes and purified proteins from the Affi-G and Affi-NAL matrices revealed that the Anti-R IgG interacts with a protein of 58 kDa.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315826>Effect of extrusion processing of soybean meal on ileal amino acid digestibility and growth performance of broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>The present experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of extrusion of inadequately processed soybean meal (SBM) on amino acid (AA) digestibility and performance of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of Lys, , Cys, Leu, , Tyr, Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily  gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117172>Preparation and Identification of Antioxidative Peptides from Pacific Herring () Protein.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to isolate and purify antioxidative peptides from Pacific herring () protein. Five enzymes (pepsin, trypsin, papain, flavourzyme, and neutrase) were used for protein hydrolysis, and Pacific herring protein hydrolysates (PHPH) were separated by ultrafiltration. The fraction with the molecular  below 3500 Da exhibited the highest in vitro antioxidant activities and cellular antioxidant activity. The PHPH was isolated and purified by consecutive chromatographic methods including gel filtration chromatography and reverse high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The purified antioxidant peptides were identified as Leu-His-Asp-Glu-Leu- (MW = 726.35 Da) and Lys-Glu-Glu-Lys--Glu (MW = 808.40 Da), and the IC values of cellular antioxidant activity were 1.19 ± 0.05 mg/mL and 1.04 ± 0.06 mg/mL.

Chondrostean fish, such as the Acipenseridae (sturgeon), though without a distinct urophysis, also have a caudal neurosecretory system, which has been indicated by bioassay and immunological evidence to contain UII-like peptides. In the present studies, we investigated by UII radioimmunoassay the UII-like peptides in the spinal cord of three Acipenser species, and isolated and sequenced UII from one of them. As expected, much more UII immunoreactivity (UII-IR) was found in caudal than in anterior spinal cord extracts. In addition, caudal extracts from A. ruthenus were found to contain much more UII-IR (whether determined on a UII-IR/ or UII-IR/fish basis) than those from the larger A. stellatus and A. guldenstadti. UII was therefore isolated from A. ruthenus and its amino acid sequence was shown to be H-Gly-Ser--Ser-Glu-Cys--Trp-Lys-Tyr-Cys-Val-OH. This sequence is identical at positions 6-11 (the disulfide ring) with the known teleost UII peptides, and has acidic and hydrophobic amino acids at positions 5 and 12, respectively, as do the teleost UII peptides. Overall sequence identity with the various forms of teleost UII was 58-83%.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19504181>Relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms of the H-FABP gene and slaughter and meat quality traits in chicken.</a></h1><p>Using PCR-SSCP with five primer pairs, we detected six single nucleotide polymorphisms of the H-FABP gene: 332G --> A, 534G --> A, 783C --> T, 835C --> T, 1198T --> C, and 2329C --> T. Chi-square results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in genotype frequency among breeds in Fragment 1 and extremely significant differences (P < 0.01) in Fragments 2-4.

It was concluded that H-FABP was the major gene influencing slaughter performance and meat quality or was linked with the major gene in these strains and that the C783T mutation could be used as a candidate molecular genetic marker for breeding selection. The combination M1C2-B2B2-D1D1 is an ideal model for breeding in these strains because it can improve slaughter and meat quality traits.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12174287>Isolation, Purification and Characterization of a Group of Novel Small Molecular Ribosome Inactivating Protein -- LuffinS from Seeds of Luffa cylindrica.</a></h1><p>A group of novel RIPs--LuffinS(1), LuffinS(2), LuffinS(3) (MW about 8 kD) were purified by ammonia sulfate precipitation, CM-52 chromatography, HRLC size chromatography and Mono S FPLC.

Average initial  were 10.7, 10.5, 9.1, 10.2, and 10.9 kg in Exp. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The nine treatments in Exp. 1 were 1) Basal (B, 12% CP), 2) B + .26% methionine (Met), 3) B + .24% histidine (His), 4) B + .21% isoleucine (Ile), 5) B + .12% tryptophan (Trp), 6) B + .24% valine (Val), 7) B+Met+His, 8) B+Met+His+Ile+Trp+Val (AllAA), and 9) S-SBM positive control (PC, 21.81% CP). All diets provided 1.10% Lys and .83% . Individual addition of His and Val to the B diet increased (P < .10) gain. The gain of pigs fed the AllAA diet did not differ (P > .10) from that of pigs fed the PC diet. Experiment 2 consisted of the nine treatments used in Exp. 1, except that Treatment 7 in Exp. 2 contained His+Val (H+V) rather than Met+His. Individual additions of Ile, Trp, and H+V increased (P < .10) gain/feed compared with the B diet. Performance of pigs fed the AllAA diet was not different (P > .10) from that of pigs fed the PC diet. Addition of NaHCO3 (Exp. 3),  (Exp. 4), or nonessential N (Exp. 5) to the AllAA diet did not affect (P > .10) pig performance compared with pigs fed the AllAA diet. However, in Exp. 3, pigs fed the PC diet grew faster (P < .03) and had greater (P < .10) apparent N digestibilities than pigs fed the AllAA diet.

Our previous studies have indicated that a region encompassing residues 6-11 (RKKIQF) and phospho--34, of phospho-DARPP-32, interacts with PP1. However, little is known about specific regions of inhibitor-2 that interact with PP1. We have now characterized in detail the interaction of phospho-DARPP-32 and inhibitor-2 with PP1. Mutagenesis studies indicate that within DARPP-32 -11 and Ile-9 play critical roles, with Lys-7 playing a lesser role in inhibition of PP1. Pro-33 and Pro-35 are also important, as is the number of amino acids between residues 7 and 11 and phospho--34. For inhibitor-2, deletion of amino acids 1-8 (I2-(9-204)) or 100-204 (I2-(1-99)) had little effect on the ability of the mutant proteins to inhibit PP1. Further deletion of residues 9-13 (I2-(14-204)) resulted in a large decrease in inhibitory potency (IC50 approximately 800 nM), whereas further COOH-terminal deletion (I2-(1-84)) caused a moderate decrease in inhibitory potency (IC50 approximately 10 nM). Within residues 9-13 (PIKGI), mutagenesis indicated that Ile-10, Lys-11, and Ile-13 play critical roles. The peptide I2-(6-20) antagonized the inhibition of PP-1 by inhibitor-2 but had no effect on inhibition by phospho-DARPP-32. In contrast, the peptide D32-(6-38) antagonized the inhibition of PP1 by phospho-DARPP-32, inhibitor-2, and I2-(1-120) but not I2-(85-204). These results indicate that distinct amino acid motifs contained within the NH2 termini of phospho-DARPP-32 (KKIQF, where italics indicate important residues) and inhibitor-2 (IKGI) are critical for inhibition of PP1. Moreover, residues 14-84 of inhibitor-2 and residues 6-38 of phospho-DARPP-32 share elements that are important for interaction with PP1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540110>Purification and characterization of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory peptides from the rotifer, Brachionus rotundiformis.</a></h1><p>Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide was isolated from the marine rotifer, Brachionus rotundiformis. ACE inhibitory peptides were separated from rotifer hydrolysate prepared by Alcalase, alpha-chymotrypsin, Neutrase, papain, and trypsin. The Alcalase hydrolysate had the highest ACE inhibitory activity compared to the other hydrolysates. The IC(50) value of Alcalase hydrolysate for ACE inhibitory activity was 0.63 mg/ml. We attempted to isolate ACE inhibitory peptides from Alcalase prepared rotifer hydrolysate using gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column and high performance liquid chromatography on an ODS column. The IC(50) value of purified ACE inhibitory peptide was 9.64 microM, and Lineweaver-Burk plots suggest that the peptide purified from rotifer protein acts as a competitive inhibitor against ACE. Amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as Asp-Asp--Gly-His-Asp--Glu-Asp--Gly-Glu-Ala-Met, with a molecular  1538 Da.

The exo-PGase was purified to homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, through sequential column chromatographies. The enzyme had a molecular  of approximately 45,000 and an isoelectric point of pH 5.8. The N-terminal sequence was Ser-Met-Gln-Lys-Ile-Lys-Asp-Glu-Ile-Leu-Lys--Leu-Lys-Val-Pro-Val- and had no sequence similarity to those of other pectinolytic enzymes reported to date. Maximum activity toward polygalacturonic acid (PGA) was observed at 60 degrees C and at pH 7.0 in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer without requiring any metal ions. When the chain length of oligogalacturonic acids increased, the apparent Km for them decreased, but the kcat values increased. This is the first bacterial exo-PGase that releases exclusively mono-galacturonic acid from PGA, di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-galacturonic acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690286>Isolation and characterisation of in vitro and cellular free radical scavenging peptides from corn peptide fractions.</a></h1><p>Corn gluten meal, a corn processing industry by-product, is a good source for the preparation of bioactive peptides due to its special amino acid composition. In the present study, the in vitro and cellular free radical scavenging activities of corn peptide fractions (CPFs) were investigated. Results indicated that CPF1 (molecular weight less than 1 kDa) and CPF2 (molecular weight between 1 and 3 kDa) exhibited good hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion radical and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Meanwhile, the in vitro radical scavenging activity of CPF1 was slightly higher than that of CPF2. Both CPF1 and CPF2 also exhibited significant cytoprotective effects and intracellular reactive  species scavenging activity in Caco-2 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The amino acid composition analysis revealed that the CPF were rich in hydrophobic amino acids, which comprised of more than 45% of total amino acids. An antioxidant peptide sequence of Tyr--Cys-Leu- (YFCLT) was identified from CPF1 using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS). The YFCLT exhibited excellent ABTS radical scavenging activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of 37.63 µM, which was much lower than that of Trolox. In conclusion, corn gluten meal might be a good source to prepare antioxidant peptides.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988118>Effects of feeding betaine-containing liquid supplement to transition dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Betaine is a natural compound found in sugar beets that serves as a methyl donor and organic osmolyte when fed to animals. The objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding betaine-containing molasses on performance of transition dairy cows during late summer in 2 trials. In early September, cows were randomly assigned to betaine (BET) or control (CON) groups either shortly after dry off (trial 1; n = 10 per treatment) or 24 d before calving (trial 2; n = 8 per treatment) based on parity and previous mature equivalent milk yield. Cows were fed common diets supplemented either with a liquid supplement made of molasses from sugar cane and condensed beet solubles containing betaine [BET, 89.1 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] or a sugar cane molasses-based liquid supplement without betaine (CON) until 8 wk postpartum. The liquid supplements had similar nutrient contents and were fed at a rate of 1.1 and 1.4 kg DM/d for pre- and postpartum cows, respectively. Starting at their entry in the studies, cows were housed in the same freestall barn without a cooling system. After calving, all cows were housed in the same barn cooled by misters and fans and milked thrice daily. Intake was recorded daily and  and  condition score were assessed every 2 wk. Milk yield was recorded at each milking and composition was analyzed weekly. Blood samples were collected weekly from a subset of cows to assess concentrations of metabolites and AA. No treatment effects were apparent for DM intake and  in the prepartum and postpartum periods. For cows enrolled at dry off, BET supported higher milk yield (45.1 vs. 41.9 kg/d) and fat content (4.78 vs. 4.34%) and elevated plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in early lactation compared to CON. However, no differences were observed for milk yield, most milk component contents and yields, and blood metabolites between treatments for cows enrolled during the close-up period. Compared to cows in the CON group, BET cows enrolled during the far-off period tended to have lower plasma concentrations of Met, , and Trp during the pre- and postpartum periods. They also had lower plasma concentrations of Lys and  before calving but higher plasma Gly concentration after parturition. In conclusion, feeding a betaine-containing liquid supplement from far-off through early lactation improves lactation performance but increases adipose tissue mobilization and production of ketone bodies in early lactation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

It binds iron and other transitional metals in vivo and in vitro and is postulated to play a role in their absorption and intracellular metabolism. The purpose of this study was to characterize mobilferrin.Mobilferrin was characterized by identification of the N-terminal amino acid sequence, two-dimensional protein electrophoresis, and studies of mobilferrin and homologues using anti-mobilferrin antibody and competitive metal binding.The N-terminal amino acid sequence of mobilferrin was Asp-Pro-Ala-Ile-Tyr--Lys-Glu-Gln--Leu-Asp-Gly-Asp-Ala-Ser-- and is a homologue of calreticulin (calregulin). The proteins had a similar molecular mass (56 kilodalton) and isoelectric point (4.7). Anti-mobilferrin antibodies react with calreticulin. Both proteins bind iron and calcium but have a greater affinity for iron.Mobilferrin and calreticulin are homologues that bind iron with greater affinity than calcium and other transitional metals. Competitive binding of metals by mobilferrin provides insight into the absorptive pathway shared by both essential and toxic transitional metals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11306139>Isolation and sequence determination of peptides in the venom of the spider wasp (Cyphononyx dorsalis) guided by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Micro-scale (sub-pmol) isolation and sequence determination of three peptides from the venom of the solitary spider wasp Cyphononyx dorsalis is described. We isolated two novel peptides Cd-125 and Cd-146 and a known peptide (6)-bradykinin from only two venom sacs of solitary spider wasp Cyphononyx dorsalis without bioassay-guided fractionation, but instead guided by MALDI-TOF MS. The MALDI-TOF MS analysis of each fraction showed the purity and molecular  of the components, which led to the isolation of the peptides virtually without loss of sample amount. The sequences of the novel peptides Cd-125 (Asp--Ala-Arg-Leu-Lys-Trp-His) and Cd-146 (Ser-Glu--Gly-Asn--Val--Val-Lys-Gly--Ser-Pro-Leu-Arg) were determined by Edman degradation together with mass spectrometry, and finally corroborated by solid-phase synthesis. The known peptide (6)-bradykinin (Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly---Pro--Arg) was identified by comparison with the synthetic authentic specimen. This is the first example for any kinins to be found in Pompilidae wasp venoms. The procedure reported here can be applicable to studies on many other components of solitary wasp venoms with limited sample availability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2153136>Two tumor necrosis factor-binding proteins purified from human urine. Evidence for immunological cross-reactivity with cell surface tumor necrosis factor receptors.</a></h1><p>Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were isolated from human urine by ligand (TNF)-affinity purification, followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The molecular  of the two proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were similar (about 30,000). Both proteins provided protection against the cytocidal effect of TNF in vitro and both bound TNF-alpha more effectively than TNF-beta. Antibodies raised against each of the proteins had an inhibitory effect on the binding of TNF to cells, suggesting that both proteins are structurally related to the TNF receptors. However, the two proteins differed in NH2-terminal amino acid sequences: Asp-Ser-Val-Cys-Pro- in one and Val-Ala---Pro- in the other. The NH2-terminal sequence of the former protein was invariable, while that of the latter was truncated to varying degrees. The two proteins were also immunologically distinct. The relative efficacy of anti-sera against the two proteins in inhibiting the binding of TNF to cells varied markedly from one line of cells to another. Evidence has been presented recently for the existence of two distinct molecular species of cell surface receptors for TNF and for differential expression of those two receptors by cells of different lines. The findings presented in this study are consistent with the notion that the urinary TNF-binding proteins constitute soluble forms of the two molecular species of the cell surface TNF receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2352290>Amino acid modification of proteins in regenerating sciatic nerves of rats.</a></h1><p>Recent experiments have shown that Arg, Lys, and Leu can be incorporated posttranslationally into proteins of regenerating sciatic nerves of rats. The present experiments investigate a mixture of 15 radioactive amino acids to determine if additional amino acids can be conjugated posttranslationally to proteins of regenerating nerves. Proteins of regenerating sciatic nerves of rats were able to incorporate Arg, Lys, Leu, Pro, Val, Ala, , and Ser in relatively large amounts and Asp, Glu, , Gly, Ile, His, and Tyr in relatively low or undetectable amounts, in the most advanced portion of the regenerating nerves. Two-dimensional SDS PAGE showed incorporation of the amino acid mixture into distinct radioactive peaks with molecular  in the 80-90 kD, 53-66 kD, 22-46 kD, and 17 kD ranges with isoelectric points between 5.0 and 7.9. Most of the amino acids were incorporated into proteins in all of the molecular  ranges. But Ser was incorporated in highest amounts in the 17 kD range, and Val was most abundant in the 22-46 kD range. In some cases results indicated that single proteins were modified by several amino acids. While we do not yet know which amino acids modify specific nerve proteins or the function of the modifications in nerve regeneration, these studies demonstrate the participation of some but not all amino acids in posttranslational modification reactions and the selective modification of specific groups of nerve proteins by these amino acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293344>The cardiovascular responses to mu opioid agonist and antagonist in conscious normal and obese rats.</a></h1><p>Beta-endorphin decreases blood pressure in normal rats but increases blood pressure in obese rats. Since beta-endorphins can bind both mu opioid and kappa-opioid receptors we investigated the effect of a mu specific receptor agonist, D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) and a mu specific antagonist, D--Cys-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP) on cardiovascular responses in conscious control and obese rats. Rats were also implanted with telemetry transmitters and intracerebroventricular (ICV) cannulas for recording and peptide administration. The mu agonist, DAMGO, increased blood pressure (BP) in control rats. DAMGO also increased BP in obese rats but only at high concentrations. The heart rate responses paralleled the MAP responses. CTAP, the mu antagonist, paradoxically increased the MAP in both control and obese rats. The responsiveness to the mu agonist and antagonist was greater in controls. In other animals the brains were excised and the ventral medial hypothalamic area removed and mu receptor expression determined using PCR. The expression of mu opioid receptors was increased in obese rats. We conclude that the mu opioids can stimulate cardiovascular responses, but the excitatory responsiveness was not increased in conscious obese rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7892245>Glycine reductase selenoprotein A is not a glycoprotein: the positive periodic acid-Schiff reagent test is the result of peptide bond cleavage and carbonyl group generation.</a></h1><p>The complete amino acid sequence of Clostridium sticklandii selenoprotein A, a selenocysteine-containing protein component of the glycine reductase complex, has been established. Both the intact protein and peptide fragments produced by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or trypsin were purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis and standard Edman degradation. Selenoprotein A consists of 157 amino acids with a chemical molecular  of 17,011, in reasonable agreement with the observed molecular  (17,022.7) determined from its ionization mass spectrum. The sequence of the amino-terminal region of the isolated native protein is Ser-Arg---Gly-Lys- Lys-Ile-Val-Ile-Ile-Gly-Asp-Arg-Asp-. An N-terminal methionine residue deduced from the gene sequence was not present. Although selenoprotein A reacted positively in a glycoprotein stain when using either the periodic acid-Schiff reagent procedure or a commercial glycan detection kit, no saccharide was detected by carbohydrate analyses after acid hydrolysis or methanolysis. Identity of the amino acid sequence determined by analysis with that deduced from the gene sequence is further evidence of the absence of bound carbohydrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15355531>Purification and characterization of an endopeptidase that has an important role in the carboxyl terminal processing of antihypertensive peptides in Lactobacillus helveticus CM4.</a></h1><p>To purify and characterize a peptidase that can catalyse C-terminal processing of antihypertensive peptide from Lactobacillus helveticus CM4.An endopeptidase which seems to process the carboxyl terminal end of two antihypertensive peptides, Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro, was purified from Lactobacillus helveticus CM4 by four stages of column chromatography, using synthetic pro-peptide as a substrate. The molecular  of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 67,000 by SEPHACRYL S-200 and 70,000 by SDS-PAGE analysis. The purified enzyme generated: (i) Val-Pro-Pro from Val-Pro-Pro--Leu and Val-Pro-Pro--Leu-Gln-Pro, and (ii) Ile-Pro-Pro from Ile-Pro-Pro-Leu- and Ile-Pro-Pro-Leu--Gln-, but theses peptides could not be generated from Val-Pro-Pro-, Val-Pro-Pro--Leu-Gln, Ile-Pro-Pro-Leu and Ile-Pro-Pro-Leu--Gln.

Gel permeation and reverse-phase HPLC fractionation of crude pancreatic extracts resolved a single molecular form of gull PP in each case. Purification of gull PP to homogeneity indicated that the mammalian PP antiserum employed was only 4% cross-reactive with this peptide. When radioimmunoassay data were corrected for this, the herring gull pancreas was found to contain 5 nmol PP/g wet wt. The molecular mass of gull PP was determined as 4237 +/- 2 Da by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectroscopy (PDMS). Gas-phase sequencing established unequivocally the entire primary structure of a 36-amino-acid residue peptide as Gly-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro--Tyr-Pro-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Pro-Val-Glu-Asp-Leu-Val- Arg- - Try-Asn-Asp-Leu-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Val-Val--Arg-His-Arg-Tyr. The computed molecular mass of this peptide (4235.6 Da) was in close agreement with that derived by PDMS. The primary structure of herring gull PP differs from that of the chicken in four residues at positions 3 (Val/Ser), 18 (Val/IIe), 22 (Asn/Asp), and 23 (Asp/Asn). Avian PP thus appears to be a highly conserved regulatory peptide.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985896>Amino acid sequence of an anti-tumor protein from Rana pipiens oocytes and early embryos.

The protein, provisionally named P-30 Protein, was purified to homogeneity from early embryos and characterized. It is a single-chain protein consisting of 104 amino acid residues in the following sequence: less than Glu1-Asp-Trp-Leu---Gln-Lys-Lys-His-Ile--Asn-- Arg15-Asp-Val-Asp-Cys-Asp-Ans-Ile-Met-Ser--Asn-Leu--His-C ys30-Lys-Asp-Lys - Asn---Ile-Tyr-Ser-Arg-Pro-Glu-Pro-Val-Lys45-Ala-Ile-Cys-Lys- Gly-Ile-Ile- Ala-Ser-Lys-Asn-Val-Leu--Thr60-Ser-Glu--Tyr-Leu-Ser-Asp -Cys-Asn-Val--Ser-Arg-Por-Cys75-Lys-Tyr-Lys-Leu-Lys-Lys-Ser- -Asn-Lys-- Cys-Val--Cys90-Glu-Asn-Gln-Ala-Pro-Val-His--Val-Gly-Val-Gly- Ser-Cys104-OH . Its molecular  calculated from the sequence is 11,819. The sequence homology clearly indicates that the protein belongs to the superfamily of pancreatic ribonuclease. It is also demonstrated that it indeed exhibits a ribonucleolytic activity against highly polymerized RNA and that this activity seems to be essential for its antiproliferative/cytotoxic effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8292014>The 100-kDa protein, whose phosphorylation precedes the fusion of chick embryonic myoblasts, is the eukaryotic elongation factor-2.</a></h1><p>We have previously shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the 100-kDa protein dramatically increases during the early period of myoblast fusion and inhibition of the protein phosphorylation prevents the fusion.

In this study, we have identified IRS-1 gene polymorphisms, evaluated their frequencies in Japanese subjects, and analysed the contribution of these polymorphisms to the development of NIDDM. The entire coding region of the IRS-1 gene of 94 subjects (47 NIDDM and 47 control subjects) was screened by polymerase chain reaction-single stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Seven SSCP polymorphisms were identified. These corresponded to two previously identified polymorphisms [Gly971 --> Arg (GGG --> AGG) and Ala804 (GCA --> GCG)] as well as five novel polymorphisms [Pro190 --> Arg (CCC --> CGC), Met209 -->  (ATG --> ACG), Ser809 -->  (TCT --> TTT), Leu142 (CTT --> CTC), and Gly625 (GGC --> GGT)]. Although the prevalence of each of these polymorphisms was not statistically different between NIDDM and control subjects, the prevalence of the four IRS-1 polymorphisms with an amino acid substitution together was significantly higher in NIDDM than in control subjects (23.4 vs 8.5%, p < 0.05), and two substitutions (Met 209 -->  and Ser809 --> ) were found only in NIDDM patients. Equilibrium glucose infusion rates during a euglycaemic clamp in NIDDM and control subjects with the IRS-1 polymorphisms decreased by 29.5 and 22.0%, respectively on the average when compared to those in comparable groups without polymorphisms, although they were not statistically significant. Thus, IRS-1 polymorphisms may contribute in part to the insulin resistance and development of NIDDM in Japanese subjects; however, they do not account for the major part of the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake which is observed in subjects with clinically apparent NIDDM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145747>Identification, structure-activity relationship and in silico molecular docking analyses of five novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides from stone fish (Actinopyga lecanora) hydrolysates.</a></h1><p>Stone fish is an under-utilized sea cucumber with many health benefits.

Five novel peptide sequences with molecular  (mw) < 1000 daltons (Da) were identified using LC-MS/MS. The peptides including Ala-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln--Tyr (794.44 Da), Lys-Val-Pro-Pro-Lys-Ala (638.88 Da), Leu-Ala-Pro-Pro--Met (628.85 Da), Glu-Val-Leu-Ile-Gln (600.77 Da) and Glu-His-Pro-Val-Leu (593.74 Da) were evaluated for ACE-inhibitory activity and showed IC50 values of 0.012 mM, 0.980 mM, 1.310 mM, 1.440 mM and 1.680 mM, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory effects of the peptides were further verified using molecular docking study.

The models included estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 and MX-1 and estrogen-sensitive MCF-7-MIII tumors. Nude mice bearing xenografts of these cancers were injected i.v. with 250 nmol/kg doses of cytotoxic radical AN-201, cytotoxic analog AN-238 or the unconjugated mixture of AN-201 and sst analog RC-121. Significant inhibition of growth of MDA-MB-231, MX-1 and MCF-7-MIII tumors was observed 1 week after injection of a single dose of cytotoxic analog AN-238. The volume of MDA-MB-231 tumors remained significantly decreased 3 weeks after treatment. The volumes and  of MCF-7-MIII tumors continued to be significantly reduced 60 days after therapy with AN-238. AN-238 also caused complete regression of MX-1 tumors in 5 of 10 animals, which remained tumor-free 60 days after treatment. In contrast, after treatment with cytotoxic radical AN-201, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7-MIII tumors grew steadily and the regression of MX-1 tumors was only transitory in most animals. Toxicity of AN-201 was much greater than that of AN-238, as measured by animal deaths, loss of  and leukopenia. High-affinity sst receptors and mRNA for both sst(2) and sst(5) subtypes were found in all 3 tumor lines. Expression of sst receptors was not significantly affected by treatment with AN-238. Our results indicate that the cytotoxic somatostatin analog AN-238 efficaciously inhibits growth of human breast cancers expressing sst receptor subtypes 2 and 5.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626507>Effects of herbage ingestion upon ileal digestibility of amino acids in heavy Iberian pigs fed on an acorn-based diet.</a></h1><p>We conducted two experiments with heavy Iberian pigs to determine the ileal digestibility of amino acids (AA) in acorns and freshly cut herbage, and the effects of adding fresh herbage upon the supply of ileal digestible AA when pigs were fed on holm-oak acorns. In Experiment 1, carried out in cannulated pigs of 107 kg bodyweight (BW), daily intake of acorns reached 44.9 g DM/kg(0.75) BW. Arg, His and  showed the lowest apparent ileal digestibility (AID) values, whereas Met, the branched-chain AA and  had the highest coefficients. The AID of total EAA was 0.716 but only 0.222 for NEAA. Most of the digestive and absorptive processes of acorn protein occurred before the hindgut. Acorn provides (per kg DM) 2.27 g apparent ileal digestible Lys and 22.7 g apparent total digestible AA. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) values for EAA, NEAA and total AA were 0.924 ± 0.020, 0.784 ± 0.041 and 0.860 ± 0.029. In Experiment 2 fresh herbage was given to six cannulated Iberian pigs of 140 kg either as a single feed (13.7 g DM/kg(0.75) BW) or as a supplement to acorns (28.4 g DM/kg(0.75) BW). When only freshly cut forage was offered the AID of the EAA, NEAA and total AA was close to 0.65 and supplied (per kg DM ingested) 5.61 g AID Lys and 91.7 g digestible AA. Standardized ileal values were 0.744 ± 0.023, 0.912 ± 0.038 and 0.831 ± 0.030 respectively. The addition of fresh forage to the acorns led to a significant decrease in AID of AA in acorn due to digesta transfer to the hindgut: His (p < 0.01), Met (p < 0.001),  (p = 0.092),  (p < 0.05) and Val (p < 0.05), but Arg, Lys and the branched-chain AA remained unaffected.

Comparison of true ileal amino acid and N digestibilities was also made between adult human subjects and growing pigs to establish the usefulness of the pig as a model animal. Five subjects with established ileostomies and six subjects with intact large bowels consumed a constant diet consisting of meat, vegetables, fruit, bread and dairy products for 7 d with collection of ileostomy contents or faeces respectively over the last 4 d. The study was repeated using 25 kg  ileostomized and intact pigs. Apparent amino acid and N digestibility coefficients were determined. For human subjects the faecal digestibility values were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the ileal values for Arg, Asp, Gly, , Pro, Ser,  and Trp. The faecal digestibility of Met was significantly lower than the ileal value. Determination of DNA, diaminopimelic acid (DAPA) and the digestibilities of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose in human subjects indicated that some microbial colonization had occurred at the terminal ileum after formation of an ileostomy; however, this was not as extensive as in the large intestine. True ileum amino acid and N digestibilities were calculated after correcting for the endogenous contribution of amino acids at the terminal ileum determined using a protein-free diet. There were no significant differences between adult human subjects and pigs for true ileal dietary amino acid digestibility except for , , Cys and Met. There were no significant differences between adult humans and pigs for the ileal digestibility of dry matter and the faecal digestibility of gross energy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032795>Muscle growth and plasma concentrations of amino acids, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin in growing pigs fed reduced-protein diets.</a></h1><p>Twenty barrows were used to determine if partial replacement of protein-bound AA with crystalline AA (CAA) reduces AA use for muscle tissue and whole- growth. Barrows (44.2 +/- 1.3 kg of BW) were assigned to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design. Diets consisted of 16.1% CP with no CAA, and 12.8, 10.1, and 7.8% CP containing CAA. As the CP concentration decreased, CAA were gradually increased to meet requirements on a true ileal digestibility basis. Barrows were weighed on d 0 and 13. Blood samples were collected before the morning feeding on d 0, 6, and 12 (prefeeding), and 2 h after the morning feeding on d 13 (postfeeding). Pigs were euthanized on d 13, and liver and right LM were removed and weighed. The reduction in the dietary CP concentration linearly decreased (P < 0.01) ADG, G:F, LM , and the CP content of LM. Reducing the CP concentration decreased pre- and postfeeding plasma concentrations of IGF-I (linear, P < 0.01) and insulin (linear, P < 0.10). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased prefeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, Gln, Gly, and total AA but decreased Arg, Asn, His, Ile, , Trp, and Tyr (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentration of total indispensable AA decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.01). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased postfeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, Lys, Met (linear, P < 0.01), and Gly (linear, P = 0.073) and decreased Asn, Ser, Tyr, Arg, His, and Leu (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of Ile, , , Trp, and Val decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05). In muscle tissue, concentrations of free Ala, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, and Lys increased (linear, P < 0.05) as the dietary CP concentration decreased. Concentrations of free His, Ile, , , Trp, and Val in muscle tissue decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05). In summary, the reduction in the dietary protein-bound AA decreased whole- and LM growth, altered the free AA pool profile in muscle tissue, and decreased plasma insulin and IGF-I. As the replacement of protein-bound AA with CAA increased, 1) free Ala and Gln in muscle tissue increased, indicating an increase of muscle tissue protein breakdown; and 2) utilization of indispensable AA in muscle tissue decreased.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2913235>Brain histidine and food intake in rats fed diets deficient in single amino acids.</a></h1><p>Histidine (His) is elevated in plasma and brain during protein deficiency as well as in several pathological conditions, leading to the possibility of a direct effect on central nervous system (CNS) function. In this study, groups of weanling rats were fed diets containing graded levels of casein or a single indispensable amino acid (IAA: Leu, Val, Ile, , Trp, , Met or Lys) in order to produce nutritionally-deficient states.  gains and food intakes were recorded daily for 2 wk. Whole brain and serum samples were obtained and analyzed for amino acid (AA) content. All  gain and food intake responses could be predicted by the Saturation Kinetics Model. The only consistent pattern observed in AA profiles which could be correlated with food intake was an increase in brain His concentrations. Limiting dietary casein or IAA elevated brain His above controls 2.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Food intake was generally depressed by 50% at brain His concentrations above 105 nmol/g. Since His is the precursor of the depressant neurotransmitter histamine (HA), systemic increases may be significant in that HA could be a possible cause of the anorexia observed in protein and IAA deficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339994>Nutritional and physiological effects of dietary sinapic acid (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxy-cinnamic acid) in broiler chickens and its metabolism in the digestive tract.</a></h1><p>Sinapic acid (SA) is a major free phenolic acid in rapeseed meal, with the majority found in the esterified form of sinapine. Two experiments were conducted to delineate the effect of dietary SA on broiler chickens, in terms of performance, toxicity, and nutrient digestibility. In the first experiment, 80 male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 5 diets adequate in all nutrients and containing 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, or 0.20% dietary SA. Performance from 0 to 18 d of age and the relative size of all the internal organs and intestines were not affected (all P>0.05) by dietary treatment. In addition, dietary SA had no effect (P>0.05) on the serum activity of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which indicated that there was no damage to skeletal muscle, heart muscle, liver, kidneys, or brain. The objectives of the second experiment were to investigate the effect of SA on nutrient retention and to study the retention of SA in the digestive tract. Male broiler chicks (96) were randomly assigned into 4 treatments containing dietary SA at 0, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.10%. Dietary SA at the 0.025% level increased feed intake compared with control (P<0.05). Regression analysis indicated a quadratic response for both  gain and feed intake (P<0.05) as SA increased in the diet. Again, dietary SA did not affect the relative  of bursa of Fabricius, liver, kidney, or digestive tract. Nitrogen-corrected AME and protein digestibility were not affected by SA level. A negative linear relationship was found between dietary SA level and apparent ileal digestibility of Met, , Ser, Pro, Gly, Ala, and . Sinapic acid disappearance in the ileum was above 97% for all SA levels, whereas apparent SA retention in excreta ranged from 64 to 79%. Sinapic acid at dietary levels investigated in this research is apparently not toxic to broiler chickens but may have a negative effect on amino acid digestibility at higher levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2903768>Azidobenzamido-008, a new photosensitive substrate for the 'multispecific bile acid transporter' of hepatocytes: evidence for a common transport system for bile acids and cyclosomatostatins in basolateral membranes.</a></h1><p>Cyclo(-(p-NH[1-14C]Ac)--Lys-(CO(p-N3)C6H4)-Trp--DPro++ +), in the following named azidobenzamido-008, was synthesized in order to identify binding sites for c(--Lys-Trp--DPro), named 008, (a cyclosomatostatin with retro sequence) in liver cell plasma membranes. In the dark the above photolabel was taken up into isolated hepatocytes, inhibiting the sodium dependent uptake of cholate and taurocholate in a competitive manner (Ki for cholate uptake inhibition = 1 microM; Ki for taurocholate uptake inhibition = 5 microM). When activated by flashed light the inhibition became irreversible (IC50 for cholate uptake inhibition = 2 microM; IC50 for taurocholate uptake inhibition = 9 microM) and the activated cyclopeptide bound chiefly to hepatocellular membrane proteins of 67, 54, 50, 37 kDa. Excess of the initial 008, or of cholate or phalloidin partially protected the above membrane components against labeling with 14C-labeled azidobenzamido-008. In contrast AS 30 D ascites hepatoma cells, known to be deficient in bile acid and cyclosomatostatin transport, could not be specifically labeled by azidobenzamido-008. The membrane proteins preferentially labeled in hepatocytes (50 and 54 kDa) are integral glycoproteins. The 67 kDa protein is a hydrophilic nonglycosylated membrane component. Independent of labeling with 14C-labeled azidobenzamido-008 or with 14C-labeled azidobenzamido-taurocholate, the main radioactive peaks in the pH region of 7, 5.5, 5.25 were identical after solubilization with Nonidet P-40 and subsequent isoelectric focusing. Proteins of 67, 54, 50 and 37 kDa could be enriched by use of 008-containing gels in affinity electrophoresis. Binding sites for 008 were not destroyed by SDS or Nonidet P-40 treatment of plasma membranes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136900>Sensitive determination of N-terminal prolyl peptides by high-performance liquid chromatography with laser-induced fluorescence detection.</a></h1><p>Short-chain peptides with an N-terminal proline (Pro-Gly, Pro-Ile, Pro-Gly-Gly, Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2, and Pro--Pro-Ser-NH2, etc.) were determined by HPLC with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. The peptides were quantitatively labelled with 4-(N,N-dimethylaminosulphonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (DBD-F) at 50 degrees C after 1 h in a 0.1 M borax (pH 9.3)-acetonitrile mixture. The rate of reaction decreases inversely with the molecular  of the peptides. The mean value of fluorescent emission of the resulting DBD-peptides and DBD-peptide amides was 573 nm (excitation, 453 nm). The proline peptides, including bioactive peptides such as Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (release inhibitor of melanocyte-stimulating hormone), Pro--Pro-Ser-NH2 (IgA1 proteinase inhibitor) and Pro-Asp-Val-Asp-His-Val- -Leu-Arg--NH2 [FMRF amide-like (-Met-Arg--NH2) neuropeptide], were well separated by reversed-phase HPLC with water-acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The acetonitrile concentration in the mobile phase had a profound effect upon the retention times, and the capacity factors (k') were dependent on the hydrophobicity of the peptides. The structure of DBD-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 was identified by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS. The chromatographic detection limits (S/N = 2) of the peptides with a 15-mW argon-ion laser at 488 nm were in the 6-28 fmol range. The detection limits were improved to 2-5 fmol with a microbore column. The detectability was two orders of magnitude higher than with a conventional fluorescence detector using xenon arc lamp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9751625>Targeted cytotoxic analogue of somatostatin AN-238 inhibits growth of androgen-independent Dunning R-3327-AT-1 prostate cancer in rats at nontoxic doses.</a></h1><p>Receptors for somatostatin (SST) that are found on prostate cancers might be used for targeting of chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, doxorubicin derivative 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201) can be linked to SST analogue RC-121 (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2) to form targeted cytotoxic SST analogue AN-238. In this study, we evaluated the effects of AN-238 on the growth of SST receptor (SSTR)-positive androgen-independent Dunning R-3327-AT-1 prostate cancers in Copenhagen rats. The dose range and tumor growth-inhibitory effects of AN-238 and AN-201 were investigated in preliminary experiments. Administration of cytotoxic radical AN-201 at single i.v. doses of 110, 125, and 150 nmol/kg resulted in 0, 77.7, and 100% mortality, respectively, within 6-10 days. Four weeks after the injection of 110 nmol/kg AN-201, mean tumor volume was reduced by 35.1 % (P < 0.05), as compared with controls. In contrast, a single i.v. injection of analogue AN-238 at a dose of 300 nmol/kg was nontoxic and remarkably potent in inhibiting the growth of Dunning AT-1 tumors, resulting in a 85.9% (P < 0.01) reduction in tumor volume after 4 weeks. Treatment with AN-238 extended the survival time of tumor-bearing rats from 52.0+/-3.75 to 91.8+/-3.70 days, corresponding to a 76.5% (P < 0.01) increase. In a comprehensive experiment, we compared the effects of radical AN-201 at 115 nmol/kg, analogue AN-238 at 115 and 300 nmol/kg, carrier SST analogue RC-121 at 300 nmol/kg, and a mixture of AN-201 and RC-121 at doses of 300 nmol/kg administered i.v. Administration of AN-201 at 115 nmol/kg led to 90.0% mortality in 12 days, but animals treated with 115 nmol/kg of AN-238 showed no signs of toxicity, their tumor volume was reduced by 40.0% (P < 0.05), and their tumor  was reduced by 42.8% (P < 0.01) after 4 weeks, as compared with controls. The dose of 300 nmol/kg of AN-238 was also nontoxic and diminished tumor volume by 80.9% (P < 0.01) and tumor  by 82.0% (P < 0.01). No reduction in tumor growth or toxic effects was observed with carrier RC-121, but after the injection of unconjugated mixture of AN-201 and RC-121 at doses of 300 nmol/kg, all rats died within 4 days. Specific high-affinity receptors for SST were found on Dunning R-3327-AT-1 tumor membranes by radioligand binding assay and were identified by reverse transcription-PCR as SSTR2. Our study indicates that cytotoxic SST analogue AN-238 can be targeted to SSTRs on tumors and produces a powerful inhibition of the growth of Dunning-AT-1 rat prostate cancer at doses that are nontoxic, whereas its cytotoxic component, 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin, is toxic and ineffective.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2276874>Complete amino acid sequence of goose VLDV-neurophysin. Traces of a putative gene conversion between promesotocin and provasotocin genes.</a></h1><p>Goose VLDV-neurophysin (mesotocin-associated neurophysin) has been purified from posterior pituitary glands through molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75 and high-pressure reverse-phase liquid chromatography on Nucleosil C-18 columns. Despite apparent molecular mass of unreduced VLDV-neurophysin measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecylsulfate appeared near 17 kDa, this value fell to 11 kDa after reduction with mercaptoethanol, suggesting the existence of a homodimer. Complete amino acid sequence (93 residues) of goose VLDV-neurophysin has been determined. N- and C-terminal sequences of the protein have been established by Edman degradation (microsequencing) and use of carboxypeptidase Y, respectively. Peptides derived from oxidized or carboxamidomethylated neurophysin by trypsin or staphylococcal proteinase hydrolyses have been isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and microsequenced, allowing determination of the complete sequence. Comparison within the vertebrate VLDV-neurophysin lineage, namely goose VLDV-neurophysin to mammalian VLDV-neurophysins and to deduced toad VLDV-neurophysin, reveals a residue insertion between positions 66 and 67 in the nonmammalian VLDV-neurophysins. When goose MSEL-neurophysin (vasotocin-associated neurophysin) and goose VLDV-neurophysin are compared to their bovine counterparts, identical substitutions are found in positions 17 (Asn in both goose neurophysins instead of Gly in both ox neurophysins), 18 (Arg instead of Lys), 35 (Tyr instead of ), and 41 ( instead of Ala). Identity of the sequences 10-74 in both ox neurophysins has been explained by partial gene conversion between oxytocin and vasopressin genes, and identical substitutions in both goose neurophysins might reveal a similar gene conversion between mesotocin and vasopressin genes in birds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8720134>A structural study of the carboxyl terminal region of the human erythrocyte band 3 protein.</a></h1><p>Two peptides derived from the carboxyl terminal region of the human erythrocyte band 3 protein were identified as fragments releasable from cell membranes on trypsin digestion. These peptides, Asn-880-Lys-892 and Ala-893-Val-911-COOH, however, were resistant to trypsin, unless the cell membranes had been treated with high concentrations of NaOH. This suggests that the carboxyl terminal region is located in situ within the native band 3 molecule. Unlike in the cases of other portions of the band 3 protein, such as Gly-647-Arg-656, Ser-731-Lys-743, and Tyr-818-Lys-826, the release of the carboxyl terminal region was not inhibited by pretreatment of erythrocytes with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), indicating that there is no major structural difference in the carboxyl terminal portion between the outward and inward facing forms. The carboxyl terminal region of the band 3 protein has a negative charge cluster. In the middle of the negative charge cluster, consensus sequences, Val-Asp-X-X-X-Leu-Asp-Ala-Asp-Asp and --Asp-Glu (TFDE), were found in the carboxyl terminal regions of aquaporin CHIP and glucose transporter 1, respectively. The sequence, TFDE, exists in the highly amphipathic 11-residue sequence of glucose transporter 1, and this amphipathic sequence has been suggested to promote normal membrane insertion of polytopic membrane proteins such as glucose transporter 1 and serine chemoreceptor. The role of the carboxyl terminal region of the band 3 protein is discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10947102>Limiting order of amino acids and the effects of phytase on protein quality in corn gluten meal fed to young chicks.</a></h1><p>An amino acid deletion assay, a protein efficiency ratio (PER) assay, and a slope-ratio growth assay were used to establish the limiting order of AA, and to determine the effects of microbial phytase on protein utilization in corn gluten meal (CGM) fed to chicks during the period of 8 to 21 d posthatching. In Assay 1, a 12% CP CGM diet was fortified with AA to fulfill the digestible AA ideal profile (only  + Tyr, Leu, and Pro exceeded requirements) for young chicks. Amino acids were then individually deleted, and all diets were fortified to 23% CP, with Glu varying as necessary. A Met-fortified 23% CP corn-soybean meal diet served as a positive control. No  gain or feed efficiency differences were observed between the fully fortified CGM basal diet and the corn-soybean meal positive-control diet. The limiting order of AA established in CGM was 1) Lys, 2) Trp, 3) Arg, 4) , 5) Val, 6) Ile, 7) His, 8) cystine, and 9) Met. In Assay 2, diets with 10% CP furnished by CGM or casein were fed in the presence and absence of 1,200 U/kg phytase. A protein source x phytase interaction (P < 0.05) was observed for  gain, gain:feed, and PER, indicating positive responses to phytase when casein was fed but negative responses to phytase when CGM was fed. In Assay 3, graded levels of protein (8, 16, and 24% CP) furnished by CGM were fed in the presence and absence of 1,200 U/kg phytase.  gain and gain:feed increased linearly (P < 0.05) as a function of protein intake, but phytase supplementation had no effect on  gain or gain:feed slopes. These results indicate that 1,200 U/kg phytase did not increase either CP or AA utilization in CGM for young chicks.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2307282>Enzymatic and envelope-converting activities of pars recta oviductal fluid from Xenopus laevis.</a></h1><p>Conversion of the coelomic egg envelope to the vitelline envelope of the Xenopus laevis egg is known to take place in the pars recta (PR) region of the oviduct. A method for collecting fluid generated from PR cultured in vitro was devised which enhanced the recovery of envelope-converting factors. By the criteria of melting temperature analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 125I labeling, ferritin binding, and in vitro fertilization assays, the secretions collected from PR cultured in vitro were capable of modifying the envelope in a manner analogous to that which occurred in vivo, including the limited hydrolysis of one envelope glycoprotein. Hydrolytic activities present in PR fluid were assayed with a number of peptide and carbohydrate substrates. Enzymes which hydrolyzed t-butyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Ser--Arg-methylcoumarylamide, t-butyloxycarbonyl--Ser-Arg-methylcoumarylamide, and t-butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Lys-methylcoumarylamide were found to be present in PR fluid at levels elevated by threefold or more over amounts found in a comparable volume of blood plasma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1874717>Dissociative inhibition of dimeric enzymes. Kinetic characterization of the inhibition of HIV-1 protease by its COOH-terminal tetrapeptide.</a></h1><p>Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease is an aspartyl protease composed of two identical protomers linked by a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet consisting of the NH2- and COOH-terminal segments (Weber, I.T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10492-10496). Kinetic analysis of the HIV-1 protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of a fluorogenic substrate demonstrates that the enzyme is an obligatory dimer. At pH = 5.0, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer, 37 degrees C, the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 3.6 +/- 1.9 nM. We found that the tetrapeptide Ac--Leu-Asn--COOH, corresponding to the COOH-terminal segment of the enzyme, is an excellent inhibitor of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibitor binds to the inactive protomers and prevents their association into the active dimer (dissociative inhibition). The dissociative nature of this inhibition is consistent with the results obtained from sedimentation equilibrium experiments in which the apparent molecular  of the enzyme was observed to be 20,800 +/- 1,500 and 12,100 +/- 300, in the absence and presence of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide, respectively. The dissociation constant of the protomer-inhibitor complex is Ki = 45.1 +/- 1.8 microM. This is the first kinetic analysis and direct experimental demonstration of noncovalent dissociative inhibition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7896811>Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (matrilysin) from human rectal carcinoma cells. Activation of the precursor, interaction with other matrix metalloproteinases and enzymic properties.</a></h1><p>Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) has been purified as an inactive zymogen of M(r) 28,000 (proMMP-7) from the culture medium of CaR-1 human rectal carcinoma cells. The NH2-terminal sequence of proMMP-7 is Lys-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Glu, which is identical to that of matrilysin. The zymogen is activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), yielding an intermediate form of M(r) 21,000 and an active species of M(r) 19,000 which shows the new NH2-terminal sequence of Tyr78-Ser-Leu--Pro-Asn-Ser. Although trypsin fully activates the zymogen, the activation rate by plasmin or leukocyte elastase is confined to approximately 50%. ProMMP-7 can be activated by MMP-3 (stromelysin 1) to its full activity in a single-step mechanism and generates the same NH2 terminus obtained by APMA activation, whereas MMP-1 (tissue collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) do not have such an effect. On the other hand, proMMP-1 is activated by MMP-7 to an activity similar to that obtained by APMA and the activation by MMP-7 is enhanced up to approximately 6.5 fold in the presence of APMA. This enhanced activity is donated by specific cleavage at the Gln80-Phe81 bond of proMMP-1. MMP-7 can also activate proMMP-9 up to approximately 50% of the full activity with a new NH2 terminus of Leu16-Arg--(Asn)-Leu. Incubation of proMMP-2 or proMMP-3 with MMP-7 results in no activation of these proMMPs. MMP-7 degrades type IV collagen, laminin-1, fibronectin, proteoglycan, type I gelatin, and insoluble elastin. These results suggest that in vivo MMP-7 may play a role in degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules in concert with MMP-1, -3, and -9 under pathological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2775757>Amino acid sequence of bovine angiogenin.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence and disulfide bridges of bovine plasma derived angiogenin were determined by sequencer analysis of the intact protein and fragments derived by enzymatic and chemical digestion.

Disulfide bonds link Cys(27)-Cys(82), Cys(40)-Cys(93), and Cys(58)-Cys(108). Bovine angiogenin is 64% identical with human angiogenin; like the human protein, it is homologous to the pancreatic ribonucleases, with conservation of active site residues. Two regions, 6-22 and 65-75, are highly conserved between the angiogenins but are significantly different from those of the ribonucleases, suggesting a possible role in the molecules' biological activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727380>Purification and partial characterization of canine S100A12.</a></h1><p>Canine S100A12 (cS100A12) is a calcium-binding protein of the S100 superfamily of EF-hand proteins, and its expression is restricted to neutrophils and monocytes. Interaction of S100A12 with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been suggested to play a central role in inflammation. Moreover, S100A12 has been shown to represent a sensitive and specific marker for gastrointestinal inflammation in humans. Only human, porcine, bovine, and rabbit S100A12 have been purified to date, and an immunoassay for the quantification of S100A12 is available only for humans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the purification of S100A12 and to partially characterize this protein in the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) as a prelude to the development of an immunologic method for its detection and quantification in canine serum and fecal specimens. Leukocytes were isolated from canine whole blood by dextran sedimentation, and canine S100A12 was extracted from the cytosol fraction of these cells. Further purification of cS100A12 comprised of ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and strong cation- and anion-exchange column chromatography. Canine S100A12 was successfully purified from canine whole blood. The relative molecular mass of the protein was estimated at 10,379.5 and isoelectric focusing revealed an isoelectric point of 6.0. The approximate specific absorbance of cS100A12 at 280 nm was determined to be 1.78 for a 1 mg/ml solution. The N-terminal AA sequence of the first 15 residues of cS100A12 was -Lys-Leu-Glu-Asp-His-X-Glu-Gly-Ile-Val-Asp-Val--His, and revealed 100% identity with the predicted protein sequence available through the canine genome project. Sequence homology for the 14 N-terminal residues identified for cS100A12 with those of feline, bovine, porcine, and human S100A12 was 78.6%. We conclude that canine S100A12 can be successfully purified from canine whole blood using the described methods.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This novel enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a two-step column-chromatographic procedure with high yield. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was Glu-Gly-Asn--Arg-Glu-Asp-Asn--Lys-His-Leu-Leu-Gly-Asn-Asp-Asn-Val- Lys-Arg. The enzyme had a molecular mass of approximately 86 kDa and an isoelectric point of pH 3.8. The enzyme had a pH optimum of 8.6-9.0 and displayed maximum activity at 45 degrees C. The alkaline enzyme was stable up to 50 degrees C and more than 30% of the original activity was detectable after heating at 100 degrees C and at pH 9.0 for 10 min. The enzyme hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose, lichenan (beta-1,3;1,4-linkage), and p-nitrophenyl derivatives of cellotriose and cellotetraose. Crystalline forms of cellulose (Avicel and filter paper), H3PO4-swollen cellulose, NaOH-swollen cellulose, curdlan (beta-1,3-linkage), laminarin (beta-1,3;1,6-linkage), and xylan were barely hydrolyzed at all.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9406077>Application of a U-13C-labeled amino acid tracer in lactating dairy goats for simultaneous measurements of the flux of amino acids in plasma and the partition of amino acids to the mammary gland.</a></h1><p>A preliminary study was conducted using lactating British Saanen goats (n = 5) at 109 to 213 d in milk that yielded 1.67 to 3.68 kg of milk/d to examine the application of a U-13C-labeled amino acid (AA) mixture obtained from hydrolyzed algal proteins as a tracer for measuring plasma flux (n = 5) and partition to the mammary gland (n = 3; arteriovenous difference) of 13 AA simultaneously. Except for Ile and Ser, there was incomplete (6 to 54%) equilibration of the tracer with AA from packed blood cells (> 90% erythrocytes) during the 6-h infusions. This result agreed with the large ratio of packed cells to gradients for plasma AA concentration that was also observed. However, net mass and isotope removals by the mammary gland were predominantly from plasma, indicating that the erythrocytes did not participate in kinetic exchanges. Plasma AA fluxes (millimoles per kilogram of metabolizable protein intake per kilogram of  0.75) differed among goats that consumed different protein sources; however, overall rates were lowest for Met (5 to 14) and His (8 to 17) and highest for Leu (48 to 70) and Ala (53 to 88). On average, 25% of plasma flux was partitioned to the mammary gland. Less than 20% of His, Ser, , and Ala were directed to the mammary gland; 20 to 30% of Arg, , Tyr, and Leu were directed to the mammary gland; and 30 to 40% of Pro, Ile, Lys, and Val were directed to the mammary gland. The unidirectional AA flux in the mammary gland (AA apparently available for protein syntheses, oxidation, and metabolite formation) did not match the pattern that is required for casein synthesis, suggesting differences in the metabolic requirements of AA for nonmilk protein synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2182557>Properties of a cleaved two-chain form of recombinant human growth hormone.</a></h1><p>Escherichia coli cells transformed with plasmids engineered for the expression of recombinant human growth hormone as a secreted product also produced a proteolytically cleaved form of rhGH. This variant is isolated at a high resolution anion exchange chromatography stage during the manufacturing process. The higher isoelectric point of this form is demonstrated by isoelectric focusing and chromatofocusing and the two-chain nature by tryptic mapping, N- and C-terminal sequence analyses, and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These data indicate that the single site of cleavage is between -142 and Tyr-143, in contrast to the two-chain variant isolated from human pituitary glands, which has a clip after residue -139. The recombinant two-chain form was further characterized by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography at both acidic and basic pHs. The assay utilizing bicarbonate-containing mobile phases was determined to be the most efficient and sensitive method. The bioactivity of this two-chain form was measured by the in vivo rat  gain assay and by the in vitro Nb2 cell bioassay. Its immunological similarity to intact one-chain rhGH was demonstrated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143767>Influence of dietary amino acid reductions and Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein diets.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of Eimeria acervulina infection on growth performance, plasma carotenoids, and intestinal cytokine responses of broilers fed low crude protein (LCP) diets with reduced concentrations of selected amino acids (AA). Experiment 1 was conducted to validate a dietary formulation approach in which broilers were fed 1 of 5 diets including a 19.0% CP corn-soybean meal based (CSBM) diet, a LCP control diet (16.7% CP) that matched the AA profile of the CSBM diet, and 3 LCP diets with 30% reductions in standardized ileal digestible concentrations of TSAA, Lys, or  from 14 to 23 d post-hatch.  gain and G:F were greatest (P < 0.05) and similar for broilers fed the CSBM and LCP control diets, whereas reductions in , TSAA, and Lys each decreased (P < 0.05) G:F of broilers. In Experiment 2, birds were allotted to 18 treatment groups in a factorial arrangement of 9 dietary treatments × 2 infection states. Dietary treatments included a LCP control diet similar to that fed in Experiment 1 and 8 LCP diets with 40% individual reductions in TSAA, Lys, , Val, Ile, Arg,  + Tyr, or Gly + Ser. Broilers received experimental diets from 10 d to 28 d post-hatch and were inoculated with 0 or 4.0 × 10 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at 15 d. Decreased (P < 0.05) growth performance (10 to 28 d) of broilers was observed with each AA reduction, except  + Tyr, compared with birds fed the LCP control diet.  gain and G:F were lowest (P < 0.05) for birds fed diets reduced in Lys or Val. Eimeria acervulina decreased growth performance and plasma carotenoids of broilers, but effects varied among dietary treatment groups as indicated by diet × infection interactions (P < 0.05). Dietary AA reductions did not alter (P > 0.05) the increase in intestinal gene expression of interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, or interleukin-10 observed in E. acervulina-infected birds.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2162822>Mutations in hemophilia Bm occur at the Arg180-Val activation site or in the catalytic domain of factor IX.</a></h1><p>Hemophilia Bm is characterized by a strikingly prolonged plasma ox brain prothrombin time. In an attempt to find an explanation for this phenomenon we have analyzed various aspects of the Bm variants factor IX Deventer, factor IX Milano, factor IX Novara, and factor IX Bergamo. Proteolytic cleavage by factor XIa was normal in two Bm variants, but absent at the Arg180-Val bond in the other two. In the latter variants Arg180 was replaced by either Trp or Gln, whereas Val181---- and Pro368---- replacements have occurred in the variants that were normally cleaved by factor XIa. In all four variants the Bm effect could be neutralized with a single monoclonal antibody against factor IX. Also, after treatment with factor XIa, none of the Bm variants reacted with antithrombin III (in contrast to normal factor IXa). Purified factor IX Deventer (one of the variants with a replacement of Arg181), either with or without pretreatment with factor XIa, was found to be a more effective competitive inhibitor of the factor VIIa-tissue factor-induced factor X activation than similarly treated normal factor IX. In addition, this inhibitory effect was much more pronounced when bovine tissue factor was used instead of human tissue factor. We propose that the normal activation of factor IX not only produces a conformational change around the active site serine that allows efficient substrate binding and catalysis, but that the same conformational change is instrumental in effectively dissociating factor IXa from the activating factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. Amino acid replacements that disrupt this conformational transition directly (e.g. Pro368---- near the catalytic center) or indirectly (mutations at the Arg180-Val activation site) therefore lead to a combination of 1) the loss of coagulant activity and 2) an inhibitory effect in the ox brain prothrombin time assay.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9070615>Purification, characterization, and localization of a novel trypsin-like protease found in the human airway.</a></h1><p>A novel trypsin-like protease was purified to homogeneity from the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases, by sequential chromatographic procedures. The enzyme migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to a position corresponding to a molecular  of 28 kDa under both reducing and non-reducing conditions, and showed an apparent molecular  of 27 kDa by gel filtration, indicating that it exists as a monomer. It had an NH2-terminal sequence of Ile-Leu-Gly-Gly--Glu-Ala-Glu-Glu-Gly-Ser-Trp-Pro-Trp-Gln-Val-Ser-Leu- Arg-Leu, which differed from that of any known protease. Studies with model peptide substrates showed that the enzyme preferentially cleaves the COOH-terminal side of arginine residues at the P1 position of certain peptides, cleaving Boc--Ser-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide most efficiently and having an optimum pH of 8.6 with this substrate. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, but hardly inhibited by secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor at 10 microM. An immunohistochemical study indicated that the enzyme is located in the cells of the submucosal serous glands of the bronchi and trachea. These results suggest that the enzyme is secreted from submucosal serous glands onto the mucous membrane in patients with chronic airway diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15060037>Characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae TrmD, a tRNA methyltransferase essential for growth.</a></h1><p>Down-regulation of expression of trmD, encoding the enzyme tRNA (guanosine-1)-methyltransferase, has shown that this gene is essential for growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The S. pneumoniae trmD gene has been isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli by using a His-tagged T7 expression vector. Recombinant protein has been purified, and its catalytic and physical properties have been characterized. The native enzyme displays a molecular mass of approximately 65,000 Da, suggesting that streptococcal TrmD is a dimer of two identical subunits. In fact, this characteristic can be extended to several other TrmD orthologs, including E. coli TrmD. Kinetic studies show that the streptococcal enzyme utilizes a sequential mechanism. Binding of tRNA by gel mobility shift assays gives a dissociation constant of 22 nM for one of its substrates, tRNA(Leu)(CAG). Other heterologous nonsubstrate tRNA species, like, tRNA ()(GGT), tRNA(), and tRNA (Ala)(TGC), bind the enzyme with similar affinities, suggesting that tRNA specificity is achieved via a postbinding event(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1366438>Purification and characterization of acid urease from Lactobacillus fermentum.</a></h1><p>Acid urease was purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state, and the molecular  was estimated to be 220,000. The enzyme consisted of three kinds of subunits, designated alpha, beta and gamma, with molecular  of 67,000, 16,800 and 8600, respectively, in a (alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1)2 structure. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 4.8. The nickel content was found to be 1.9 atoms of nickel per alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1 unit. The amino acid profile was different from those of known bacterial neutral ureases. The enzyme was most active at pH 2 and around 65 degrees C. It was stable between pH 3 and 9, and below 50 degrees C. The Km for urea was 2.7 mM at pH 2. The enzyme activity was inhibited by Ag+, Hg2+, Cu2+, p-chloromercuribenzoate and acetohydroxamate. The enzyme was separated into three subunits by reverse phase HPLC. The amino terminal amino acid sequences of the subunits alpha, beta and gamma were Ser--Asp-Met-, Met-Val-Pro-Gly- and Met-Arg-Leu--, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9891929>Properties of a cold-active protease from psychrotrophic Flavobacterium balustinum P104.</a></h1><p>Protease activity was detected in the culture medium of Flavobacterium balustinum P104 grown at 10 degrees C, which was isolated from salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) intestine. The enzyme, designated as CP-70 protease, was purified to homogeneity from the culture broth by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographyies. The molecular mass of the protease was 70 kDa, and its isoelectric point was close to 3.5. Maximal activity toward azocasein was observed at 40 degrees C and from pH 7.0 to 9.0. The activity was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, suggesting that the enzyme is a serine protease. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was Asp--Arg-Gln-Leu-Leu-Asn-Ala-Asn-Ser-Asp-Leu-Leu- Asn---Gly-Asn-Val--Gly-Leu--Gly-Ala--Asn-Gly-Gly-Asn. A search through the database for sequence homology yielded no significant match. The initial cleavage sites for oxidized insulin B-chain were found to be the Glu13-Ala14 and Phe24-Phe25 bonds. The result of the cleavage pattern of oxidized insulin B-chain suggests that CP-70 protease has a broader specificity than the other cold-active proteases against the peptide substrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8138020>Isolation and characterization of fibrinogenase from Candida albicans NH-1.</a></h1><p>1. Fibrinogenase was isolated from Candida albicans NH-1 by DEAE-Cellulose, Sephadex G-75 and Sephadex G-100 column chromatographies. 2. The purified fibrinogenase gave a single band on disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 3. The enzyme preparation had a molecular  of 13,000, isoelectric point of pH 4.2 and possessed 117 amino acid residues. 4. The purified fibrinogenase possessed capillary permeability-increasing activity. 5. The enzyme hydrolyzed fibrinogen, casein, hide powder azure, azocoll hydrolytic activities and also hydrolyzed the oxidized B chain of insulin. The cleavage sites in the oxidized B chain of insulin were identified as Asp(3)-Glu(4), Glu(13)-Ala(14), Ala(14)-Leu(15), Tyr(16)-Leu(17), Arg(22)-Gly(23), (25)-Tyr(26) and Tyr(26)-(27). 6.

The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular  of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0.

More specifically, IL-8 caused a transient, dose and time dependent activation of a Ser/ kinase activity towards myelin basic protein (MBP) and the MBP-derived peptide APRTPGGRR patterned after the specific concensus sequence in MBP for ERK enzymes. The activated MBP kinase was furthermore identified as an extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1) based on several criteria such as substrate specificity, molecular , activation-dependent mobility shift, and recognition by anti-ERK antibodies. For comparison, the chemotactic response of neutrophils to a stimulus of bacterial origin (fMet-Leu- or fMLP) was also examined and found to involve the activation of a similar ERK enzyme. The present data clearly indicate that in terminally differentiated, non-proliferating human cells, the MBP kinase/ERK activity can serve other purposes than mitogenic signaling, and that processes such as chemotaxis, induced by bacterial peptides as well as by human cytokines like IL-8, involve the regulation of ERK enzymes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2542332>Purification and characterization of rat skeletal muscle fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase.</a></h1><p>Fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bis-phosphatase from rat skeletal muscle has been purified to homogeneity, and its structure and kinetic properties have been determined. The Mr of the native enzyme was 100,000 and the subunit Mr was 54,000. The apparent Km values of fructose-6-P,2-kinase for Fru-6-P and ATP were 56 and 48 microM, respectively. The apparent Km value for Fru-2,6-P2 of fructose-2,6-bis-phosphatase was 0.4 microM, and the Ki for Fru-6-P was 12.5 microM. The enzyme was bifunctional, and the phosphatase activity was 2.5 times higher than the kinase activity. The enzyme was not phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The amino acid composition of the skeletal muscle enzyme was similar to that of the rat liver enzyme, and the carboxyl terminus sequence (His-Tyr) was the same as that of the liver enzyme. The tryptic peptides generated from the liver and skeletal muscle enzymes were identical except for two peptides. A peptide corresponding to nucleotides 14-28 of the rat liver enzyme was not detected in the skeletal muscle enzyme. A peptide whose amino acid sequence was -Ala-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln---Asn-Ser-Pro--Met-Val-Ile-Met-Val-Gly-Leu-Pro - Ala-Arg was also isolated. This peptide was the same as that of rat liver enzyme (nucleotides 31-52) containing the phosphorylation site except in the muscle enzyme two amino terminus amino acids, Gly-Ser(P), have been altered to -Ala. Thus, the rat skeletal muscle enzyme is very similar in structure to the rat liver enzyme except for the lack of possibly one peptide and the lack of a phosphorylation site by the substitution of the target Ser with Ala.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8392893>The highly selective delta agonist BUBU induces an analgesic effect in normal and arthritic rat and this action is not affected by repeated administration of low doses of morphine.</a></h1><p>The effect of various doses of the selective delta agonist BUBU (Tyr-D-Ser(O-t-butyl)-Gly--Leu-(O-t-butyl) on the vocalization threshold to paw pressure were compared in normal and arthritic rats, a suitable clinical model of chronic pain. In both group of rats, the intravenous administration of BUBU (6, 9, 12 mg/kg in normal and 1.5, 3, 6 mg/kg in arthritic rats) led to significant antinociceptive effects. The same dose of BUBU (6 mg/kg i.v.) produced a much more potent antinociceptive effect in arthritic than in normal rats, and a dose as low as 1.5 mg/kg produced a significant analgesic effect in the arthritic animal, whereas at 3 mg/kg BUBU was ineffective in normal rats. The analgesic effects of BUBU (9 mg/kg in normal and 3 mg/kg in arthritic rats) were completely prevented by the selective delta antagonist naltrindole (1 mg/kg i.v. a dose devoid of analgesic potency per se), while they were not affected by the selective mu antagonist naloxone (0.05 mg/kg i.v.). In addition, 3 mg/kg i.v. of BUBU remained effective in morphine tolerant arthritic rats. These results suggest that delta opioid receptor activation can modulate the transmission of cutaneous mechanical nociceptive information in rats, especially in inflammatory pain conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1726837>Purification from human cerebrospinal fluid of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs). Isolation of IGFBP-2, an altered form of IGFBP-3 and a new IGFBP species.</a></h1><p>Cerebrospinal fluid insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (CSF IGFBPs) characteristically have a preferential affinity for IGF-II, which is largely accounted for by a 32-30 kDa IGFBP(Ka = 10(11) M-1) previously purified from human CSF, with an N-terminal sequence unlike any other IGFBP identified at the time. We have now used procedure (including ammonium sulphate precipitation, acidic gel filtration, affinity chromatography and reverse phase chromatography) and purified three further IGFBPs to homogeneity from child CSF. Apart from the 32-30-kDa form, the predominant IGFBP in CSF is a 34-kDa form (non-reduced in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Like the 32-30-kDa IGFBP, it has a preferential affinity for IGF-II (Ka = 2 x 10(10) M-1). Its N-terminus, -Arg-(/)-Pro-Pro-(/)--Pro-Glu-Arg-Arg-(/)-Gly-Pro-Pro-Pro-Val, corresponds to that deduced for IGFBP-2, except for the first three residues which were not found in the CSF IGFBP. Another form, of 30 kDa, has an N-terminus identical to IGFBP-3's over the first 18 residues determined and seems to be an altered form of IGFBP-3. A third minor species, of 22 kDa, with a preferential affinity for IGF-II similar to that of the 34-kDa IGFBP, has an N-terminal sequence, (/)-(/)-Asp-Ser--Val-Pro-(/)-Glu-Pro-Ser-Asp-Glu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Ser-(/)- (/)-Pro, which bears some analogy with those of other known human IGFBPs, particularly IGFBP-3 (7 homologous residues), and appears to be related to, but distinct from, other IGFBP species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7726575>Kinetic and pharmacologic characterization of phospholipases A2 from Bothrops neuwiedii venom.</a></h1><p>Two phospholipases A2 (PLA2) (EC 3.1.1.4) were purified from Bothrops neuwiedii venom (isoenzymes P-1 and P-2). The molecular  of P-1 and P-2 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 15,000 and 16,200 and the isoelectric points were 4.8 and 4.6, respectively. The N-terminal 14-amino-acid sequences determined were Asn-Leu-Val-Gln--Glu--Leu-Ile-Met-Met-Ile-Ala-Gly and Ser-Leu-Val-Gln--Glu--Leu-Ile-Met-Met-Ile-Ala-Gly for P-1 and P-2, respectively. Since both show sequence almost identical to that of a PLA2 from Crotalus atrox it was tentatively classified as being of group II. The enzymatic activity of P-1 and P-2 toward lipid monolayers was studied. The hydrolysis of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (dlPC) shows a broad optimum between 7 and 18 mN m-1 and a cut-off pressure of 22 mN m-1. The activity toward dlPC displays a maximum at pH 8 and is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ with an apparent Kd of 0.1 mM, for both enzymes. P-1 and P-2 are heat-stable enzymes, unable to hydrolyze dilauroylphosphatidic acid monolayers. The enzymes are not lethal to mice at doses up to 5 micrograms/g  by intraperitoneal injection and they do not show myotoxic (up to 40 micrograms) or hemolytic activity (up to 8.5 micrograms/ml). Both lack anti-coagulant activity, determined by absence of changes in the recalcification time of platelet poor plasma (up to 100 micrograms/ml), and are not able to induce platelet aggregation (up to 50 micrograms/ml). However, both isoenzymes exhibit an important edema-inducing activity that is not altered at short times by the irreversible chemical inactivation of the hydrolytic activity with phenacyl bromide. P-1 and P-2 are able to release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids of neutrophils, property that is lost by the inactivation of the enzyme. This suggests that the edema-inducing activity of the active but not the inactive forms may be partly due to arachidonic acid-derived mediators. The edema-inducing activity of the active or inactive forms of the enzymes is inhibited by antagonists of histamine, suggesting that histamine plays an important role in both the active and the inactive B. neuwiedii PLA2s-induced edema. The results suggest that the inflammatory and the catalytic activity of these enzymes constitute separate properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636875>Analysis in gingival crevicular fluid of two oligopeptides derived from human hemoglobin beta-chain.</a></h1><p>HPLC on a reversed phase column, amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to determine the structure of two human gingival crevicular exudate oligopeptides (Leu--Pro-Glu-Glu-Lys-Ser-Ala-Val--Ala-Leu and Leu-Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp--Gln-Arg-) which were shown to have been derived from the beta-chain of hemoglobin.

Recently, a PrPSc-like intermediate form characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant PrP species termed insoluble PrPC (iPrPC) has been identified in uninfected mammalian brains and cultured neuronal cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of these diseases. Here, we explore the molecular characteristics of the spontaneously formed iPrPC in cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP linked to two familial prion diseases. We observed that although PrP mutation at either residue 183 from  to Ala (PrPT183A) or at residue 198 from  to Ser (PrPF198S) affects glycosylation at both N-linked glycosylation sites, the T183A mutation that results in intracellular retention significantly increased the formation of iPrPC. Moreover, while autophagy is increased in F198S cells, it was significantly decreased in T183A cells. Our results indicate that iPrPC may be formed more readily in an intracellular compartment and that a significant increase in PrPT183A aggregation may be attributable to the inhibition of autophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879834>Effect of keratinase on ileal amino acid digestibility in five feedstuffs fed to growing pigs.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of keratinase (KE) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in rice bran, cottonseed meal (CSM), rapeseed meal (RSM), corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and peanut meal (PNM).Twelve crossbred barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire, 50.5±1.4 kg  [BW]) fitted with T-cannulas at the terminal ileum were allotted to a 12×6 Youden Square design with 12 diets and 6 periods. The treatment diets included rice bran, CSM, RSM, corn DDGS, PNM, or corn-soybean meal (cSBM) supplemented with 0.05% KE or not. Diets were given to pigs at a level of 3% BW in two equal meals. The endogenous AA losses were the mean results of three previously experiments determined by a same nitrogen-free diet fed to pigs. Pigs had free access to water during the experiment.The KE supplementation improved (p<0.05) the AID and SID of Met, , Val, Asp, Cys, and Tyr in rice bran. Inclusion of KE increased (p<0.05) the AID and SID of Met and Val in CSM. The KE supplementation decreased (p<0.05) the AID and SID of His in RSM and all measured AA except for Arg, Met, Trp, Val, Gly, and Pro in corn DDGS. There was an increase (p<0.05) in AID and SID of Leu, Ile, Met, Ala, Cys, Ser, and Tyr in PNM supplemented with KE compared with that without KE. Inclusion of KE increased (p<0.05) the AID and SID of crude protein, Leu, Ile, , , Asp, and Ser in cSBM.This study indicated that KE had different effects on ileal AA digestibility of feedstuffs for growing pigs, which can give some usage directions of KE in swine feed containing those detected feedstuffs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2358440>Juvenile hormone esterase activity repressive factor in the plasma of parasitized insect larvae.</a></h1><p>A proteinaceous factor that represses plasma juvenile hormone esterase activity in parasitized insect larvae has been isolated and partially characterized from last instar larvae of the armyworm Pseudaletia separata parasitized with the wasp Apantales kariyai.

The result of Western blotting indicated that the antigenicity of the protein was specific.The stable expression of the protein and the analysis of its antigenic specificity provide the foundation for developing the ELISA early stage diagnosis kit.As coating antigen, the recombinant E protein served a good source in the indirect ELISA method for the detection of JEV antibody.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2164842>The small molecular mass ubiquinone-binding protein (QPc-9.5 kDa) in mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase: isolation, ubiquinone-binding domain, and immunoinhibition.</a></h1><p>The small molecular mass ubiquinone-binding protein (QPc-9.5 kDa) was purified to homogeneity from 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-(3,7-dimethyl[3H]octyl)-1,4-benzoquinol+ ++- labeled bovine heart mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated protein is Gly-Arg-Gln--Gly-His-Leu--Arg-Val-Arg-His-, which is identical with that of a Mr = 9500 protein in the reductase [Borchart et al. (1986) FEBS Lett. 200, 81-86]. A ubiquinone-binding peptide was prepared from [3H]azidoubiquinol-labeled QPc-9.5 kDa protein by trypsin digestion followed by HPLC separation. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of this peptide, Val-Ala-Pro-Pro--Val-Ala--Tyr-Leu-, corresponds to amino acid residues 48-57 in the reported Mr = 9500 protein. According to the proposed structural model for the Mr = 9500 protein, the azido-Q-labeled peptide is located in the membrane on the matrix side. These results confirm our previous assessment that the Mr = 13,400 subunit is not the small molecular  Q-binding protein. Purified antibodies against QPc-9.5 kDa have a high titer with isolated QPc-9.5 kDa protein and complexes that contain it. Although antibodies against QPc-9.5 kDa do not inhibit intact succinate- and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductases, a decrease of 85% and 20% in restoration of succinate- and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductases, respectively, is observed when delipidated succinate- or ubiquinol-cytochrome reductases are incubated with antibodies prior to reconstitution with ubiquinone and phospholipid, indicating that epitopes at the catalytic site of QPc-9.5 kDa are buried in the phospholipid environment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9173902>Identification of amino acid residues responsible for differences in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity between two human liver dihydrodiol dehydrogenase isoenzymes by site-directed mutagenesis.</a></h1><p>Human liver dihydrodiol dehydrogenase isoenzymes (DD1 and DD2), in which only seven amino acid residues are substituted, differ remarkably in specificity for steroidal substrates and inhibitor sensitivity: DD1 shows 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and sensitivity to 1,10-phenanthroline, whereas DD2 oxidizes 3alpha-hydroxysteroids and is highly inhibited by bile acids. In the present study we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the seven residues (-38, Arg-47, Leu-54, Cys-87, Val-151, Arg-170 and Gln-172) of DD1 to the corresponding residues (Val, His, Val, Ser, Met, His and Leu respectively) of DD2. Of the seven mutations, only the replacement of Leu-54 with Val produced an enzyme that had almost the same properties as DD2. No significant changes were observed in the other mutant enzymes. An additional site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr-55 of DD1 to  yielded an inactive protein, suggesting the catalytically important role of this residue. Thus a residue at a position before the catalytic Tyr residue might play a key role in determining the orientation of the substrates and inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9278970>A new phospholipase A2 isoform isolated from Bothrops neuwiedii (Yarará chica) venom with novel kinetic and chromatographic properties.</a></h1><p>A new phospholipase A2 isoform, called P-3, isolated from Bothrops neuwiedii (Yarará chica) venom, showed different chromatographic, enzymatic and cytotoxic properties compared to the previously purified isoforms P-1 and P-2 but it had a similar edema-inducing activity. In contrast to previously reported B. neuwiedii phospholipase A2 isoforms, P-3 did not interact with the oligosaccharide matrix of gel filtration columns (Superose, Superdex). Its molecular  was 15,000 and its N-terminal 14 amino acid sequence was Asn-Leu-Val-Gln--Glu--Leu-Ile-Met-Lys-Ile-Ala-Gly. Amino acid analyse revealed the presence of an unique histidine, presumably located at the active site, because a full inhibition of enzymatic activity was observed after treatment with p-bromophenacyl bromide. The new isoform also differentiated in its surface pressure activity profile when assayed in lipid monolayers. P-3 had an optimum activity towards dilauroylphosphatidylcholine monolayers of 27 mN/m and a cut-off pressure of 30 mN/m, whereas P-1 and P-2 had an optimum of 13 mN/m with a cut-off of 22 mN/m. P-3 retained its edema-inducing activity in the absence of hydrolytic activity, suggesting that the inflammatory activity was not dependent on the enzymatic activity. Neither the enzymatic nor the edema-inducing activity was affected by heparin. The new isoform was not lethal when a single dose of 5 micrograms/g  was injected intraperitoneally into mice. All of the isoforms displayed cytotoxic activity in vitro on B16F10 melanoma cells evaluated by direct MTT assay, with an EC50 of 31 micrograms/ml for P-3 and of 15 micrograms/ml for P-1 and P-2. The cytotoxic activity of P-3 was inhibited by p-bromophenacyl bromide treatment of the enzyme (up to 170 micrograms/ml), whereas the same treatment on P-1 and P-2 changed their EC50 to 60 micrograms/ml. The difference observed with inhibited enzymes suggests a different mechanism for the cytotoxic action of P-3 with respect to P-1 and P-2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155652>Effects of increased energy and amino acid intake in late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, metabolic, and redox status of sows1.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of increased AA and energy intake during late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, and metabolic and redox status of sows. A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID Lys, SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2 energy levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on metabolism, redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of energy, AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of energy (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high energy had higher total litter birth  (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low energy, which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: Lys, Met, , Val, Ile, Leu, , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of energy increased total litter  of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved energy status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher energy intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter  and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Lectin gave a single band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In SDS-gel electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions Erythrina indica leaf lectin (EiLL) split into two bands with subunit molecular  of 30 and 33 kDa, whereas 58 kDa was obtained for the intact lectin by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. EiLL agglutinated all human RBC types, with a slight preference for the O blood group. Lectin was found to be a glycoprotein with a neutral sugar content of 9.5%. The carbohydrate specificity of lectin was directed towards D-galactose and its derivatives with pronounced preference for lactose. EiLL had pH optima at pH 7.0; above and below this pH lectin lost sugar-binding capability rapidly. Lectin showed broad temperature optima from 25 to 50 degrees C; however, at 55 degrees C EiLL lost more than 90% of its activity and at 60 degrees C it was totally inactivated. The pI of EiLL was found to be 7.6. The amino acid analysis of EiLL indicated that the lectin was rich in acidic as well as hydrophobic amino acids and totally lacked cysteine and methionine. The N-terminal amino acids were Val-Glu--IIe-Ser--Ser--Ser-Glu--Glu-Ala-Gly-Asn-Asp-X-Leu--Gln-Glu-Gly-Ala-Ala-Leu-. Chemical modification studies of both EiLL and Erythrina indica seed lectin (EiSL) with phenylglyoxal, DEP and DTNB revealed an absence of arginine, histidine and cysteine, respectively, in or near the ligand-binding site of both lectins. Modification of tyrosine with NAI led to partial inactivation of EiLL and EiSL; however, total inactivation was observed upon NBS-modification of two tryptophan residues in EiSL. Despite the apparent importance of these tryptophan residues for lectin activity they did not seem to have a direct role in binding haptenic sugar as D-galactose did not protect lectin from inactivation by NBS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15665465>Purification and characterization of serine proteinase from a halophilic bacterium, Filobacillus sp. RF2-5.</a></h1><p>In order to find a unique proteinase, proteinase-producing bacteria were screened from fish sauce in Thailand. An isolated moderately halophilic bacterium was classified and named Filobacillus sp. RF2-5. The molecular  of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 49 kDa. The enzyme showed the highest activity at 60 degrees C and pH 10-11 under 10% NaCl, and was highly stable in the presence of about 25% NaCl. The activity was strongly inhibited by phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), chymostatin, and alpha-microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor (MAPI). Proteinase activity was activated about 2-fold and 2.5-fold by the addition of 5% and 15-25% NaCl respectively using Suc-Ala-Ala--pNA as a substrate. The N-terminal 15 amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme showed about 67% identity to that of serine proteinase from Bacillus subtilis 168 and Bacillus subtilis (natto). The proteinase was found to prefer , Met, and  at the P1 position, and Ile at the P2 position of peptide substrates, respectively. This is the first serine proteinase with a moderately thermophilic, NaCl-stable, and NaCl-activatable, and that has a unique substrate specificity at the P2 position of substrates from moderately halophilic bacteria, Filobacillus sp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178180>The threonine requirement of sows increases in late gestation.</a></h1><p>Current AA recommendations for sows are to provide a fixed amount of AA intake throughout gestation based on the assumption that there is a constant demand for AA; however, the demand for nutrients changes from maternal lean tissue in early gestation to fetal and mammary growth in late gestation. The objective of this study was to determine the  requirement in early (d 35 to 53 and 25 to 55 for Exp. 1 and 2, respectively) and late (d 92 to 110 and 81 to 111 for Exp. 1 and 2, respectively) gestation using the indicator AA oxidation (IAAO) method with l-[1-(13)C] as the tracer AA. A total of 14 multiparous sows were used: 6 in Exp. 1 and 8 in Exp. 2. Each sow received each of 6 diets in random order in both early and late gestation. A basal diet was formulated to contain  at 60% of the 1998 NRC recommendation in Exp. 1 and 20 and 60% of the 1998 NRC in Exp. 2 for early and late gestation, respectively. Crystalline l- was added to create additional diets with approximately 10% incremental increases in . Sows were placed in respiration chambers, and expired air and blood were collected every 30 min for 5.5 h. Tracer  [mg/(kg of BW·h)] was given orally over the last 4 h divided into eight 0.5-h meals. Expired air and plasma were measured for (13)CO(2) enrichment and free  concentration, respectively. Background (13)CO(2) was subtracted from plateau (13)CO(2) enrichment. Data were analyzed using a 2-phase nonlinear Mixed model. The overall litter size and litter  were 13.5 ± 3.1 and 20.5 ± 3.9 kg, respectively. Based on IAAO, the  requirement in early gestation was 6.1 g/d (R(2) = 0.59, Exp. 1) and 5.0 g/d (R(2) = 0.71, Exp. 2). In late gestation, the  requirement based on IAAO was 13.6 g/d (R(2) = 0.60, Exp. 1) and 12.3 g/d (R(2) = 0.58, Exp. 2). Based on plasma , the  requirement in early gestation was 7.0 g/d (R(2) = 0.90, Exp. 1) and 3.9 g/d (R(2) = 0.90, Exp. 2). In late gestation, the  requirement based on plasma  was 10.5 g/d (R(2) = 0.67, Exp. 2). There was a linear response to increasing  intake in late gestation in Exp. 1. Feeding a single amount of AA throughout gestation results in overfeeding AA in early gestation and underfeeding AA in late gestation. The 2-fold increase in  requirement in the last third of gestation suggests that phase feeding sows in gestation will more closely meet the demands for nutrients and that the requirement for essential AA in gestating sows should be re-evaluated in early and late gestation separately.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12761101>Purification and characterization of enterotoxigenic El Tor-like hemolysin produced by Vibrio fluvialis.</a></h1><p>The halophilic bacterium Vibrio fluvialis is an enteric pathogen that produces an extracellular hemolysin. This hemolysin was purified to homogeneity by using sequential hydrophobic-interaction chromatography with phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and gel filtration with Sephacryl S-200. It has a molecular  of 63,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.6, and its hemolytic activity is sensitive to heat, proteases, and preincubation with zinc ions. The hemolysin lyses erythrocytes of the eight different animal species that we tested, is cytotoxic against Chinese hamster ovary cells in tissue culture, and elicits fluid accumulation in suckling mice. Lysis of erythrocytes occurs by a temperature-dependent binding step followed by a temperature- and pH-dependent lytic step. Fourteen of the first 20 N-terminal amino acid residues (Val-Ser-Gly-Gly-Glu-Ala-Asn--Leu-Pro-His-Val-Ala--Tyr-Ile-Asn-Val-Asn-Arg) are identical to those of the El Tor hemolysin of Vibrio cholerae and the heat-labile hemolysin of Vibrio mimicus. This homology was further confirmed by PCR analysis using a 5' primer derived from the amino-terminal sequence of the hemolysin and a 3' primer derived from the El Tor hemolysin structural gene. The hemolysin also reacts with antibodies to the El Tor-like hemolysin of non-O1 V. cholerae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23472023>Amino acid requirements of broiler breeders at peak production for egg mass, , and fertility.</a></h1><p>Two trials were conducted to determine the amino acid and protein requirements of broiler breeders at peak production. In trial 1, 32-wk-old Cobb 500 broiler breeders with similar BW were selected to determine the digestible amino acid requirement for daily product output (g of egg mass + g of BW gain/b/d) and feed conversion (g of feed/g of product) for Met, , Arg, Ile, Lys, and CP in a 42-d production study. In trial 2, 30-wk-old Cobb 500 broiler breeders were selected to determine the digestible requirement for Met, Lys, Ile, Arg, Cys, Val, Trp, and  in a 70-d production study. Breeders were given a corn-soy basal diet plus crystalline amino acids with 8 graded levels of amino acids (10 birds per level), representing 40 to 130% of the highest suggested requirements reported in the literature. All other amino acids were maintained at 100% of their suggested requirement level. All breeders were inseminated weekly and fertility was determined. A third trial consisted of 41-wk-old colostomized hens randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets differing only in the amount of Ile. Urine was collected after a 6-wk feeding period. The average digestible requirements per breeder per day for both product and feed/product ratio from trials 1 and 2 for Met, Cys, TSAA, ,  + Tyr, Trp, Arg, Ile, Lys, Val, , and CP were 424, 477, 901, 689, 997, 252, 1,026, 830, 916, 799, 613 mg/d, and 20.0 g/d, respectively. The ideal profile for digestible Met, Cys, TSAA, ,  + Tyr, Trp, Arg, Ile, Lys, Val, and  was 46, 52, 98, 76, 108, 28, 112.0, 91, 100.0, 87, and 67%, respectively. A significant decrease in fertility was noted with increasing levels of Ile and Lys. Urine pH was significantly more alkaline in hens fed the higher level of Ile. It is suggested that adequate dietary Lys and Ile should be provided for maximum hatching egg production but an excess may affect fertility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862400>Optimal in-feed amino acid ratio for broiler breeder hens based on deletion studies.</a></h1><p>An ideal amino acid ratio (IAAR) for breeder hens is needed for maximum nitrogen retention (NR) taking into account nitrogen deposition in  (ND ), feathers (ND ) and egg mass (NEM) to improve dietary protein efficiency. Thus, the aim of this study was to apply the deletion method to derive the IAAR for broiler breeder hens. The nitrogen balance trials were performed from 31 to 35 weeks and from 46 to 50 weeks. Twelve treatments with eight replicates and one hen per cage were used. A balanced diet (BD) was formulated to meet the requirement of all nutrients. The other diets were formulated diluting 55% of BD with corn starch and refilled with amino acids (AAs) and other ingredients, except the AA tested. Each trial lasted 25 days. Feather losses, egg production and egg  were recorded daily, and the samples were stored to further determine NEM and nitrogen in feather losses (ND ). At the start and the end of each period, a group of birds were slaughtered to further determine ND and ND . The NR was calculated as the sum of ND , ND , ND , NEM and the nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR). The deletion of valine greatly depressed the NR in peak production (31 to 35 weeks) while the deletion of the isoleucine greatly depressed the NR of the hens from 46 to 50 weeks of age. The percentual reduction in NR and the per cent of the AA to delete from the BD were used to calculate the AA requirement. The average IAAR was Lys 100, Met+Cys 86, Trp 23,  80, Arg 113, Val 90, Ile 91, Leu 133, +Tyr 108, Gly+Ser 94 and His 35. The IAAR was in line with the recommendation from the literature, validating deletion method with the advantages from a rapid and low-cost procedure.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491915>Analysis of the correlation between dipeptides and taste differences among soy sauces by using metabolomics-based component profiling.</a></h1><p>Characterizing the relationships between the components and taste differences among soy sauces can help evaluate and improve the quality of soy sauces. Although previous studies have reported that certain taste-active dipeptides, the relationships between taste differences and dipeptides of soy sauces are unknown. Therefore, our objective in this study was to investigate the correlations between the dipeptides and the taste differences among soy sauces. To analyze the dipeptides, we constructed an analytical method using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Based on this method, we detected 237 dipeptides, the largest number ever detected in soy sauce research. Next, orthogonal projections to latent structures regressions were performed. The data matrix of components, including dipeptides and other low-molecular- hydrophilic components obtained from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), served as explanatory variables (366 in total), whereas a sensory data matrix obtained using quantitative descriptive analysis served as the response variable. The accuracy of models for the sweetness and saltiness differences constructed using the LC/MS/MS and GC/MS data matrix were higher than did models constructed using only the GC/MS data matrix. As a result of investigation of the correlation between the dipeptides and taste differences among soy sauces by using variable importance in the projection (VIP) score, many dipeptides showed the high correlation with taste differences. Specifically, Ile-Gln, Pro-Lys, Ile-Glu, -, and Leu-Gln showed the high VIP score on sweet differences. This study is the first report that reveals the correlations between the dipeptides and taste differences among soy sauces.Copyright © 2013 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

With this antiserum, immunostaining of Western blots of rat brain extracts revealed two major proteins with mol wt (Mr = 39,000 and 52,000) considerably larger than that of the largest protein (Mr = 29,000) that could be encoded by the cDNA of Lechan et al. Because these observations suggested the possibility of novel TRH precursors, we studied the immunocytochemical distribution of pro-TRH (39-52K) in rat brain. Our anatomical findings were 4-fold. 1) The distributions of 29K pro-TRH and 39-52K pro-TRH are not identical. 2) TRH is found only in regions containing 29K pro-TRH, 39-52K pro-TRH, or both. 3) There are regions that contain both 29K pro-TRH and 39-52K pro-TRH, but no TRH. 4) Regions containing only 39-52K pro-TRH do not contain 29K pro-TRH mRNA as mapped by Segerson et al.

The aim of this study was to determine whether and how mice respond to deprivation of individual EAA species.Dietary deprivation of any single EAA (not non-EAA) in mice led to progressive  loss in the order of Ile(-) > Val(-) > (-) > Leu(-) > Trp(-) > His(-) > (-) > Met(-) > Lys(-) , which correlated with the reduction in food intake. Decreased levels of the deprived EAAs as well as increased levels of all or some of the other amino acids were detected in the serum, although these levels differed among the diets examined. Serum biochemistry identified significant increases in creatine phosphokinase, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and decreases in glucose and triglycerides; computed tomography revealed a marked reduction in abdominal/femoral fat and muscle depots; histology identified diffuse myofiber atrophy in the rectus femoris muscle, all in that approximate order. In contrast, amino acid response, autophagy, and ubiquitination marker genes as well as amino acid transporter genes were induced in both deprived EAA-specific and tissue-specific manners.Dietary deprivation of individual EAAs induced systemic adaptive responses that differed in magnitude and molecular machinery.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Low birth  (LBW) piglets, with long-term alterations in structure, physiology and metabolism, have lower survival rates and poor growth performance. The aim of the study was to compare the plasma, liver and skeletal muscle contents of neutral amino acids (NAA) and the intestinal expression of NAA transporters between LBW and high birth  (HBW) suckling Huanjiang mini-piglets. Forty piglets with either LBW or HBW (20 piglets per group) were sampled on day 0, 7, 14 and 21 of age to give 5 observations per day per group. The contents of NAA in plasma, liver and skeletal muscle were measured, and jejunal expression of transporters for NAA, including Slc6a19 (B(0)AT1) and Slc1a5 (ASCT2), were determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western Blot, respectively. Results showed that the suckling piglets with LBW had higher contents of , Ser, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, Tyr,  and Pro in liver, and Gly in skeletal muscle, whereas lower contents of Met, Ser and Ala in plasma when compared with the HBW littermates. Consistent with the content differences in plasma NAA, the jejunal expression profiles of both Slc6a19 (B(0)AT1) and Slc1a5 (ASCT2) in the LBW piglets were lower in compared with the HBW littermates during the early suckling period. These findings suggested that intestinal dysfunction in the LBW piglets may be one of the reasons in altered physiology and metabolism states of other organs, which result in lower survival and growth rate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9399582>Alanyl aminopeptidase from human seminal plasma: purification, characterization, and immunohistochemical localization in the male genital tract.</a></h1><p>Alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP) was purified to homogeneity from human seminal plasma. The calculated molecular  of the purified enzyme was approximately 137,000+/-5,000 from light scattering, 140,000 (main) and 137,000 (minor) from non-denatured PAGE and 153,000 from SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These findings suggest that the enzyme is monomeric in form in human seminal plasma. The enzyme hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order of Kcat/Km values of AAP at optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Ala- > Lys-Ala- > or = Met- > Leu- > - > Arg- > or = Arg-Arg- > Lys- > Gly-MCAs. AAP was potently inhibited by bestatin, leuhistin, actinonin, amastatin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. These findings suggest that AAP is an aminopeptidase. We determined that the amino acid sequence of the first 22 residues of the enzyme was Ser1---Pro-Ser5-Ala-Ser-Ala--Thr10-Asn-Pro-Al a-Ser-Ala15---Leu-Asp-Gln20-Ser-Lys-. This sequence was completely coincident with that downstream of the transmembrane site of human intestinal alanyl aminopeptidase N (CD13). We also isolated cDNA encoding AAP from human prostate cDNA library, sequenced its structure, and confirmed human seminal plasma AAP to be identical with alanyl aminopeptidase N. We postulated that native human seminal plasma alanyl aminopeptidase is released into the seminal plasma after the specific site is cleaved by elastase or an elastase-like enzyme. The enzyme level in human seminal plasma determined by single radial immunodiffusion was 5.2+/-3.2 mg/100 ml (mean+/-SD, n=20) in individuals 20-47 years of age.

Gel-filtration chromatography gave an apparent molecular mass of 41 kDa and SDS-PAGE showed only one protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 42 kDa, indicating that the enzyme is a single polypeptide. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 8.0 and the pI value of the enzyme was 5.0. The enzyme was relatively stable from pH 4.5 to 7.5. The optimal temperature for the enzyme activity was 30 degrees C. The activity of the enzyme was inhibited by Hg2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid. The enzyme catalysed the oxidation of D-arabinose, L-fucose, L-xylose and L-galactose, which have the same configurations of hydroxyl groups at C2- and C3-positions, with apparent K(m) values of 29.2, 28.9, 37.1 and 91.3 mM at pH 8.0, respectively, with 50 microM NADP+. The enzyme used NADP+ as a coenzyme. Apparent K(m) value at 60 mM D-arabinose for NADP+ was 44.6 microM. NADPH inhibited the enzyme activity competitively with respect to NADP+ (Ki = 78.6 microM). The amino-terminal sequence of the enzyme was Met-Lys-Leu-Ala--Glu-Ile-Asp--X-Leu-Asn-Asn-Gly-. The reaction product was D-arabinono-1,4-lactone, judged from gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. In C. albicans, D-erythroascorbic acid was formed from D-arabinose by D-arabinose dehydrogenase and D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22792284>Low level sequence variant analysis of recombinant proteins: an optimized approach.</a></h1><p>Sequence variants in recombinant biopharmaceuticals may have a relevant and unpredictable impact on clinical safety and efficacy. Hence, their sensitive analysis is important throughout bioprocess development. The two stage analytical approach presented here provides a quick multi clone comparison of candidate production cell lines as a first stage, followed by an in-depth analysis including identification and quantitation of aberrant sequence variants of selected clones as a second stage. We show that the differential analysis is a suitable tool for sensitive and fast batch to batch comparison of recombinant proteins. The optimized approach allows for detection of not only single amino acid substitutions in unmodified peptides, but also substitutions in posttranslational modified peptides such as glycopeptides, for detection of truncated or elongated sequence variants as well as double amino acid substitutions or substitution with amino acid structural isomers within one peptide. In two case studies we were able to detect sequence variants of different origin down to a sub percentage level. One of the sequence variants ( → Asn) could be correlated to a cytosine to adenine substitution at DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) level. In the second case we were able to correlate the sub percentage substitution ( → Tyr) to amino acid limitation in the chemically defined fermentation medium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11809685>Inhibition of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein by Bcr requires phosphoserine 354.</a></h1><p>The BCR protein is involved in the inhibition of oncogenic activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. This inhibition is believed to be the result of binding to the SH2 domain of Bcr-Abl in a non-phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. We showed that the Arg to Leu mutation in the -Leu-Val-Arg-Glu-Ser (FLVRES) sequence of the SH2 domain, known to interfere with phosphotyrosine sequence binding, did not block the binding of Bcr first exon sequences to the Abl SH2 domain. We examined the structural-functional properties of a first exon mutant of BCR lacking the oligomerization domain, termed Bcr(64-413), that encodes the Ser- protein kinase activity of Bcr. The autokinase product contained a M(r) 45,000-47,000 and 55,000 protein. Both species were detected by a Bcr phosphoserine 354 sequence-specific antibody. In contrast, the S354A mutant of Bcr(64-413), although maintaining autokinase activity, produced only the M(r) 45,000-47,000 kinase product. Abl SH2 binding experiments indicated that the M(r) 55,000 species of Bcr(64-413) but not the M(r) 45,000-47,000 species bound strongly to glutathime transferase-Abl SH2. The S354A mutant of Bcr(64-413) did not bind to glutathime transferase-Abl SH2. An adenovirus encoding Bcr(64-413) S354A did not induce cell death in CML cell lines in contrast to wild-type Bcr(64-413). Our findings indicate that Ser-354 of Bcr is part of a gating mechanism, which, after its phosphorylation, allows structural changes to occur in the Bcr protein. This altered phosphoserine form of the Bcr protein selectively binds to the Abl SH2 domain of the oncoprotein, which we propose down-regulates the activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525356>Purification and characterization of insulin from the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Dipnoi).</a></h1><p>The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, a facultative air breather, is considered to be the most primitive of the extant Dipnoi and so occupies a uniquely important evolutionary position in the transition from fish to tetrapods. Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly-Ile-Val-Glu-Gln-Cys-Cys-His--Pro(10)-Cys-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Gln-Leu-G lu-Asn-Tyr-Cys(20)-Asn-Glu--Glu; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val-Asn-Gln-His-Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser(10)-His-Leu-Val-Glu-Ala-Leu- Tyr--Val-Cys(20)-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly---Tyr-Leu-Pro- Lys(30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution (Leu --> ) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> Asn) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2914138>Topography of surface-exposed amino acids in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin determined by proteolysis and micro-sequencing.</a></h1><p>The topography of membrane-surface-exposed amino acids in the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR) was studied. By limited proteolysis of purple membrane with papain or proteinase K, domains were cleaved, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Fragments transferred were sequenced in a gas-phase sequencer. Papain cleavage sites at Gly-65, Gly-72, and Gly-231, previously only deduced from the apparent molecular  of the digestion fragments, could be confirmed by N-terminal micro-sequencing. By proteinase K, cleavage occurred at Gln-3, -71, Gly-72, Tyr-131, Tyr-133, and Ser-226, i.e., in regions previously suggested to be surface-exposed. Additionally, proteinase-K cleavage sites at -121 and Leu-127 were identified, which are sites predicted to be in the alpha-helical membrane-spanning segment D. Our results, especially that the amino acids Gly-122 to Tyr-133 are protruding into the aqueous environment, place new constraints on the amino-acid folding of BR across the purple membrane. The validity of theoretical prediction methods of the secondary structure and polypeptide folding for membrane proteins is challenged. The results on BR show that micro-sequencing of peptides separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF can be successfully applied to the study of membrane proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1333198>Purification and characterization of a sialidase from Bacteroides fragilis SBT3182.</a></h1><p>A sialidase from Bacteroides fragilis SBT3182 was purified 2,240-fold to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential chromatographies on DEAE-Toyopearl 650M, Hydroxyapatite, MonoS and Superose6 columns. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this sialidase, Ala-Asp-X-Ile--Val-Arg-Glu--Arg-Ile-Pro-, was determined. Substrate specificity of this enzyme using a variety of sialoglycoconjugates showed a 1.5- and 2.2-fold preference for sialyl alpha 2-8 linkages when compared with alpha 2-3 and alpha 2-6 bound sialic acids, respectively. The native sialidase had a molecular  of 165kDa, as determined by Superose6 gel filtration chromatography and consisted of three subunits each of 55kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This enzyme had optimal activity at pH6.1 with colominic acid as substrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26210756>Low-protein diets affect ileal amino acid digestibility and gene expression of digestive enzymes in growing and finishing pigs.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of dietary crude protein (CP) intake on ileal amino acid digestibilities and expression of genes for digestive enzymes in growing and finishing pigs. In Experiment 1, 18 growing pigs (average initial BW = 36.5 kg) were assigned randomly into one of three treatments (n = 6/treatment group) representing normal (18 % CP), low (15 % CP), and very low (12 % CP) protein intake. In Experiment 2, 18 finishing pigs (average initial BW = 62.3 kg) were allotted randomly into one of three treatments (n = 6/treatment group), representing normal (16 % CP), low (13 % CP) and very low (10 % CP) protein intake. In both experiments, diets with low and very low CP were supplemented with crystalline amino acids to achieve equal content of standardized ileal digestible Lys, Met, , and Trp, and were provided to pigs ad libitum. Daily feed intake, BW, and feed/gain ratios were determined. At the end of each experiment, all pigs were slaughtered to collect pancreas, small-intestine samples, and terminal ileal chymes. Samples were used for determining expression of genes for digestive enzymes and ileal amino acid digestibilities. Growing pigs fed the 12 % CP and 15 % CP diets had lower final  (P < 0.01) and ADG (P < 0.0001) when compared with pigs fed the 18 % dietary CP diet. Growing pigs fed with the 12 % CP diet showed higher digestibilities for CP (P < 0.05), DM (P < 0.05), Lys (P < 0.0001), Met (P < 0.01), Cys (P < 0.01),  (P < 0.01), Trp (P < 0.05), Val (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05), Ala (P < 0.05), Cys (P < 0.01), and Gly (P < 0.05) than those fed the 18 % CP diet. Finishing pigs fed the 16 % CP diet had a higher (P < 0.01) final  than those fed the 10 % CP diet. mRNA levels for digestive enzymes (trypsinogen, chymotrypsin B, and dipeptidases-II and III) differed among the three groups of pigs (P < 0.05), and no difference was noted in the genes expression between control group and lower CP group. These results indicated that a reduction of dietary CP by a six-percentage value limited the growth performance of growing-finishing pigs and that a low-protein diet supplemented with deficient amino acids could reduce the excretion of nitrogen into the environment without affecting  gain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190051>Optimal crude protein in diets supplemented with crystalline amino acids fed to high-yielding lactating sows1.</a></h1><p>The objective of the current study was to determine the requirement of standardized ileal digestible (SID) CP for maximal litter gain in high-yielding lactating sows due to insufficient supply of either His, Leu, Val, Ile, or . The content of SID Lys was formulated at 95% of the recommended level, while that of Met, Met+Cys, , and Trp was formulated at 100% of the recommended level or slightly greater using crystalline AA. A total of 540 parity 1 to 5 sows (L×Y, DanBred, Herlev, Denmark) were included in the study from day 3 after farrowing until weaning at day 26. Sows were allocated to six dietary treatments increasing in SID CP content (96, 110, 119, 128, 137, and 152 g/kg). Litters were standardized to 14 piglets at day 3 ± 2 after farrowing. At day 3 ± 2 after farrowing and at day 26 ± 3, sow BW and back fat, and litter  were recorded. On a subsample of 72 sows (parity 2 to 4), litters were also weighed at days 10 and 17 ± 3, and milk and blood were sampled at day 3 ± 2 d, and 10, 17 and at 24 ± 3 d in lactation. Sow  pools of protein and fat were determined on the 72 sows at days 3 ± 2 and 26 ± 3 d using the D2O dilution technique. All data were subjected to ANOVA, and to linear and quadratic polynomial contrasts. Variables with quadratic effects or days in milk × treatment interactions were analyzed using linear regression or one-slope linear broken line using the NLMIXED procedure of SAS. Average daily litter gain reached a breakpoint at 125 g SID CP/kg (as-fed). Multiparous sows had a greater litter gain than primiparous sows (3.33 vs. 3.02 kg/d above the breakpoint; P < 0.001) but litter size (13.1 ± 0.1) at weaning were unaffected by dietary treatment (P = 0.62). Sow BW loss was minimized at 102 g SID CP/kg. Concentrations of protein and casein in milk increased linearly with increasing SID CP (P < 0.001). Milk urea reached a minimum at 111-118 g SID CP/kg (P < 0.05) and milk fat a maximum at 116 g SID CP/kg (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 125 g SID CP/kg feed was required to maximize litter gain.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.

A B. cereus ts-4 DNA fragment of 2,065 bp containing the entire impdh gene and flanking regions was sequenced. The fragment contained an open reading frame of 1,527 bp encoding 509 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55,390 Da. The impdh sequence of JCM 2152 was also analyzed by TA cloning using PCR products amplified with primers from B. cereus ts-4 impdh gene. The gene amplified by PCR was expressed in Escherichia coli using a pET17 x b expression plasmid. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the overproduced enzyme was identified as Met-Trp-Glu-Ser-Lys--Val-Lys-Glu-Gly-Leu---AspAsp-Val-Leu -Leu-Val- Pro. The overproduced enzyme was eluted at a molecular mass of about 225 kDa by gel filtration. The molecular mass of the subunit was estimated to be 56 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The overproduced enzyme was active against IMP, IDP, and ITP, and showed the highest activity at pH 9.5. These properties of the recombinant enzyme were almost identical to those of IMP dehydrogenase of B. cereus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1697584>Characterization of a purified bovine lung cGMP-binding cGMP phosphodiesterase.</a></h1><p>A bovine lung cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase (cG-BPDE) was purified to homogeneity and exhibited specific cGMP hydrolytic (Km = 5.6 microM) and cGMP binding (half-maximum approximately 0.2 microM) activities which comigrated throughout the purification. A chimeric structure was suggested for cG-BPDE since DEAE chromatography of a partial alpha-chymotryptic digest of cG-BPDE separated cGMP-binding fragments from a cGMP hydrolytic fragment. Native cG-BPDE (178 kDa) appeared to be a homodimer comprised of two 93-kDa subunits. The order of potency of inhibitors of cG-BPDE hydrolysis of cGMP was as follows: zaprinast greater than dipyridamole greater than 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-8-methoxymethylxanthine greater than 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine greater than cilostamide greater than theophylline greater than rolipram. Minimum [3H]cGMP binding stoichiometry was 0.93 mol of cGMP bound/mol of monomer, but [3H]cGMP dissociation from cG-BPDE in the presence of excess unlabeled cGMP was curvilinear, suggesting multiple cGMP-binding sites. Two chymotryptic cGMP-binding fragments of 35 and 45 kDa were specifically photoaffinity labeled with [32P] cGMP, exhibited [3H]cGMP association and dissociation behavior indistinguishable from native cG-BPDE, and each had the amino-terminal sequence: -Ser-Pro-Arg--Asp-Asn-Asp-Glu-Gly-. Cochromatography of the two cGMP-binding fragments suggested that both a dimerization domain and a cGMP-binding domain were located in a 35-kDa segment of cG-BPDE. Increased [3H]cGMP binding to or [32P]cGMP photoaffinity labeling of cG-BPDE binding sites in the presence of hydrolytic site-specific cyclic nucleotide analogs suggested communication between hydrolytic and binding sites. The principle of reciprocity thus predicts that cGMP binding to the binding sites may affect the hydrolytic site. In the presence of cGMP, the binding fragments or native cG-BPDE exhibited an electronegative shift on high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE, consistent with a cGMP-induced change in cG-BPDE conformation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9264026>Purification and some properties of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylases/oxygenases from Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 and Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava.</a></h1><p>Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylases/oxygenases (RuBisCOs) of two carboxydobacteria, Acinetobacter sp. strain JC1 and Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava, grown on carbon monoxide were purified and partially characterized. RuBisCO of Acinetobacter sp. JC1 was purified 5-fold in eight steps to homogeneity, with a yield of 1.6%. The final specific activity of the purified enzyme was 39.5 nmol CO2 incorporated per min per mg protein. The molecular  of the native enzyme was determined to be 520,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed two nonidentical subunits of molecular  53,500 and 15,000. The Km and Vmax for CO2 were 36.7 microM and 296.1 nmol per min per mg protein, respectively, and those for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate were 3.7 microM and 770 nmol per min per mg protein, respectively. The enzyme of H. pseudoflava was purified 55-fold in eight steps to homogeneity, with a yield of 3.6%. The final specific activity was 304.3 nmol CO2 incorporated per min per mg protein. The molecular  of the enzyme was estimated to be 505,000. The enzyme was found to have two kinds of nonidentical subunits of molecular  51,500 and 14,000. The Km and Vmax for CO2 were found to be 16.4 microM and 777.8 nmol per min per mg protein, respectively, and those for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate were 0.1 microM and 436.2 nmol per min per mg protein, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the large and small subunits of Acinetobacter sp. JC1 enzyme were Ala-Asp-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Gly-Val-IIe-Pro-Tyr-Ala-Glu-Met-Gly and Met-Arg-Ile--Glu-Gly---Ser-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Asp--, respectively. The sequences of the H. pseudoflava enzyme were Ala--Lys--Tyr-Asu-Ala-Gly-Val-Lys-Glu-Tyr-Trp-Ser- and Met-Ser-Met-Gln-Asp-Tyr-His-Ser-Arg-Leu-Ser-Asp-Pro-Ala-Ile, respectively. The peptide map of RuBisCO from Acinetobacter sp. JC1 grown on carbon monoxide was different from that of the bacterium grown on methanol. The two RuBisCOs, however, were found to be identical in N-terminal residue and antigenic property. The RuBisCO of Acinetobacter sp.

YY62 with 9% overall yield. Seventy-four-fold purification was achieved by ammonium-sulfate precipitation, three consecutive open-column chromatographies (DEAE anion-exchange, Sepharose CL-6B gel-filtration, and the second DEAE anion-exchange columns), and two HPLCs (TSK G2000SWXL gel-filtration and phenyl 5PW hydrophobic interaction columns). Enzymes hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl acetate were separated into two peaks (peak I and II) on the hydrophobic HPLC, and only peak II was found to have TBO-hydrolyzing activity. The peak preparation showed a single band of 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and a molecular mass of 39 kDa on gel-filtration under non-denatured conditions, indicating the monomeric nature of the TBO-hydrolyzing lipase. The lipase showed maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 28 degrees C. The N-terminal 15 amino acid residues were determined as Met-Asp--Tyr-Asp-Ala-Asn-Glu--Arg-His-Pro-Glu-Gln-Arg, which showed no homology to known proteins, suggesting that the purified enzyme may belong to a novel class of hydrolase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8255273>[The partial parenteral nutrition of preterm infants with a  < 1000 g: the effects of an infusion of human albumin on plasma amino acid concentration].</a></h1><p>This paper concerns with the changes of plasma amino acid (AA) concentrations of N. 10 ELBW infants receiving a regimen of partial parenteral nutrition including human serum albumin (HSA) as a protein supply. The plasma AA concentration has been compared with VLBW infants orally fed with human milk (HM) or human milk supplemented with human milk protein (HMP). As for the essential AA: in comparison to VLBW infants fed HM, the plasma concentration of VAL,  and LYS is significantly higher, that of , MET, LEU and HIS is similar, whereas that of ILE is significantly lower; in comparison to VLBW infants fed HMP, with the exception of  whose plasma concentration is higher, concentration of essential AA significantly lower; the percentage ratio between plasma concentration and intake is in the range of 1,4 to 3,3, except for LYS (= 0.83), indicating a good efficacy of the i.v. administered HSA as AA source, or a slow plasma clearance or a sustained flux of AA from  protein catabolism.

The molecular  of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approx. 185,000 and 200,000 on Superdex 200 column chromatography and non-denatured PAGE, respectively, and to be 58,000 and 61,000 on SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME), respectively. These findings suggested that the enzyme is composed of three identical subunits. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates Lys-Ala-MCA and Gly-Pro-MCA at acidic pH. The Km and V(max) values of DPP II at optimal pH (pH 6.0) were 1330 microM and 2.9 mumol/mg per min for Gly-Pro-MCA, and 360 microM and 1.43 mumol/mg per min for Lys-Ala-MCA, respectively. It was strongly inhibited by diisopropylphosphofluoride (DFP), and moderately by 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). These findings suggest that DPP II is a serine peptidase. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was also strongly inhibited by copper ions. The amino-acid sequence of the first 41 residues of the enzyme was determined as Ala1-Ser-Pro-Pro-Glu-Pro-Gly--Arg- Glu10-Val-Tyr--Glu-Gln-Leu-Leu-Asp-His-Phe20-Asn--Glu- Arg-- Gly-Lys-Lys--Phe30-Arg-Gln-Arg--Leu-Val-Ser-Asp-Lys-Phe40 -Trp.

Each amino acid was added to a starter ration to bring it to a level 2.84x above the National Research Council (1984) requirement. Excesses of all amino acids except His and Leu caused significant reductions in  gain. Of the amino acid excesses that reduced growth, only Trp and Val did not also reduce feed intake. Gain:feed decreased significantly only in chicks consuming excess Arg, Lys, , and Trp. Chicks fed excesses of Ile and Val had plasma T3 levels that were statistically higher than control levels; none of the other amino acid excesses significantly altered blood concentrations of this hormone. Compared to the control, plasma T4 levels were not significantly altered by the amino acid excesses, but there was a significant difference between Trp and Val, the latter being lower. This study shows that high dietary levels of essential amino acids cause depressions in  gain and feed intake, and, with Ile and Val, these depressions are accompanied by elevations in plasma T3 levels. Otherwise, the amino acid excesses had little effect on plasma levels of thyroid hormones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14608388>Isolation and characterization of a zinc-containing metalloprotease expressed by Vibrio tubiashii.</a></h1><p>A Vibrio tubiashii hemagglutinin, a protease, was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.

This ANF preparation also contained potent kinase activities which phosphorylated the Mr greater than 400,000 (high molecular ) and Mr 220,000 squid neurofilament protein subunits. High salt (1 M) extraction of this ANF preparation solubilized most of the neurofilament proteins and kinase activities and gel filtration on an AcA 44 column separated these two components. The neurofilaments eluted in the void volume of the column while the kinase activities eluted in the 17-44-kDa range of the column. Two major kinase activities were measured in this peak of activity. One of these strongly phosphorylated the phosphate acceptor peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) and was completely inhibited by the selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent kinase --Tyr-Ala-Asp--Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg--Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile- NH2 (Wiptide). Since addition of cAMP did not stimulate activity, this suggested that this kinase was a free catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase associated with the neurofilaments. The second kinase activity most effectively phosphorylated alpha-casein, and this activity was not affected by Wiptide. The alpha-casein phosphorylating activity (ANF kinase) was the principal activity responsible for neurofilament protein phosphorylation, and was not inhibited by various inhibitors against second messenger regulated kinases, suggesting it was related to the casein kinase family. Four lines of evidence indicate ANF kinase was similar to casein kinase I. These were: 1) the apparent molecular  determined by gel filtration and the chromatographic elution profile on phosphocellulose column corresponded to casein kinase I; 2) heparin, an inhibitor of casein kinase II at 2-5 micrograms/ml, stimulated both ANF kinase and purified casein kinase I at these concentrations, while CKI-7, a relatively selective inhibitor of casein kinase I, inhibited ANF kinase in a comparable dose-response fashion; 3) purified casein kinase I strongly phosphorylated both ANF protein subunits (like ANF kinase) whereas casein kinase II was relatively ineffective; and 4) tryptic peptide maps of the HMW and Mr 220,000 neurofilament proteins after phosphorylation by ANF kinase or purified casein kinase I showed similar 32P-peptide patterns.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9292995>Biochemical and molecular characterization of PepR, a dipeptidase, from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32.</a></h1><p>A dipeptidase with prolinase activity from Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32, which was designated PepR, was purified to gel electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein had 96% identity to the deduced NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the pepR gene, which was previously designated pepPN, from L. helveticus CNRZ32. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed Pro-Met, -Leu, and Ser- as well as dipeptides containing neutral, nonpolar amino acid residues at the amino terminus. Purified PepR was determined to have a molecular mass of 125 kDa with subunits of 33 kDa. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was determined to be 4.5. The optimal reaction conditions, as determined with Pro-Leu as substrate, were pH 6.0 to 6.5 and 45 to 50 degrees C. The purified PepR had a Km of 4.9 to 5.2 mM and a Vmax of 260 to 270 mumol of protein per min/mg at pH 6.5 and 37 degrees C. The activity of purified PepR was inhibited by Zn2+ but not by other cations or cysteine, serine, aspartic, or metal-containing protease inhibitors or reducing agents. Results obtained by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that PepR is a serine-dependent protease. Gene replacement was employed to construct a PepR-deficient derivative of CNRZ32. This mutant did not differ from the wild-type strain in its ability to acidify milk. However, the PepR-deficient construct was determined to have reduced dipeptidase activity compared to the wild-type strain with all dipeptide substrates examined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215764>Amino acid efflux by asexual blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum and its utility in interrogating the kinetics of hemoglobin endocytosis and catabolism in vivo.</a></h1><p>The endocytosis and catabolism of large quantities of host cell hemoglobin is a hallmark of the intraerythrocytic asexual stage of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. It is known that the parasite's production of amino acids from hemoglobin far exceeds its metabolic needs. Here, we show that P. falciparum effluxes large quantities of certain non-polar (Ala, Leu, Val, Pro, , Gly) and polar (Ser, , His) amino acids to the external medium. That these amino acids originate from hemoglobin catabolism is indicated by the strong correlation between individual amino acid efflux rates and their abundances in hemoglobin, and the ability of the food vacuole falcipain inhibitor E-64d to greatly suppress efflux rates. We then developed a rapid, sensitive and precise method for quantifying flux through the hemoglobin endocytic-catabolic pathway that is based on leucine efflux. Optimization of the method involved the generation of a novel amino acid-restricted RPMI formulation as well as the validation of D-norvaline as an internal standard. The utility of this method was demonstrated by characterizing the effects of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and dihydroartemisinin on the kinetics of Leu efflux. Both compounds rapidly inhibited Leu efflux, which is consistent with a role for phosphtidylinositol-3-phosphate production in the delivery of hemoglobin to the food vacuole; however, wortmannin inhibition was transient, which was likely due to the instability of this compound in culture medium. The simplicity, convenience and non-invasive nature of the Leu efflux assay described here makes it ideal for characterizing the in vivo kinetics of hemoglobin endocytosis and catabolism, for inhibitor target validation studies, and for medium-throughput screens to identify novel inhibitors of cytostomal endocytosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The chronic administration of thyroxine to rats decreased their rate of gain of , increased colonic temperature and increased systolic blood pressure and heart rate, in comparison to vehicle-injected rats. The administration of thyroxine also increased the serum concentration of triiodothyronine (total T3) and thyroxine, when compared to vehicle-injected rats. The binding of [3H]DAGO to membranes of the striatum of rats treated with thyroxine was greater than in vehicle-treated rats; however, the binding to membranes of pons and medulla, amygdala, hypothalamus, midbrain and cortex in the two treatment groups did not differ. The increased binding of [3H]DAGO in rats treated with thyroxine was due to an increase in the Bmax value. The binding of [3H]DSTLE in the midbrain, hypothalamus, pons and medulla and striatum of rat treated with thyroxine and vehicle-injected rats did not differ but it was significantly less in the amygdala of rats injected with thyroxine than in vehicle-injected rats. The decreased binding in the amygdala was due to changes in the Kd value of [3H]DSTLE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503149>A peptidic hydrogel that may behave as a "Trojan Horse".</a></h1><p>A physical hydrogel prepared with the low-molecular- hydrogelator (LMWHG) CH2(C3H6CO-L--D-Oxd-OH)2 and water/ethanol mixture was applied as a potential "Trojan Horse" carrier into cells. By SEM and XRD analysis we could demonstrate that a fibrous structure is present in the xerogel, making a complex network. The gelator is derived from α-amino acids (, ) and a fatty acid (azelaic acid) and is biocompatible: it was dosed to IGROV-1 cells, which internalized it, without significantly affecting the cell proliferation.

This was achieved by measuring the ability of library peptides to compete with [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH or [3H]TRH binding to rat cortical homogenates. [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH was observed to bind to a single population of high-affinity, low-capacity sites (K(d): 4.54+/-0.62 nM, N=5; B(max): 4.38+/-0.21 fmol/mg wet  tissue, N=5), consistent with them being central TRH receptors. Displacement studies showed TRH to bind to these sites with an apparent K(i) of 22 nM. K(i) values for the library peptides at [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH-labelled sites varied from 10(-3) to 10(-9)M; the potency order was: [3-Me-His(2)]>His>Thi>Leu,,Asn>Gln, Arg, , Ala, HomoPhe. All other replacements had K(i) values >10(-4)M. [3H]TRH was observed to label a single population of low-affinity, high-capacity sites (K(d): 7.55+/-1.23 microM, N=6; B(max): 3.40+/-0.63 pmol/mg wet  tissue, N=6). The affinities of the synthetic peptides for [3H]TRH-labelled sites did not correlate with their affinities for [3H][3-Me-His(2)]TRH-labelled sites (r=0.33, N=18, P>0.1). They did, however, correlate significantly with previously reported binding affinities for TRH-degrading ectoenzyme (r=0.72, N=12, P<0.01). These results strongly indicate that the identity of the low-affinity, [3H]TRH-labelled site is the membrane-bound enzyme, TRH-degrading ectoenzyme, not a subpopulation of TRH receptors. They also provide the first comprehensive description of the influence of the histidyl residue in TRH on binding of TRH to brain receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1317746>Cytotoxic analog of somatostatin containing methotrexate inhibits growth of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer xenografts in nude mice.</a></h1><p>Nude mice bearing xenografts of MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell line were treated for 4 weeks with AN-51, a somatostatin octapeptide analog D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2 (RC-121) containing methotrexate attached to the alpha-amino group of D- in position 1. Control groups of mice received saline, RC-121 or methotrexate. Drugs were given in equimolar doses by daily s.c. injections. After 7 days of treatment with 25 micrograms/day of AN-51, tumor growth was completely inhibited although the treatment had to be suspended because of toxic side effects, especially on the gastrointestinal tract, accompanied by major  loss of the animals. Mice were allowed to recover for 1 week and treatment was continued with 12.5 micrograms/day AN-51. After 2 weeks of additional therapy, tumor volume, percentage change in tumor volume, and tumor  were significantly decreased, compared with controls, only in the group treated with AN-51. Methotrexate and RC-121 also inhibited tumor growth, but their effects were not statistically significant. AN-51 retained its hormonal activity and decreased serum growth hormone levels in mice. Binding affinity of AN-51 for somatostatin receptors on MIA PaCa-2 cells was found to be 2.5-times lower than that of parent compound RC-121.

Gel electrophoresis indicates that the isolated protein is homogeneous in the presence or absence of a denaturing agent. The JHBP in question has a relative molecular mass of 32 kDa, determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Chromatofocusing analysis indicated that the JHBP is an acidic protein with pI 4.9. The protein exhibits a dissociation constant of 9.0 x 10(-8) M for JH I, 1.14 x 10(-7) M for JH II and 3.9 x 10(-7) M for JH III, and thus its affinity for JH analogues is in the order of JH I > JH II > JH III. Its amino acid composition indicates that the protein consists of 297 residues of 18 kinds of amino acids. The sequence of the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain was determined for 34 of the first 36 residues: Asp-Gln-Asp-Ala-Leu-Leu- Lys-Pro-?-Lys-Leu-Gly-Asp-Met-Gln-Ser-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ala--Gln-Gln--Le u-Glu- Lys--Ser-Lys-Gly-Ile-Pro-?-Tyr-His-.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11731090>Factor X activator from Vipera lebetina snake venom, molecular characterization and substrate specificity.</a></h1><p>Our studies of the venom from the Levantine viper Vipera lebetina have demonstrated the existence of both coagulants and anticoagulants of the hemostatic system in the same venom. We showed that V. lebetina venom contains factor X activator (VLFXA) and factor V activator, fibrinolytic enzymes. VLFXA was separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 superfine and ion exchange chromatography on CM-cellulose and on TSK-DEAE (for HPLC) columns. VLFXA is a glycoprotein composed of a heavy chain (57.5 kDa) and two light chains (17.4 kDa and 14.5 kDa) linked by disulfide bonds. VLFXA has multiple molecular forms distinguished by their isoelectric points. The differences in their pI values may be caused by dissimilarities in the respective charged carbohydrate content or in the primary sequence of amino acids. We synthesized 6-9 amino acid residues containing peptides according to physiological cleavage regions of human factor X and human factor IX. The peptides (Asn-Asn-Leu--Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly - factor X fragment, and Asn-Asp---Arg-Val-Val-Gly-Gly - factor IX fragment) were used as substrates for direct assay of VLFXA. Cleavage products of peptide hydrolysis and the molecular masses of cleavage products of human factor X were determined by MALDI-TOF MS. The MALDI-TOF MS was highly efficient for the recovery and identification of peptides released by VLFXA hydrolysis. We can conclude that VLFXA cleaves the Arg(52)-Ile(53) bond in the heavy chain of human factor X and the Arg(226)-Val(227) bond in human factor IX precursor. VLFXA could not activate prothrombin nor had any effect on fibrinogen, and it had no arginine esterase activity toward benzoylarginine ethyl ester.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2246265>Purification and characterization of a methionine aminopeptidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>Methionine aminopeptidase (MAP), which catalyzes the removal of NH2-terminal methionine from proteins, was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme was purified 472-fold to apparent homogeneity. The Mr of the native enzyme was estimated to be 36,000 +/- 5,000 by gel filtration chromatography, and the Mr of the denatured protein was estimated to be 34,000 +/- 2,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a pH optimum near 7.0, and its pI is 7.8 as determined by chromatofocusing on Mono P. The enzyme was inactivated by metalloprotease inhibitors (EDTA, o-phenanthroline and nitrilotriacetic acid), sulfhydryl-modifying reagents (HgCl2 and p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid), and Zn2+. Yeast MAP failed to cleave methionine p-nitroanilide. Among 11 Xaa-Ala-Ser analogues (Xaa = Ala, Asp, Gln, Glu, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , Pro, and Ser), MAP cleaved only Met-Ala-Ser. MAP also cleaved methionine from other tripeptides whose penultimate amino acid residue is relatively small and/or uncharged (e.g. Pro, Gly, Val, , or Ser) but not when bulky and/or charged (Arg. His, Leu, Met, or Tyr). Yeast MAP displayed similar substrate specificities compared with those of Escherichia coli (Ben-Bassat, A., Bauer, K., Chang, S.Y., Myambo, K., Boosman, A., and Chang, S.

In several species two or more isoforms of trypsin have been isolated. Feline trypsin was purified from feline pancrease by sulfuric acid extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration and affinity chromatography on a benzamidine-activated sepharose gel. Feline trypsinogen was purified by sulfuric acid extraction, SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Only one isoform of feline trypsin and its zymogen could be demonstrated. Isoelectric focusing on agarose gel revealed an isoelectric point of greater than 10.0 for both feline trypsinogen and trypsin. The molecular  of feline trysinogen was estimated at 22,600, while the molecular  of feline trypsin was estimated at 21,000. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of feline trypsinogen was -Pro-Ile-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-Tyr--Asn-Arg. We conclude that cats either have only one isoform of trypsin or that other isoforms are present in minute quantities, undetectable by commonly used methods. We further conclude that feline trypsinogen and trypsin are cationic. Finally, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the last 16 amino acid residues of feline trypsinogen is closely related to that of other mammalian species and the final 8 amino acid residues (termed trypsinogen activation peptide) are identical to those of canine cationic trypsinogen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1964226>Structure-activity study of neurokinins: antagonists for the neurokinin-2 receptor.</a></h1><p>A series of 21 peptides were synthesized and tested in a variety of isolated organs in order to determine their potential as neurokinin-2 (NK-2) antagonists. The peptides have been tested in the three monoreceptor systems, the dog carotid artery (NK-1), the rabbit pulmonary artery (NK-2) and the rat portal vein (NK-3) as well as on other preparations containing NK-2 receptors, such as the rat vas deferens, the hamster urinary bladder, the guinea-pig trachea and the human urinary bladder. Some of the compounds have also been tested on the human isolated bronchus. Three compounds, of which two are linear peptides, Ac.Leu-Asp-Gln-Trp--Gly.NH2, -Asp-Tyr-D-Trp-Val-D-Trp-D-Trp-Arg.NH2 and a cyclic one, cyclo[Gln-Trp--Gly-Leu-Met] have been shown to reduce or eliminate the effects of neurokinin A (NKA) in practically all the preparations containing NK-2 receptors. The first compound was found to be selective for the NK-2 receptor and showed only agonistic or no activity on the other receptor systems, while the second compound showed some antagonistic effects not only on the NK-2 but also on the other systems. The cyclic compound was found to be fairly selective for the NK-2 receptor. The first compound (Ac.Leu-Asp-Gln-Trp--Gly.NH2) was characterized with respect to its specificity for neurokinins (NK): it was found to be inactive on receptors for acetylcholine, noradrenaline, angiotensin and des Arg9-bradykinin in the rabbit pulmonary artery. Moreover, the compound exerted a competitive type of antagonism on the rabbit pulmonary artery and on the hamster urinary bladder.

Each protease consisted of a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 29 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Both were totally inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, antipain, and leupeptin and partially inhibited by chymostatin and dithiothreitol, suggesting that they are trypsin-like serine proteases. They hydrolyzed synthetic substrates for trypsin-like proteases but not those for chymotrypsin-like proteases, elastase and kallikrein. MTSP-1 hydrolyzed tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-Asp(OBzl)Pro-Arg-amino-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) and Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA faster than Boc--Ser-Arg-MCA. On the other hand, MTSP-2 hydrolyzed Boc--Ser-Arg-MCA most rapidly, with a specific activity 15 times higher than that of MTSP-1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of MTSP-1 was Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-Tyr--His-Leu-Asp-Asn-Gln-Val-Pro-Tyr. This sequence was 71% homologous with the N-terminal of bovine trypsin. The Boc--Ser-Arg-MCA hydrolyzing activity of mouse spleen significantly (p < 0.01) increased to about 1.5-fold the basal activity 2 weeks after an injection of Freund's complete adjuvant, suggesting that these proteases are involved in the immune response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16775059>Biochemical and morphological developments are partially impaired in intestinal mucosa from growing pigs fed reduced-protein diets supplemented with crystalline amino acids.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine if a reduction in dietary CP, with partial replacement of the intact protein with crystalline AA (CAA), would alter growth, morphology, and free or peptide-bound AA concentrations of intestinal mucosa in growing pigs.

This family contains nitrilases that break carbon-nitrogen bonds and appear to be involved in the reduction of organic nitrogen compounds and ammonia production. They all have distinct substrate specificity and include nitrilase, cyanide hydratases, aliphatic amidases, beta-alanine synthase, and a few other proteins with unknown molecular function.

The enzyme displays high specificity towards hydrophobic L-amino acids, the best substrates are L-Met, L-Trp, L-Leu followed by L-His, L-, L-Arg and L-Ile. Six substrates-Gly, L-Ser, L-, L-Pro, L-Cys, L-Asp--were not oxidized. The enzyme has antimicrobial activity inhibiting the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. V. lebetina LAAO dose-dependently inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP or collagen. In case of ADP-induced aggregation the inhibitory effect was more pronounced on the second wave of aggregation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h1><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs. Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average  (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, :Lys, Leu:, Ile:, Val:, BCAA:, (+Tyr):Lys, Leu:(+Tyr), Ile:(+Tyr), Val:(+Tyr), BCAA:(+Tyr), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the  statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × Ile:Lys) - (0.1479 × Ile:Lys × Ile:Lys) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Dipeptides may hydrolyze in the peritoneal cavity, generating constituent amino acids and thereby increasing the osmolality of the dialysate. Dipeptides can also be a valuable source of amino acids, which are poorly soluble in water, such as tyrosine.Dwell studies in rats were performed during four hours with dipeptide solutions containing five dipeptides (Gly-His, Ala-Tyr, -Leu, Ser-, Val-Lys), 8, or 16 mmol/L of each dipeptide (low or high dipeptide group). Dwell studies were also performed with a 1.1% amino acid solution (Nutrineal(R)). The model of dipeptide hydrolysis (hydrolysis rate, KH), diffusive (rate constant, KBDD) and convective transport as well as transport of constituent amino acids consisted of mass balance equations, written for each dipeptide and amino acid.Peritoneal volume with the amino acid solution decreased much faster than that with the high and low dipeptide solutions. KH for all dipeptides did not differ between the high and low dipeptide groups. In the low dipeptide group, KH was 0.004 +/- 0.004 mL/min (mean +/- SD) for Gly-His (the lowest) and 0.088 +/- 0.048 mL/min for -Leu (the highest). KBDD was higher than KH for all dipeptides, the average being 0.2 +/- 0.05 mL/min.Dipeptides are hydrolyzed in the peritoneal cavity, generating constituent amino acids. However, the hydrolysis rate appears to be several times lower than the dipeptide diffusive transport rate from dialysate to blood. Due to the higher molecular  and intraperitoneal generation of amino acids, the dipeptide-based solutions provide more sustained ultrafiltration than the amino acid solution. The plasma concentration of amino acids at 60 minutes, in relation to the dose of amino acids delivered between 0 and 60 minutes, is considerably higher during the dwells with amino acid-based solution than during dwells with the dipeptide-based solutions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690663>Metabolic changes and nutrient repletion in lambs provided with electrolyte solutions before and after feed and water deprivation.</a></h1><p>Providing feeder calves and lambs with electrolyte solutions before and(or) after a transport period could potentially reduce tissue shrink and speed repletion of nutrients and  that are lost during transport. This trial was conducted to determine metabolic changes and nutrient repletion in lambs provided with electrolyte solutions before and after feed and water deprivation. Solutions were 1) deionized water, 2) ES1 (g/10 L: NaCl, 2.0; K carbonate, 2.8; Mg sulfate.7H2O, 2.0; equal mixture of amino acids [Lys, , , His, Trp, Met, Leu, Ile, and Val], .45; and phosphoric acid to pH 7.0), 3) ES2 (twice the concentrations as in ES1), and ES3 (g/10 L: NaCl 2.0; K carbonate, 8.0; Mg sulfate.7H2O, 4.0; amino acid mixture from ES1, .45; and phosphoric acid to pH 7.0). Eight Suffolk x Hampshire crossbred lambs (average BW 35 +/- 2 kg) were used in an 8 x 8 Latin square design with treatments arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial. Main treatments consisted of two deprivation electrolyte solutions (deionized water or ES1) and four realimentation electrolyte solutions (deionized water, ES1, ES2, and ES3). Lambs were limit-fed (600 g/d, as-fed basis) before and after a 3-d feed and water deprivation phase. Lambs provided the ES1 solution during the pre-deprivation phase had greater (P < .05) Na, Mg, Zn retention during the pre-deprivation phase, had greater (P < .05) Na and Mg losses during the 3-d deprivation phase, and greater (P < .05) cumulative Na, Cu, and Fe retentions than lambs given deionized water during the pre-deprivation phase. Compared to lambs provided water, lambs provided the ES1 solution during the realimentation phase had greater Na retention but similar K, Mg, and water retentions. However, when the concentration of electrolytes in the solution was doubled (i.e., ES2 solution), Na, K, and Mg retentions were increased (P < .05) compared with those of lambs provided deionized water or the ES1 solution. These results suggest that as the length or severity of the stress period increases, the concentration of electrolytes in the electrolyte solution may need to be increased to improve nutrient balance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320441>Phosphate Solubilizing Bacillus megaterium mj1212 Regulates Endogenous Plant Carbohydrates and Amino Acids Contents to Promote Mustard Plant Growth.</a></h1><p>The current study was conducted to explore the potential of a phosphate solubilizing soil bacterium, Bacillus megaterium mj1212 for enhancing the growth of mustard plants. The newly isolated bacterial strain mj1212 was identified as B. megaterium using phylogenetic analysis and, its phosphate solubilization ability was shown by the clear zone formation on National Botanical Research Institute's Phosphate medium. Moreover, the phosphate solubilization ability of B. megaterium mj1212 was enhanced by optimal culture conditions at pH 7.0 and 35 °C which might be due to the presence of malic and quinic acid in the culture medium. The beneficial effect of B. megaterium mj1212 in mustard plants was determined by an increasing shoot length, root length and fresh  of plants. In the biochemical analysis revealed that chlorophyll, sucrose, glucose, fructose and amino acids (Asp, , Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Val, Met, Ilu, Leu, Tyr, , Lys, His, Arg and Pro) were higher in B. megaterium mj1212 treated plants, when compared to their control. The result of present study suggests that B. megaterium mj1212 treatment could be act as phosphate biofertilizer to improve the plant growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24723294>Purification of an amide hydrolase DamH from Delftia sp. T3-6 and its gene cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization.</a></h1><p>A highly active amide hydrolase (DamH) was purified from Delftia sp. T3-6 using ammonium sulfate precipitation, diethylaminoethyl anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 32 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the N-terminal 15 amino acid residues was determined to be Gly--Ser-Pro-Gln-Ser-Asp--Leu-Arg-Ala-Leu--Gln-Ser. Based on the N-terminal sequence and results of peptide mass fingerprints, the gene (damH) was cloned by PCR amplification and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). DamH was a bifunctional hydrolase showing activity to amide and ester bonds. The specific activities of recombinant DamH were 5,036 U/mg for 2'-methyl-6'-ethyl-2- chloroacetanilide (CMEPA) (amide hydrolase function) and 612 U/mg for 4-nitrophenyl acetate (esterase function). The optimum substrate of DamH was CMEPA, with K m and k cat values of 0.197 mM and 2,804.32 s(-1), respectively. DamH could also hydrolyze esters such as 4-nitrophenyl acetate, glycerol tributyrate, and caprolactone. The optimal pH and temperature for recombinant DamH were 6.5 and 35 °C, respectively; the enzyme was activated by Mn(2+) and inhibited by Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+), and Fe(2+). DamH was inhibited strongly by phenylmethylsulfonyl and SDS and weakly by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and dimethyl sulfoxide.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614939>Chromatographic separation and tandem MS identification of active peptides in potato protein hydrolysate that inhibit autoxidation of soybean oil-in-water emulsions.</a></h1><p>A previously developed antioxidative potato protein hydrolysate was fractionated using gel filtration. The efficacy of different fractions for inhibiting lipid oxidation in soybean oil-in-water emulsions, neutralizing 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(+*)) radicals, and chelating prooxidative metal ions was investigated. Low-molecular- fraction Peak 3 (709 Da) exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity and radical scavenging activity. Active peptides based on the ABTS(+*) scavenging assay were isolated by RP-HPLC and purified by UPLC. The amino acid sequence determination by MS/MS identified eight prominent peptides in the antioxidative Peak 3 fraction, of which -Tyr, Tyr--Glu, Tyr-Ser--Ala, and Asn-Tyr-Lys-Gln-Met matched the sequence of papatin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9578462>Activation of the precursor of human stromelysin 2 and its interactions with other matrix metalloproteinases.</a></h1><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are synthesized as inactive zymogens (proMMP) and subsequently activated by many factors to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM). In the present study, we have examined the intermolecular activation mechanisms of proMMP by MMP-10 (stromelysin 2). ProMMP-10 was purified from the culture media of OSC-20 human oral squamous carcinoma cells stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. The final products are partially activated (approximately 38% of the full activity) during the purification steps and contain proMMP-10 of Mr 56,000 with minor protein bands of Mr 47,000, 24,000 and 22,000. The zymogen is activated by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and processed to the active forms of Mr 47,000 and 24,000. The NH2-terminal sequence of the 47,000- and 24,000-Mr species is Phe82-Ser-Ser--Pro-Gly, which is identical to that of stromelysin 2. ProMMP-9 (progelatinase B) is activated by MMP-10 to its full activity and processed to the low-Mr species of Mr 81,000, 65,000, 57,000 and 55,000, the former two of which show proteolytic activity on a gelatin zymography. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicates that the 81,000-, 65,000- and 57,000-M, species have the identical sequence of Phe88-Gln---Glu-Gly, suggesting the cleavage of the Arg87-Phe88 peptide bond for activation and both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal truncation in the 65,000- and 57,000-Mr forms. MMP-10 also activates proMMP-7 (promatrilysin) up to about 60% of the full activity and generates the same active species of Mr 19,000 as that obtained by activation with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate. Incubation of proMMP-2 (progelatinase A) or proMMP-3 with MMP-10 does not result in activation of these proMMP. These results indicate that in addition to the previously reported activation of proMMP-1 (tissue procollagenase) and proMMP-8 (neutrophil procollagenase), MMP-10 can also activate proMMP-9 and proMMP-7, and suggest the possibility that MMP-10 may replace a role of MMP-3 in the ECM degradation in concert with other MMP under various pathological conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19617510>Nutritional value of flaxseed meal for swine and its effects on the fatty acid profile of the carcass.</a></h1><p>Four experiments were conducted to determine the nutritional value of flaxseed meal [FSM; 133 g of ether extract (EE) and 343 g of CP/kg of DM] for swine. In Exp. 1, apparent fecal digestibility (AD) of DM and EE, and the DE and NE contents were determined in growing pigs (n = 32; initial BW, 70 +/- 3 kg) and gestating sows (n = 24; parities, 2 to 4). Diets contained 0, 100, 200, or 300 g of FSM/kg at the expense of wheat, barley, and soybean meal. Fecal samples were collected for 3 d after a 9-d adaptation. The AD for DM and EE were 72.0 +/- 0.4% and 67.4 +/- 4.7%, respectively, for growing pigs and 68.0 +/- 0.5% and 48.9 +/- 1.9% for sows. The DE content was 3.51 and 3.54 Mcal/kg for growing pigs and gestating sows, and NE was estimated to be 2.43 and 2.44 Mcal/kg for growing pigs and sows, respectively. Five ileally cannulated barrows (initial BW, 38 +/- 3 kg) were fed semi-synthetic diets containing 400 g of FSM/kg for a 7-d period (4-d adaptation and 3-d collection) then 7 d of N-free diet to determine basal endogenous N losses in Exp. 2. Standardized ileal digestible AA contents were 29.6 +/- 1.0, 5.7 +/- 0.3, 12.1 +/- 0.8, 16.8 +/- 1.0, 10.3 +/- 0.4, 5.3 +/- 0.3, 14.0 +/- 0.7, 9.4 +/- 0.5, 2.9 +/- 0.2, and 13.8 +/- 0.8 g/kg of dry FSM for Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, and Val, respectively. In Exp. 3, the AD of P and the effects of phytase inclusion on P availability were determined. Five groups of 8 barrows (initial BW, 45 +/- 4 kg) were fed a 300 g of FSM/kg semi-synthetic diet with increasing concentrations of exogenous phytase [0, 575, 1,185, 2,400 and 2,570 phytase units (FTU)/kg]. The AD of P increased from 21 to 61% (P < 0.001). Broken-line analysis estimated the optimal phytase inclusion rate to be 1,415 FTU/kg of diet. Growth performance and carcass fatty acid (FA) profiles of pigs fed FSM were determined in Exp. 4. Two hundred pigs (100 barrows and 100 gilts; initial BW, 32 +/- 4 kg), blocked by sex, were housed in groups of 5 pigs per pen and fed 1 of 4 diets containing 0, 50, 100, or 150 g of FSM/kg. Six market pigs per diet were selected for carcass FA analysis. The ADG, ADFI, and G:F were not affected by dietary FSM (P > 0.05). Increasing FSM in the diet from 0 to 150 g of FSM/kg increased the alpha-linolenic acid content from 11.1 +/- 0.2 to 47.4 +/- 1.2 mg/g of backfat (P < 0.001) and from 5.0 +/- 0.1 to 10.1 +/- 0.6 mg/g of loin tissue (P < 0.001). Flaxseed meal despite its deficiency in lysine can be included up to 150 g/kg of diets for swine and will contribute to the enrichment of the carcass with n-3 fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087732>Enzymatic hydrolysis optimization of Paphia undulata and lymphocyte proliferation activity of the isolated peptide fractions.</a></h1><p>The immune system is important in preventing and controlling various infectious diseases. Immunoactive peptides derived from food proteins could exert immunomodulatory activity without side effects. Paphia undulata with high-protein is suitable for the production of immunoactive peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis parameters to maximize the immune activity of hydrolysates from Paphia undulata.Hydrolysis parameters, including temperature, time and the ratio of alkaline protease to Paphia undulata meat (E/S), were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: temperature, 51 °C; time, 3.14 h; E/S, 4,321 U g(-1) (Paphia undulata meat). Furthermore, hydrolysates obtained under the optimum conditions were fractionated by ultrafiltration and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. After two-step isolation, the isolated fractions (P2 and P3) including the peptides Pro-His--Cys, Val-Gly-Try-, Glu-, Leu-, and Glu-Gly-Ala-Lys, Trp-Ile or Trp-Leu, respectively, could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation ability.These results showed that response surface methodology and two-step separation were efficient for recovery of low-molecular- peptides with high spleen lymphocyte proliferation activity, and the isolated fractions of Paphia undulata hydrolysates are potential ingredients for development of functional foods.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10213505>Inhibition of PC-3 human androgen-independent prostate cancer and its metastases by cytotoxic somatostatin analogue AN-238.</a></h1><p>We evaluated whether AN-238, the cytotoxic analogue of somatostatin (SST) consisting of the radical 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201) linked covalently to the SST octapeptide carrier RC-121 (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2), could be used for targeting human primary and metastatic prostate carcinomas that express SST receptors (SSTRs). The antitumor activity and toxicity of AN-238 and its components were first characterized in nude mice bearing s.c. xenografts of PC-3 human androgen-independent prostate cancer. In experiment 1, AN-238 was injected once i.v. at 200 nmol/kg when the mean volume of s.c. tumors was about 30 mm3. Administration of AN-238 inhibited tumor growth, as shown by a 74% decrease in tumor volume and by a 71% reduction in tumor  after 7 weeks as compared with the control group. AN-201 at an equimolar dose did not show any antitumor activity. The mortality was 14.3% (one of seven mice) in the AN-238-treated group and 47% (three of seven mice) in mice that received AN-201. In experiment 2, two i.v. injections of AN-238 at 150 nmol/kg were given 10 days apart when the tumors measured 65-70 mm3. A significant inhibition of tumor volume (62.3%; P < 0.001) and tumor  (61.1%; P < 0.01) was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. AN-201, given alone at the same dose or coadministered with RC-121, had no significant effect on PC-3 tumors. The suppression of tumor growth induced by AN-238 was accompanied by a significant enhancement of apoptosis (P < 0.01). There were similar side effects in all treated groups, which included a transient loss of  and leukopenia. The effectiveness of AN-238 in a metastatic model was then investigated in animals implanted orthotopically with 2 x 10(6) PC-3 cells. Two i.v. injections of AN-238 or AN-201 at 150 nmol/kg were administered 10 days apart at 10 weeks after intraprostatic inoculation of PC-3 cells. After 4 weeks of treatment, the mean  of primary tumors in animals receiving AN-238 was 77% lower (P < 0.01) than that in controls. This reduction was also significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that in animals given AN-201, which showed only a 34% inhibition (nonsignificant versus controls). All control animals and four of six (67%) mice treated with AN-201 developed metastases in the lymph nodes; however, no lymphatic spread of cancer was found in the AN-238-treated group. Using reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we demonstrated the expression of SSTR2 and SSTR5 in intraprostatic tumors and their metastases in lymph nodes as well as in s.c. tumors. The present study demonstrates the high efficacy of SSTR-targeted chemotherapy in a model of advanced human androgen-independent prostatic carcinoma, as shown by the inhibition of primary tumors and their metastases by the cytotoxic SST analogue AN-238.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12162529>Purification and characterization of the allergenic components of shimeji mushroom (Tricholoma conglobatum) spore for shimeji workers' hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</a></h1><p>Respiratory symptoms and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) among mushroom workers have been well documented. Inhalation of shimeji mushroom (Tricholoma conglobatum) spore has been assumed to be the cause of HP among indoor shimeji cultivating workers. We isolated and partially characterized the allergenic components of shimeji. The sera from 9 HP patients, 10 asymptomatic shimeji workers and 15 normal individuals were examined for shimeji specific IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA using crude shimeji extract. Shimeji specific IgG- and IgA-antibodies were higher in sera from HP patients than in sera from control subjects. Crude shimeji spore extract was separated and purified by HPLC followed by SDS-PAGE, and their antigenic activity was studied by immunoblotting with a pool of sera from patients. Sera from all HP patients showed IgG and IgA antibody activities to 21, 16 and 14 kD proteins extracted from shimeji spore. The 21 kD protein contained internal peptide amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly--Val-Ile-Asn-Leu-Leu-Gly, Gln-Arg--Glu-Glu and Gln-Gly-Ile-Tyr. These results demonstrate that shimeji spore extract contains multiple proteinous components, which have antigenic activity to react with the sera from HP patients among shimeji workers. These proteins may be the potent sensitizing allergens to cause HP among shimeji cultivating workers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9438293>Apparent digestibility of protein and amino acids in broiler chickens fed a corn-soybean diet supplemented with microbial phytase.</a></h1><p>The effect of microbial phytase supplementation on CP and amino acid (AA) digestibility was investigated in a 28-d trial using 360 sexed, day-old broiler chickens fed corn-soybean meal diets. The experimental design was a completely randomized one with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. The variables included P and Ca levels and phytase: P and Ca levels were: normal P-normal Ca [0.45% available P (Pa), 1.0% Ca], low P-normal Ca (0.35% Pa, 1.0% Ca), and low P-low Ca (0.35 Pa and 0.6% Ca); and phytase at 0 and 600 U/kg diet. Phytase supplementation increased  gain (P < 0.014) and feed intake (P < 0.004) at 19 d in male chickens; in females, phytase increased (P < 0.012) only  gain at 19 d. The low P-normal Ca diet reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake and  gain in both sexes at 7, 14, and 19 d, compared to the normal P-normal Ca diet; the reduction of Ca in the low P diet prevented the above depression, resulting in  gain and feed intake to a level comparable to that of the normal P-normal Ca diet. Microbial phytase supplementation had no effect (P < 0.065) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP or any AA except Met and  in male broiler chickens. In females, adding phytase increased the AID of all AA except Lys, Met, , and Pro. The low P-normal Ca diet reduced (P < 0.05) the AID of , Asp, and Ser in male chickens and reduced the AID of all the AA except Met and Pro in females compared to the normal P-normal Ca diet. The reduction of Ca in the low P diet prevented the depression of the AID of the AA caused by the low P-normal Ca diet, resulting in AID of AA having a level comparable to that of the normal P-normal Ca diet in both sexes. Phytase supplementation did not have any effect (P > 0.05) on apparent "fecal" digestibility (AFD) of CP or any of the AA in male chickens; however, in female chickens it increased the AFD of , Asp, Glu, and Ser. In summary, phytase supplementation increased growth performance in both sexes; increased AID and AFD of most of the AA, particularly in female chickens. The optimum growth performance and AA digestibilities were obtained with the lowest input of resources, in the low P-low Ca diet supplemented with microbial phytase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9058961>Purification, properties, and N-terminal amino acid sequences of guar gum-degrading enzyme from Bacillus circulans K-1.</a></h1><p>A guar gum-degrading enzyme of the newly isolated Bacillus circulans K-1 was purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state.

The characteristic lipids are recognized as glycopeptidolipid (GPL) antigen consisted of short-chain acylated oligosaccharides linked to long-chain fatty acyl-D--D-allo -D-Ala-L-alaninol-O-3, 4-di-O-methyl rhamnose 'core'. The lack of information on the properties of GPL antigen from serovar 16 and a large number of patients infected with MAC serovar 16 have prompted an examination of the chemical structures utilizing the analytical techniques of alditol acetates with GC or GC/MS, and making use of FAB/MS and 1H-NMR to analyze the intact GPLs. The following structure of serovar 16 GPL antigen was proposed with molecular : 1933, main fatty acyl component: OH-C32:0, and oligosaccharides: 3-amido (2'-methyl, 3'-hydroxy, 4'-methoxy pentanoyl) 3, 6-dideoxy hexose-->4-O-methyl-L-rhamnose-->L-rhamnose-->L-rhamnose-->6-deoxy-L-talose The unique structure may be an important factor in physiological and pathological roles. The GPL antigens were highly reactive in ELISA against sera from rabbits hyperimmunized with MAC strains, indicating its basic antigenicity. The type-specific antigen of serovar 16 was also specifically reactive against sera from patients infected with MAC serovar 16, but invariant core was not. Apparently, the epitope of GPL antigen of serovar 16 was specific oligosaccharides, 3-amido (2'-methyl, 3'-hydroxy, 4'-methoxy pentanoyl) 3, 6-dideoxy hexose. It was found that the ELISA using GPL antigens was particularly useful for the serovar diagnosis of human infections with MAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2733541>Protective effect of an orally administered, highly potent somatostatin analog (RC-121) against absolute ethanol-induced hemorrhagic erosions of the rat gastric mucosa.</a></h1><p>The cytoprotective effect of a highly potent somatostatin (SRIF) analog, RC-121 (H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys--NH2), was examined in the absolute ethanol-induced gastric erosion model in rat.

The aminio acid compositions of two enzymes were very similar. N-terminal amino acid sequences of larval and pupal enzymes were Glu-Glu-Ala--Val-Val-Pro-Asp-Gly- and Ala--Val-Val-Pro-Asp-Gly-Tyr--Met-, respectively, and the residues 3-9 (larval phenoloxidase) were in agreement with the residues 1-7 (pupal phenoloxidase).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2009280>The presence of a covalently cross-linked matrix in human platelets.</a></h1><p>Exhaustive extraction of human platelets with 6 M guanidine-HCl, and 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, followed by 5% SDS resulted in a sedimentable material which showed fibrous structure by transmission electron microscopy. When platelets treated with 8 M urea, 50 mM DTT and 2% SDS were applied on a 3% solubilizable acrylamide gel a high molecular  material could be also isolated which was highly crosslinked by epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bonds.

The quantity of platelet polymer material as well as the amount of epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bond was slightly higher in thrombin activated platelets. The insoluble matrix of resting platelets reacts with antibodies against spectrin, alpha-actinin, actin, myosin, tropomyosin. The matrix from activated platelets has shown reaction with additional antibodies including ones against blood coagulation factor XIIIa, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, tubulin and filamin. The presence of an epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-linked cell matrix in platelets is consistent with the observation of a similar structure in other cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423885>Effect of fermented biogas residue on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the effect of fermented biogas residue (FBR) of wheat on the performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.We selected 128 pigs (the mean initial  was 40.24±3.08 kg) and randomly allocated them to 4 groups (1 control group and 3 treatment groups) with 4 replicates per group and 8 pigs per pen in a randomized complete block design based on initial  and sex. The control group received a corn-soybean meal-based diet, the treatment group fed diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% FBR, respectively (abbreviated as FBR5, FBR10, and FBR15, respectively). Every group received equivalent-energy and nitrogen diets. The test lasted 60 days and was divided into early and late stages. Blood and carcass samples were obtained on 60 d. Meat quality was collected from two pigs per pen.During the late stage, the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the treatment groups was greater than that of the control group (p<0.05). During the entire experiment, the average daily gain of the treatment groups was higher than that of the control group (p<0.05). Fermented biomass residue did not significantly affect serum biochemical parameters or meat quality, but did affect amino acid profiles in pork. The contents of Asp, Arg, Tyr, , Leu, , Ser, Lys, Pro, Ala, essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, and total amino acids in pork of FBR5 and FBR10 were greater than those of the control group (p<0.05).These combined results suggest that feeding FBR could increase the average daily gain and average daily feed intake in pigs and the content of several flavor-promoting amino acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18346051>Antitumoural effect of an L-amino acid oxidase isolated from Bothrops jararaca snake venom.</a></h1><p>An L-amino acid oxidase (BjarLAAO-I) from Bothrops jararaca snake venom was highly purified using a stepwise sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-75, Benzamidine Sepharose and Phenyl Sepharose. Purified BjarLAAO-I showed a molecular weight around 60,000 under reducing conditions and about 125,000 in the native form, when analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, respectively. BjarLAAO-I is a homodimeric acidic glycoprotein, pI approximately 5.0, and N-terminal sequence showing close structural homology with other snake venom LAAOs. The purified enzyme catalysed the oxidative deamination of L-amino acids, the most specific substrate being L-. Five amino acids, L-Ser, L-Pro, L-Gly, L- and L-Cys were not oxidized, clearly indicating a significant specificity. BjarLAAO-I significantly inhibited Ehrlich ascites tumour growth and induced an influx of polymorphonuclear cells, as well as spontaneous liberation of H(2)O(2) from peritoneal macrophages.

The isoelectric point of the immunodulatory peptide was determined to be 3.82 by capillary isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. The molecular mass of the immunomodulatory peptide was determined to be 2133.52 Da by mass spectrometry. The first 10 amino acid sequence of the immunomodulatory peptide was Tyr-X--Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-X-. This immunomodulatory peptide showed no significant homology with other immunomodulatory peptides.

Using the peptidic substrate H-Pro--Glu--(NO2)-Arg-Leu-OH, which is specific for aspartyl proteases, proteases, proteolytic activity was detected in a number of tissues including muscle by using a crude extraction procedure for isolation of lysosomal enzymes. Biochemical characterization and increased muscle levels following either fasting or injection of endotoxin (ETX) suggest that the enzyme is likely cathepsin D. The wasting syndrome accompanying the tumor was measured by comparing the  of the skinned hind limb in treated and control animals. DBA/2 mice inoculated intraperitoneally with L1210 cells developed multiple solid tumors in the peritoneum and ascites; maximal tumor burden was reached by 16 days. There was a significant reduction in hind limb  (16 +/- 2%; mean +/- SE) and significant increase (31 +/- 8%) in muscle APA associated with the development of ascites and solid tumors. Plasma APA activity was substantially increased (240 +/- 33%), while liver and spleen APA were increased (10-20%) but not significantly. Chronic pepstatin administration, 30 mg.kg-1.day-1, for 7 days concurrent with the initiation of observable ascites and solid tumor formation (7 days post-inoculation), completely inhibited hind limb  loss and alleviated the tumor-dependent increase of APA in both plasma and muscle without altering tumor development. Delaying the administration of pepstatin by 3 days resulted in less of an inhibition (33 +/- 13%) of hind limb  loss. Thus, cathepsin D or a similar aspartyl protease appears to be of key importance in the wasting syndrome associated with cachexia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16553624>Mu-opioid receptor cellular function in the nucleus accumbens is essential for hedonically driven eating.</a></h1><p>Acute pharmacological studies have implicated mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in mediating responses for palatable food and other natural and drug-induced rewards. However, the long-term behavioral effects of inactivating signal transduction via accumbal MORs, as quantified by an anatomically defined loss of cellular activity, have never been analysed. We combined microinfusion of the irreversible MOR antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA; 8.0 nmol/0.8 microL, n=9; controls, n=6) with mapping by [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography to demonstrate an anatomically specific loss of the coupling of MORs to their G-proteins in the dorsal caudomedial shell of the NAC in rabbits. beta-FNA did not alter the stimulated coupling of kappa-opioid receptors. This selective blockade of the cellular function of MORs persistently decreased consumption of a palatable sucrose solution by 40% during a daily 4-h test conducted 2, 3 and 4 days after infusion. beta-FNA did not alter  or 20-h consumption of standard chow or water. In 10 different rabbits, infusion of the selective, competitive MOR antagonist, CTAP (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2) into the same locus produced a reversible decrease in sucrose consumption, with normal intakes returning on the next day. Together, these data appear to establish that MORs in this accumbal subregion support responding for orosensory reward. Overall, these results visualize a discrete brain locus where cellular actions of endogenous opioids mediate behaviors involved in self-administration of foods and perhaps other hedonically valued substances, such as ethanol and drugs of abuse.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10525358>Tachykinins (substance P and neuropeptide gamma) from the brains of the pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus and the paddlefish, Polyodon spathula (Acipenseriformes).</a></h1><p>A peptide with substance P-like immunoreactivity was isolated from extracts of the brains of the pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus and the North American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula. The primary structure of the peptide (Lys-Pro-Lys-Pro-His-Gln---Gly-Leu-Met.NH(2)) is the same in both species and contains 2 amino acid substitutions (Arg(1) --> Lys and Gln(5) --> His) compared with human substance P and 1 substitution (Arg(3) --> Lys) compared with substance P from the trout (Teleostei). Scyliorhinin I, a tachykinin previously isolated from an extract of sturgeon intestine, was not detected in either brain extract.

It was not possible to obtain the paddlefish neurokinin A-related peptide in pure form.

We have therefore evaluated naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in rats after central infusion during 7 days of comparable antinociceptive doses of RB 38 A ((R,S)HONH-CO-CH2-CH(CH2C6H5)-CONH-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH), a mixed enkephalin catabolism blocker and of the selective mu, DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me)-Gly-ol) and delta, DSTBULET (Tyr-D-Ser(OtBu)-Gly--Leu-), opioid agonists. The responses were compared to those induced by RB 38 B ((S,S)HONH-CO-CH2-CH(CH2C6H5)-CONH-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH), a selective inhibitor of the 24.11 neutral endopeptidase (NEP) 'enkephalinase'. DAGO induced a severe withdrawal syndrome evidenced by a large  loss, hypothermia, jumping, mastication, teeth chattering, diarrhoea, lacrimation and salivation. In contrast, DSTBULET and RB 38 A produced only a moderate physical dependence. Only two signs were statistically different in these two groups: wet dog shakes and temperature. Chronic i.c.v. administration of DAGO, DSTBULET and RB 38 A produced a time-dependent reduction in analgesia, but 120 h after continuous infusion only RB 38 A was able to still induce a significative antinociceptive effect. The present data suggest that even in the drastic conditions used here long-term complete inhibition of enkephalin catabolism induces a weak tolerance and a moderate physical dependence, similar to that produced by delta opioid agonists. This effect was not observed after chronic selective inhibition of NEP by RB 38 B.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9687021>Isolation and characterization of an alanyl aminopeptidase from rat liver cytosol as a puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase.</a></h1><p>Alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP-S) was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. The molecular  of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approximately 100,000 on Sephacryl S-200 HR and to be 90,000 on SDS-PAGE in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. These findings suggested that the enzyme exists as a monomeric form in rat liver cytosol. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates Ala-, Tyr- and Met-MCAs, and moderately hydrolyzed Arg-, Lys-, Leu-, - and Lys-Ala-MCAs at pHs ranging from 7.5to 8.0. The enzyme also hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order for k(cat)/Km values of AAP-S at the optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Lys->Met->Arg->Ala->Leu->->Tyr->Lys-Ala-MCAs. It was strongly inhibited by bestatin, leuhistin, actinonin, amastatin, 1, 10-phenanthroline, PCMBS, Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+, and puromycin. The amino acid sequence of the first 43 residues of the enzyme was determined as Pro1-Glu-Lys-Arg-Pro5--Glu-Arg-Leu-Pro10--Glu-Val-Ser-Pro 15-Ile-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Leu20-(Cys)-Leu-Lys-Pro-Asp25-Leu-Leu- Asp--Thr30--Glu-Gly-Lys-Leu35-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln40 -Val-Arg-Gln-. This N-terminal amino acid sequence is almost identical with those of puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidases in rat and human brains, and the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A. These findings suggest that the AAP-S from rat liver cytosol is a puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase. Furthermore, with immunohistochemistry the enzyme was strongly stained in the cytosol of the rat liver cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25960139>Purification, Partial Characterizations, and N-Terminal Amino Acid Sequence of a Procoagulant Protein FV-2 from Daboia Russelli Siamensis (Myanmar) Venom.</a></h1><p>In this study, we purified and characterized the procoagulant protein FV-2 from Daboia russelli siamensis (Myanmar) venom using ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50 and gel filtration on Superdex G-75 column. The activation of factor X and prothrombin was determined, respectively, by specific chromogenic substrates. The fibrinogen-clotting activity, thermal stability, and pH stability were also determined. The N-treminal sequence was determined by the National Center of Biomedical Analysis of China. In the end, FV-2 was achieved with a molecular  of 13,608.0 Da. It could activate factor X, but did not affect prothrombin or fibrinogen. The suitable pH was 6.5-7.5, and the suitable temperature ranged from 25 to 60°C. The N-terminal sequence was Asn---Gln--Ala-Glu-Met-Ile-Val-Lys-Met--Gly-Lys.

The purified beta-1,3-glucan binding protein was homogenous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 100,000 Da and an isoelectric point of approximately 5.0. Amino acid analysis showed a very high similarity with the amino acid composition of beta-1,3-glucan binding proteins recently purified from two insects, the cockroach Blaberus craniifer and the silkworm Bombyx mori. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be: H2N-Asp-Ala-Gly-X-Ala-Ser-Leu-Val--Asn--Asn-Ser-Ala-Lys-Leu-X-X-Ly s--- Using monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies, the presence of this protein has also been shown within the blood cells. The purified beta-1,3-glucan binding protein did not show any peptidase or phenoloxidase activity but was able to enhance the activation of hemocyte-derived peptidase and prophenoloxidase only in the presence of the beta-1,3-glucan, laminarin, whereas mannan, dextran (alpha-glucan), or cellulose (beta-1,4-glucan) incubated with the beta-1,3-glucan binding protein had no effect on these enzyme activities. The beta-1,3-glucan binding protein could only be affinity-precipitated from crayfish plasma by the beta-1,3-glucans laminarin or curdlan (an insoluble beta-1,3-glucan), while mannan or dextran did not bind to the beta-1,3-glucan binding protein.

KSM-1378.</a></h1><p>The novel alkaline amylopullulanase produced by alkalophilic Bacillus sp. KSM-1378 was purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state from culture medium. The purified enzyme was a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of about 210 kDa and an isoelectric point of pH 4.8. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was Glu--Gly-Asp-Lys-Arg-Ile-Glu--Ser-Tyr-Glu-Arg-Pro and showed no homology to the N-terminal regions of other amylopullulanases reported to date. The enzyme was able to attack specifically the alpha-1,6 linkages in pullulan to generate maltotriose as the major end product, as well as the alpha-1,4 linkages in amylose, amylopectin and glycogen to generate various oligosaccharides. The pH and temperature optima for the pullulanase and alpha-amylase activities were pH 9.5 and 50 degrees C and pH 8.5 and 50 degrees C respectively. Both activities were strongly inhibited by well characterized inhibitors, such as diethyl pyrocarbonate and N-bromosuccinimide. The pullulanase activity was specifically inactivated by Hg2+ ions, alpha-cyclodextrin and beta-cyclodextrin while the amylase activity was strongly inhibited by EDTA and EGTA, although inhibition could be reversed by Ca2+ ions. It is suggested that the single alkaline amylopullulanase protein has two different active sites, one for the cleavage of alpha-1,4-linked substrates and one for the cleavage of alpha-1,6-linked substrates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18051597>Characterization and action patterns of two beta-1,4-glucanases purified from cellulomonas uda CS1-1.</a></h1><p>Two beta-1,4-glucanases (DI and DIII fractions) were purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate of a cellulolytic bacteria, Cellulomonas sp. CS1-1, which was classified as a novel species belonging to Cellulomonas uda based on chemotaxanomic and phylogenetic analyses. The molecular mass was estimated as 50,000 Da and 52,000 Da for DI and DIII, respectively. Moreover, DIII was identified as a glycoprotein with a pI of 3.8, and DI was identified as a non-glycoprotein with a pI of 5.3. When comparing the ratio of the CMC-saccharifying activity and CMC-liquefying activity, DI exhibited a steep slope, characteristic of an endoglucanase, whereas DIII exhibited a low slope, characteristic of an exoglucanase. The substrate specificity of the purified enzymes revealed that DI efficiently hydrolyzed CMC as well as xylan, whereas DIII exhibited a high activity on microcrystalline celluloses, such as Sigmacells. A comparison of the hydrolysis patterns for pNP-glucosides (DP 2-5) using an HPLC analysis demonstrated that the halosidic bond 3 from the nonreducing end was the preferential cleavage site for DI, whereas bond 2, from which the cellobiose unit is split off, was the preferential cleavage site for DIII. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequences for the purified enzymes were 1Ala-Gly-Ser--Leu-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Glu-Ser-Gly-Arg-Tyr15- for DI and 1Ala-Asp-Ser-Asp--Asn-Leu-Tyr-Val-Ala-Glu-Asn-Ala-Met-Lys15- for DIII.

Each pig was previously fitted under anaesthesia with electromagnetic flow probes around the portal vein and the hepatic artery, and with permanent catheters in the portal vein, carotid artery, one hepatic vein and the duodenum. Each solution was infused for 1 h after a fasting period (18 h) and each pig received both solutions at 8 d intervals. The observation period lasted 8 h. For most AA (his, lys, , , arg, tyr, pro) the absorption rate after infusion of PEP was significantly higher than after that of AAL during the 1st hour, but the differences quickly disappeared. After 8 h, the only differences concerned his and tyr (PEP > AAL) and met, glu and asp (AAL > PEP). There was a large uptake of blood AA by gut-wall cells, higher after AAL infusion than after PEP infusion, particularly for branched-chain AA (BCAA). The absorption of ammonia-nitrogen after both infusions was equivalent to two-thirds of urea-N passing from blood to intestinal tissues and lumen. Glucose absorbed within 8 h represented only 76% (PEP) or 69% (AAL) of the infused amounts. The cumulative hepatic total AA (TAA) uptake increased from 13 to 27% of the infused amounts between the 1st and the 8th hour after PEP infusion, and from 8 to 31% after AAL infusion. Most essential AA were largely taken up by the liver, with the exception of met (PEP) and  and of BCAA, which were poorly retained for both solutions; there was a high uptake of ala and gly, and a release of asp, glu, and gln. Urea-N released by the liver within 8 h was equivalent to 23-25% absorbed amino-N and to around 1.5 times ammonia-N taken up by the liver within 8 h. Glucose was highly taken up by the liver during the first hours then released, the total uptake within 8 h representing about half the absorbed amount.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8302297>Glycosylation site of the major allergen from olive tree pollen. Allergenic implications of the carbohydrate moiety.</a></h1><p>The electrophoretic analysis of purified Ole e I, the major allergen from Olea europaea pollen, reveals the presence of two main variants, glycosylated (20.0 kDa) and non-glycosylated (18.5 kDa) components. The glycosylated variant has been identified as a concanavalin A-binding glycoprotein. Its carbohydrate moiety has a molecular mass of about 1.3 kDa (5%  of the glycosylated allergen), based on mass spectrometry analysis. Enzymatic treatment of native Ole e I with the specific glycosidase PNGase F accounts for an oligosaccharide N-linked to the polypeptide chain. This treatment does not sensibly modify the secondary structure of the protein but diminishes the affinity of the allergen for specific IgE antibodies. Tryptic digestion of Ole e I reveals the presence of a single carbohydrate-containing peptide. This peptide was recognized by the sera of hypersensitive individuals. The amino acid sequence of this peptide is -Lys-Leu-Asn--Val-Asn-Gly---Arg, asparagine at the seventh being the carbohydrate attaching site. The obtained data are discussed in terms of the potential role of the sugar moiety in the allergenic activity of Ole e I.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17366895>[Purification and characterization of a lipase from Aspergillus niger F044].</a></h1><p>A lipase from Aspergillus niger F044 was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography. This purification protocol resulted in a 73.71-fold purification of lipase with 33.99% final yield, and the relative molecular  of the enzyme was determined to be approximately 35-40kD using SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature for lipolytic activity of the lipase was 7.0 and 45 degrees C , respectively. It was extremely stable at 60 degrees C and retained 98.70% of its original activity for 30min. The stability declined rapidly as soon as the temperature rose over 65 degrees C . The lipase was highly stable in the pH range from 2.0 to 9.0 for 4h. Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions stimulated lipolytic activity, whereas Mn2+ , Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions caused inhibition. The values of Km and Vmax calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using pNPP as hydrolysis substrate were 7.37mmol/L and 25.91 micromol/(min x mg), respectively. The N-terminal sequence of the lipase was Ser/Glu/His-Val-Ser--Ser--Leu-Asp-Glu-Leu-Gln-Leu--Ala-Gln, which is highly homogeneity with that of lipase, as reported by Torossian.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10070742>Hydrolytic enzymes of Psoroptes cuniculi (Delafond).</a></h1><p>Phosphatases, C4 and C8 esterases, leucine and valine aminopeptidases, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase were detected in extracts of the parasitic mite Psoroptes cuniculi. Lipase, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities were not present. Haemoglobin was hydrolysed by a detergent-soluble fraction of the mite extracts with a maximum hydrolysis between pH 3 and 5. Acid proteinase activity was greater against haemoglobin than bovine serum albumin.

In contrast to the situation in other insects, where the major site of inactivation is the Malpighian tubules (excretory organs), in Manduca the capacity of the hemolymph to metabolize adipokinetic hormone is comparable to that of the Malpighian tubules. The hemolymph enzyme cleaves Manduca adipokinetic hormone (pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp-Gly-NH2) to give the fragment pGlu-Leu---. Other fragments were not positively identified. The enzyme is present in the plasma and not in hemocytes, and occurs at similar levels in the hemolymph of larvae, pupae and adults. The enzyme is inactivated by boiling, has a neutral pH optimum (7.0-7.5), and an estimated molecular  of 66 kDa. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by inhibitors of metalloprotease activity (EGTA and 1,10-phenanthroline), but not by serine protease inhibitors. The enzyme was capable of metabolizing a number of AKH family peptides with varying sequences around the presumed site of cleavage. An accurate assessment of enzyme kinetics was not possible with the assay method used, but the enzyme was not saturated at a substrate concentration of 10 microM, and the value of Km must be at least 1 microM. It is possible that the enzyme may represent a low affinity system of peptide removal rather than the principal means of inactivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26500271>Lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, arginine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and threonine maintenance requirements of broiler breeders.</a></h1><p>Five hundred and sixty Cobb-Vantress broiler breeders were used to determine the maintenance requirement of dietary Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , and Val in 10 21-d assays using the comparative slaughter technique. Fifty sexually immature broiler breeder pullets per assay were given crystalline amino acid diets containing graded levels of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , or Val, respectively, representing 0, 10, 20, 30, 40% of their suggested requirement level (NRC, 1994) with all other amino acids maintained at 40% of their suggested requirement level. Sixty hens were slaughtered prior to the beginning of the study to assess initial  composition at 3  groups. Linear regression lines (protein accretion vs. amino acid intake) were determined and the maintenance requirements were calculated based on zero protein accretion. The maintenance requirements expressed on a metabolic  basis were determined to be 174, 94, 52, 81, 60, 126, 133, and 155 mg/kg(0.75)/d for Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , and Val, respectively. Additionally, the maintenance requirements, expressed on metabolic protein  basis, were determined to be 651, 329, 172, 295, 223, 523, 478, and 546 mg/kgCP/d for Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , and Val, respectively. The requirement for His could not be established as the results obtained were outside of assay range.© 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1730484>Characterization of the neurotoxin isolated from a Clostridium baratii strain implicated in infant botulism.</a></h1><p>Botulism is widely known to result from ingestion of food containing botulinum neurotoxin produced in situ by certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism caused by C. botulinum, unlike the food-borne intoxication, is the toxicoinfectious form of botulism (S. S. Arnon, p. 331-345, in G. E. Lewis, ed., Biomedical Aspects of Botulism, 1981). The strain of Clostridium baratii implicated in infant botulism produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized with antiserum for botulinum neurotoxin serotype F (J. D. Hall, L. M. McCroskey, B. J. Pincomb, and C. L. Hatheway, J. Clin. Microbiol. 21:654-655, 1985). We developed a procedure to culture the toxigenic C. baratii (strain 6341) in dialysis bags and a simple purification scheme (precipitation of 900-ml culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate and two anion-exchange chromatographic steps at pH 5.5 and 8.0) that yielded up to 150 micrograms of purified neurotoxin. It is an approximately 140-kDa single-chain protein and has the following sequence of amino acid residues at the N terminus: Pro-Val-Asn-Ile-Asn-Asn--Asn-Tyr-Asn-Asp-Pro-Ile-Asn-Asn---Ile- Leu. Comparison of this amino acid sequence with those of the botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, and E showed 40 to 50% identical residues in comparable positions. The specific toxicity of the neurotoxin, approximately 2 x 10(6) 50% lethal doses for mice per mg of protein injected, was not enhanced significantly by mild trypsinization, although the protease cleaved the neurotoxin within a disulfide loop that generated at least two primary fragments, approximately 47 and approximately 86 kDa, that remained linked by an interchain disulfide. These two fragments resembled the light and heavy chains of the well-characterized neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C, D, E, and F produced by C. botulinum.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2524482>Pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase. Lys-497 conserved in cation transporting ATPases is modified with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.</a></h1><p>Pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase can be covalently modified with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) (about 1 mol/mol enzyme), and this modification is not observed in the presence of ATP, suggesting that PLP binds to a specific Lys residue in the ATP binding site or the region in its vicinity (Maeda, M., Tagaya, M., and Futai, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3652-3656). The peptides labeled with radioactive PLP could be released from the gastric membrane vesicles quantitatively by chymotrypsin treatment, and two peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatographies. These peptides were not obtained from vesicles incubated with PLP in the presence of ATP. The sequences of the two peptides were NH2-Asn-Ser--Asn-Lys--COOH and NH2-Ser--Asn-Lys--COOH, exactly corresponding to residues 493-498 and 494-498, respectively, of pig gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase sequenced recently (Maeda, M., Ishizaki, J., and Futai, M. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 157, 203-209). Lys-497 was concluded to be the binding site of PLP, as pyridoxyl-Lys was identified at the corresponding position. This Lys residue is conserved in (Na+ + K+)- and Ca2+-ATPases. The possible amino acid residues in the catalytic site of gastric (H+ + K+)-ATPase are discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23999161>Characterization of 2-(methylamino)alkanoic acid capacity to restrict blood-brain phenylalanine transport in Pah enu2 mice: preliminary findings.</a></h1><p>Our laboratory seeks a pharmacotherapeutic intervention for PKU that utilizes non-physiological amino acids (NPAAs) to block the accumulation of phenylalanine () in the brain. In previous studies (Vogel et al. 2013), methylation of the amino group of 2-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) provided an enhanced degree of selectivity for  restriction into the brain of Pah(enu2) mice in comparison to unmethylated AIB, leading to the hypothesis that 2-(methylamino)alkanoic acid analogs of AIB might represent targeted inhibitors of  accretion into the brain.Pah(enu2) and control mice were intraperitoneally administered (500-750 mg/kg , once daily; standard 19% protein diet) AIB, methyl AIB (MAIB), isovaline, and two MAIB analogs, 2-methyl-2-(methylamino)butanoic (MeVal) and 3-methyl-2-(methylamino)pentanoic (MePent) acids for one week, followed by brain and blood isolation for amino acid analyses using UPLC.In the brain, AIB significantly reduced  accretion in Pah(enu2) mice, while MeVal significantly improved glutamine and aspartic acids. Four of five test compounds improved brain threonine and arginine levels. AIB, MAIB and IsoVal significantly reduced blood , with no effect of any drug intervention on other sera amino acids.Further evaluation of AIB and the 2-(methylamino)alkanoic acids as inhibitors of brain  accumulation in Pah(enu2) mice is warranted, with more detailed evaluations of route of administration, combinatorial intervention, and detailed toxicity studies.© 2013.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7747964>Identification and purification of a new staphylococcal enterotoxin, H.</a></h1><p>A staphylococcal enterotoxin which elicited an emetic response in monkeys but did not share antigenic determinants with any of the identified enterotoxins was identified and purified from Staphylococcus aureus FRI-569. The emetic activity of this new enterotoxin was neutralized only by antibodies specific to it and not by antibodies to enterotoxins A, B, C, D, and E or toxic shock syndrome toxin 1. Immunodiffusion assays did not detect cross-reactivity between this new and all the other identified enterotoxins. The purification procedure involved removal of the enterotoxin from culture supernatant fluids by batch adsorption with CG-50 resin, CM-Sepharose FL ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephacryl 100 HR and Bio-Gel P-30 gel filtration. The molecular  of this enterotoxin, 27,300, determined by gel filtration on Sephacryl 100 HR agreed with the molecular , 28,500, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The apparent migration of this enterotoxin determined by SDS-PAGE did not shift in the presence of a disulfide reducing agent, indicating that it is composed of a single-chain protein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enterotoxin was determined to be Glu-Asp-Leu-His-Asp-Lys-Ser-Glu-Leu--Asp-Leu-Ala-Leu-Ala-Asn-Ala-Tyr- Gly- Gln-Tyr-Asn-His-Pro--Ile-Lys-Glu-Asn-Ile, which did not match the N-terminal sequences of any known proteins.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was Ala--Met-Lys-Tyr-X---Gly-Gly-Pro-Val-Ala-Gly-Lys-Ile-Asn-Val-His-Leu-. The alpha-mannosidase activity for Man(5)GlcNAc(1) was enhanced by the addition of Co(2+), but the addition of Zn(2+), Ca(2+), or EDTA did not show any significant effect. In the presence of cobalt ions, the hydrolysis rate for pyridylaminated Man(6)GlcNAc(1) was significantly faster than that for pyridylaminated Man(6)GlcNAc(2), suggesting the possibility that this enzyme is involved in the degradation of free N-glycans occurring in developing plant cells (Kimura, Y., and Matsuo, S., J. Biochem., 127, 1013-1019 (2000)). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that plant cells contain an alpha-mannosidase, which is activated by Co(2+) and prefers the oligomannose type free N-glycans bearing only one GlcNAc residue as substrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29509931>Effects of feeding reduced crude protein diets on growth performance, nitrogen excretion, and plasma uric acid concentration of broiler chicks during the starter period.</a></h1><p>An experiment (2 trials) was conducted to determine the effects of feeding reduced crude protein (CP) diets to Ross × Ross 708 male broilers while maintaining adequate essential amino acid (AA) concentrations on growth performance, nitrogen excretion, and plasma uric acid (UA) concentration during the starter period. In trial 1, 11 dietary treatments were fed from 1 to 18 d of age containing 1.20% digestible Lys. Diet 1 (23.2% CP) was formulated with DL-Met, L-Lys, and L- to contain 1.70 total Gly + Ser to digestible Lys ratio whereas diets 2 (23.4% CP) to 11 were formulated with additional Gly to contain 1.90 total Gly + Ser to digestible Lys ratio. Free AA were added sequentially in the order of limitation (L-Val, L-Ile, L-Arg, L-Trp, L-His, L-, and L-Leu) from diets 3 to 10 to decrease CP content from 22.6 to 18.8%, respectively. In diet 11, L-Gln was added to increase the CP content to 23.4%. Feed conversion of broilers fed diet 2 was lower (P < 0.05) than those consuming diets 6 to 11 from 1 to 17 d of age. Nitrogen excretion (mg/b/d) decreased (P < 0.001) by 14.1% when broilers were fed diet 4 compared with birds fed diet 2 from 15 to 16 d of age. Broilers fed diet 4 had lower (P = 0.011) plasma UA concentration than birds fed diet 2 at 18 d of age. In trial 2, 8 dietary treatments containing 1.25% digestible Lys and 1.70 total Gly + Ser to digestible Lys ratio were fed from 1 to 21 d of age. Diet 1 (24.0% CP) was supplemented with DL-Met, L-Lys, and L-. Free AA (L-Val, Gly, L-Ile, L-Arg, L-Trp, L-His, and L-) were sequentially supplemented in the order of limitation to decrease CP content in diets 2 to 8 from 23.8 to 20.3%. Broilers fed diet 1 had higher (P < 0.05)  gain and lower (P < 0.05) feed conversion when compared with diet 7 or 8. Plasma UA concentration of broiler provided diets 4 to 8 was lower (P < 0.05) compared with diet 1 at 21 d of age.

In order to identify the structural domain of factor XI that binds high Mr kininogen, CNBr-digested factor XI was passed over a 5F7 antibody affinity column. One of two CNBr peptides that bound to this 5F7 affinity column inhibited binding of 125I-factor XI to high Mr kininogen, as did intact factor XI. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate of an inhibitory peptide purified by high performance liquid chromatography revealed an Mr of 10,000-15,000. Gas-phase sequencing of this peptide revealed the following amino-terminal sequence: X-X-Val--Gln-Leu-Leu-Lys-Asp-. These data together with the amino acid composition of the isolated peptide indicate that both the epitope recognized by antibody 5F7 and at least a portion of the high Mr kininogen binding site are contained within the amino-terminal portion of factor XI comprising residues Glu-1 through Met-102. Further cleavage of this peptide with o-iodosobenzoic acid at a tryptophanyl peptide bond revealed that an Mr 5,000 peptide (with the amino-terminal sequence Trp---Cys-Val-Leu) bound to a high Mr kininogen affinity column and inhibited binding of 125I-factor XI to high Mr kininogen. Finally, a synthetic peptide comprising residues -56 through Ser-86 inhibited 125I-factor XI binding to high Mr kininogen. These experiments strongly suggest that the high Mr kininogen binding site is contained within the domain in the heavy chain region of factor XI comprising residues -56 through Ser-86.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8250978>[Complete primary structure of Bacillus thuringiensis extracellular ribonuclease].</a></h1><p>Complete primary structure of an extracellular low molecular mass ribonuclease of Bacillus thuringiensis was determined using Edman degradation and mass-spectrometry analysis of individual peptides obtained after hydrolysis of the protein by cyanogen bromide and staphylococcal protease.

Our hypothesis was that at a given level of milk protein output, p[EAA] would remain steady in response to increasing EAAduo until the EAA requirement was met, at which point p[EAA] would increase rapidly in response to greater duodenal flow of EAA until p[EAA] reached a plateau as other  processes degraded excess EAA to avoid toxicity. Thus, the requirement of each EAA would be fulfilled when p[EAA] increased rapidly. To investigate this hypothesis, we compiled a literature database that included 102 studies with 420 treatment means that reported p[EAA], dietary nutrient content, , and milk production. A second database was produced to validate relationships developed in the first database and included 32 studies with 98 treatment means. All relationships were evaluated as regression equations with study as a random factor. Breed, days in milk, , and milk protein production had no effect on the plasma concentration of any EAA. Other than metabolizable protein supply, nutritional content of the rations did not affect p[EAA]. Only p[Arg] was affected by parity, with primiparous cows having higher concentrations of Arg than older cows. No break points in the relationship between p[EAA] versus EAAduo were detected as either steep increases or plateaus. Plasma Arg, Ile, Lys, , and Val concentrations were best associated with their respective EAAduo as quadratic equations, whereas His, Leu, Met, and  were associated only linearly. Adding a quadratic term improved the adjusted R(2) or decreased the root mean square error marginally (<2.0%). Thus, we conclude that the main effect of EAAduo on p[EAA] is linear. Abomasal or duodenal infusions of Met, Lys, His, Lys+Met, and casein revealed that Met or Lys infused alone increased the plasma concentration of the infused EAA and lowered the concentration of other EAA, particularly His. Infusion of Lys+Met or His alone was associated with increases in concentrations of these EAA without affecting others. We conclude that over a wide range of protein intakes in lactating cows, plasma levels of EAA increase linearly with duodenal flow. No evidence was found that EAA requirements are reflected in blood plasma concentrations.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The complex of metabolic derangements of protein in cancer patients may be reflected by alteration in the plasma free amino acid profile. In this study, we try to investigate the plasma free amino acid profile in patients with colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, which are the most common cancers in Taiwan.Fasting venous blood samples were drawn from sixteen control volunteers and 42 cancer-bearing patients including 14 early stage colorectal cancer patients (Duke A and B), 18 late stage ones (Duke C and D) and 10 liver cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Seventeen amino acid levels were measured using a Beckman amino acid analyzer.About one third of early or late colorectal cancer patients had  loss more than 10% in half a year and were defined as malnourished. For individual amino acids, in early colorectal cancer patients, the plasma level of most essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids decreased (significantly in Tyr, Ala, Met,  and ). In late stage colorectal cancer patients and patients with liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma levels of most essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids decreased more obviously. For group amino acids, the plasma levels of essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, gluconeogenic amino acids and branched-chain amino acids were also lower in the cancer patients than those in control volunteers. The difference was also noticeably significant in patients with late stage colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. The plasma free amino acid patterns in colorectal cancer patients are quite different from those in patients with non-gastrointestinal cancer and  loss. The plasma level of essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids was not kept within normal range in colorectal cancer patients. Elevation of plasma aromatic amino acids and methionine levels usually observed in liver cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma was not apparent in our cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.The plasma free amino acid patterns in our colorectal cancer patients and cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were rather characteristic.

The deduced amino acid sequence of Syrian hamster PrPC identifies two potential sites for the addition of Asn-linked carbohydrates at amino acids 181-183 (Asn-Ile-) and 197-199 (Asn--). We have altered these sites by replacing the threonine residues with alanine and expressed the mutant proteins transiently in CV1 cells utilizing a mutagenesis vector with the T7 promoter located upstream from the PrP gene. The T7 RNA polymerase was supplied by infection with a recombinant vaccinia virus. The 3 mutant proteins (PrPAla183, PrPAla199 and PrPAla183/199) have a reduced relative molecular  compared to wild-type (wt) PrP. Deglycosylation as well as synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin reduced the relative molecular  of all the PrP species to that of the double mutant PrPAla183/199. Our results indicate that both single-site mutant prion proteins are glycosylated at non-mutated sites and they suggest that both potential sites for Asn-linked glycosylation are utilized in wt PrPC. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that while wt PrPC localizes to the cell surface, all the mutant PrP molecules accumulate intracellularly. The site of accumulation of PrPAla183 is probably prior to the mid-Golgi stack since this protein does not acquire resistance to endoglycosidase H. Whether the intracellular locations of the mutant PrPC species are the same as those identified for the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) remains to be established.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10432319>Lipid-binding and antimicrobial properties of synthetic peptides of bovine apolipoprotein A-II.</a></h1><p>We previously showed that bovine apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) had antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in PBS. We have characterized here the active domain of apoA-II using synthetic peptides. A peptide corresponding to C-terminal residues Leu(49)-(76) exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli in PBS, but not against S. cerevisiae. Experiments using amino-acid-substituted peptides indicated that the residues (52)-(53)-Lys(54)-Lys(55) are required for the activity. Peptide Leu(49)-(76) induced the release of calcein trapped inside the vesicles whose lipid composition resembles that of E. coli membrane, suggesting that peptide Leu(49)-(76) can destabilize the E. coli membrane. CD measurements showed that the alpha-helicity of peptide Leu(49)-(76) increased from 3.5 to 36% by addition of the vesicles. When E. coli cells were incubated with peptide Leu(49)-(76), some proteins were released to the external medium, probably owing to membrane destabilization caused by the peptide. In electron micrographs of E. coli cells treated with peptide Leu(49)-(76), transparent nucleoids and granulated cytoplasm were observed. Amino acid substitutions, (52)(53)-->AlaAla ((52, 53)-->Ala) in peptide Leu(49)-(76) caused the loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli, although protein-releasing activity was retained. Electron micrographs of the cells treated with peptide Leu(49)-(76)((52,53)-->Ala) revealed morphological change only at the nucleoids. Therefore peptide Leu(49)-(76) appears to primarily target the cytoplasm rather than the membrane of E. coli cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439548>Effect of reverse photoperiod on in vitro regeneration and piperine production in Piper nigrum L.</a></h1><p>In this study, a novel approach for in vitro regeneration of Piper nigrum L. has been applied in order to increase healthy biomass, phytochemicals and piperine production via reverse photoperiod (16hD/8hL). Leaf portions of the seed-derived plants were placed on an MS-medium fortified with different PGRs. Under 16hD/8hL, thidiazuron (TDZ; 4.0 mg L⁻¹) and BA (1.5 mg L⁻¹) was found to be the most effective (<90%) in callus induction. Two concentrations (1.5, 2.0 mg L⁻¹) of the IBA produced>80% shoots from callus cultures. Healthy shoots were transferred to rooting medium and higher percentage of rooting (<90%) was observed on IBA (1.5 mg L⁻¹). These in vitro tissues were subjected to amino acid analysis, spectrophotometry, and HPLC. ARG, SER, , and TYR were the most abundant components out of 17 amino acids. Higher amino acid production was observed under normal photoperiod (16hL/8hD) than under reverse photoperiod (16hD/8hL). The highest total phenolic content (TPC; 9.91 mg/g-DW) and flavonoid content (7.38 mg/g-DW) were observed in callus cultures incubated under 16hL/8hD than other tissues incubated under 16hD/8hL photoperiod. Higher DPPH and PoMo activities were observed in tissues incubated under 16hL/8hD photoperiod, while ABTS and Fe²⁺ chelating activities were found higher in tissues incubated under reverse photoperiod. Significant quantities of piperine content were observed in all tissues except callus cultures. These results suggest that reverse photoperiod is a promising approach for callus induction, phytochemicals and piperine production for commercial applications.Copyright © 2013 Académie des sciences.

Fab/c fragments were also hydrolysed. The digestion was accelerated by dithiothreitol (DTT), indicating that cleavage of IgG heavy chain was due to a cysteine protease secreted into the medium. The responsible enzyme, of M(r) 27 (+/- 0.8) kDa, was purified by a series of thiopropyl affinity, Sephacryl S-300 HR and DEAE-anion exchange chromatographies, either from worm extracts or from excretory-secretory products (ESP). The purified, thiol-dependent protease showed an optimal activity at pH 5.7 with 0.1 M sodium acetate but was active over the pH range 4.5-8.0. Its activity was inhibited completely by 10(-5) M L-trans-epoxysuccinylleucylamido(4-guanidino) butane (E-64) and 1 mM iodoacetamide (IAA), but by only 53% using the specific cathepsin L inhibitor, Z---CHN2 (5 x 10(-5) M).

The enzyme was rich in both basic and hydrophobic amino acids, presenting the following NH2-terminal amino acid sequence: -Ala-Asp-Leu-Ile-Val-Lys-Ile-Asn-. Amylolytic activity on soluble starch was optimal at pH 5.5-6.0 and 95 degrees C, and the enzyme was stable in the pH range of 4.0-8.0. Calcium enhanced thermostability at temperatures above 80 degrees C, increasing the half-life of activity to more than 8 h at 85 degrees C, 80 min at 90 degrees C, and 19 min at 95 degrees C. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited amylase activity, the inhibition being reversed by the addition of calcium or strontium ions. The alpha-amylase was also inhibited by copper and mercuric ions, and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, the latter being reversed in the presence of dithiothreitol. Dithiothreitol and beta-mercaptoethanol activated the enzyme. The alpha-amylase exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics for starch, with a K(m) of 5.0 mg.ml-1 and kcat/K(m) of 5.2 x 10(5) ml.mg-1s-1. Similar values were obtained for amylose, amylopectin, and glycogen. The hydrolysis pattern was similar for maltooligosaccharides and polysaccharides, with maltose being the major hydrolysis product. Glucose and maltotriose were generated as secondary products, although glucose was produced in high levels after a 6-h digestion. To our knowledge this is the first report of the characterization of an alpha-amylase from a strain of the genus Thermus.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9925605>Purification and characterization of a novel 5-oxoprolinase (without ATP-hydrolyzing activity) from Alcaligenes faecalis N-38A.</a></h1><p>A novel type of 5-oxoprolinase was found in a cell extract of strain N-38A, which was later identified as Alcaligenes faecalis. The enzyme in the cell extract was purified to a homogeneous state with a yield of 16.6%. The molecular  of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 47,000 by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, suggesting that the enzyme is a monomeric protein. The enzyme specifically catalyzed a decyclization of L-pyroglutamate without hydrolyzing ATP and also without any requirements for metal ions such as Mg2+ and K+. The optimal pH for the decyclization was 7.4. The reaction was reversible. The equilibrium constant of the reaction, Keq = [L-glutamate]/[L-pyroglutamate], was evaluated to be approximately 0. 035, which indicates that the reaction tends to form L-pyroglutamate. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was H-Glu-Pro-Arg-Leu-Asp--Ser-Gln-Leu-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Val-His--. No protein with a similar sequence was found in the DNASIS database. Based on these data, it was strongly suggested that the enzyme described here is a novel type of 5-oxoprolinase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2603803>Ornitho-kininogen and ornitho-kinin: isolation, characterization and chemical structure.</a></h1><p>Ornitho-kininogen was purified from chicken and duck blood plasmas by a two-stage method using chromatography on columns of S-alkylated papain-Cellulofine and DEAE-5PW. The isolated preparation from chicken plasma gave a single band on SDS-PAGE with or without 2-mercaptoethanol and on disc-PAGE. The molecular  of ornitho-kininogen was estimated as 74,000 on SDS-PAGE using the Ferguson plot method. Ornitho-kininogen was found to have the similar properties to those of mammalian high molecular  kininogen (HMWK), in terms of the amino acid composition, molecular , and susceptibility to plasma kallikrein. No kininogen corresponding to mammalian low molecular  kininogen (LMWK) and rat T-kininogen could be detected in chicken plasma. In fact, ornitho-kininogen was degraded rapidly by bovine plasma kallikrein, liberating a kinin. This kinin was isolated from the digest by reversed-phase HPLC. The primary structure of the isolated kinin was determined as Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly---Pro-Leu-Arg. The sequence of this peptide, named ornitho-kinin, was similar to that of bradykinin except for the substitution of -6 and Leu-8 for Ser-6 and -8. The isolated ornitho-kinin induced a contraction of chicken smooth muscle and had a strong hypotensive effect in the chicken. However, it did not contract the isolated rat uterus. It is suggested that this specificity difference is due to the replacement of -8 by Leu-8. The sequence of residues 1-30 of ornitho-kininogen exhibited 43% identity with that of bovine kininogen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9357326>[Structures and functions of ribonucleases].</a></h1><p>1. In order to understand the differences in pH optima and reaction rates of RNase A towards low molecular  substrates and polymer substrates, the subsite structure of bovine pancreatic RNase A was studied. The kinetic studies of various sizes of oligouridylic acids showed that the size of the subsite is three nucleotides long. The kinetic studies on the inhibition of pUp, X-ray crystallographies of RNase A-ApC and pTp complexes, 31P-NMR studies on the binding of RNase A-pAp, and pTp showed the presence of P0, P2 and B3 sites. The location of the P0 site was assigned to be Lys66 by X-ray crystallography of the RNase A-pTp complex. The location of the P2 and/or P3/B3 site was determined by studying the enzymatic activities of several S-peptide analogs in which N-Leu was substituted for Lys7 and/or Lys1 coupled with S-protein toward various chain lengths of oligouridylic acids. The experiment suggested that P2 is Lys7 and P3/B3 is Lys1. 2. Several new pyrimidine base specific RNases were isolated and their primary structures were determined. They were two non-secretory RNases, a bovine liver alkaline RNase, a bovine brain RNase, and a bullfrog liver RNase. The bovine brain RNase has extra 16 amino acids at the C-terminus with O-glycosylated Ser. The bullfrog liver RNase was an extremely heat-stable RNase so far known. 3. Two new RNases belonging to RNase T1 family were isolated and their primary structures were elucidated. They were RNases isolated from Aspergillus saitoi and a mushroom (hiratake). The former RNase has a similar structure to RNase T1, but it was a base non-specific and guanylic acid preferential enzyme. From the results of X-crystallographic studies of this RNase, we suggested that the mechanism of RNase T1 RNase is essentialy a general acid-base catalysis between His40 and Glu58. 4. We isolated several fungal, plant and animal base non-specific acid RNases with a molecular mass about 24 kDa or more, and elucidated their primary structures. These RNases contain two sequences containing common 7-8 amino acid residues in common which include most of the amino acid residues important for the catalysis. Therefore, we proposed to designate these RNases as RNase T2 family RNase. On the basis of chemical modifications, kinetic studies and protein engineering studies of RNase Rh from Rhizopus niveus and RNase M from A. saitoi, we assigned that the catalytic site of RNase Rh consists of His46, His104, His109, Glu105, and Lys108. In the mechanism we proposed for RNase Rh, His46 and His109 work as a general acid and base catalysts. His104 was a phosphate binding site, and Glu105 and Lys108 might work to polarize a P=O bond of the substrate or stabilize the pentacovalent intermediate. However, in the reverse reaction of the transfer reaction step and the hydrolysis step of RNase Rh, His109 and His46 work as an acid and base catalyst, respectively. The X-ray crystallographic studies of RNase Rh, an RNase Rh-2'-AMP or d(ApC)complex, and the protein engineering studies of several mutant enzymes assigned the components of the major base recognition site (B1 site) and the minor base recognition site (B2 sites) of RNase Rh. The enzymatic studies of several mutant enzymes indicated that (i) Asp51 is very crucial for adenine base recognition, and the replacement of Asp51 by other amino acid, such as , Ser, Glu, Asn makes RNase Rh more guanylic acid preferential, (ii) the replacement of Trp49 by , and Tyr57 by Trp make the enzyme more pyrimidine and purine bases preferential, respectively. These trials are the first example of marked artificial change in the base specificity of RNases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2524550>Properties of a Leu--cleaving endopeptidase activity putatively involved in beta-endorphin metabolism in rat brain.</a></h1><p>Incubation of beta-endorphin with cytosolic and particulate fractions of rat brain resulted in the formation of several peptides, including gamma-endorphin [beta-endorphin-(1-17)] and beta-endorphin-(18-31), indicating the presence of enzyme activity cleaving the Leu17-Phe18 bond of beta-endorphin. An assay for this Leu- cleaving activity, based on the cleavage of the 14C-labeled substrate acetyl-Val--Leu--[epsilon-([14C]CH3)2]Lys-NHCH3, was used to examine the properties of this enzyme activity. beta-Endorphin-(1-31) competitively inhibited the Leu--cleaving enzyme activity on the pentapeptide substrate. Over 90% of activity was recovered in the cytosolic fraction. Leu--cleaving activity behaved like a thiol endopeptidase because it was inhibited by low concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, p-chloromercuribenzoyl sulfate, and low concentrations of Hg2+. Low concentrations of sulfhydryl compounds stimulated Leu--cleaving activity. The activity was optimal between pH 8.5 and 9.0. The Km of Leu--cleaving activity in the cytosolic fraction was 35 microM and in the particulate fraction 88 microM with Vmax values of 193 and 15 nmol mg protein-1 h-1, respectively. The apparent molecular mass of the Leu--cleaving enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be approximately 200 kilodaltons. These properties of Leu--cleaving activity indicate that the Leu--cleaving enzyme is distinct from any known brain endopeptidase.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1939157>Carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing of matrix Gla protein.</a></h1><p>The present study was undertaken to determine the extent of COOH-terminal proteolytic processing in matrix Gla protein (MGP), a 10-kDa protein which contains 5 residues of the vitamin K-dependent Ca2+ binding amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). Two forms of MGP were isolated from demineralization and urea extracts of bovine cortical bone, one 79 residues in length with the COOH terminus -Arg-Gln and the other 83 residues in length with the COOH terminus -Arg-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala. The 84-residue form of bovine MGP predicted from the message structure could not be detected in the bone extracellular matrix extracts, and it therefore seems probable that the lysine at position 84 was removed by the action of a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme prior to secretion. A plausible sequence of proteolytic cleavages that could generate the 79-residue form of MGP would be a trypsin-like cleavage at Arg80-Arg81 or Arg81-Gly82 followed by carboxypeptidase B-like cleavage to remove COOH-terminal arginine(s). Since essentially equal amounts of the 79- and 83-residue forms of MGP were also detected in bovine articular cartilage and plasma, it seems likely that the COOH-terminal processing events identified in bone apply to many of the other tissues which synthesize this protein. Only one form of MGP was detected in human bone extracts, a 77-residue protein that lacks the COOH-terminal residues Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gly--Lys. This shortened version of human MGP is consistent with the proposed model for COOH-terminal processing, since the amino acid substitution in the COOH terminus of the human protein, Lys79 for Gln79, would allow removal of the additional basic residues from the human MGP COOH terminus by the action of the carboxypeptidase B-like enzymic activity. Recent studies have shown that MGP is strongly induced by retinoic acid in fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, a response which suggests that MGP mediates an action of retinoic acid on an aspect of cell growth or differentiation. If this hypothesis is true, the present evidence for complex COOH-terminal processing events could provide a means to regulate the as yet unknown activity of MGP in the extracellular environment in a mechanism similar to the activation of hormones such as anaphlotoxins and kinins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15604796>Cloning, characterization and expression of a new cry 1Ab gene from Bacillus thuringiensis WB9.</a></h1><p>A new cry 1Ab-type gene, cry 1Ab17, was cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis WB9 by PCR. Nucleotide sequence indicated that the open reading frames (ORFs) consists of 3471 bases and encodes a protein of 1156 residues with a calculated molecular  of 130.5 kDa and an pI value of 5.04. Homology comparison revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of Cry1Ab17 had 95.4% to 99.7% identity with those of the known Cry1Ab proteins.

Additionally, the cry 1Ab17 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 under the control of T7 promoter and the Cry1Ab17 isolated from the culture medium was toxic to 3rd instar Plutella xylostella larvae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8647835>Novel O-methylated terminal glucuronic acid characterizes the polar glycopeptidolipids of Mycobacterium habana strain TMC 5135.</a></h1><p>Mycobacterium "habana" strain TMC 5135, which has been proposed as a vaccine against both leprosy and tuberculosis, is considered to be a strain of serotype I of the recognized species Mycobacterium simiae. We have now shown that each of these strains possesses characteristic polar glycopeptidolipids (GPL) which are sufficiently different to allow unequivocal strain identification. Thin layer chromatographic analysis demonstrated that M. habana synthesizes a family of apolar GPLs and three distinct polar GPLs (pGPL-I to -III) which exhibited migration patterns different from those of M. simiae serotype I (pGPL-Sim). Using a combination of chemical, mass spectrometric, and proton-NMR analyses, the GPLs from M. habana were determined to be based on the same generic structure as those from the M. avium complex, namely N-fatty acyl-D--(O-saccharide)-D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninyl-O-m onosaccharide. The de-O-acetylated apolar GPLs contain a 3-O-Me-6-deoxy-Tal attached to the allo- and either a 3-O-Me-Rha or a 3,4-di-O-Me-Rha attached to the alaninol. In the pGPLs, oligosaccharides were found to be attached to the allo-. The oligoglycosyl alditol reductively released from the least polar pGPL-I was fully characterized as L-Fucp alpha 1 in --7 with 3-(6-O-Me)-D-Glcp beta 1 in --7 with 3-(4-O-Me)-L-Rhap alpha 1 in --7 with 3-L-Rhap alpha 1 in --7 with 2-(3-O-Me)-6-deoxy-Tal. In pGPl-II and -III, the terminal Fuc residue is further 3-O-methylated and 4-O-substituted with an additional 2,4-di-O-Me-D-GlcA and 4-O-Me-D-GlcA, respectively. The corresponding oligosaccharide from pGPL-Sim was shown to be of identical molecular  to pGPL-II but terminating with a 3,4-di-O-Me-GlcA. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based serological studies using anti-M. habana and anti-M. simiae sera against whole cells and purified pGPLs firmly established the polar GPLs as important antigens and indicated that the terminal epitopes L-Fuc-, 2,4-di-O-Me-D-GlcA, and 4-O-Me-D-GlcA uniquely present in pGPL-I, -II, and -III, respectively, confer sufficient specificity for the identification of M. habana as a distinct serotype of M. simiae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18203976>Nutrient digestibility and performance responses of growing pigs fed phytase- and xylanase-supplemented wheat-based diets.</a></h1><p>Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementing phytase and xylanase on nutrient digestibility and performance of growing pigs fed wheat-based diets. In Exp. 1, 10 diets were fed to 60 pigs from 20 to 60 kg of BW to determine the effect of combining phytase and xylanase on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and growth performance. The 10 diets included a positive control diet (PC; 0.23% available P; 0.60% Ca) and a negative control diet (NC; 0.16% available P; 0.50% Ca) supplemented with phytase at 0, 250, and 500 fytase units (FTU)/kg and xylanase at 0, 2,000, and 4,000 xylanase units (XU)/kg in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement. In Exp. 2, 6 ileally cannulated barrows (initial BW = 35.1 kg) were fed 4 wheat-based diets in a 4 x 4 Latin square design, with 2 added columns to determine the effect of combining phytase and xylanase on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients. The 4 diets were NC (same as that used in Exp. 1) or NC supplemented with phytase at 500 FTU/kg, xylanase at 4,000 XU/kg, or phytase at 500 FTU/kg plus xylanase at 4,000 XU/kg. In Exp. 3, 36 barrows (initial BW = 55.5 kg) were fed 4 diets based on prepelleted (at 80 degrees C) and crumpled wheat for 2 wk to determine the effect of phytase supplementation on ATTD of nutrients. The 4 diets fed were a PC (0.22% available P; 0.54% Ca) and a NC (0.13% available P; 0.43% Ca) alone or with phytase at 500 or 1,000 FTU/kg. All diets in the 3 experiments contained Cr(2)O(3) as an indigestible marker. No synergistic interactions were detected between phytase and xylanase on any of the response criteria measured in Exp. 1 or 2. There were no dietary effects on growth performance in Exp. 1. In Exp. 1, phytase at 250 FTU/kg increased the ATTD of P and Ca by 51 and 11% at 20 kg of BW or by 54 and 10% at 60 kg of BW, respectively, but increasing the level of phytase to 500 FTU/kg only increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of P at 20 kg of BW. In Exp. 2, phytase at 500 FTU/kg increased (P < 0.05) the AID of P and Ca by 21 and 12%, respectively. In Exp. 3, phytase at 500 FTU/kg improved (P < 0.05) ATTD of P by 36%, but had no further effect at 1,000 FTU/kg. Xylanase at 4,000 XU/kg improved (P < 0.05) AID of Lys, Leu, , , Gly, and Ser in Exp. 2. In conclusion, phytase and xylanase improved P and AA digestibilities, respectively, but no interaction between the 2 enzymes was noted.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10441133>Modulation of juxtamembrane cleavage ("shedding") of angiotensin-converting enzyme by stalk glycosylation: evidence for an alternative shedding protease.</a></h1><p>The role of juxtamembrane stalk glycosylation in modulating stalk cleavage and shedding of membrane proteins remains unresolved, despite reports that proteins expressed in glycosylation-deficient cells undergo accelerated proteolysis. We have constructed stalk glycosylation mutants of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a type I ectoprotein that is vigorously shed when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Surprisingly, stalk glycosylation did not significantly inhibit release. Introduction of an N-linked glycan directly adjacent to the native stalk cleavage site resulted in a 13-residue, proximal displacement of the cleavage site, from the Arg-626/Ser-627 to the -640/Leu-641 bond. Substitution of the wild-type stalk with a Ser-/-rich sequence known to be heavily O-glycosylated produced a mutant (ACE-JGL) in which this chimeric stalk was partially O-glycosylated; incomplete glycosylation may have been due to membrane proximity. Relative to levels of cell-associated ACE-JGL, rates of basal, unstimulated release of ACE-JGL were enhanced compared with wild-type ACE. ACE-JGL was cleaved at an Ala/ bond, 14 residues from the membrane. Notably, phorbol ester stimulation and TAPI (a peptide hydroxamate) inhibition of release-universal characteristics of regulated ectodomain shedding-were significantly blunted for ACE-JGL, as was a formerly undescribed transient stimulation of ACE release by 3, 4-dichloroisocoumarin. These data indicate that (1) stalk glycosylation modulates but does not inhibit ectodomain shedding; and (2) a Ser-/-rich, O-glycosylated stalk directs cleavage, at least in part, by an alternative shedding protease, which may resemble an activity recently described in TNF-alpha convertase null cells [Buxbaum, J.

An extract of the pancreas of one such fish, the Pacific ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) contained somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (141 pmol/g wet wt), measured with an antiserum raised against mammalian somatostatin-14. Automated Edman degradation and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry established the primary structure of the major molecular form as Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Ser---Trp-Lys----Ser-Cys. A minor component of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity, constituting 8% of the total, was of approximate molecular  6000. Thus, in the ratfish pancreas prosomatostatin-I is processed predominantly to somatostatin-14, as in the mammalian pancreas, but the resulting tetradecapeptide contains the substitution Ser for Asn at position 5.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8742356>Purification and characterization of urease from schizosaccharomyces pombe.</a></h1><p>The urease from the ascomycetous fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was purified about 4000-fold (34% yield) to homogeneity by acetone precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange column chromatography, and if required, Mono-Q ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. The enzyme was intracellular and only one species of urease was detected by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The native enzyme had a M(r) of 212 kDa (Sepharose CL6B-200 gel filtration) and a single subunit was detected with a M(r) of 102 kDa (PAGE with sodium dodecyl sulfate). The subunit stoichiometry was not specifically determined, but the molecular mass estimations indicate that the undissociated enzyme may be a dimer of identical subunits. The specific activity was 700-800 micromols urea.min-1.mg protein-1, the optimum pH for activity was 8.0, and the Km for urea was 1.03 mM. The sequence of the amino terminus was Met-Gln-Pro-Arg-Glu-Leu-His-Lys-Leu--Leu-His-Gln-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala and the sequence of two tryptic peptides of the enzyme were -Ile-Glu--Asn-Glu-Lys and Leu-Tyr-Ala-Pro-Glu-Asn-Ser-Pro-Gly--Val-Glu-Val-Leu-Glu-Gly-Glu-Ile- Glu- Leu-Leu-Pro-Asn-Leu-Pro.

Cellular glycine (Gly), hydroxyproline (Hpr), ornithine (Orn), phenylalanine (), serine (Ser), and tryptophan (Trp) concentrations were depressed 24 hr after HgCl2 (p less than 0.05), but the remaining 12 AAs were not distinguishable from control despite the presence of severe renal failure. ARginine (Arg), glutamic acid (Glu), and valine (Val) also were decreased (P less than 0.05) 24 hr later, but concentrations of half of all measured AAs were still normal. Cellular alanine (Ala), Arg, Glu, Gly, , and Ser concentrations were decreased 3 hr after ischemia, p less than 0.05, but 12 AAs were unchanged and only Arg, , Ser, and threonine () were reduced 24 hr after ischemia was reversed. Concentrations of even the most affected AAs remained notably higher than in plasma in both forms of acute renal failure (ARF). Total loss of AAs from a small proportion of tubular cells would be hidden by essentially normal concentrations in the rest, and such losses may well have occurred. Unless cellular AAs in ARF are almost completely bound, however, the well-maintained cell:plasma AA concentration ratios indicate that cellular energetics were adequate for AA uptake and that epithelial permeability to AAs in the vast majority of cells was not greatly disturbed.

The enzyme was purified about 230-fold from a concentrated spinal cord extract. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it stained as a protein of Mr 55,000. The purified enzyme is optimally active at around pH7 and has essential thiol groups. It appears to be highly specific for dynorphin B (Km = 11 microM) but not for alpha-neoendorphin or dynorphin A, two other opioids included in the prodynorphin precursor. From its specificity, molecular size, and inhibitory spectrum, this enzyme is different from other known dynorphin-converting or -degrading enzymes and appears to be a unique and novel endoprotease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8101382>Involvement of mu-opioid receptors in alcohol drinking by alcohol-preferring AA rats.</a></h1><p>The present study examined the role of mu- and delta-opioid receptors in alcohol drinking using antagonists selective for these receptor types. Food- and water-sated male and female AA (Alko, alcohol) rats consistently drank 10% alcohol during daily 30-min access periods in their home cages in the middle of the 12-h light phase. On 3 consecutive days, the animals received the mu-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2 (CTOP, 1 micrograms ICv), the delta-receptor antagonist N,N-diallyl-Try-Aib-Aib--Leu-OH (ICI 174,864, 3 micrograms ICV), or saline 15 min before the alcohol access period. Relative to saline, the mu-antagonist CTOP decreased alcohol drinking both by males and females progressively over the 3 treatment days, with a continued suppression on the first days after the termination of the administration. Treatment with the delta-antagonist ICI 174,864 had no effect on alcohol drinking in males, and produced transient hind limb dysfunction and barrel rolling in over half of the females. These results suggest that selective blockage of mu-opioid receptors is sufficient to suppress alcohol drinking in AA rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641421>HSDAVFTDNYTKLRKQ-NIe-AVKK-(3-OCH3,4-OH)-FLNSSV-GABA-L-(Dap-(BMA))-Cu.</a></h1><p>HSDAVFTDNYTKLRKQ-Nle-AVKK-(2-OCH3,4OH)-FLNSSV-GABA-L-(Dap-(BMA)2)-Cu (Cu-TP3939) is a radiolabeled molecular imaging agent developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumors with overexpression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) receptors (1, 2). Cu is a positron emitter with a half-life () of 12.7 h. VIP and PACAP38 are two basic C-terminally amidated peptides (28 amino acids and 38 amino acids, respectively) that possess a remarkable amino acid homology (3-6). VIP was initially isolated from porcine intestine, and PACAP38 was isolated from bovine hypothalamus (7-9).(Later, another form of PACAP was isolated with sequence homologous to N-terminal 27 amino acid secued of PACAP28 and named PACAP27.). VIP (HSDAVFTDNYTRLRKQMAVKKYLNSILN-NH) is a hydrophobic, basic peptide that contains three lysine residues (1520, and 21, ), two arginine residues (12 and 14, ), two tyrosine residues (10 and 22, ), an essential histidine residue at the N terminus, and an amidated C-terminus (10). The sequence of PACAP27 shows 68% identity with VIP (11). Like VIP, PACAP27 also has an amidated C-terminal and histidine residue at the N terminus. VIP and PACAP are known regulators within the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. VIP has been shown to have a broad range of activities as a neuroendocrine mediator in diverse cells and tissues (12). Similarly, PACAP has also been shown to act as a hormone, a neurohormone, a neurotransmitter, and a trophic factor in a number of tissues (11). VIP and PACAP act through common G-protein–coupled receptors (11, 12). Three main subtypes of VIP/PACAP receptors are identified as PAC, VPAC, and VPAC. PACAP binds with high affinity to all three receptors, but VIP binds with high affinity to VPAC and VPAC and with low affinity to PAC. These receptors have been shown to be overexpressed on many human tumors, including breast (100% receptor incidence), prostate (100%), ovarian (100%), pancreas (65%), lung (58%), colon (96%), stomach (54%), liver (49%), and urinary bladder (100%) carcinomas, as well as lymphomas (58%) and meningiomas (100%) (5, 13). These receptors are potential molecular targets for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of various cancers (14-17). I-Labeled VIP (I-VIP) was prepared for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric carcinomas, as well as carcinoid tumors (18-20). The results were generally promising in that both primary and metastatic lesions in the liver, lung, and lymph nodes were visualized (21, 22). Tc-Labeled VIP (Tc-VIP) analogs were also developed because Tc is more readily available for clinical applications (23-25). In the initial Tc radiolabeling, VIP was conjugated at the N terminal of the histidine residue with a bifunctional chelating agent for Tc labeling. This Tc-VIP analog had relatively high radiochemical impurities and a loss of biological activity because the histidine residue was required for the VIP biological activity. In an effort to improve Tc labeling, Pallela et al. (24) prepared TP3654 (named according to its molecular ) using 4-aminobutyric acid as a spacer and extended the peptide to include a tetrapeptide moiety of Gly-Gly-(d)-Ala-Gly, which provided an N configuration for Tc chelation. The biological activity of Tc-TP3654 was similar to that of native VIP28, and the binding to the human colorectal cancer was receptor-specific with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC) of 1.5 × 10 M. To prepare a PET probe for VIP imaging, Thakur et al. (25) synthesized Cu-TP3982 (IC = 8.1 × 10 M) for PET imaging of oncogene VPAC receptors overexpressed in human breast cancer cells by synthesizing a protected diaminedithiol (NS)-VIP for Cu chelation. Cu-TP3939, another VIP analog, was also successfully prepared for PET imaging of experimental human prostate cancer in mice (1, 2). This analog with Lys, Nle, (3-OH, 4-OH) , Val, and  was found to be more potent and more biologically stable than the native VIP28 (26, 27). It contains a carboxy terminus lysine residue separated from VIP-asparagine by a γ-aminobutyric acid spacer, and NS is used as the chelating agent. Zhang et al. (1) showed that Cu-TP3939 is a promising molecular imaging probe for PET imaging of prostate cancer. Another study (2) from the same research group also demonstrated the potential use of PET imaging of Cu-TP3939 for human breast cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7673241>Characterization of the -81 and Val-82 human fibroblast collagenase catalytic domain purified from Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Soluble recombinant human fibroblast collagenase catalytic domain was highly expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The expression construct utilized the T7 gene 10 promoter for transcription of a two-cistron messenger RNA which encoded the ubiquitin-collagenase catalytic domain fusion protein as the second cistron. The ubiquitin domain was attached to the collagenase catalytic domain with the linker sequences Gly-Gly--Gly-Asp-Val-Ala-Gln (wild type) or Gly-Gly--Gly-Asp-Val-Gly-His (mutant) which served as cleavage sites for in vitro activation. The last four residues of the linker were included based on the crystal structure of human prostromelysin-1 catalytic domain. Soluble fusion proteins purified from E. coli retained the proteolytic activity of the collagenase catalytic domain. The collagenase catalytic domain was released by either autoproteolytic or stromelysin-1-catalyzed cleavage, purified to homogeneity, and separately possess -81, Val-82, or Leu-83 as the amino-terminal residue. Very similar kcat/Km values were determined for the -81 and Val-82 forms using continuous fluorogenic and chromogenic peptide cleavage assays.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22443554>Determination of standardized ileal crude protein and amino acid digestibilities in protein supplements for piglets.</a></h1><p>The objective of the study was to determine standardized ileal digestibilities (SID) of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in six ingredients commonly used in weanling pigs diets. The ingredients consisted of extruded soybeans (SBe), high-protein soybean meal (SBMhp), soy protein concentrate (SPC), hydrolyzed wheat gluten (WGh), conventional fish meal 1 (FM1) and extracted fish meal 2 (FM2e). Each assay feed ingredient was added to a purified cornstarch-based basal diet supplemented with casein and crystalline AA, and SID of CP and AA of assay ingredients were estimated using the difference method. A total of 12 3-week-old barrows were surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum. The piglets were allocated to four simultaneous 3 × 3 Latin-square designs with three animals and three periods each, resulting in six observations per assay diet. After 3 to 5 days recovery from surgery, each assay diet was fed at a level of 30 g/kg . Each experimental period consisted of 5 days for adaptation to the assay diets and 2 days for ileal digesta collection. The SID of CP, Lys, Met,  and Trp were 73%, 78%, 76%, 66% and 71% in SBe; 80%, 84%, 87%, 75% and 81% in SBMhp; 86%, 89%, 89%, 78% and 83% in SPC; 87%, 60%, 88%, 76% and 79% in WGh; 87%, 92%, 94%, 86% and 86% in FM1; and 79%, 86%, 89%, 80% and 74% in FM2e, respectively. The greatest SID of indispensable AA were observed for FM1 and SPC (SID 85% for most indispensable AA), followed by WGh, FM2e and SBMhp (SID 80% for most indispensable AA) and the smallest SID were obtained for SBe (SID < 80% for most indispensable AA). The SID of CP and indispensable AA in both types of fish meal, SBMhp and WGh were similar to SPC (P = 0.063 to 0.855), except for Arg (P = 0.010) and Lys (P = 0.001) in WGh, and  (P = 0.044) and Trp (P = 0.037) in FM2e. The SID of CP and indispensable AA were smaller in SBe compared with SPC (P < 0.001 to P = 0.017), except for Lys (P = 0.136). The SID of CP and indispensable AA were consistently smaller in FM2e compared with FM1 with significant differences for CP (P = 0.035),  (P = 0.028) and Trp (P = 0.008). Digestibility values measured in the present study can be used to formulate diets for piglets based on standardized ileal digestible contents of CP and AA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2500436>Purification and characterization of human neutrophil peptide 4, a novel member of the defensin family.</a></h1><p>Primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils contain proteins which play a major role in the killing and digestion of bacteria in the phagolysosome. We have isolated and characterized a novel antimicrobial peptide from the azurophil granule fraction of discontinuous Percoll gradients. We have named this peptide human neutrophil peptide 4 (HNP-4) based on its structural similarity to a group of antimicrobial polypeptides known as defensins (HNP 1-3). Using size exclusion and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, HNP-4 was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence determined from isolated HNP-4 and from tryptic fragments of reduced and alkylated peptide is: NH2-Val-Cys-Ser-Cys-Arg-Leu-Val--Cys-Arg-Arg--Glu- Leu-Arg-Val-Gly-Asn-Cys-Leu-Ile-Gly-Gly-Val-Ser---Tyr-Cys-Cys-- Arg-Val - COOH. Based on this sequence, HNP-4 has a calculated molecular  of 3715 and a theoretical pI of 8.61. HNP-4 shows structural similarity to the family of three human defensins. HNP-4 and the defensins have identical cysteine backbones and, like the defensins, HNP-4 is rich in arginine (15.2 mol %). However, the amino acids at 22 of the 33 positions differ between HNP-4 and human defensins. Further, HNP-4 is significantly more hydrophobic than the defensins, as determined by its retention time on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro, purified HNP-4 was shown to kill Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Compared to a mixture of the other human defensins, HNP-4 was found to be approximately 100 times more potent against E. coli and four times more potent against both S. faecalis and C. albicans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10199800>Several mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene including a nonsense and a frameshift mutation associated with dominantly inherited obesity in humans.</a></h1><p>The melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4-R) has been implicated in  regulation. Recently, two independent groups reported frameshift mutations associated with a dominant form of obesity (1, 2). We screened the coding region of the MC4-R in 306 extremely obese children and adolescents (mean  mass index: BMI 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m2), 25 healthy underweight students (mean BMI 17.1 +/- 0.8 kg/m2), 52 normal  individuals (mean BMI 22.0 +/- 1.0 kg/m2), 51 inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 14.3 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) and 27 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN, DSM IV criteria, mean BMI 21.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m2) by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Several mutations were identified, including the frameshift mutation described (1). The mutations were as follows: a) The deletion of 4 bp (delta of CTCT at codon 211) results in a frameshift, thus rendering a truncated protein. This mutation has been assumed to be associated with dominantly-inherited morbid obesity in humans (1). Both the index patient (BMI 42.06 kg/m2, height 171 cm, age 19.6 years) and her mother (BMI 37.55 kg/m2, height 164 cm, age 42.5 years) were heterozygous for the deletion. b) A nonsense mutation at position 35 of the MC4-R was detected in two obese probands (BMI 31.29 kg/m2 and BMI 45.91 kg/m2). This mutation leads to a truncated protein that encompasses the N-terminal extracellular domain. Both carriers additionally showed (c) a missense mutation (Asp-37-Val). In both of these cases Tyr-35-Stop and Asp-37-Val were maternally transmitted, thus these variations form a haplotype. d) e) A male obese proband harbored two missense mutations (Ser-30-, Gly-252-Ser). f)-i) Four different missense mutations (Pro-78-Leu, -112-Met, Arg-165-Trp, Ile-317-) were detected in four different male probands, respectively. All of these mutations (a to i) were found solely in extremely obese individuals whose BMIs were all above the 99th percentile. j) A silent mutation (C-579-T, Val-193-Val) was detected in a male underweight individual. k) A previously described polymorphism (Val-103-Ile; 3) was detected with similar frequencies in all different study groups. 1) We identified a novel polymorphism (Ile-251-Leu) with similar allele frequencies in all groups under study. In conclusion, our data indicate that mutations in the MC4-R are not uncommon. Whereas our data support the evidence for dominantly inherited obesity as revealed by the three obese probands with haplo-insufficiency, the functional significance of the missense mutations remains to be determined.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11391672>Determination of amino acid enantiomers in human urine and blood serum by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Amino acid (AA) enantiomers were determined as N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl-(2)-propyl esters by chiral gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in 24 h samples of the urine of three healthy volunteers and in their blood sera. In urine the largest amounts were determined for D-Ser (64-199 micromol/day) and D-Ala (24-138 micromol/day). In blood sera, D-Ala (2.3-4.2 micromol/L) and D-Ser (1.0-2.9 micromol/L) were most abundant. Varying amounts of the D-enantiomers of , Pro, Asx, Glx, , Tyr, Orn and Lys were also found, albeit not in all urines and sera. Further, enantiomers were quantified in urine samples of two volunteers fasting for 115 h. Quantities of renally excreted D-AAs decreased in fasting, although amounts of D-Ser (69 and 77 micromol/L urine) as well as other D-AAs were still detectable. Time-dependent analyses of urine showed that D-AAs are continuously excreted.Copyright -Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20509999>[Identification of the active material of anti-hepatic fibrosis from Amydae Carapax].</a></h1><p>To identify the active material of anti-hepatic fibrosis from Amydae Carapax.Membrane separation technology was adopted to screen active fraction in Amydae Carapax, and the active components were isolated from the active fraction using gel chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography.

Thus, there is a keen interest in methods which allow non-invasive monitoring of molecular targets involved in angiogenesis which would support information for planning and controlling corresponding therapies. Moreover, such techniques would provide an insight into the formation of new sprouting blood vessels, the involved processes and regulatory mechanisms in patients. At the moment, development of radiotracer based techniques is mainly concentrated on three different targets which include peptidic and non-peptidic alpha v beta 3-integrin binding antagonists, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and single chain anti-fibronectin antibody fragments. Development of radiolabeled MMP inhibitors is based on either the decapeptide Cys---His-Trp-Gly---Leu-Cys resulting from a phage display library or small molecular  compounds. The in vitro data for these tracers are very promising. However, more detailed in vivo data are necessary to evaluate the potency of MMP-inhibitors for in-vivo imaging. The radiolabelled anti-ED-B single chain antibody fragment scFv L-19 shows selective accumulation in the tumor vasculature in a murine tumour model. In a first patient study a selective localisation of the (123)I-labeled tracer in lesions of different tumours was found. On the basis of the lead structure cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-dPhe-Val) a variety of different radiolabeled RGD-peptides has been developed for the non-invasive determination of the alpha v beta 3 expression. These developments include peptides labeled with minimum structural alteration, peptide carbohydrate conjugates, peptidomimetics based on the RGD-structure as well as heterodimeric, homodimeric and homotetrameric ligand systems. Many of the tracers show high alpha v beta 3-affinity and selectivity in vitro and receptor selective tumour accumulation with high image contrast in different murine tumour models. Further studies have to demonstrate that this approach can be translated to clinical settings allowing visualisation of alpha v beta 3-positive tumours and alpha v beta 3 expression during tumour-induced angiogenesis in patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22943296>Agonistic effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and its metabolites on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through molecular docking simulation.</a></h1><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is implicated in the regulation of food intake and . Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) localised in cell membranes have been shown to alter the levels of BDNF in the brain, suggesting that PUFAs and BDNF could have physical interaction with each other. To decipher the molecular mechanism through which PUFAs modulates BDNF's activity, molecular docking was performed for BDNF with PUFAs and its metabolites, with 4-Methyl Catechol as a control.Inferring from molecular docking studies, lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and a known anti-inflammatory bioactive metabolite derived from PUFAs, with a binding energy of -3.98 Kcal/mol and dissociation constant of 1.2 mM showed highest binding affinity for BDNF in comparison to other PUFAs and metabolites considered in the study. Further, the residues Lys 18,  20, Ala 21, Val 22,  46, Glu 48, Lys 50, Lys 58,  75, Gln 77, Arg 97 and Ile 98 form hot point motif, which on interaction enhances BDNF's function.These results suggest that PUFAs and their metabolites especially, LXA4, modulate insulin resistance by establishing a physical interaction with BDNF. Similar interaction(s) was noted between BDNF and resolvins and protectins but were of lesser intensity compared to LXA4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2738058>Purification and characterization of an N-acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase from rabbit muscle.</a></h1><p>An N-acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase has been purified to homogeneity (7,000-fold with 20% yield) from rabbit muscle. This overall enrichment and its general properties as a soluble protein suggest that it is of cytosolic origin and not a component of ribosomes or other cellular organelles. The enzyme has an Mr of 230,000-245,000 and a subunit Mr of 76,000-80,000. An extensive survey of the substrate specificity of the pure enzyme reveals that our earlier conclusions (Radhakrishna, G., and Wold, F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9572-9575) that the enzyme is specific for Ac-Met-peptides are wrong. The enzyme catalyzes the rapid removal of Ac-, Ac-Ala, Ac-Met, Ac-Ser, and more slowly Ac-Gly from peptides of different lengths. Other acetylated amino acids (Cys, Tyr, Asp, Val, , Ile, Leu) may be removed at 1% or less of the rate of the above good substrates from some peptide substrates. The nature of the amino acid in the second position of the acetylated peptide generally has only a minor effect on the reaction rate; however, with charged amino acids (Arg, Asp) in the second position the reaction is retarded, and with proline it is virtually abolished. Except for slow rate of hydrolysis of acetylated dipeptides, the hydrolase does not appear to be severely affected by the peptide length in the range studied (from 2 to 11 amino acid residues). The hydrolase also cleaves formylamino acids from formylated peptides. The biological function of the enzyme is not clear.</p></html>
