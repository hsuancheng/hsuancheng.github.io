The exogenous application of chitosan (CTS) has gained extensive interests due to its effect on improving drought resistance. This research aimed to determine the role of exogenous CTS on annual ryegrass in response to water stress. Here, we investigated the impact of exogenous CTS on the physiological responses and transcriptome changes of annual ryegrass variety "Tetragold" under osmotic stress induced by exposing them to 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000. Our experimental results demonstrated that 50 mg/L exogenous CTS had the optimal effect on promoting seed germination under osmotic stress. Pre-treatment of annual ryegrass seedlings with 500 mg/L CTS solution reduced the level of electrolyte leakage (EL) as well as the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline and enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX) under osmotic stress. In addition, CTS increased soluble sugars and chlorophyll (Chl) content, net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), water use efficiency (WUE), and transpiration rate (E) in annual ryegrass seedlings in response to three and six days of osmotic stress. Transcriptome analysis further provided a comprehensive understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of CTS impact. To be more specific, in contrast of non-treated seedlings, the distinct changes of gene expressions of CTS-treated seedlings were shown to be tightly related to carbon , photosynthesis, and plant hormone. Altogether, exogenous CTS could elicit drought-related genes in annual ryegrass, leading to resistance to osmotic stress via producing antioxidant enzymes and maintaining intact cell membranes and photosynthetic rates. This robust evidence supports the potential of the application of exogenous CTS, which will be helpful for determining the suitability and productivity of agricultural crops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663278>Discovery and Identification of Serum Succinyl-Proteome for Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis and Osteopenia.</a></h2><p>For the purpose of providing evidence for the treatment of osteoporosis and osteopenia, this study retrospectively identified succinylation-modified sites and proteins in postmenopausal women, and bioinformatics analysis were performed.From January 2016 to June 2018, a total of 30 postmenopausal women aged from 55 to 70 years old were assigned to three groups: 10 cases with osteoporosis; 10 cases with osteopenia; and 10 cases with normal bone mass. Subsequently, the serum samples were collected from all cases for succinyl-proteome. Measures comprised label-free quantitative analysis, succinylation enrichment techniques, the liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) methods, and bioinformatics.A total of 113 succinylation sites on 35 proteins were identified based on quantitative information. The variation of the different multiple folds were more than 1.2 times as a significant increase for up-regulated and less than 1/1.2 times as a significant decrease for down-regulated. Among the quantified succinylation sites, 66 were up-regulated and 11 down-regulated in the Osteopenia/Normal comparison group, 24 were up-regulated and 44 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Osteopenia comparison group, 45 were up-regulated and 32 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Normal comparison group. Among the quantified succinylation proteins, 24 were up-regulated and 7 down-regulated in the Osteopenia/Normal comparison group, 15 were up-regulated and 20 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Osteopenia comparison group, 20 were up-regulated and 17 down-regulated in the Osteoporosis/Normal comparison group. The percentage of proteins differed in immune response, signaling pathway, proteolysis, lymphocyte, leukocyte, and cell activation. Four differentially expressed proteins (apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, hemoglobin subunit alpha, and haptoglobin) contained quantitative information; they were mediated with receptors, factors, mechanisms, that related to bone . Hemoglobin subunit alpha was screened for diagnosis of osteopenia.The succinyl-proteome experimental data indicated that apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, hemoglobin subunit alpha, and haptoglobin were valuable for diagnosis and treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and osteopenia.© 2019 The Authors.

Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662402>Metabolically healthy obesity and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.</a></h2><p>Metabolically healthy obese phenotype (MHO) refers to obese individuals with an adequate  profile and absence of  syndrome. Many prospective studies have reported the benign condition relating the MHO phenotype and its potential role in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. However, inconsistent results were found and the question remains controversial. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the associations these associations from relevant prospective studies.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 statement was used to prepare this protocol. MEDLINE, Web of Science databases, EMBASE and Cochrane Database will be used for literature search from their inception up to December 2019 with restriction of published studies in English. Published prospective studies reporting adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates for the association between MHO phenotype and cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause or cause-specific mortality will be included. The process of study screening, selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, and the risk of bias for the studies included will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. HRs or RRs for disease events and mortality with 95% CIs will be considered as primary outcomes, and summary HRs/RRs will be pooled using random-effects models. The Cochrane's Q and the I statistics will be used to assess and quantify heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out according to study characteristics to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.As this meta-analysis is performed based on the published studies, no ethical approval and patient safety considerations are required. The findings of the study will be reported and submitted to a peer-reviewed journals for publication.CRD42019121766.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

SHIP2 is a phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzyme, which dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P resulting to PI(3,4)P, and it has been recently shown that Aβ directly increases the activity of SHIP2. Here we monitored, utilizing fluorescent SHIP2 biosensor, real-time increase of PI(3,4)P-containing vesicles in HT22 cells treated with Aβ. Interestingly, PI(3,4)P is accumulated at late endosomes and lysosomal vesicles. We further discovered that ARAP3 can be attracted to PI(3,4)P-positive mature endosomes via its PH domain and this facilitates the degradation of ARAP3. The reduced level of ARAP3 then causes RhoA hyperactivation and filamentous actin, which are critical for neurodegeneration in AD. These results provide a novel molecular link between Aβ and actin disruption through dysregulated phosphoinositide , and the SHIP2-PI(3,4)P-ARAP3-RhoA signaling pathway can be considered as new therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662365>Effect of diabetes mellitus on risk of latent TB infection in a high TB incidence area: a community-based study in Taiwan.</a></h2><p>To investigate the association between diabetes and latent tuberculosis infections (LTBI) in high TB incidence areas.Community-based comparison study.Outpatient diabetes clinics at 4 hospitals and 13 health centres in urban and rural townships. A community-based screening programme was used to recruit non-diabetic participants.A total of 2948 patients with diabetes aged older than 40 years were recruited, and 453 non-diabetic participants from the community were enrolled.The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and the tuberculin skin test were used to detect LTBI. The IGRA result was used as a surrogate of LTBI in logistic regression analysis.Diabetes was significantly associated with LTBI (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.59; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.28) and age correlated positively with LTBI. Many subjects with diabetes also had additional risk factors (current smokers (aOR=1.28; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.71), comorbid chronic kidney disease (aOR=1.26; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.55) and history of TB (aOR=2.08; 95% CI 1.19 to 3.63)). The presence of BCG scar was protective (aOR=0.66; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.85). Duration of diabetes and poor glycaemic control were unrelated to the risk of LTBI.There was a moderately increased risk of LTBI in patients with diabetes from this high TB incidence area. This finding suggests LTBI screening for the diabetics be combined with other risk factors and comorbidities of TB to better identify high-risk groups and improve the efficacy of targeted screening for LTBI.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Imaging inflammation provides information on disease prognosis and may guide therapy, but the cellular basis of the signal remains equivocal. We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant inflammation-targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino acid  and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino acid C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for  radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific inflammation-targeted radiotracers. The pathogenetic cell population in specific inflammatory diseases should be considered in the selection of an appropriate imaging agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663251>Microbiome-immune- axis in the epidemic of childhood obesity: Evidence and opportunities.</a></h2><p>Obesity epidemic responsible for increase in diabetes, heart diseases, infections and cancer shows no signs of abating. Obesity in children is also on rise, indicating the urgent need of strategies for prevention and intervention that must begin in early life. While originally posited that obesity results from the simple concept of consuming more calories, or genetics, emerging research suggests that the bacteria living in our gut (gut microbiome) and its interactions with immune cells and  organs including adipose tissues (microbiome-immune- axis) play significant role in obesity development in childhood. Specifically, abnormal changes (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiome, stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, and shifts in the  functions of brown adipose tissue and the browning of white adipose tissue are associated with increased obesity. Many factors from as early as gestation appear to contribute in obesity, such as maternal health, diet, antibiotic use by mother and/or child, and birth and feeding methods. Herein, using evidence from animal and human studies, we discuss how these factors impact microbiome-immune- axis and cause obesity epidemic in children, and describe the gaps in knowledge that are warranted for future research.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early  abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and diabetes, and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662775>Effect of Naoxintong Capsules on the Activities of CYP450 and  of Metoprolol Tartrate in Rats Evaluated by Probe Cocktail and Pharmacokinetic Methods.</a></h2><p>Naoxintong capsule (NXT), a prescribed Chinese medicine, has been used clinically for more than 20 years and is widely received by patients. We determined five probe drugs, namely, omeprazole (CYP2C19), midazolam (CYP3A4), phenacetin (CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) to study the potential influences of NXT on the activities of CYP enzymes and assessed the pharmacokinetics effect of NXT on metoprolol tartrate in rat plasma. The study showed that AUC and AUC of midazolam (CYP3A4) in NXT coadministration group (283.7 ± 65.2 h·ng·mL and 292.0 ± 75.1 h·ng·mL in group B; 295.7 ± 62.7 h·ng·mL and 299.5 ± 60.0 h·ng·mL in group C) were significantly decreased as compared to another group (416.8 ± 82.3 h·ng·mL and 424.9 ± 77.9 h·ng·mL in group A), while that of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) showed an opposite tendency (540.7 ± 119.7 h·ng·mL and 595.3 ± 122.2 h·ng·mL in group A, 760.6 ± 184.9 h·ng·mL and 788.7 ± 211.0 h·ng·mL in group B, and 734.3 ± 118.5 h·ng·mL and 757.2 ± 105.4 h·ng·mL in group C). Moreover, NXT preadministration can enhance the  of metoprolol tartrate and reduce the  of O-demethylmetoprolol. The results indicated that NXT had potential effects in inducing CYP3A4 and inhibiting CYP2D6 in the  of metoprolol tartrate. It suggests that patients who coadministered NXT and metoprolol tartrate should be advised of potential herb-drug interactions (HDIs) to reduce therapeutic failure or accelerated toxicity of conventional drug treatment.Copyright © 2019 Huizi Ouyang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665018>A  reconstruction of Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112 and analysis of its potential as a cell factory.</a></h2><p>Lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative Lactic Acid Bacterium (LAB) that is commonly used for food fermentations and probiotic purposes. Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale  models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational  engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate  model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the  were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic , the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas , varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these  result in different energy yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these  in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central  demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general  engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale  model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict  behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665811>Postnatal β2 Adrenergic Treatment Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Lambs with IUGR but not Persistent Defects in Pancreatic Islets or Skeletal Muscle.</a></h2><p>Previous studies in fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have shown that adrenergic dysregulation was associated with low insulin concentrations and greater insulin sensitivity. Although whole-body glucose clearance is normal, one-month-old lambs with IUGR at birth have higher rates of hindlimb glucose uptake, which may compensate for myocyte deficiencies in glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in IUGR lambs is due to lower intra-islet insulin availability and not from glucose sensing. We investigated adrenergic receptor (ADR) β2 desensitization by administering oral ADRβ modifiers for the first month after birth to activate ADRβ2 and antagonize ADRβ1/3. In IUGR lambs ADRβ2 activation increased whole-body glucose utilization rates and insulin sensitivity but had no effect on isolated islet or myocyte deficiencies. IUGR establishes risk for developing diabetes. In IUGR lambs we identified disparities in key aspects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, providing new insights into potential mechanisms for this risk.Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and disturbances in glucose homeostasis with associated β-adrenergic receptor (ADRβ) desensitization. Our objectives were to measure insulin-sensitive glucose  in neonatal lambs with IUGR and to determine whether daily treatment with ADRβ2 agonist and ADRβ1/β3 antagonists for one month normalizes their glucose . Growth, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and glucose utilization rates (GUR) were measured in control lambs, IUGR lambs, and IUGR lambs treated with β2-agonist clenbuterol, β1-antagonist atenolol, and β3-antagonist SR59230A (IUGR-AR). In IUGR lambs, islet insulin content and GSIS were less than in controls; however, insulin sensitivity and whole-body GUR were not different from controls. Of importance, ADRβ2 stimulation with β1/β3 inhibition increases both insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose utilization in IUGR lambs. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs, hindlimb GUR were greater but fractional glucose oxidation rates and ex vivo skeletal muscle glucose oxidation rates were lower than controls. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) was lower in IUGR and IUGR-AR skeletal muscle than in controls but GLUT1 was greater in IUGR-AR. ADRβ2, insulin receptor, glycogen content, and citrate synthase activity were similar among groups. In IUGR and IUGR-AR lambs heart rates were greater, which was independent of cardiac ADRβ1 activation. We conclude that targeted ADRβ2 stimulation improved whole-body insulin sensitivity but minimally affected defects in GSIS and skeletal muscle glucose oxidation. We show that risk factors for developing diabetes are independent of postnatal catch-up growth in IUGR lambs as early as one-month of age and are inherent to the islets and myocytes.

Furthermore, PR expression can predict response to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Current immunohistochemical approaches to PR detection are limited by sampling error associated with biopsy and lack of standardised protocols; positron emission tomography (PET) using receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals to provide quantitative, whole-body imaging may overcome these limitations. PR expression has been successfully imaged with PET in the clinical setting, however investigation into new radioligands with improved pharmacokinetics and  stability is desirable.We report the synthesis of a focused library of non-steroidal PR ligands evaluated for use as PET radioligands. A lead candidate ([F]2) with low nanomolar activity was selected and radiolabelled with a radiochemical yield of 2.29 ± 2.31% (decay-corrected), radiochemical purity (RCP) > 95% and a molar activity of 2.5 ± 1.6 GBq/μmol. Cell uptake studies showed a significant and specific accumulation of [F]2 in T47D (PR++) breast cancer cell compared to MDA-MB-231 (PR-) control; however, in vivo evaluation was confounded by rapid defluorination of the radioligand. In vitro metabolite analysis of 2 in MLM confirmed defluorination and oxidative  of the thiocarbamate to oxocarbamate moiety by mass spectrometry.A route to access [F]2 was developed to allow in vitro and in vivo evaluation, albeit with low radiochemical yield and modest molar activity. [F]2 demonstrated selective uptake in PR++ T47D cells which could be blocked in a dose dependent manner with progesterone. However, [F]2 showed poor in vivo  stability with rapid defluorination within the time frame of the imaging protocol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with Insulin Sensitivity and Lipid Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h2><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other  factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino acids and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve  of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665347>Water Supplementation Reduces Copeptin and Plasma Glucose in Adults with high Copeptin: The H2O  Pilot Study.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664515>Randomized trial of prophylactic ipsilateral central lymph node dissection in patients with clinically node negative papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the role of prophylactic ipsilateral central neck dissection (pCND) in patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).In this randomized control trial, a total of 164 consecutive patients were enrolled.

Until last follow-up (mean 73.4 months), one regional recurrence developed in the pCND (-) group, and three regional recurrences occurred in the pCND (+) group. Five-year recurrence-free survival was similar between the two groups.Although ipsilateral pCND could clear occult lymph node metastasis in the central compartment, it failed to provide any oncological benefit for cN0 PTMC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659858>Protein Kinase Cα Mediates Recovery of Renal and Mitochondrial Functions Following Acute Injury.</a></h2><p>Previously, we have shown that active PKCα promotes recovery of mitochondrial function after injury in vitro [24]. This study examined whether PKCα regulates recovery of mitochondrial and kidney functions after ischemia-induced acute injury (AKI) in vivo. Markers of kidney injury were increased after bilateral ischemia and returned to normal levels in wild-type (WT) mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complexes and F F -ATPase decreased after ischemia and recovered in WT mice. Reperfusion after ischemia was accompanied by translocation of active PKCα to mitochondria. PKCα deletion reduced mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complex I and F F -ATPase in non-injured kidneys, indicating that PKCα is essential in developing fully functional renal mitochondria. These changes in PKCα-deficient mice were accompanied by lower levels of complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) and the γ-subunit of F F -ATPase. Also, lack of PKCα exacerbated ischemia-induced decreases in respiration, complex I and F F -ATPase activities, and blocked their recovery after injury, indicating a crucial role of PKCα in promoting mitochondrial recovery after AKI. Further, PKCα deletion exacerbated acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins of energy  after ischemia due to decreases in deacetylase and desuccinylase (sirtuin3 and sirtuin5) levels in renal mitochondria. Thus, our data show a novel role for PKCα in regulating levels of mitochondrial sirtuins and acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that PKCα deletion: 1) affects renal physiology by decreasing mitochondrial capacity for maximum respiration, 2) blocks recovery of mitochondrial functions, renal morphology and functions after AKI, and 3) decreases survival after AKI.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665025>Simultaneous and sequential based co-fermentations of Trichoderma asperellum GDFS1009 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 1841: a strategy to enhance the gene expression and metabolites to improve the bio-control and plant growth promoting activity.</a></h2><p>The consequence of simultaneous and sequential inoculation of T. asperellum and B. amyloliquefaciens cultures with respect to growth rate, differential expression of vital genes and metabolites were examined.The competition was observed between T. asperellum and B. amyloliquefaciens under co-cultivation.

We comprehensively searched the ancient medical records to identify empirical evidence; conducted a systematic review (SR) based on moderate- to high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to synthesize the clinical evidence; and reviewed the possible mechanisms of its antidiabetic effects. Empirical application of  in treating diabetic symptoms dated back to more than 2000 years ago.

The combinations used today are consistent with their usage in ancient times. Results of the SR showed that GGFs could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes for blood glucose control. When in combination with hypoglycemic agents or insulin, GGFs enhanced the glucose-lowering effect as well as the lipid-lowering effects. Also, the incidence and the risk of adverse events (AE), especially the hypoglycemic episodes, were lower in the combination group. No serious or life-threatening AE was reported.

The mechanisms behind DSMM in L individuals are not completely understood but decreased muscle mass and shifts in lipid and carbohydrate utilisation may contribute. Previously, we observed lower fat oxidation in a porcine model of low birth weight. To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with lipid  in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth weight (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth weight, diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary fat was associated with decreased LD intermuscular fat deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake and intramuscular fat deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis, lipid synthesis and transport increased in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary fat reduction, LD mRNA associated with lipid synthesis and inter- and intramuscular fat deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular fat deposition increased in both birth weight groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle lipid  associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth weight. Whilst, many of the adaptions to diet and age appear to be similar in birth weight groups, the magnitude of response and individual changes underpin the previously observed lower fat oxidation in L pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663865>Improving Trip and Slip-Resisting Skills in Older People: Perturbation Dose Matters.</a></h2><p>Aging negatively affects balance recovery responses following trips and slips.

Chalcone synthase (CHS) is the first committed enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis, and anthocyanidins are transported into fiber cells after biosynthesis mainly by Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) and Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) to present diverse colors with distinct stability. The biochemical and molecular mechanism of pigment formation in natural colored cotton fiber is not clear.The three key genes of GhCHS, GhANR and GhLAR were predominantly expressed in the developing fibers of colored cotton. In the GhCHSi, GhANRi and GhLARi transgenic cottons, the expression levels of GhCHS, GhANR and GhLAR significantly decreased in the developing cotton fiber, negatively correlated with the content of anthocyanidins and the color depth of cotton fiber. In colored cotton Zongxu1 (ZX1) and the GhCHSi, GhANRi and GhLARi transgenic lines of ZX1, HZ and ZH, the anthocyanidin contents of the leaves, cotton kernels, the mixture of fiber and seedcoat were all changed and positively correlated with the fiber color.The three genes of GhCHS, GhANR and GhLAR were predominantly expressed early in developing colored cotton fibers and identified to be a key genes of cotton fiber color formation. The expression levels of the three genes affected the anthocyanidin contents and fiber color depth.

However, the effects on nutrient absorption and rumen function induced by excessive iron have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of over-load iron on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep. Twenty-four German Mutton Merino cross-bred sheep with weight (42.66 ± 2.34 kg BW) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates and 1 sheep per replicate. The basal diet consisted of 60% Leymus chinensis hay and 40% concentrate. The sheep in 4 groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with 50 (Control), 500 (T1), 1,000 (T2) and 1,500 (T3) mg Fe/kg as ferrous sulphate monohydrate (FeSO ·H O) respectively. And the actual contents of iron in the diet were determined to be 457.68 (control), 816.42 (T1), 1,256.78 (T2) and 1,725.63 (T3) mg/kg respectively. The experiment lasted 62 days including a 7-day  trial. During the whole experiment, the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre showed a quadratic increase with increasing over-load iron levels (p < .05), and maximum responses were found with 500 mg/kg supplementation. However, the response of total VFA concentration showed a quadratic decrease, as did the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerate (p < .05). Serum total iron-binding capacity on day 30 showed a quadratic decrease with the increase in high-dose iron, while the serum iron content increased linearly at day 60 (p < .05). Excessive iron resulted in the change in bacterial communities. An increase in over-load iron linearly decreased the abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes (p < .05), but linearly increased the Firmicutes (p = .037) and Proteobacteria (p = .018). In addition, there was a quadratic effect (p = .003) on the Fibrobacteres, which was higher in the 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Fe-supplemented groups. At the genus level, there were quadratic effects on the abundances of Selenomonas_1 (p = .023) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p = .016). Furthermore, feeding of iron linearly increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 (p < .05). These results indicate that increasing ferrous sulphate monohydrate in diets had no negative impact on the growth performance, but it changed nutrient digestibility, blood iron parameters, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659860>Standard medical nutrition therapy of 25kcal/kg ideal body weight/day often does not reach even resting energy expenditure in patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In Japan, an ideal body weight (IBW) calculated by 22 × height (m) has commonly been used in the planning of medical nutrition therapy (MNT). However, there have been concerns regarding calorie deficits in fulfilling resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing MNT as defined by 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.To measure REE in patients with type 2 diabetes and verify the validity of MNT with 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 52 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age was 65.9 ± 7.3 years, body weight 65.0 ± 11.3 kg, body mass index 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m ). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry.Mean REE was 1601.0 ± 253.1 kcal/day. Assuming that all patients strictly observed daily energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW/day, 41 of 52 patients (78.9%) did not reach their REE. The greater the body weight, the greater the difference between assumed energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW and REE.We call attention to the potential risk of total dietary energy intake set to 25 kcal/kg IBW/day. Clinicians should carefully plan MNT to not fall below patient's REE to prevent sarcopenia and ensure MNT continuity.© 2019 The Authors.

Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a  fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln , as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related  abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related  indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid , transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid  including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664920>Phenome-wide association analysis of LDL-cholesterol lowering genetic variants in PCSK9.</a></h2><p>We characterised the phenotypic consequence of genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus and compared findings with recent trials of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9.Published and individual participant level data (300,000+ participants) were combined to construct a weighted PCSK9 gene-centric score (GS). Seventeen randomized placebo controlled PCSK9 inhibitor trials were included, providing data on 79,578 participants. Results were scaled to a one mmol/L lower LDL-C concentration.The PCSK9 GS (comprising 4 SNPs) associations with plasma lipid and apolipoprotein levels were consistent in direction with treatment effects. The GS odds ratio (OR) for myocardial infarction (MI) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.42; 0.68), compared to a PCSK9 inhibitor effect of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86; 0.93). For ischemic stroke ORs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.57; 1.22) for the GS, compared to 0.85 (95% CI 0.78; 0.93) in the drug trials. ORs with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95% CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimer's disease - outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.Genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus recapitulates the effects of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 on major blood lipid fractions and MI.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of macronutrient supplements for infants born small on later development and .We searched OvidMedline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to April 1, 2019, and controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and anzctr.org.au. Randomised or quasirandomised trials were included if the intention was to increase macronutrient intake to improve growth or development of infants born small and assessed post-discharge outcomes. Co-primary outcomes were cognitive impairment and  risk, evaluated in toddlers (<3 years), childhood (3 to 8 years), and adolescence (9 to 18 years). Two reviewers independently extracted data. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and data were pooled using random-effect models. Twenty-one randomised and one quasirandomised trial of variable methodological quality involving 3,680 infants were included. In toddlers born small, supplementation did not alter cognitive impairment (relative risk [RR] 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.49; P = 0.99), and there were no differences in cognitive scores (mean difference [MD] 0.57; 95% CI -0.71 to 1.84; P = 0.38) or motor scores (MD 1.16; 95% CI -0.32 to 2.65; P = 0.12) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. However, fewer supplemented children had motor impairment (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; P = 0.01). In subgroup analyses, supplementation improved cognitive scores in boys (MD 5.60; 95% CI 1.07 to 10.14; P = 0.02), but not girls born small (MD -2.04; 95% CI -7.04 to 2.95; P = 0.42), and did not alter cognitive or motor scores in the subgroup of children born SGA. In childhood, there was no difference in cognitive impairment (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; P = 0.72) or cognitive scores (MD 1.02; 95% CI -1.91 to 3.95; P = 0.50) between supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There were also no differences in blood pressure, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (all P > 0.05). However, supplemented children had lower fasting glucose (mmol/L: MD -0.20; 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06; P = 0.005) and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations (mmol/L: MD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02). In subgroup analyses, there was no evidence of differences in blood pressure between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in boys or girls born small, or in SGA children. In adolescence, there was no difference between supplemented and unsupplemented groups in blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL and HDL concentrations, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and fasting insulin concentrations (all P > 0.05). Limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, low to very low quality of the evidence, and limited data beyond early childhood.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials, we found no evidence that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small altered later cognitive function, although there was some evidence that supplementation may decrease motor impairment in toddlers. Contrary to the findings from observational studies, evidence from randomised trials suggests that early macronutrient supplementation for infants born small improves some  outcomes in childhood.CRD42019127858.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664128>Periodicity of cerebral flow velocity during sleep and its association with white-matter hyperintensity volume.</a></h2><p>Impaired sleep-related activation of the cerebral waste-clearance system might be related with the brain aging process. We hypothesized that cerebral blood-flow pattern changes during sleep might reflect the activation of the cerebral waste-clearance system and investigated its association with the cerebral white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. Fifty healthy volunteers were prospectively recruited. In addition to the baseline transcranial Doppler parameters, the mean flow velocity (MFV) of the middle cerebral artery was monitored during waking and short-term non-REM sleep. Spectral density analysis was performed to analyze the periodic MFV variation patterns. For the aged subgroup (>50 years, n = 25), the WMH volumes in the total, subcortical, and periventricular regions were measured. The MFV periodic pattern during sleep was substantially augmented over that in the waking status. Spectral density analysis of MFV showed a noticeable peak in the very-low-frequency (VLF) band during sleep status (sleep/waking ratio 2.87 ± 2.71, P < 0.001). In linear regression analysis in the aged subgroup, the sleep/waking ratio of the VLF peak was inversely associated with total (P = 0.013) and subcortical (P = 0.020) WMH volumes.

As these compounds may interact with any surface of the analytical system, time-resolved monitoring and reliable quantification is difficult. We describe a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) based analytical method for direct breath-resolved monitoring of reactive compounds. Aliphatic amines were used as test substances. Matrix adapted gas standards were generated by means of a liquid calibration unit. Calibration conditions were adapted in terms of materials, temperature and equilibration time. PTR-ToF-MS conditions were optimized in terms of inlet materials, transfer line and drift tube temperature and drift tube reduced electric field (E/N). Optimized PTR conditions in combination with inert materials and high temperatures considerably reduced the interactions of compounds with the surfaces of the analytical system. Good linearity (R2 > 0.99, RSDs < 5%) with LODs between 0.15 ppbV and 1.23 ppbV and LOQs between 0.24 ppbV and 1.94 ppbV could be achieved. The method was then applied to breath-resolved monitoring of reactive compounds in 17 healthy subjects after high and low oral protein challenge. Exhaled concentrations of trimethylamine, indole, methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, acetone, 2-propanol, 2-butanone and phenol showed significant changes after protein intake. Methanethiol concentrations increased 6-fold within minutes after the protein intake. Optimization of methods and instrument design enabled reliable breath-resolved PTR-MS based analysis of exhaled reactive VOCs in the sub-ppbV range.

To date, engineering of pullulanase is mainly focused on catalytic pocket or domain tailoring based on structure/sequence information. Saturation mutagenesis-involved directed evolution is, however, limited by the low number of mutational sites compatible with combinatorial libraries of feasible size. Using Bacillus naganoensis pullulanase as a target protein, here we introduce the "evolutionary coupling saturation mutagenesis" (ECSM) approach: residue pair co-variances are calculated to identify residues for saturation mutagenesis, focusing directed evolution on residue pairs playing important roles in natural evolution. Evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis identified seven residue pairs as evolutionary mutational hotspots. Subsequent saturation mutagenesis yielded variants with enhanced catalytic activity.

The rCMRglu in the right anterior insula and adjacent prefrontal and striatal areas was lower in the PTSD group, while higher in the Resilience/Recovery group, compared to the Control group. In addition, the lower glucose  of these areas was associated with higher severity and less improvement in PTSD symptoms in the PTSD group, while the higher levels of rCMRglu were correlated with stronger resilience in the Resilience/Recovery group. This study suggests distinct roles of the anterior insula in response to trauma between the PTSD and Resilience/Recovery groups. Heightened rCMRglu in the anterior insular regions may reflect an underlying mechanism of resilience against traumatic stress, while reduced rCMRglu may indicate vulnerability to PTSD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661132>Gallotannin attenuates 2‑deoxy‑D‑glucose‑induced dedifferentiation and endoplasmic reticulum stress through inhibition of inositol‑requiring enzyme 1 downstream p38 kinase pathway in chondrocytes.</a></h2><p>Gallotannin (GT) is a class of polyphenols with antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities. 2‑Deoxy‑D‑glucose (2DG), a glucose‑derived molecule, can inhibit glucose  and induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. GT in primary‑cultured chondrocytes enhances expression of type II collagen, an indicator of differentiation, and cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2), which mediates inflammatory reactions. In contrast, 2DG reduces type II collagen and COX‑2 expression while driving ER‑stress‑induced unglycosylation. In the present study, it was investigated whether GT could attenuate 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress. Following treatment with GT and 2DG, chondrocytes were assessed using western blotting, RT‑PCR, immunofluorescence, and alcian blue staining. GT restored type II collagen expression that was reduced by 2DG, inhibited ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation, and induced COX‑2 expression. The expression of a glucose‑regulated protein, GRP78, which is an indicator of reduced ER‑stress, was decreased. To link the GT signaling pathway with  that inhibit 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress, inhibitors were treated in chondrocytes. The results revealed that, among the different signaling  triggered by ER‑stress, the p38 kinase pathway was involved in the inositol‑requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) downstream signaling pathway. Following inhibition of the IRE1 pathway, type II collagen expression was increased and COX‑2 expression was decreased. In addition, after examining the splicing of X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1) which is dependent on IRE1 activation induced by ER‑stress, it was revealed that GT inhibited the increase of XBP‑1s after splicing due to 2DG‑induced ER stress. GT in chondrocytes inhibited 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation while regulating differentiation and inflammation via the ER‑stress‑induced p38 kinase pathway downstream from the IRE1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665426>New insights into protein-DNA binding specificity from hydrogen bond based comparative study.</a></h2><p>Knowledge of protein-DNA binding specificity has important implications in understanding DNA , transcriptional regulation and developing therapeutic drugs. Previous studies demonstrated hydrogen bonds between amino acid side chains and DNA bases play major roles in specific protein-DNA interactions. In this paper, we investigated the roles of individual DNA strands and protein secondary structure types in specific protein-DNA recognition based on side chain-base hydrogen bonds. By comparing the contribution of each DNA strand to the overall binding specificity between DNA-binding proteins with different degrees of binding specificity, we found that highly specific DNA-binding proteins show balanced hydrogen bonding with each of the two DNA strands while multi-specific DNA binding proteins are generally biased towards one strand. Protein-base pair hydrogen bonds, in which both bases of a base pair are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid side chains, are more prevalent in the highly specific protein-DNA complexes than those in the multi-specific group. Amino acids involved in side chain-base hydrogen bonds favor strand and coil secondary structure types in highly specific DNA-binding proteins while multi-specific DNA-binding proteins prefer helices.© The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, it can take years to finally diagnose CS, though early diagnosis is important for prevention of complications.The aim of this study was to assess the time span between first symptoms and diagnosis of CS in different populations in order to identify factors associated with an early diagnosis.A systematic literature search via PubMed was performed to identify studies reporting on time to diagnosis in CS. In addition, unpublished data from patients of our tertiary care center and 4 other centers were included.Clinical studies reporting on the time to diagnosis of CS were eligible. Corresponding authors were contacted to obtain additional information relevant to the research question.Data were extracted from the text of the retrieved articles and from additional information provided by authors contacted successfully. From initially 3326 screened studies 44 were included.Mean time to diagnosis for patients with CS was 34 months (ectopic CS: 14 months; adrenal CS: 30 months; and pituitary CS: 38 months; p<0.001). No difference was found for gender, age (</≥ 18 years), and year of diagnosis (before/after 2000). Patients with pituitary CS had a longer time to diagnosis in Germany than elsewhere.Time to diagnosis differs for subtypes of CS but not for gender and age.

The aberrantly expressed methylation‑driven genes in HCC and normal tissues were identified using the Limma package and the MethylMix algorithm. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and ConsensusPathDB were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct a prognostic risk model of HCC. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the clinical utility of the risk model. A total of 238 methylation‑driven genes were successfully identified from cancer and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis indicated that these genes functioned in the extracellular space, interfering with lipid  in hepatocytes and regulating adaptive immune responses. In total, 14 relevant  were identified. The following prognostic risk model was generated: Risk score=CALML3 (degree of methylation) x (‑4.860) + CCNI2 x (2.071) + TNFRSF12A x (‑3.369) + IFITM1 x (1.203) + ENPP7P13 x (‑1.366) + DDT x (2.139) + RASAL2‑AS1 x (‑1.384) + ANKRD22 x (‑3.215). The median risk score (0.970) derived from this model was set as cutoff value for assigning patients to high‑ or low‑risk group. The 5‑year survival rate was 35.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.1‑47.4%] in the high‑risk group and 61.7% (95% CI=51.4‑74.2%) in the low‑risk group (P<0.0001). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.742, indicating that this model is appropriate for predicting the survival rate of patients. Furthermore, the methylation and expression levels of two key genes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12A and D‑dopachrome decarboxylase, were significantly associated with prognosis and were correlated with cg00510447, cg26808293, cg11060661 and cg16132339 methylation. In conclusion, a prognostic risk model for HCC is proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis of methylation‑driven genes.

Here, using the systematic helix-based computational method, we investigated the regulation of this riboswitch. We find that the function of the riboswitch does not depend on the transcription process. Whether TPP is present or not, the riboswitch predominately folds into the ON state, while the OFF state aptamer structure does not appear during transcription. Since the transition from the ON state to the aptamer structure is extremely slow, TPP may interact with the RNA before full formation of the aptamer structure, promoting the switch flipping. The potential to fully form helix P0 of the ON state is necessary to restore ligand-dependent gene control by the riboswitch.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663297>Association of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility.</a></h2><p>Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is essential in mediating folate , and thus plays an important role in diabetes and diabetic complications. MTHFR C677T (rs1801133 C>T) polymorphism has been proposed to be linked with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) susceptibility. However, the conclusions are inconsistent. Therefore, we rechecked their linkage aiming to obtain a more reliable estimation by performing an updated meta-analysis.We searched electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang to obtain studies updated to October 2019.After carefully screening, we finally incorporated 68 studies with 10,812 cases and 8,745 controls. The genotype frequency of C677T polymorphism was analyzed pooled to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled results presented that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM under homozygous (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.39-1.94), heterozygous (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.20-1.59), recessive (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.23-1.61), dominant (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.27-1.70), and allele (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.23-1.52) genetic models. Stratified analysis demonstrated that C677T genotype was associated with T2DM in Asian populations, but not Caucasian and African populations.Our results indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism confers to T2DM, especially in Asian populations.

Cells of isolated strain NKC3-5 were 0.5-0.7 μm wide and 1.4-2.8 μm long. The strain NKC3-5T could grow at up to 20.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10%), pH 6.5-10.0 (optimum pH 9.0), and 25-40°C (optimum 35°C). The cells were able to reduce nitrate under aerobic conditions, which is the first report in the genus Salicibibacter. The genome size and genomic G + C content of strain NKC3-5 were 3,754,174 bp and 45.9 mol%, respectively; it contained 3,630 coding sequences, 16S rRNA genes (six 16S, five 5S, and five 23S), and 59 tRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA showed that strain NKC3-5 clustered with bacterium Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1, with a similarity of 96.2-97.6%, but formed a distinct branch with other published species of the family Bacillaceae. In addition, OrthoANI value between strain NKC3-5 and Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1 was far lower than the species demarcation threshold. Using functional genome annotation, the result found that carbohydrate, amino acid, and vitamin  related genes were highly distributed in the genome of strain NKC3-5. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that strain NKC3-5 had 716 pan-genome orthologous groups (POGs), dominated with carbohydrate . Phylogenomic analysis based on the concatenated core POGs revealed that strain NKC3-5 was closely related to Salicibibacter kimchii. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified lipids. Anteiso-C, iso-C, anteiso-C, and iso-C were the major cellular fatty acids, and menaquinone-7 was the major isoprenoid quinone present in strain NKC3-5. Cell wall peptidoglycan analysis of strain NKC3-5 showed that meso-diaminopimelic acid was the diagnostic diamino acid.

One of the main drugs associated with the gingival overgrowth is the anti-epileptic such as phenytoin, which affects gingival tissues by altering extracellular matrix . In our study, we evaluate the effect of phenytoin, a drug whose active substance is phenytoin, on gingival fibroblasts of healthy volunteers. Gene expression of 29 genes was investigated in gingival fibroblasts' cell culture treated with phenytoin compared with untreated cells. Among the studied genes, only 13 genes (CXCL5, CXCL10, CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, IL-1A, IL-1B, IL-5, IL-7, IL-6R, BMP-2, and TNFSF-10) were statistically significant. All but one gene resulted downregulated after 24 h of treatment with phenytoin. BPM2 was the only, although weakly, up-expressed gene. Probably, we have not highlighted overexpression of the other inflammatory molecules because the study was performed on healthy people.

However, mutations in genes that control chromosome segregation are rare in human tumors as these mutations reduce cell fitness. Screening experiments indicate that the knockdown of multiple classes of genes that are not directly involved in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy induction. The possible contribution of these genes to cancer formation remains yet to be defined. Here we identified gene knockdowns that lead to an increase in aneuploidy in checkpoint-deficient human cancer cells. Computational analysis revealed that the identified genes overlap with recurrent mutations in human cancers. The knockdown of the three strongest selected candidate genes (ORP3, GJB3, and RXFP1) enhances the malignant transformation of human fibroblasts in culture. Furthermore, the knockout of Orp3 results in an aberrant expansion of lymphoid progenitor cells and a high penetrance formation of chromosomal instable, pauci-clonal B-cell lymphoma in aging mice. At pre-tumorous stages, lymphoid cells from the animals exhibit deregulated phospholipid  and an aberrant induction of proliferation regulating  associating with increased aneuploidy in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Together, these results support the concept that aneuploidy-inducing gene deficiencies contribute to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis involving the deregulation of various molecular processes such as lipid , proliferation, and cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659241>Target site as the main mechanism of resistance to imazamox in a Euphorbia heterophylla biotype.</a></h2><p>Euphorbia heterophylla is a weed species that invades extensive crop areas in subtropical regions of Brazil. This species was previously controlled by imazamox, but the continuous use of this herbicide has selected for resistant biotypes. Two biotypes of E. heterophylla from southern Brazil, one resistant (R) and one susceptible (S) to imazamox, were compared. The resistance of the R biotype was confirmed by dose-response assays since it required 1250.2 g ai ha to reduce the fresh weight by 50% versus 7.4 g ai ha for the S biotype. The acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme activity was studied using ALS-inhibiting herbicides from five different chemical families. The R biotype required the highest concentrations to reduce this enzyme activity by 50%. A Ser653Asn mutation was found in the ALS gene of the R biotype. The experiments carried out showed that imazamox absorption and  were not involved in resistance. However, greater C-imazamox root exudation was found in the R biotype (~70% of the total absorbed imazamox). Target site mutation in the ALS gene is the principal mechanism that explains the imazamox resistance of the R biotype, but root exudation seems to also contribute to the resistance of this biotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663122>Role of regulatory miRNAs of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common malignant human tumors with high morbidity worldwide.

Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 µg/L of each chemical or mixture for ten days, followed by an eight-day depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10 and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that  effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino acid  and the urea cycle. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected   associated with anaerobic , osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, there were fewer metabolites altered, but none of the treatments returned to their initial control values, indicating that  disruptions were long-lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis, and many of its affected   were not well-predicted from the individual treatments.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid  contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid  is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665642>CD146 Regulates Growth Factor-Induced mTORC2 Activity Independent of the PI3K and mTORC1 .</a></h2><p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) coordinates cell proliferation, survival, and  with environmental inputs, yet how extracellular stimuli such as growth factors (GFs) activate mTORC2 remains enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that in human endothelial cells, activation of mTORC2 signaling by GFs is mediated by transmembrane cell adhesion protein CD146. Upon GF stimulation, the cytoplasmic tail of CD146 is phosphorylated, which permits its positively charged, juxtamembrane KKGK motif to interact with Rictor, the defining subunit of mTORC2. The formation of the CD146-Rictor/mTORC2 complex protects Rictor from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby specifically upregulating mTORC2 activity with no intervention of the PI3K and mTORC1 . This CD146-mediated mTORC2 activation in response to GF stimulation promotes cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, our findings identify a molecular mechanism by which extracellular stimuli regulate mTORC2 activity, linking environmental cues with mTORC2 regulation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

A well-validated PGAM1 inhibitor, however, has not been reported for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. By uncovering the elevated PGAM1 expressions were statistically related to worse prognosis of PDAC in a cohort of 50 patients, we developed a series of allosteric PGAM1 inhibitors by structure-guided optimization. The compound KH3 significantly suppressed proliferation of various PDAC cells by down-regulating the levels of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in correlation with PGAM1 expression. Similar to PGAM1 depletion, KH3 dramatically hampered the canonic  highly involved in cancer  and development. Additionally, we observed the shared expression profiles of several signature  at 12 h after treatment in multiple PDAC primary cells of which the matched patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models responded similarly to KH3 in the 2 wk treatment. The better responses to KH3 in PDXs were associated with higher expression of PGAM1 and longer/stronger suppressions of cancer  . Taken together, our findings demonstrate a strategy of targeting cancer  by PGAM1 inhibition in PDAC. Also, this work provided "proof of concept" for the potential application of  treatment in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659408>miR-409-3p is reduced in plasma and islet immune infiltrates of NOD diabetic mice and is differentially expressed in people with type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of potential biomarkers emerging in many diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Here, we aim to analyse a panel of circulating miRNAs in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and individuals with type 1 diabetes.We adopted standardised methodologies for extracting miRNAs from small sample volumes to evaluate a profiling panel of mature miRNAs in paired plasma and laser-captured microdissected immune-infiltrated islets of recently diabetic and normoglycaemic NOD mice. Moreover, we validated the findings during disease progression and remission after anti-CD3 therapy in NOD mice, as well as in individuals with type 1 diabetes.Plasma levels of five miRNAs were downregulated in diabetic vs normoglycaemic mice. Of those, miR-409-3p was also downregulated in situ in the immune islet infiltrates of diabetic mice, suggesting an association with disease pathogenesis. Target-prediction tools linked miR-409-3p to immune- and -related signalling molecules. In situ miR-409-3p expression correlated with insulitis severity, and CD8 central memory T cells were found to be enriched in miR-409-3p. Plasma miR-409-3p levels gradually decreased during diabetes development and improved with disease remission after anti-CD3 antibody therapy. Finally, plasma miR-409-3p levels were lower in people recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes compared with a non-diabetic control group, and levels were inversely correlated with HbA levels.We propose that miR-409-3p may represent a new circulating biomarker of islet inflammation and type 1 diabetes severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659421>The growth and lutein accumulation in heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides provoked by waste Monascus fermentation broth feeding.</a></h2><p>Although the potential of heterotrophic microalgae served as a sustainable source for lutein, it was still crucial to formulate a suitable medium to offset the cost involved in algal biomass cultivation while improve inherent lutein productivity. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibilities of waste Monascus fermentation broth medium (MFBM) toward heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides-enriched lutein. The results indicated that C. protothecoides subjected to MFBM batch feeding achieved 7.1 g/L biomass and 7.27 mg/g lutein. The resulting lutein productivity (7.34 mg/L/day) represented 1.54-fold more than that of frequently used Basal medium. Concurrently, the effective  and absorption of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in MFBM by C. subellipsoidea cultivation make it easily complied with the permissible dischargeable limits for fermentation broth. When response to fed-batch culture mode, the biomass and lutein productivity peaked 20.4 g/L and 9.11 mg/L/day with concentrated MFBM feeding. Transcriptomics data hinted that MFBM feeding manipulated lutein biosynthesis key checkpoints (e.g., lycopene β-cyclase and lycopene ε-cyclase) while accelerated energy  (e.g., glycolysis and TCA cycle) to contribute such high lutein productivity in C. protothecoides. These encouraging findings not only provided indications in applying nutrient-rich fermentation broth for affordable microalgae cultivation but also presented possibilities in linking algal high value-added products like lutein with high-efficient biological nutrition removal from industrial fermentation processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663971>Timing of Preoperative Antibiotic Prophylaxis and Surgical Site Infection: TAPAS, An Observational Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that surgical site infection (SSI) risk differs, after administration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) within 60-30 or 30-0 minutes before incision.The importance of appropriate timing of SAP before surgery has long been recognized. However, available evidence is contradictive on the best timing within a 60-0 minutes time interval before incision. Here, we aim to evaluate previous contradictions with a carefully designed observational cohort.An observational cohort study was conducted in a Dutch tertiary referral center. For 2 years, consecutive patients with SAP indication undergoing general, orthopedic, or gynecologic surgery were followed for the occurrence of superficial and deep SSI as defined by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention. The association between timing of SAP and SSI was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.After 3001 surgical procedures, 161 SSIs were detected. In 87% of the procedures, SAP was administered within 60 minutes before incision. Only antibiotics with short infusion time were used. Multivariable logistic regression indicated there was no conclusive evidence of a difference in SSI risk after SAP administration 60-30 minutes or 30-0 minutes before incision [odds ratio: 0.82; 95% confidence interval (0.57-1.19)].For SAP with short infusion time no clear superior timing interval within the 60-minute interval before incision could be identified in this cohort.

However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity.Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune  using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features was assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma and  biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check-point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, LAR and Mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and  TME signatures and enriched in margin restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in chromosome 5q and 15q regions including genomic loss of MHC-related genes showed reduced cytotoxic activity, as a plausible immune escape mechanism.Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of immunotherapy in TNBC patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the results of these studies were inconsistent. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to explore associations between folate  enzyme polymorphisms and LC in a larger pooled population. Systematic literature research of PubMed, WOS, Embase and CNKI was performed to identify eligible studies. Review Manager Version 5.3.3 was used to conduct statistical analyses. Totally 37 genetic association studies were included for analyses. The pooled analyses showed that  rs1801394 (dominant model:  = 0.01; recessive model:  = 0.04; allele model:  = 0.005) and  rs1801133 (dominant model:  = 0.008; recessive model:  = 0.0003; allele model:  = 0.0002) polymorphisms were both significantly associated with susceptibility to LC in overall population. Subgroup analyses revealed similar significant findings for  rs1801133 polymorphism in East Asians. Significant associations with LC were also observed for  rs1801394 and  rs1801133 polymorphisms in smokers. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that  rs1801394 was significantly associated with LC in smokers, and  rs1801133 polymorphisms was also significantly associated with LC in smokers and East Asians. These results suggested that these two polymorphisms could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing LC in certain populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659743>Plasma levels of the cardiovascular protective endogenous nucleoside adenosine are reduced in patients with primary aldosteronism without affecting ischemia-reperfusion injury: a prospective case-control study.</a></h2><p>Patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) experience more cardiovascular events compared to patients with essential hypertension (EHT), independent from blood pressure levels. In animals, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists limit ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury by increasing extracellular adenosine formation and adenosine receptor stimulation. Adenosine is an endogenous compound with profound cardiovascular protective effects. We hypothesized that patients with PA have lower circulating adenosine levels which might contribute to the observed increased cardiovascular risk. Secondly, we hypothesized that by this mechanism, patients with PA are more susceptible to IR compared to patients with EHT.In our prospective study in 20 patients with PA and 20 patients with EHT, circulating adenosine was measured using a pharmacological blocker solution that halts adenosine  after blood drawing. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) before and after forearm IR was used as a well-established method to study IR injury.Patients with PA had a 33% lower adenosine level compared to patients with EHT (15.3 (13.3-20.4) versus 22.7 (19.4-36.8) nmol/l respectively, p<0.01). The reduction in FMD after IR however, did not differ between patients with PA and patients with EHT (-1.0 ± 2.9 % versus -1.6 ± 1.6 % respectively, p=0.52).As adenosine receptor stimulation induces various powerful protective cardiovascular effects, its lower concentration in patients with PA might be an important novel mechanism that contributes to their increased cardiovascular risk. We suggest that modulation of the adenosine  is an exciting novel pharmacological opportunity to limit cardiovascular risk in patients with PA that needs further exploration.© 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660854>Dynamic transcriptome sequencing and analysis during early development in the bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis).</a></h2><p>Early development is a key process of the life history of fish. However, the relationship between the transcriptome and the dynamic regulation of early development is still uncharacterized in the bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). In the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of six development stages in H. nobilis, aiming to understand the dynamic molecular regulation of early development in this fish.A total of 76,573 unigenes were assembled from clean sequence reads, with an average length of 1768 base. Among which, 41,742 (54.54%) unigenes were annotated to public protein databases, and an additional 59,014 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were identified among the unigenes. Furthermore, 30,199 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) (fold change > 4 or < 0.25, and the false discovery rate FDR < 0.01) were observed in comparisons between the adjacent developmental stages, and nine expression patterns (profiles) were simulated using series-cluster analysis across six developmental stages. The unigenes expression level markedly increased after the DS1 stage (early blastula), and the numbers of DETs gradually decreased during subsequent development. The largest transcriptomic change (up- or down-regulated) was detected during the period from DS1 to DS2 (6-somite stage), which was enriched for many biological processes and   related to maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). Distinctly protein-protein interaction (PPI)  were plotted for DETs during the period from DS1 to DS2. The genes (or proteins) from the same  were integrated together, and showed with obvious co-regulation patterns. In the series-cluster analysis, a remarkable profile of gene expression (profile_48) was identified that is probably related to the hatching during H. nobilis development, and the strict co-expression of a hatching enzyme gene (hce1) with 33 other annotated genes was identified from this profile.The results indicated that strict dynamic regulation occurs during the early development in H. nobilis, especially in embryogenesis before hatching. This study provides valuable new information and transcriptomic resources related to H. nobilis early development, and for certain events such as MZT and hatching.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661586>A novel MCT1 and MCT4 dual inhibitor reduces mitochondrial  and inhibits tumor growth of feline oral squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) support tumor growth by regulating the transport of metabolites in the tumor microenvironment. High MCT1 or MCT4 expression is correlated with poor outcomes in human patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recently, drugs targeting these transporters have been developed and may prove to be an effective treatment strategy for HNSCC. Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive and treatment-resistance malignancy resembling advanced or recurrent HNSCC. The goals of this study were to investigate the effects of a previously characterized dual MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitor, MD-1, in OSCC as a novel treatment approach for feline oral cancer. We also sought to determine the potential of feline OSCC as a large animal model for the further development of MCT inhibitors to treat human HNSCC. In vitro, MD-1 killed feline OSCC and human HNSCC cell lines, altered glycolytic and mitochondrial , and synergized with platinum-based chemotherapies. While MD-1 treatment increased lactate concentrations in an HNSCC cell line, the inhibitor failed to alter lactate levels in feline OSCC cells, suggesting an MCT-independent activity. In vivo, MD-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model and prolonged overall survival in an orthotopic model of feline OSCC. Our results show that MD-1 may be an effective therapy for the treatment of feline oral cancer. Our findings also support the further investigation of feline OSCC as a large animal model to inform the development of MCT inhibitors and future clinical studies in human HNSCC.

Data from a randomized clinical trial were combined with a subgroup of participants aged 80 years and older from a second clinical trial. The trials were conducted between April 2013 and May 2018. Final follow-up was May 4, 2018.Participants were randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine (n = 112; 52 participants from the first trial and 60 from the second trial) or placebo (n = 139; 53 participants from the first trial and 86 from the second trial).Co-primary outcomes were Thyroid-Related Quality of Life Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO) questionnaire scores for the domains of hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness at 1 year (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate worse quality of life; minimal clinically important difference, 9).Of 251 participants (mean age, 85 years; 118 [47%] women), 105 were included from the first clinical trial and 146 were included from the second clinical trial. A total of 212 participants (84%) completed the study. The hypothyroid symptoms score decreased from 21.7 at baseline to 19.3 at 12 months in the levothyroxine group vs from 19.8 at baseline to 17.4 at 12 months in the placebo group (adjusted between-group difference, 1.3 [95% CI, -2.7 to 5.2]; P = .53).

Here we describe a 23-year-old man with FD possessing a novel mutation in the GLA gene, the evaluation of his family, and the functional characterization of the novel variant.Two generations of a family were screened for FD by clinical symptoms and low enzymatic activity. This step was followed by DNA sequencing that showed a novel GLA missense mutation. To confirm the pathogenicity potential of the mutation, we employed site-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. GLA wild-type and mutant plasmids were transfected into mammalian cells; RNA and proteins were extracted for expression and analysis of enzymatic activity.The patient presents the variant p.Asn34Asp in the GLA and had several manifestations of FD since adolescence. The investigation of the deficiency of α-Gal A was initiated due to stage 4 of chronic kidney disease. All family members carrying the novel mutation presented early symptoms, including index case's mother, who received a renal transplant when she was 35 years old. In silico and in vitro analysis confirmed the pathogenic potential of the mutation p.Asn34Asp showing that the enzyme had only 4% of residual activity due to protein misfolding. The ability of the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin to recover the mutant was confirmed, producing 37.5% of residual activity.In this work, we present a novel missense mutation in GLA that leads to the production of a catalytically competent α-Gal A, which is degraded before its delivery to the lysosome, promoting severe manifestations of FD, with a very similar disease course in affected men and women.© 2019 S.

Here we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) manipulation in rats that models a low resource environment to examine effects on growth, developmental milestones, and endocrine endpoints. In LBN, dams and pups, from pups' postnatal days 2-9, are exposed to a limited resource environment where dams lack proper materials to build a nest. This manipulation is compared to control housing conditions, where rat dams have access to ample nesting materials and enrichment throughout pups' development. We found that the LBN condition altered maternal care, increasing pup-directed behaviors while reducing self-care. This, perhaps compensatory, increase in nursing and attention to pups did not mitigate against changes in , as LBN reduced weight gain in both sexes and this effect persisted into adulthood. Although adult stress hormone levels in both sexes and vaginal opening and estrous cycle length in females were not disrupted, there was other evidence of endocrine dysregulation. Compared to controls, LBN rats of both sexes had shorted anogenital distances, indicating reduced androgen exposure. LBN males also had higher plasma estradiol levels in adulthood. This combination of results suggests that LBN causes a demasculinizing effect in males that could contribute to lasting changes in the brain and behavior. Importantly, alterations in  and endocrine systems due to early life adversity could be one mechanism by which stress early in life increases risk for later disease.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665641>Maternal Lipid  Directs Fetal Liver Programming following Nutrient Stress.</a></h2><p>The extreme  demands of pregnancy require coordinated  adaptations between mother and fetus to balance fetal growth and maternal health with nutrient availability. To determine maternal and fetal contributions to  flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or lipid  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of lipid- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal lipid  alters circulating lipid metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves  deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates.

The identification of human FA blood biomarkers related to disease severity and neuro-pathomechanism could support clinical trials of drug efficacy. To try to identify human biomarkers of neuro-pathomechanistic relevance, we compared the overlapping gene expression changes of primary blood and skin cells of FA patients with changes in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the KIKO FA mouse model. As DRG is the primary site of neurodegeneration in FA, our goal was to identify which changes in blood and skin of FA patients provide a 'window' into the FA neuropathomechanism inside the nervous system. In addition, gene expression in frataxin-deficient neuroglial cells and FA mouse hearts were compared for a total of 5 data sets. The overlap of these changes strongly supports mitochondrial changes, apoptosis and alterations of selenium . Consistent biomarkers were observed, including three genes of mitochondrial stress (MTIF2, ENO2), apoptosis (DDIT3/CHOP), oxidative stress (PREX1), and selenometabolism (SEPW1). These results prompted our investigation of the GPX1 activity as a marker of selenium and oxidative stress, in which we observed a significant change in FA patients. We believe these lead biomarkers that could be assayed in FA patient blood as indicators of disease severity and progression, and also support the involvement of mitochondria, apoptosis and selenium in the neurodegenerative process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665443> Reprogramming Associated with Aggressiveness Occurs in the G-CIMP-High Molecular Subtypes of IDH1mut Lower Grade Gliomas.</a></h2><p>Early detection of increased aggressiveness of brain tumors is a major challenge in the field of neuro-oncology because of the inability of traditional imaging to uncover it. IDH-mutant gliomas represent an ideal model system to study the molecular mechanisms associated with tumorigenicity because they appear indolent and non-glycolytic initially, but eventually a subset progresses towards secondary glioblastoma with a Warburg-like phenotype. The mechanisms and molecular features associated with this transformation are poorly understood.We employed model systems for IDH1 mutant gliomas with different growth and proliferation rates in vivo and in vitro. We described the metabolome, transcriptome and epigenome of these models in order to understand the link between their  and the tumor biology. To verify whether this  reprogramming occurs in the clinic we analyzed TCGA data.We reveal that the aggressive glioma models have lost DNA methylation in the promoters of glycolytic enzymes, especially LDHA, and have increased mRNA and metabolite levels compared to the indolent model. We find that the acquisition of the high glycolytic phenotype occurs at the G-CIMP-high molecular subtype in patients and is associated with the worst outcome.We propose very early monitoring of lactate levels as a biomarker of  reprogramming and tumor aggressiveness.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, the neurotrophin - brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) has implicated in SC regulation in animals. To date, little is known regarding the role of BDNF in human SC function in vivo. Twenty-nine males (21±0.5y) participated in the study. Muscle biopsies from the thigh were obtained prior to a bout of 300 maximal eccentric contractions (PRE), and 6h, 24h, 72h, and 96h of post-exercise. BDNF was not detected in any quiescent (Pax7+/MyoD-) SCs across the time-course. BDNF co-localized to 39±5% of proliferating (Pax7+/MyoD+) cells at PRE, which increased to 84±3% by 96h (P<0.05). BDNF was only detected in 13±5% of differentiating (Pax7-/MyoD+) cells at PRE, which increased to 67±4% by 96h (P<0.05). The number of Myogenin+ cells increased 95% from PRE (1.6±0.2 cells/100MF) at 24h (3.1±0.3 cells/100MF) and remained elevated until 96h (cells/100MF), p<0.05. The proportion of BDNF+/Myogenin+ cells was 26±0.3% at PRE, peaking at 24h (49±3%, p<0.05) and remained elevated at 96h (p<0.05). These data are the first to demonstrate an association between SC proliferation and differentiation and BDNF expression in humans in vivo, with BDNF co-localization to SCs increasing during the later stages of proliferation and early differentiation. Novelty: • BDNF is associated with SC response to muscle injury • BDNF was not detected in non-activated (quiescent) SCs • BDNF is associated with late proliferation and early differentiation of SCs in vivo in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664748>The role of TRIM family proteins in the regulation of cancer stem cell self-renewal.</a></h2><p>The tripartite-motif (TRIM) family of proteins represents one of the largest classes of putative single protein RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases. Members of this family are characterized by an N-terminal TRIM motif containing one RING-finger domain, one or two zinc-finger domains called B boxes (B1 box and B2 box), and a coiled-coil region. The TRIM motif can be found in isolation or in combination with a variety of C-terminal domains, and based on C-terminus, TRIM proteins are classified into 11 distinct groups. Because of the complex nature of TRIM proteins, they are implicated in a variety of cellular functions and biological processes, including regulation of cell proliferation, cell division and developmental processes, cancer transformation, regulation of cell , autophagocytosis, modification of chromatin status, regulation of gene transcription, post-translational modifications, and interactions with pathogens. Here, we demonstrate the specific activities of TRIM family proteins that contribute to the cancer stem cell phenotype. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that several TRIM members guarantee the acquisition of stem cell properties and the ability to sustain stem-like phenotype by cancer cells using distinct mechanisms. For other members, further work is needed to understand their full contribution to stem cell self-renewal. Identification of TRIM proteins that possess the potential to serve as therapeutic targets may result in the development of new therapeutic strategies. Finally, these strategies may result in the disruption of the machinery of stemness acquisition, which may prevent tumor growth, progression, and overcome the resistance to anticancer therapies. © AlphaMed Press 2019 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: TRIM proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions and biological processes, and recent data revealed their significant role in the acquisition and maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. Here, we describe those TRIM family members that facilitate cell stemness and discuss others for which further studies are needed to understand their full contribution to stem cell self-renewal.© 2019 AlphaMed Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665330>Human Endometrial Transcriptome and Progesterone Receptor Cistrome Reveal Important  and Epithelial Regulators.</a></h2><p>Poor uterine receptivity is one major factor leading to pregnancy loss and infertility. Understanding the molecular events governing successful implantation is hence critical in combating infertility.To define PGR-regulated molecular mechanisms and epithelial roles in receptivity.RNA-seq and PGR-ChIP-seq were conducted in parallel to identify PGR-regulated  during the WOI in endometrium of fertile women.Endometrial biopsies from the proliferative and mid-secretory phases were analyzed.Participants were fertile, reproductive aged (18-37) women with normal cycle length; and without any history of dysmenorrhea, infertility, or irregular cycles. In total, 42 endometrial biopsies obtained from 42 women were analyzed in this study.There were no interventions during this study.Here we measured the alterations in gene expression and PGR occupancy in the genome during the WOI, based on the hypothesis that PGR binds uterine chromatin cycle-dependently to regulate genes involved in uterine cell differentiation and function.653 genes were identified with regulated PGR binding and differential expression during the WOI. These were involved in regulating inflammatory response, xenobiotic , EMT, cell death, interleukin/STAT signaling, estrogen response, and MTORC1 response. Transcriptome of the epithelium identified 3,052 DEGs, of which 658 were uniquely regulated. Transcription factors IRF8 and MEF2C were found to be regulated in the epithelium during the WOI at the protein level, suggesting potentially important functions that are previously unrecognized.PGR binds the genomic regions of genes regulating critical processes in uterine receptivity and function.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2019.

However, the  and pharmacological properties of many of these compounds remain unknown. Elucidating these characteristics allows members of the clinical and forensic communities to identify causative agents in patient samples, as well as render conclusions regarding their toxic effects. This work presents a detailed report on the in vitro phase I  of indazole carboxamide synthetic cannabinoid APP-CHMINACA (PX-3). Incubation of APP-CHMINACA with human liver microsomes, followed by analysis of extracts via high-resolution mass spectrometry, yielded 12 metabolites, encompassing 7 different metabolite classes. Characterization of the metabolites was achieved by evaluating the product ion spectra, accurate mass and chemical formula generated for each metabolite. The predominant biotransformations observed were hydrolysis of the distal amide group and hydroxylation of the cyclohexylmethyl (CHM) substituent. Nine metabolites were amide hydrolysis products, of which five were monohydroxylated, one dihydroxylated and two were ketone products. The metabolites in greatest abundance in the study were products of amide hydrolysis with no further biotransformation (M1), followed by amide hydrolysis with monohydroxylation (M2.1). Three APP-CHMINACA-specific metabolites were generated, all of which were hydroxylated on the CHM group; one mono-, di- and tri-hydroxylated metabolite each was produced, with dihydroxylation (M6) present in the greatest abundance. The authors propose that metabolites M1, M2.1 and M6 are the most appropriate markers to determine consumption of APP-CHMINACA. The methods used in the current study have broad applicability and have been used to determine the in vitro  profiles of multiple synthetic cannabinoids and other classes of NPS. This research can be used to guide analytical scientists in method development, synthesis of reference material, pharmacological testing of proposed metabolites and prediction of  processes of compounds yet to be studied.© The Author(s) 2019.

Supporting this notion, aKG supplementation can restore growth/survival of glutamine-deprived cells. However, pancreatic cancers are often poorly vascularized and limited in glutamine supply, in alignment with recent concerns on the significance of glutaminolysis in pancreatic cancer. Here, we show that aKG-mediated rescue of glutamine-deprived pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) cells requires glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL), the enzyme responsible for de novo glutamine synthesis. GLUL-deficient PDAC cells are capable of the TCA cycle but defective in aKG-coupled glutamine biosynthesis and subsequent nitrogen anabolic processes. Importantly, GLUL expression is elevated in pancreatic cancer patient samples and in mouse PDAC models. GLUL ablation suppresses the development of Kras-driven murine PDAC. Therefore, GLUL-mediated glutamine biosynthesis couples the TCA cycle with nitrogen anabolism and plays a critical role in PDAC.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herein, particulate matter (PM) emitted from artisanal cashew nut roasting, an important economic activity worldwide, was investigated. This study focused on: i) chemical characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated (oxy-) PAHs; ii) intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); iii) genotoxic effects and time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA damage signaling, and iv) differential expression of genes involved in xenobiotic , inflammation, cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, using A549 lung cells. Among the PAHs, chrysene, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benz[a]anthracene showed the highest concentrations (7.8-10 ng/m), while benzanthrone and 9,10-anthraquinone were the most abundant oxy-PAHs. Testing of PM extracts was based on B[a]P equivalent doses (B[a]P). IC values for viability were 5.7 and 3.0 nM B[a]P at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. At these low doses, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in intracellular levels of ROS, genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks) and DNA damage signaling (phosphorylation of the protein checkpoint kinase 1 - Chk1). In comparison, effects of B[a]P alone was observed at micromolar range. To our knowledge, no previous study has demonstrated an activation of pChk1, a biomarker used to estimate the carcinogenic potency of PAHs in vitro, in lung cells exposed to cashew nut roasting extracts. Sustained induction of expression of several important stress response mediators of xenobiotic  (CYP1A1, CYP1B1), ROS and pro-inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-2, COX2), and DNA damage response (CDKN1A and DDB2) was also identified. In conclusion, our data show high potency of cashew nut roasting PM to induce cellular stress including genotoxicity, and more potently when compared to B[a]P alone. Our study provides new data that will help elucidate the toxic effects of low-levels of PAH mixtures from air PM generated by cashew nut roasting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Prevalence and incidence rates of DR were extracted from January 2000 to December 2017 and random effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool was applied for quality assessment of eligible studies.A total of 55,445 participants across 33 studies were included. The pooled prevalence (95% CI) of DR in diabetic clinics (22 studies), eye clinics (4 studies), and general population (7 studies) was 31.8% (24.5 to 39.2), 57.8% (50.2 to 65.3), and 29.6% (22.6 to 36.5), respectively. It was 7.4% (3.9 to 10.8) for proliferative DR and 7.1% (4.9 to 9.4) for clinically significant macular edema. The heterogeneity of individual estimates of prevalence was highly significant.

This study presents a novel approach for comprehensive assessment of the remodeling pattern in a complex microvascular network containing multiple collateral microvessels.We have developed a hardware-software integrated platform for quantitative, longitudinal, and label-free imaging of network-wide hemodynamic changes and arteriogenesis at the single-vessel level. By ligating feeding arteries in the mouse ear, we induced network-wide hemodynamic redistribution and localized arteriogenesis. The utility of this technology's was demonstrated by studying the influence of obesity on microvascular arteriogenesis.Simultaneously monitoring the remodeling of competing collateral arterioles revealed a new, inverse relationship between initial vascular resistance and extent of arteriogenesis. Obese mice exhibited similar remodeling responses to lean mice through the first week, including diameter increase and flow upregulation in collateral arterioles. However, these gains were subsequently lost in obese mice.Capable of label-free, comprehensive, and dynamic quantification of structural and functional changes in the microvascular network in vivo, this platform opens up new opportunities to study the mechanisms of microvascular arteriogenesis, its implications in diseases, and approaches to pharmacologically rectify microvascular dysfunction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664980>Diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism as a first presentation of silent adenocarcinoma of lung: a case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>Pituitary metastasis is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. Very few patients with pituitary metastasis are symptomatic. It is often associated with presence of co-existing metastases to other organs. Isolated pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary malignancy is uncommon.A 72-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of polyuria, increasing thirst and unexplained weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was scheduled as part of the investigation. She was kept nil per os for 10 h prior to EGD, after which she developed alteration of consciousness. Further investigation revealed hypernatremia with sodium level of 161 mmol/L and low urine osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg. Her urine output was 300 mL per hour. Diabetes insipidus (DI) was diagnosed based on evidence of polyuria, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality. Her urine output decreased and urine osmolality increased to 570 mOsm/kg in response to subcutaneous desmopressin acetate, confirming central DI. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneous gadolinium enhancing lesion at the sellar and suprasellar regions, measuring 2.4 × 2.6 × 3.9 cm compressing both the hypothalamus bilaterally and the inferior aspect of optic chiasm as well as displacing the residual pituitary gland anteriorly. The posterior pituitary bright spot was absent. These MRI findings suggested pituitary macroadenoma. There were also multiple small gadolinium-enhancing lesions up to 0.7 cm in size with adjacent vasogenic brain edema at the subcortical and subpial regions of the left frontal and parietal areas, raising the concern of brain metastases. Pituitary hormonal evaluation was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the pituitary tissue revealed an adenocarcinoma, originating from the lung. Computed tomography of the chest and abdomen was subsequently performed, showing a 2.2-cm soft tissue mass at the proximal part of right bronchus. There was no evidence of distant metastases elsewhere. The final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung with pituitary metastasis manifesting as panhypopituitarism and central DI. Palliative care along with hormonal replacement therapy was offered to the patient. She died 4 months after diagnosis.Diagnosis of pituitary metastasis is challenging, especially in patients with previously undiagnosed primary cancer.

In addition, 52,294 variants from The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) had been simultaneously identified and analysed. Rare variants with a variant allele frequency (VAF) less than 0.01 comprised 41.4% (3594/8682) of identified variations in CMDB, while 98.1% (51,320/52,294) in gnomAD were rare.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genec susceptibility loci for obesity and T2DM, although the causal genes and mechanisms are largely unknown. SPRY2 is a candidate gene identified in GWAS of body fat percentage and T2DM, and has recently been linked to insulin production in pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, we aimed to further understand SPRY2 via functional characterisation in HepG2 cells, an in vitro model of human hepatocytes widely used to investigate T2DM and insulin resistance.CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to target SPRY2 in HepG2 cells, and the functional consequences of SPRY2 knockout (KO) and overexpression subsequently assessed using glucose uptake and lipid droplet assays, measurement of protein kinase phosphorylation and RNA sequencing.The major functional consequence of SPRY2 KO was a significant increase in glucose uptake, along with elevated lipid droplet accumulation. These changes were attenuated, but not reversed, in cells overexpressing SPRY2. Phosphorylation of protein kinases across key signalling  (including Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases) was not altered after SPRY2 KO. Transcriptome profiling in SPRY2 KO and mock (control) cells revealed a number of differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation and cellular signalling . Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) mRNA level was subsequently validated as significantly upregulated following SPRY2 KO, highlighting this as a potential mediator downstream of SPRY2.These findings suggest a role for SPRY2 in glucose and lipid  in hepatocytes and contribute to clarifying the function of this gene in the context of  diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661609>Acid Lactic Lactobacilli as a biotechnological toll to improve food quality and human health.</a></h2><p>The genus Lactobacillus has been widely used in food industry as starter or adjunct culture due to its probiotic features.

Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of lipid, especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on lipid  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty acid exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty acid β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty acid β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Lack of a good mammalian model has impeded studies of pathogenesis and development of rational therapeutics. We took a new approach to investigating an existing mouse mutant of Pank2 and found that isolating the disease-vulnerable brain revealed regional perturbations in CoA , iron homeostasis, and dopamine  and functional defects in complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Feeding mice a CoA pathway intermediate, 4'-phosphopantetheine, normalized levels of the CoA-, iron-, and dopamine-related biomarkers as well as activities of mitochondrial enzymes. Human cell changes also were recovered by 4'-phosphopantetheine. We can mechanistically link a defect in CoA  to these secondary effects via the activation of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, which is essential to oxidative phosphorylation, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. We demonstrate the fidelity of our model in recapitulating features of the human disease. Moreover, we identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers, provide insights into disease pathogenesis, and offer evidence for 4'-phosphopantetheine as a candidate therapeutic for PKAN.© 2019 The Authors.

The standard SABRE homogeneous catalyst ["Ir-IMes"; [IrCl(COD)(IMes)], (IMes = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl), imidazole-2-ylidene; COD = cyclooctadiene)] was first activated in the presence of an auxiliary substrate (pyridine) in alcohol. Following addition of sodium 1- 13 C-acetate, parahydrogen bubbling within a microtesla magnetic field (i.e. under conditions of SABRE in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei, SABRE-SHEATH) resulted in positive enhancements of up to ~100-fold in the 13 C NMR signal compared to thermal equilibrium at 9.4 T.  The present results are consistent with a mechanism of "direct" transfer of spin order from parahydrogen to 13 C spins of acetate weakly bound to the catalyst, under conditions of fast exchange with respect to the 13 C acetate resonance, but we find that relaxation dynamics at microtesla fields alter the optimal matching from the traditional SABRE-SHEATH picture.  Further development of this approach could lead to new ways to rapidly, cheaply, and simply hyperpolarize a broad range of substrates (e.g. metabolites with carboxyl groups) for various applications, including biomedical NMR and MRI of cellular and in vivo .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Perspectives and pitfalls.</a></h2><p>Complex I (CI or NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) deficiency is the most frequent cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain defect. Successful attempts to rescue CI function by introducing an exogenous NADH dehydrogenase, such as the NDI1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScNDI1), have been reported although with drawbacks related to competition with CI. In contrast to ScNDI1, which is permanently active in yeast naturally devoid of CI, plant alternative NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2) support the oxidation of NADH only when the CI is metabolically inactive and conceivably when the concentration of matrix NADH exceeds a certain threshold. We therefore explored the feasibility of CI rescue by NDH-2 from Arabidopsis thaliana (At) in human CI defective fibroblasts.We showed that, other than ScNDI1, two different NDH-2 (AtNDA2 and AtNDB4) targeted to the mitochondria were able to rescue CI deficiency and decrease oxidative stress as indicated by a normalization of SOD activity in human CI-defective fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that when expressed in human control fibroblasts, AtNDA2 shows an affinity for NADH oxidation similar to that of CI, thus competing with CI for the oxidation of NADH as opposed to our initial hypothesis. This competition reduced the amount of ATP produced per oxygen atom reduced to water by half in control cells.In conclusion, despite their promising potential to rescue CI defects, due to a possible competition with remaining CI activity, plant NDH-2 should be regarded with caution as potential therapeutic tools for human mitochondrial diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660891>Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of tissue, serum, and serum exosomes from hepatocellular carcinoma patients.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a promising prognostic and diagnostic tool in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we performed small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) of tissue, serum and serum exosomes to investigate changes in miRNA expression between the different sample types and correlated the expression with clinical parameters. We also performed gene expression arrays on tumor and normal tissue.Paired tissue, serum and serum exosomes sequencing revealed consistent positive correlation of miR-21 between serum exosomes and tumor tissue, indicating that miR-21 could be exported from tissue to circulation via exosomes. We found that let-7 miRNAs are generally upregulated in serum exosomes compared to whole serum, indicating that these miRNAs could be preferentially loaded into exosomes. Comparing serum from HCC patients with serum from healthy individuals revealed a global increase of miRNAs in serum from HCC patients, including an almost 4-fold increase of several miRNAs, including the liver-specific miR-122. When correlating miRNA expression with clinical parameters we detected significant association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and miR-122 in serum as well as several serum and tissue-miRNAs that correlated with surgery type. We found that miR-141 and miR-146 correlated with cirrhosis in tumor tissue and normal tissue, respectively. Finally, high expression of miR-21 in tumors were associated with poor survival. Focusing on gene expression we found several significant messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between tumor and normal tissue and a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these changes were mainly related to cell cycle and . Further, we detected mRNAs that correlated with cirrhosis and HBV infection in tissue. Finally, GO analysis of predicted targets for miRNAs down-regulated in tumor found that these were enriched for functions related to collagen synthesis.Our combined data point to altered miRNA and mRNA expression contributing to both generally impaired lipid  and increased cell proliferation and a miRNA-driven increase in collagen synthesis in HCC. Our results further indicate a correlation in miRNA expression between exosomes, serum, and tissue samples suggesting export from tumors via exosomes.

Cysteine desulfurase NFS1 is the key enzyme of the complex. At present, it is well known that the active form of NFS1 is stabilized by the small protein ISD11. In this work, the structure of the human mitochondrial ACP-ISD11 heterodimer was solved at 2.0 Å resolution. ACP-ISD11 forms a cooperative unit stabilized by several ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds and also by apolar interactions. The 4'-phosphopantetheine-acyl chain, which is covalently bound to ACP, interacts with several residues of ISD11, modulating together with ACP the foldability of ISD11. Recombinant human ACP-ISD11 was able to interact with the NFS1 desulfurase, thus yielding an active enzyme, and the core complex NFS1/ACP-ISD11 was activated by frataxin and ISCU proteins. Internal motions of ACP-ISD11 were studied by molecular dynamic simulations, showing the persistence of the interactions between both protein chains. The conformation of the dimer is similar to the one found in the context of the supercomplex core (NFS1/ACP-ISD11), which contains the  ACP instead of the human variant. This fact suggests a sequential mechanism for supercomplex consolidation, in which the ACP-ISD11 complex may fold independently and after that, the NFS1 dimer is stabilized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665241>The structural connectivity of discrete  underlies impulsivity and gambling in Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Impulsivity in Parkinson's disease may be mediated by faulty evaluation of rewards or the failure to inhibit inappropriate choices. Despite prior work suggesting that distinct neural  underlie these cognitive operations, there has been little study of these  in Parkinson's disease, and their relationship to inter-individual differences in impulsivity. High-resolution diffusion MRI data were acquired from 57 individuals with Parkinson's disease (19 females, mean age 62, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.6) prior to surgery for deep brain stimulation. Reward evaluation and response inhibition  were reconstructed with seed-based probabilistic tractography. Impulsivity was evaluated using two approaches: (i) neuropsychiatric instruments were used to assess latent constructs of impulsivity, including trait impulsiveness and compulsivity, disinhibition, and also impatience; and (ii) participants gambled in an ecologically-valid virtual casino to obtain a behavioural read-out of explorative, risk-taking, impulsive behaviour. Multivariate analyses revealed that different components of impulsivity were associated with distinct variations in structural connectivity, implicating both reward evaluation and response inhibition . Larger bet sizes in the virtual casino were associated with greater connectivity of the reward evaluation network, particularly bilateral fibre tracts between the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, weaker connectivity of the response inhibition network was associated with increased exploration of alternative slot machines in the virtual casino, with right-hemispheric tracts between the subthalamic nucleus and the pre-supplementary motor area contributing most strongly. Further, reduced connectivity of the reward evaluation network was associated with more 'double or nothing' gambles, weighted by connections between the subthalamic nucleus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Notably, the variance explained by structural connectivity was higher for behavioural indices of impulsivity, derived from clinician-administered tasks and the gambling paradigm, as compared to questionnaire data. Lastly, a clinically-meaningful distinction could be made amongst participants with a history of impulse control behaviours based on the interaction of their network connectivity with medication dosage and gambling behaviour. In summary, we report structural brain-behaviour covariation in Parkinson's disease with distinct reward evaluation and response inhibition  that underlie dissociable aspects of impulsivity (cf. choosing and stopping). More broadly, our findings demonstrate the potential of using naturalistic paradigms and neuroimaging techniques in clinical settings to assist in the identification of those susceptible to harmful behaviours.© The Author(s) (2019).

The possible association between cancer and cognitive impairment is important to elucidate, because it can have a serious impact on quality of life. Here, we focused on glucose  as a factor that links cancer and cognitive impairment.Thirteen subjects with solid cancers and cognitive impairment were recruited. As a control group, 14 subjects with cognitive impairment alone and 8 subjects with cancer alone were recruited. A Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and that of β-cell function (HOMA-B) were used. In comparison with patients with solid cancer alone, those with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cancer and cognitive impairment had increased HOMA-IR values. Insulin resistance was increased in patients with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cognitive impairment and solid cancer than in patients without cognitive impairment; however, β-cell function was not affected. The present data indicated that elderly cancer patients with high HOMA-IR score may be at a relatively high risk for developing cognitive impairment. Furthermore, early treatment to reduce insulin sensitivity may prevent cognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660449>Dietary Exposure to Transgenic Rice Expressing the Spider Silk Protein Fibroin Reduces Blood Glucose Levels in Diabetic Mice: The Potential Role of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Phosphorylation in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance (IR). T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659545>Expression dynamics of autophagy-related genes in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus during embryonic development and under increasing larval starvation.</a></h2><p>Rhipicephalus microplus is a hematophagous ectoparasite that significantly affects parasitized cattle. As a one-host tick its entire life cycle consists of free-living and parasitic forms. Its extraordinary ability to survive during prolonged off-host periods has been related to the process of cytoplasmic degradation called autophagy. In order to deepen our understanding of this process during R. microplus non-parasitic stages, we determined the expression dynamics of a set of five autophagy-related genes (ATG genes) during embryonic development and over an increasing larval starvation period of 50 days. We found two apparent successive waves of ATG genes transcriptional activation, which paralleled key embryonic changes such as cellularization and organogenesis, as well as nutrient utilization. Moreover, during increasing larval starvation, ATG genes were up-regulated cyclically every 10-15 days. Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy is playing a major role in embryo development and energy  during starvation in R. microplus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on  Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h2><p>The  syndrome (MS) underlies  disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world. Sterculic acid has been proposed as a potential tool for the treatment of MS since it inhibits the activity of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a central enzyme in lipid . We analyzed the effect of sterculic oil (SO) co-administration with 30% fructose in drinking water on the development of MS in male Wistar rats. After 8 weeks, 0.4% SO exerted a protective effect from MS development since parameters altered by fructose (blood pressure, insulin resistance, serum glucose and triglycerides, steatosis, and adiposity) were similar to those of control rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659814>GPETAFLR, a biopeptide from Lupinus angustifolius L., protects against oxidative and inflammatory damage in retinal pigment epithelium cells.</a></h2><p>GPETAFLR, an octapeptide released from the enzymatic hydrolysis of lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.) protein, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effect in myeloid lineage. This work aims to evaluate in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells the protective role of GPETAFLR on both oxidative and inflammatory markers known to be involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In comparison with stimulated control cells, GPETAFLR increased glutathione production and diminished the secretion and gene expression of VEFG, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF-α, as well as reactive oxygen species, and nitrite output. Our findings reveal that GPETAFLR, a novel plant peptide, is able to protect against RPE oxidative stress and inflammation. Taken together, these results strongly support innovative nutritional strategies considering Lupinus angustifolius L. as source of proteins to prevent the onset and progression of AMD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: We reveal a novel nutraceutical impact of GPETAFLR peptide in human RPE cells to prevent oxidative and inflammatory mediators. Our results support that the intake of Lupine angustifolius L., proposed to be a reservoir of GPETAFLR, could lessen the functional decay of RPE cells, leading therefore to a slowdown of the progress of AMD during age. Not only this work, but also future simple clinical studies should raise new nutritional strategies focused on understanding the etiological role of the foods, nutrition, and  in the pathogenesis of ocular disorders.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659627>Impact of Carbohydrate on Glucose Variability in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Assessed Through Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to objectively analyze the correlation between dietary components and blood glucose variation by means of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who received CGM to manage their blood glucose levels were enrolled into the study, and the components of their total caloric intake were analyzed. Glycemic variation parameters were calculated, and dietary components, including percentages of carbohydrate, protein and fat in the total dietary intake, were analyzed by a dietitian. The interaction between parameters of glycemic variability and dietary components was analyzed.Sixty-one patients with T1DM (33 females, 28 males) were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years, and the average duration of diabetes was 14 years. Glycated hemoglobin before CGM was 8.54%. Participants with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake had a longer DM duration and a higher protein and fat intake than did those with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for ≥ 50% of total caloric intake, but there was no between-group difference in total caloric intake per day. The group with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake also had lower nocturnal continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA) 1, - 2 and - 4 values. The percentage of protein intake had a slightly negative correlation with mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) (r = - 0.286, p < 0.05) and a moderately negative correlation with coefficient of variation (CV) (r = 0.289, p < 0.05). One additional percentage of protein calories of total calories per day decreased the MAGE to 4.25 mg/dL and CV to 0.012 (p < 0.05). The optimal dietary protein percentage for MAGE < 140 mg/dL was 15.13%. The performance of predictive models revealed the beneficial effect of adequate carbohydrate intake on glucose variation when combined with protein consumption.Adequate carbohydrate consumption-but not more than half the daily total calories-combined with protein calories that amount to approximately 15% of the daily caloric intake is important for glucose stability and beneficial for patients with T1DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665451>Sperm recovery and ICSI outcomes in men with non-obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Factor affecting sperm retrieval rate (SRR) or pregnancy rates (PR) after testicular sperm extraction (TESE) in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) have not been systematically evaluated. In addition, although micro-TESE (mTESE) has been advocated as the gold standard for sperm retrieval in men with NOA, its superiority over conventional TESE (cTESE) remains conflicting.The objective was to perform a meta-analysis of the currently available studies comparing the techniques of sperm retrieval and to identify clinical and biochemical factors predicting SRR in men with NOA. In addition, PRs and live birth rates (LBRs), as derived from subjects with NOA post-ICSI, were also analysed as secondary outcomes.An extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane search was performed. All trials reporting SRR derived from cTESE or mTESE in patients with NOA and their specific determinants were included. Data derived from genetic causes of NOA or testicular sperm aspiration were excluded.Out of 1236 studies, 117 studies met the inclusion criteria for this study, enrolling 21 404 patients with a mean age (± SD) of 35.0 ± 2.7 years. cTESE and mTESE were used in 56 and 43 studies, respectively. In addition, 10 studies used a mixed approach and 8 studies compared cTESE with mTESE approach. Overall, a SRR per TESE procedure of 47[45;49]% (mean percentage [95% CI]) was found. No differences were observed when mTESE was compared to cTESE (46[43;49]% for cTESE versus 46[42;49]% for mTESE). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that SRR per cycle was independent of age and hormonal parameters at enrolment. However, the SRR increased as a function of testis volume. In particular, by applying ROC curve analysis, a mean testis volume higher than 12.5 ml predicted SRR >60% with an accuracy of 86.2% ± 0.01. In addition, SRR decreased as a function of the number of Klinefelter's syndrome cases included (S = -0.02[-0.04;-0.01]; P < 0.01. I = 0.12[-0.05;0.29]; P = 0.16). Information on fertility outcomes after ICSI was available in 42 studies. Overall, a total of 1096 biochemical pregnancies were reported (cumulative PR = 29[25;32]% per ICSI cycle). A similar rate was observed when LBR was analysed (569 live births with a cumulative LBR = 24[20;28]% per ICSI cycle). No influence of male and female age, mean testis volume or hormonal parameters on both PR and LBR per ICSI cycle was observed. Finally, a higher PR per ICSI cycle was observed when the use of fresh sperm was compared to cryopreserved sperm (PR = 35[30;40]%, versus 20[13;29]% respectively): however, this result was not confirmed when cumulative LBR per ICSI cycle was analysed (LBR = 30[20;41]% for fresh versus 20[12;31]% for cryopreserved sperm).This analysis shows that cTESE/mTESE in subjects with NOA results in SRRs of up to 50%, with no differences when cTESE was compared to mTESE. Retrieved sperms resulted in a LBR of up to 28% ICSI cycle. Although no difference between techniques was found, to conclusively clarify if one technique is superior to the other, there is a need for a sufficiently powered and well-designed randomized controlled trial to compare mTESE to cTESE in men with NOA.© The Author(s) 2019.

Besides Ganoderma polysaccharides and triterpenes, multiple proteins have been found in Ganoderma. With the in-depth study of these proteins, various pharmacological functions of Ganoderma have become important in the discovery and development of new products. In the review, we summarized and discussed the kinds and characteristics of Ganoderma proteins, especially on fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FIPs) which can be potentially developed into cosmeceuticals or nutricosmetics and are a suitable target for production using established biotechnological methods. Furthermore, we discuss their pharmacological activities of the proteins with a focus on their pharmacological functions related to cosmetics, such as antioxidant activity, inhibition of melanin, antibacterial activity, and regulation of inflammatory mediators.

Predictors of PET thalamic changes and its role in predicting postsurgical outcome were also studied.This was a retrospective study of 39 patients with TLE who underwent MRI, PET, and scalp video EEG monitoring at the University at Buffalo, New York from 2001 to 2011 during presurgical evaluation. PET-defined  of the temporal lobes was evaluated using a 4-point ordinal rating scale.PET hypometabolism was associated with a variation in ictal (P = .034) and interictal (P < .001) foci in both lesional (by MRI) and nonlesional patients. Nonlesional MRI scans were associated with none to mild temporal PET hypometabolism (71% of patients) while lesional MRI scans were associated with moderate to severe hypometabolism (82% of patients) (P = .006). The odds of thalamic hypometabolism were 5.36 times higher when there was moderate to severe temporal hypometabolism (P = .039).This study underscores the utility of PET in localizing ictal foci in TLE patients even in those with normal MRI. The degree of PET hypometabolism corresponds to presence of MRI pathology. Coexistent thalamic hypometabolism with temporal hypometabolism suggests a secondary effect of distant temporal network disruption.

The Afirma Gene Sequencing Classifier (GSC) was developed to improve the specificity of the Gene Expression Classifier (GEC). Independent studies are needed to assess the performance of GSC.The aim was to compare the performance of GEC and GSC in the assessment of indeterminate nodules.Retrospective analysis of Bethesda III and IV nodules tested with GEC or GSC in an academic center between December 2011 and September 2018. Benign call rates (BCR) and surgical outcomes were compared. Histopathologic data were collected on nodules that were surgically resected to calculate measures of test performance.The BCR was 41% (73/178) for GEC and 67.8% (82/121) for GSC (p<0.001). Among specimens with dominant Hürthle cell cytology, the BCR was 22% (6/27) for GEC and 63.2% (12/19) for GSC (p=0.005). The overall surgery rate decreased from 47.8% in the GEC group to 34.7% in the GSC group (p=0.025). One GEC-benign and three GSC-benign nodules proved to be malignant in surgical excision. GSC had a statistically significant higher specificity (94% vs 60%, p<0.001) and positive predictive value (PPV) (85.3% vs 40%, p<0.001) compared to GEC. While sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) dropped with GSC (97.0% vs 90.6% and 98.6% vs 96.3%, respectively), these differences were not significantly different.GSC reclassified more indeterminate nodules as benign and improved the specificity and PPV of the test.

To uncover the genetic background of the ability of microaerobic toluene degradation in Z. oleivorans, the whole-genome sequence of the type strain Buc was revealed. Metatranscriptomic sequence reads, originated from a previous SIP study on microaerobic toluene degradation, were mapped on the genome. The genome (5.68 Mb) had a mean G + C content of 62.5%, 5005 protein coding gene sequences and 80 RNA genes. Annotation predicted that 66 genes were involved in the  of aromatic compounds. Genome analysis revealed the presence of a cluster with genes coding for a multicomponent phenol-hydroxylase system and a complete catechol meta-cleavage pathway. Another cluster flanked by mobile-element protein coding genes coded a partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway including a subfamily I.2.C-type extradiol dioxygenase. Analysis of metatranscriptomic data of a microaerobic toluene-degrading enrichment, containing Z .  oleivorans as an active-toluene degrader revealed that a toluene dioxygenase-like enzyme was responsible for the ring-hydroxylation, while enzymes of the partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway coding cluster were responsible for further degradation of the aromatic ring under microaerobic conditions.

This study aimed to investigate whether the cattle breed affects specific ruminal taxonomic microbial groups and functions associated with feed conversion ratio (FCR), using two genetically related Angus breeds as a model. Total RNA was extracted from 24 rumen content samples collected from purebred Black and Red Angus bulls fed the same forage diet and then subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis. Multivariate discriminant analysis (sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA)) and analysis of composition of microbiomes were conducted to identify microbial signatures characterizing Black and Red Angus cattle. Our analyses revealed relationships among bacterial signatures, host breeds and FCR. Although Black and Red Angus are genetically similar, sPLS-DA detected 25 bacterial species and 10 functions that differentiated the rumen microbial signatures between those two breeds. In Black Angus, we identified bacterial taxa Chitinophaga pinensis, Clostridium stercorarium and microbial functions with large and small subunits ribosomal proteins L16 and S7 exhibiting a higher abundance in the rumen microbiome. In Red Angus, nonetheless, we identified the poorly characterized bacterial taxon Oscillibacter valericigenes with a higher abundance and  related to carbohydrate . Analysis of composition of microbiomes revealed that C. pinensis and C. stercorarium exhibited a higher abundance in Black Angus compared to Red Angus associated with FCR, suggesting that these bacterial species may play a key role in the feed conversion efficiency of forage-fed bulls. This study highlights how the discovery of signatures of bacterial taxa and their functions can be used to harness the full potential of the rumen microbiome in Angus cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659587>Performance Comparison of Individual and Ensemble CNN Models for the Classification of Brain 18F-FDG-PET Scans.</a></h2><p>The high-background glucose  of normal gray matter on [18F]-fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain results in a low signal-to-background ratio, potentially increasing the possibility of missing important findings in patients with intracranial malignancies. To explore the strategy of using a deep learning classifier to aid in distinguishing normal versus abnormal findings on PET brain images, this study evaluated the performance of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to classify FDG PET brain scans as normal (N) or abnormal (A).Two hundred eighty-nine brain FDG-PET scans (N; n = 150, A; n = 139) resulting in a total of 68,260 images were included. Nine individual 2D-CNN models with three different window settings for axial, coronal, and sagittal axes were trained and validated. The performance of these individual and ensemble models was evaluated and compared using a test dataset. Odds ratio, Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and area under curve (AUC) on receiver-operative-characteristic curve, accuracy, and standard deviation (SD) were calculated.An optimal window setting to classify normal and abnormal scans was different for each axis of the individual models. An ensembled model using different axes with an optimized window setting (window-triad) showed better performance than ensembled models using the same axis and different windows settings (axis-triad). Increase in odds ratio and decrease in SD were observed in both axis-triad and window-triad models compared with individual models, whereas improvements of AUC and AIC were seen in window-triad models. An overall model averaging the probabilities of all individual models showed the best accuracy of 82.0%.Data ensemble using different window settings and axes was effective to improve 2D-CNN performance parameters for the classification of brain FDG-PET scans.

High-affinity glucose import in B. bruxellensis has been proposed to be the mechanism by which this yeast can outcompete S. cerevisiae. The present study describes the characterization of two B. bruxellensis genes (BHT1 and BHT3) believed to encode putative high-affinity glucose transporters. In vitro-generated transcripts of both genes as well as the S. cerevisiae HXT7 high-affinity glucose transporter were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and subsequent glucose uptake rates were assayed using 14C-labelled glucose. At 0.1 mM glucose, Bht1p was shown to transport glucose five times faster than Hxt7p. pH affected the rate of glucose transport by Bht1p and Bht3p, indicating an active glucose transport mechanism that involves proton symport. These results suggest a possible role for BHT1 and BHT3 in the competitive ability of B. bruxellensis.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665663>Differential protein analysis of Heracleum moellendorffii Hance seeds during stratification.</a></h2><p>Heracleum moellendorffii Hance is a medicinal vegetable species, and the seed dormancy of this species has caused many agricultural problems. One stratification technique involves alternating layers of seeds and substrate to allow post-ripening of dormant seeds under appropriate environmental conditions and to release dormancy. Non-stratified seeds (NS), cotyledon-stage-embryo seeds (CS) and germinated seeds (GS) represent key stages of H. moellendorffii seeds during stratification. To better understand the breaking of dormancy caused by stratification, tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry (MS)/MS was used to detect proteins among NS, CS and GS. A total of 876 proteins were identified, which were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The results showed that carbohydrate  processes, responses to stress and ribosome biogenesis were the main biological processes. The changes in protein accumulation were validated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that starch, sucrose, pyruvate and fatty acid  played significant roles and that the contents of stored substances were gradually degraded during stratification.

In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors. This also promises to provide a general approach for the characterisation of lipid catalysis, given the challenges that lipid  studies pose to traditional spectroscopic techniques.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664596>DNA damage response manages cell cycle restriction of senile multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells.</a></h2><p>Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) are promising to treat a variety of traumatic and degenerative diseases. However, in vitro-passage aging induces cell cycle arrest and a series of genetic and biological changes, which greatly limits ex vivo cell number expansion and further clinical application of MMSCs. In most cases, DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) act as the main cause and executor of cellular senescence respectively. Mechanistically, DNA damage signals induce cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair via DDR. If the DNA damage is indelible, MMSCs would entry into a permanent cell cycle arrest. It should be noted that apart from DDR signaling, certain proliferation or   are also occupied in DNA damage related cell cycle arrest. New findings of these aspects will also be summarized in this study. In summary, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of DDR associated cell cycle regulation and other major molecular signaling in the senescence of MMSCs. Above knowledge could contribute to improve the limited capacity of in vitro expansion of MMSCs, and then promote their clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665449>Urine steroid metabolomics as a novel tool for detection of recurrent adrenocortical carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Urine steroid metabolomics, combining mass spectrometry-based steroid profiling and machine learning, has been described as a novel diagnostic tool for detection of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC).This proof-of-concept study evaluated the performance of urine steroid metabolomics as a tool for post-operative recurrence detection after microscopically complete (R0) resection of ACC.135 patients from 14 clinical centers provided post-operative urine samples, which were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We assessed the utility of these urine steroid profiles in detecting ACC recurrence, either when interpreted by expert clinicians, or when analyzed by Random Forest, a machine learning-based classifier. Radiological recurrence detection served as the reference standard.Imaging detected recurrent disease in 42 of 135 patients; 32 had provided pre- and post-recurrence urine samples. 39 patients remained disease-free for ≥3 years. The urine "steroid fingerprint" at recurrence resembled that observed before R0 resection in the majority of cases. Review of longitudinally collected urine steroid profiles by three blinded experts detected recurrence by the time of radiological diagnosis in 50-72% of cases, improving to 69-92%, if a pre-operative urine steroid result was available. Recurrence detection by steroid profiling preceded detection by imaging by more than 2 months in 22-39% of patients. Specificities varied considerably, ranging from 61 to 97%. The computational classifier detected ACC recurrence with superior accuracy (sensitivity=specificity=81%).Urine steroid metabolomics is a promising tool for post-operative recurrence detection in ACC; availability of a pre-operative urine considerably improves the ability to detect ACC recurrence.© Endocrine Society 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664743>Liver kinase B1 depletion from astrocytes worsens disease in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a ubiquitously expressed kinase involved in the regulation of cell , growth, and inflammatory activation. We previously reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding LKB1 is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Since astrocyte activation and  function have important roles in regulating neuroinflammation and neuropathology, we examined the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 in astrocytes in a chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of MS. To reduce LKB1, a heterozygous astrocyte-selective conditional knockout (het-cKO) model was used. While disease incidence was similar, disease severity was worsened in het-cKO mice. RNAseq analysis identified Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  enriched in het-cKO mice relating to mitochondrial function, confirmed by alterations in mitochondrial complex proteins and reductions in mRNAs related to astrocyte . Enriched  included major histocompatibility class II genes, confirmed by increases in MHCII protein in spinal cord and cerebellum of het-cKO mice. We observed increased numbers of CD4+ Th17 cells and increased neuronal damage in spinal cords of het-cKO mice, associated with reduced expression of choline acetyltransferase, accumulation of immunoglobulin-γ, and reduced expression of factors involved in motor neuron survival. In vitro, LKB1-deficient astrocytes showed reduced  function and increased inflammatory activation. These data suggest that  dysfunction in astrocytes, in this case due to LKB1 deficiency, can exacerbate demyelinating disease by loss of  support and increase in the inflammatory environment.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660280>Exploration of the effects of a  mutant on the growth of  and the global regulatory function of  by RNA sequencing.</a></h2><p>DegS is a periplasmic serine protease that is considered to be the initiator of the σ stress response pathway, and this protein plays an important role in the regulation of the stress response in .

Bacterial colony morphology was observed by a plate-based growth experiment, and bacterial growth ability was observed by a growth curve experiment. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology was used to analyze the differential transcriptomic profiles between the wild-type and  mutant strains. Gene ontology (GO), pathway analysis and Gene-Act-network analysis were performed to explore the main functions of the differentially expressed genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the reliability and accuracy of the RNA-Seq analysis. The complementation experiments were used to test the roles of  and  in the small colony  mutant phenotype.When  was deleted, the  mutant exhibited smaller colonies on various media and slower growth than the wild-type strain. A total of 423 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 187 genes that were upregulated in the  mutant compared to the wild-type strain and 236 genes that were relatively downregulated. GO categories and pathway analysis showed that many differentially expressed genes were associated with various cellular   and the cell cycle. Furthermore, Gene-Act network analysis showed that many differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular   and bacterial chemotaxis. The cAMP-CRP-RpoS signaling pathway and the LuxPQ signal transduction system were also affected by the  mutant. The expression patterns of nine randomly selected differentially expressed genes were consistent between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq results.

The role of this  pathway in macrophage response and function is unknown. We show that the enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) is induced in macrophages infected with pathogenic bacteria through signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/MTOR and the transcription factor SP1. This results in the synthesis of cystathionine, which facilitates the survival of pathogens within myeloid cells. Our data demonstrate that the expression of CTH leads to defective macrophage activation by (i) dysregulation of polyamine  by depletion of -adenosylmethionine, resulting in immunosuppressive putrescine accumulation and inhibition of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and (ii) increased histone H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 di/trimethylation, which is associated with gene expression silencing. Thus, CTH is a pivotal enzyme of the innate immune response that disrupts host defense. The induction of the reverse transsulfuration pathway by bacterial pathogens can be considered an unrecognized mechanism for immune escape. Macrophages are professional immune cells that ingest and kill microbes. In this study, we show that different pathogenic bacteria induce the expression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) in macrophages. This enzyme is involved in a  pathway called the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which leads to the production of numerous metabolites, including cystathionine. Phagocytized bacteria use cystathionine to better survive in macrophages. In addition, the induction of CTH results in dysregulation of the  of polyamines, which in turn dampens the proinflammatory response of macrophages. In conclusion, pathogenic bacteria can evade the host immune response by inducing CTH in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663987>Plasma levels of miR-30d-5p are decreased in regularly exercising postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>Plasma/serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are proposed to have a role in the development of osteoporosis, and their levels can be affected by physical activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze differences in plasma miRNAs levels in postmenopausal women and to simultaneously find novel extracellular miRNAs that are associated with variations in physical activities.We measured hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-30d-5p in a cohort of 149 postmenopausal women divided into subgroups based on the amount of physical activity by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of  syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid  has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid  as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty acid derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty acid–binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype. This chapter focuses on  reprogramming and dysregulation of lipid  as hallmarks of hepatocellular carcinoma.Copyright: The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660450>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Expression in the Olive Flounder () against Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) Challenge.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the inflammatory response through the activation of neutrophil cells. The expression of IL-8 was investigated in early developmental stages of the olive flounder and in tissues of 8-month-old individuals.

Of these, 616 were seen again 3 y later for the longitudinal analysis. Energy-adjusted DII (E-DII) was calculated from a validated diet history questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA. Twenty-four inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed. Incident falls over 3 y were determined through telephone interviews every 4 mo. Multiple regression, linear mixed effects models, negative binomial regression, and mediation analysis were utilized in this study.A higher E-DII score (indicating a more proinflammatory diet) was associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β: 0.028 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053), IL-7 (β: 0.020 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.037), and TNF-α (β: 0.027 pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.051). A higher E-DII score was also associated with lower appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (ALMBMI) (β: -0.006 kg/m2; 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). For every unit increase in E-DII (range: -4.91 to +3.66 units), incident falls rates increased by 13% (incidence rate ratio: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) over 3 y. Mediation analysis showed that the association between E-DII and 3-y incident falls was influenced by the concentrations of IL-7 by 24%. There was no association between E-DII and BMD.Consumption of a proinflammatory diet was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-α; increased falls risk; and lower ALMBMI in community-dwelling older men. The association between incident falls and E-DII was partly mediated by concentrations of IL-7.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665674>Partial replacement of glucose by galactose in the post-weaning diet improves parameters of hepatic health.</a></h2><p>Replacing part of glucose with galactose in the post-weaning diet beneficially affects later life  health in female mice. The liver is the main site of galactose , but the direct effects of this dietary intervention on the liver in the post-weaning period are not known. The aim of this study was to elucidate this. Weanling female mice (C57BL/6JRccHsd) were fed a starch containing diet with glucose (32 en%) monosaccharide (GLU), or a diet with glucose and galactose (1:1 both 16 en%) (GLU+GAL). Body weight, body composition, and food intake were determined weekly. After 3 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and serum and liver tissues were collected. Global hepatic mRNA expression was analyzed and hepatic triglyceride (TG) and glycogen contents were determined by enzymatic assays. Body weight and body composition were similar in both groups, despite higher food intake in mice on GLU+GAL diet. Hepatic TG content was lower in GLU+GAL-fed than GLU-fed females, while glycogen levels were unaffected. Analysis of global expression patterns of hepatic mRNA showed that mainly inflammation-related  were affected by the diet, which were predominantly downregulated in GLU+GAL-fed females compared to GLU-fed females. This reduction in inflammation in GLU+GAL-fed females was also reflected by decreased serum concentrations of acute phase protein Serum amyloid A 3. In conclusion, replacing part of glucose with galactose in the post-weaning diet reduces hepatic TG content and hepatic inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we introduce a membrane-based culturing workflow that enables a rapid MSI-compatible steam inactivation of pathogens and generation of a flat surface. We equipped precision mass spectrometers with laser-post-ionization (MALDI-2) modules to increase the analytical sensitivity by up to several orders of magnitude. In this way, for example 39 different 2-alkylquinolones with differential expression patterns and a similar number of glycerophospholipids were simultaneously visualized from single cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at about 50 µm resolution. To visualize the  exchange between competing microorganisms, we challenged commensal Escherichia coli MG1655 and virulence factor-depleted E. coli C600 strains with enteropathogenic Shiga-toxin negative E. coli O26:H11, and Staphylococcus aureus with antagonistic P. aeruginosa.

Gait behaviours of the mice were monitored at different ages. Spontaneous synovial joint destruction was evaluated by digital radiographic imaging and μCT analysis; changes of articular cartilage and synovitis were determined by histological analysis. The recruitment of macrophages in the synovium was examined by immunostaining and monocyte trafficking assay. RNA-seq analysis, Western blotting and chemotaxis experiment were performed on control and FGFR3-deficient macrophages. The peripheral blood from non-osteoarthritis (OA) donors and patients with OA were analysed. Mice were treated with neutralising antibody against CXCR7 to investigate the role of CXCR7 in arthritis.R3cKO mice but not control mice developed spontaneous cartilage destruction in multiple synovial joints at the age of 13 months. Moreover, the synovitis and macrophage accumulation were observed in the joints of 9-month-old R3cKO mice when the articular cartilage was not grossly destructed. FGFR3 deficiency in myeloid cells also aggravated joint destruction in DMM mouse model. Mechanically, FGFR3 deficiency promoted macrophage chemotaxis partly through activation of NF-κB/CXCR7 pathway. Inhibition of CXCR7 could significantly reverse FGFR3-deficiency-enhanced macrophage chemotaxis and the arthritic phenotype in R3cKO mice.Our study identifies the role of FGFR3 in synovial macrophage recruitment and synovitis, which provides a new insight into the pathological mechanisms of inflammation-related arthritis.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

CXCL12 also elicits a pro-atherogenic role, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined yet. We aimed to reveal if and how CXCL12 promoted atherosclerosis via regulating lipid . In vitro, our data showed that CXCL12 reduced ABCA1 expression and it-mediated cholesterol efflux from THP-1-derived macrophages to apoA-I. Data from the Luciferase reporter gene and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that TCF21 stimulated transcription of ABCA1 via binding to its promoter region, which was repressed by CXCL12. We found that CXCL12 increased the levels of phosphorylated GSK3β and phosphorylation of β-catenin at the position Thr120. Inactivation of GSK3β or β-catenin increased expression of TCF21 and ABCA1. Further, knockdown or inhibition of CXCR4 (CXC chemokine receptor 4) blocked the effects of CXCL12 on TCF21 and ABCA1 expression and phosphorylation of GSK3β and β-catenin. In vivo, overexpression of CXCL12 in Apoe-/- mice via lentivirus enlarged atherosclerotic lesion area and increased macrophage infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques. We further found that overexpression of CXCL12 reduced the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transport and plasma HDL-C levels, decreased ABCA1 expression in aorta and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs), and suppressed cholesterol efflux from MPMs to apoA-I in Apoe-/- mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that CXCL12 interacts with CXCR4 and then activates the GSK-3β/β-cateninT120/TCF21 signaling pathway to inhibit ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux from macrophages and aggravate atherosclerosis. Targeting CXCL12 may be a novel and promising strategy for the prevention  of atherosclerosis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659417>Glutamine-induced filamentous cells of Pseudomonas mediterranea CFBP-5447T as producers of PHAs.</a></h2><p>Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are considerable biopolymers that have gained an increasing biotechnological interest in different applications, although their industrial production presents several limitations. Filamentous bacterial cells could represent a possible strategy to increase PHA yield, since more abundant PHA inclusions can be stored in elongated than in rod-shaped cells. At first, we determined the optimal batch culture conditions to induce filamentation in Pseudomonas mediterranea CFBP-5447T, using glutamine, glycerol, glucose, and sodium octanoate, as the sole carbon source, at low- (100 rpm) or high- (250 rpm) shaking speeds. Successively, a fermentative process was set up using glutamine in a co- strategy with glycerol, and the PHAs production was compared in rod-shaped and filamentous cells. High glutamine concentrations (from 28 to 56 mM) were able to induce alone filamentation, whereas at lower glutamine concentrations (5-10 mM), the shaking speeds became critical to allow or not filamentous phenotype. PHA granule production was higher in filamentous than in rod-shaped cells, when glycerol (46.6 mM) was added to glutamine (5 mM) in co-, and fermentation was performed at a low-shaking speed. After extraction and precipitation, PHA yield was about two times higher in filamentous than that rod-shaped cells. Our results provide new insights into filament-inducing conditions and indicate a potential use of filamentous P. mediterranea CFBP-5447T cells to increase PHA yield. These findings could have great advantages in PHAs recovering during downstream processes, since the harvesting of elongated cells is much less time-consuming and energy expensive than required with rod-shaped cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664782>Itraconazole increases ibrutinib exposure ten-fold and reduces inter-individual variation - A potentially beneficial drug-drug interaction.</a></h2><p>The oral bioavailability of ibrutinib is low and variable, mainly due to extensive first-pass  by CYP3A4.

In a randomized crossover study, 11 healthy subjects were administered itraconazole 200 mg or placebo twice on day 1, and once on days 2-4. On day 3, 1 hour after itraconazole (placebo) and breakfast, ibrutinib (140 mg during placebo; 15 mg during itraconazole) was administered. Itraconazole increased the dose-adjusted geometric mean AUC of ibrutinib 10.0-fold (90% CI 7.2-13.9; P < 0.001) and C 8.8-fold (90% CI 6.3-12.1; P < 0.001). During itraconazole, the inter-subject variation for the AUC (55%) and C (53%) was around half of that during placebo (104%; 99%).

Mutations in MFN2 cause the neurodegenerative disease Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A). The molecular basis underlying the physiological and pathological relevance of MFN2 is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of truncated human MFN2 in different nucleotide-loading states. Unlike other dynamin superfamily members including MFN1, MFN2 forms sustained dimers even after GTP hydrolysis via the GTPase domain (G) interface, which accounts for its high membrane-tethering efficiency. The biochemical discrepancy between human MFN2 and MFN1 largely derives from a primate-only single amino acid variance. MFN2 and MFN1 can form heterodimers via the G interface in a nucleotide-dependent manner. CMT2A-related mutations, mapping to different functional zones of MFN2, lead to changes in GTP hydrolysis and homo/hetero-association ability.

This communication is mediated by direct contact between oocytes and cumulus cells, and soluble secreted molecules. Secreted molecules involved in this process are known inflammatory mediators. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is detected in follicular fluid and is associated with reduced fertility, whereas accumulation of inflammatory mediators in follicular fluid, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), is associated with female infertility. Maturation of oocytes in the presence of LPS or TNF-α reduces meiotic maturation and the capacity to develop to the blastocyst. Here we evaluated the abundance of 92 candidate genes involved immune function, epigenetic modifications, embryo development, oocyte secreted factors, apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell signaling in bovine cumulus cells or zona-free oocytes after exposure to LPS or TNF-α during in vitro maturation. We hypothesize that LPS or TNF-α will alter the abundance of transcripts in oocytes and cumulus cell in a cell type dependent manner. Exposure to LPS altered abundance of 31 transcripts in oocytes (including ACVR1V, BMP15, DNMT3A) and 12 transcripts in cumulus cells (including AREG, FGF4, PIK3IP1). Exposure to TNF-α altered 1 transcript in oocytes (IGF2) and 4 transcripts in cumulus cells (GJA1, PLD2, PTGER4, STAT1). Cumulus expansion was reduced after exposure to LPS or TNF-α. Exposing COCs to LPS had a marked effect on expression of targeted transcripts in oocytes. We propose that altered oocyte transcript abundance is associated with reduced meiotic maturation and embryo development observed in oocytes cultured in LPS or TNF-α.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664147>Leucine-rich diet induces a shift in tumour  from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, reducing glucose consumption and metastasis in Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats.</a></h2><p>Leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, and recent studies have shown an increase in leucine-related mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in muscle cells. However, leucine-related effects in tumour tissues are still poorly understood. Thus, we described the effects of leucine in both in vivo and in vitro models of a Walker-256 tumour. Tumour-bearing Wistar rats were randomly distributed into a control group (W; normoprotein diet) and leucine group (LW; leucine-rich diet [normoprotein + 3% leucine]). After 20 days of tumour evolution, the animals underwent -fludeoxyglucose positron emission computed tomography (F-FDG PET-CT) imaging, and after euthanasia, fresh tumour biopsy samples were taken for oxygen consumption rate measurements (Oroboros Oxygraph), electron microscopy analysis and RNA and protein extraction. Our main results from the LW group showed no tumour size change, lower tumour glucose (F-FDG) uptake, and reduced metastatic sites. Furthermore, leucine stimulated a shift in tumour  from glycolytic towards oxidative phosphorylation, higher mRNA and protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation components, and enhanced mitochondrial density/area even though the leucine-treated tumour had a higher number of apoptotic nuclei with increased oxidative stress. In summary, a leucine-rich diet directed Walker-256 tumour  to a less glycolytic phenotype profile in which these  alterations were associated with a decrease in tumour aggressiveness and reduction in the number of metastatic sites in rats fed a diet supplemented with this branched-chain amino acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662278>Mannogen-ing Central Carbon  by Leishmania.</a></h2><p>Leishmania parasites synthesize mannogens, a unique type of storage carbohydrate, from finely tuned interactions between synthesis and degradation by a family of mannosyltransferase/phosphorylases (MTPs) newly discovered by Sernee et al.

However, the molecular mechanism of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP remains unclear. In the present study, dynamic changes in gene expression profiles before and after the treatment of NaSeO in liver injury mice were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. As a result, several essential genes and  were identified to be significantly associated with this process. In particular, ten genes including Cyp2j11, Cyp2b10, Cyp3a13, Dhrs9, Socs2, Stat4, Gm13305, Cyp3a44, Retsat, and Cyp26b1 were significantly enriched in the functional categories related to retinol , linoleic acid , and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Among them, the expression patterns of nine genes were validated by qRT-PCR, except for Cyp3a44. Furthermore, we have constructed the associated regulatory network based on the identified targets revealed by high throughput screening. Our study may provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP in mammals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661365>Phytotoxic effect of silver nanoparticles on seed germination and growth of terrestrial plants.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) exhibit size and concentration dependent toxicity to terrestrial plants, especially crops. AgNP exposure could decrease seed germination, inhibit seedling growth, affect mass and length of roots and shoots. The phytotoxic pathway has been partly understood. Silver (as element, ion or AgNP) accumulates in roots/leaves and triggers the defense mechanism at cellular and tissue levels, which alters , antioxidant activities and related proteomic expression. Botanical changes (either increase or decrease) in response to AgNP exposure include reactive oxygen species generation, superoxide dismutase activities, HO level, total chlorophyll, proline, carotenoid, ascorbate and glutathione contents, etc. Such processes lead to abnormal morphological changes, suppression of photosynthesis and/or transpiration, and other symptoms. Although neutral or beneficial effects are also reported depending on plant species, adverse effects dominate in majority of the studies.

The different cell types that constitute the airway epithelium are regenerated upon injury to restore integrity and maintenance of the epithelium barrier function. The molecular signature of tissue repair in CF airway epithelial cells has, however, not well been investigated in primary cultures. We therefore collected RNA-seq data from well-differentiated primary cultures of bronchial human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) of CF (F508del/F508del) and non-CF (NCF) origins before and after mechanical wounding, exposed or not to flagellin. We identified the expression changes with time of repair of genes, the products of which are markers of the different cell types that constitute the airway epithelium (basal, suprabasal, intermediate, secretory, goblet and ciliated cells as well as ionocytes). Researchers in the CF field may benefit from this transcriptomic profile, which covers the initial steps of wound repair and revealed differences in this process between CF and NCF cultures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663002>Resting Level of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Is Not at Play in Cardiac Enlargement in Endurance-Trained Adolescents.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to investigate resting levels of several selected growth and  hormones in a group of 24 endurance-trained adolescents (aged 13-19 years) compared with 24 untrained age- and sex-matched controls, and to investigate if increased cardiac dimensions were related to these hormones at rest with emphasis on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).The hormones (cortisol, IGF-1, IGF-2, follicle-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) were analysed with chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) or multiplex fluorochrome (Luminex) technique. Cardiac dimensions were assessed by echocardiographic examination at rest. Peak oxygen uptake was obtained by a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill.Circulating levels of analysed hormones at rest did not differ between the groups. A correlation was found between increased cardiac dimensions and IGF-1 in the controls, but not in the active group. This correlation declined also among the controls when the cardiac parameters were indexed for body surface area.Increased cardiac dimensions in endurance-trained adolescents could not be related to resting levels of hormones associated with growth and , including IGF-1 and GH. In addition, the resting levels of these hormones seem not to be affected by intense regular endurance exercise in adolescents. These findings may contribute to the knowledge about cellular signaling that trigger growth as well as cardiac adaptation to endurance training in young athletes.Copyright © 2019 Louise Rundqvist et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659360>In vivo formed metabolites of polyphenols and their biological efficacy.</a></h2><p>It is well known that plant-derived polyphenols are biologically relevant for human health both for their direct antioxidant activity and for their effects in the modulation of intracellular signals. Experts in this field have become aware of the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of these compounds in vivo, because of their absorption and  kinetics once ingested. Indeed, it has been established that phenolic compounds are exposed to extensive  in the human body, and their bioavailability is poor with respect to their metabolites. Thus, considering the biological activity of parent compounds, instead of that of their metabolites, is the major concern in relation to the studies on these molecules, especially in vitro. Recently, the main metabolites of polyphenols have become the subject of manifold research studies, which have revealed their beneficial effects particularly as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents. They have also been investigated for their role in the prevention of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The goal of this review is to emphasize the importance of the main in vivo formed metabolites of polyphenols for their potential benefits in relation to human health, showing the most significant outcomes of in vivo and in vitro studies carried out in the last few decades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662862>A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials exploring the role of fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent  infection.</a></h2><p>Recurrence remains a challenge in  infection (CDI), and in this field fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has attracted significant interest. Network meta-analysis (NWM) has been established as an evidence-synthesis tool that incorporates direct and indirect evidence in a collection of randomized controlled trials. So far no NWM exists concerning therapeutic interventions for recurrent CDI (rCDI).In this NWM we assessed the comparative effectiveness of various therapies for rCDI to examine the efficacy rank order and determine the optimum therapeutic approach.A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to investigate the efficacy rank order of rCDI interventions.Six eligible RCTs were entered into an NWM. They included 348 rCDI patients, in whom seven therapeutic interventions were used, i.e. donor fecal microbiota transplantation (DFMT), vancomycin, fidaxomicin, vancomycin + DFMT, vancomycin + bowel lavage, autologous FMT and placebo. DFMT showed the highest efficacy in comparison with vancomycin [odds ratio (95% credible interval), 20.02 (7.05-70.03)] and fidaxomicin (22.01 (4.38-109.63)).This NWM showed that DFMT is the optimum therapeutic approach for rCDI, as it was the most efficacious among various therapeutic interventions, particularly in comparison with commonly used antibiotics such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665664>Transcriptional changes during tomato ripening and influence of brackish water irrigation on fruit transcriptome and sugar content.</a></h2><p>Efficient management and utilization of brackish water irrigation help to minimize yield losses and promote fruit quality and sugar content in tomato fruit. However, the functional genes involved in sugar   and potential molecular  responsive to brackish water irrigation remain unknown. To this end, physiological responses and comparative transcriptional profiling was used to analyze the tomato fruit during the white-ripe period (CK1) and mature period (CK2) in plants grown under four water management strategies (rotating irrigation with brackish and fresh water during fruit development, T1; fresh water irrigation, T2; mixed brackish and fresh water irrigation, T3; mixed water and fresh water irrigation in sequence, T4). Comparative analysis revealed that during fruit development (CK2 cv CK1) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in photosynthetic  and sucrose-starch  were downregulated. However, two DEGs encoding putative beta-fructofuranosidases were significantly upregulated at the mature stage, which promoted the accumulation of glucose and fructose in CK2. Comparing four types of management strategies, rotating irrigation with brackish water and fresh water (T1) led to reprograming of global gene expression. Moreover, the upregulated DEGs in T1 were significantly enriched for signaling, hormone , and stress tolerance, suggesting the coordination of both stresses signaling as well as the plant hormone. These results provide a valuable reference for rational use of brackish water in the production of high-quality tomato in arid and semi-arid regions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The mechanisms of BMD decline with FTC/TDF remain unclear, and studies in HIV-positive individuals have been confounded by the effects of HIV and concomitant antiretroviral medications. We evaluated the impact of FTC/TDF on biomarkers of bone remodeling and bone mineral  in HIV-negative men and women enrolled in the Partners PrEP Study.In a random sample of HIV-negative participants randomized to FTC/TDF PrEP (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50), serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone biomarkers (C-telopeptide, procollagen 1 intact N-terminal propeptide, and sclerostin), and plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 were measured at baseline and month 24, and the percentage change was compared between groups. In a complementary analysis, we compared the change in biomarkers between participants with and without a 25% decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on FTC/TDF.Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups (median age, 38 years; 40% women). Vitamin D insufficiency was common, but baseline GFR and PTH were in the normal range. We observed a significantly greater percent increase in serum C-telopeptide in participants randomized to FTC/TDF vs placebo ( = .03), suggesting an increase in bone remodeling. We observed no differences in the other biomarkers, or in a separate analysis comparing participants with and without a decline in GFR.Increased bone remodeling may mediate the BMD decline observed with tenofovir-containing PrEP and antiretroviral therapy, independent of a TDF-mediated decrease in kidney function.© The Author(s) 2019.

To understand whether glycinergic inputs are involved in the regulation of the hypophysiotropic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) neurons, the central controllers of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, the glycinergic innervation of the TRH neurons was studied in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN).Double-labeling immunocytochemistry and patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the role of the glycinergic neurons in the regulation of TRH neurons in the PVN. Anterograde- and retrograde tracing methods were used to determine the sources of the glycinergic input of TRH neurons.Glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2), a marker of glycinergic neurons, containing axons was found to establish symmetric type of synapses on TRH neurons in the PVN. Furthermore, glycine receptor-immunoreactivity was observed in these TRH neurons. The raphe magnus (RMg) and the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG) were found to be the exclusive sources of the glycinergic innervation of the TRH neurons within the PVN. Patch-clamp electrophysiology using sections of TRH-IRES-tdTomato mice showed that glycine hyperpolarized the TRH neurons and completely blocked the firing of these neurons. Glycine also markedly hyperpolarized the TRH neurons in the presence of tetrodotoxin demonstrating the direct effect of glycine. In more than 60% of the TRH neurons, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) were observed, even after the pharmacological inhibition of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal transmission. The glycine antagonist, strychnine, almost completely abolished these sIPSCs, demonstrating the inhibitory nature of the glycinergic input of TRH neurons.These data demonstrate that TRH neurons in the PVN receive glycinergic inputs from the RMg and the VLPAG. The symmetric type of synaptic connection and the results of the electrophysiological experiments demonstrate the inhibitory nature of these inputs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660859>Genomic characteristics and comparative genomics analysis of the endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae.</a></h2><p>Sarocladium brachiariae is a newly identified endophytic fungus isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. A previous study indicated that S. brachiariae had antifungal activity; however, limited genomic information restrains further study. Therefore, we sequenced the genome of S. brachiariae and compared it with the genome of S. oryzae to identify differences between a Sarocladium plant pathogen and an endophyte.In this study, we reported a gapless genome sequence of a newly identified endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. The genome of S. brachiariae is 31.86 Mb, with a contig N50 of 3.27 Mb and 9903 protein coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on single copy orthologous genes provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of S. brachiariae and its closest species was identified as S. oryzae. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that S. brachiaria has 14.9% more plant cell wall degradation related CAZymes to S. oryzae, and 33.3% more fungal cell wall degradation related CAZymes, which could explain the antifungal activity of S. brachiaria. Based on Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis, we identified a contact helvolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the first time in S. oryzae. However, S. brachiaria had seven fewer terpene gene clusters, including helvolic acid BGC, compared with S. oryzae and this may be associated with adaptation to an endophytic lifestyle. Synteny analysis of polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid (PKS-NRPS) gene clusters between S. brachiariae and S. oryzae revealed that just 37.5% of tested clusters have good synteny, while 63.5% have no or poor synteny. This indicated that the S. brachiariae could potentially synthesize a variety of unknown-function secondary metabolites, which may play an important role in adaptation to its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.The data provided a better understanding of the Sarocladium brachiariae genome. Further comparative genomic analysis provided insight into the genomic basis of its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659606>Contribution of Baroreflex Afferent Pathway to NPY-Mediated Regulation of Blood Pressure in Rats.</a></h2><p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a -related cardiovascular factor, plays a crucial role in blood pressure (BP) regulation via peripheral and central . The expression of NPY receptors (YR/YR) specific to baroreflex afferents impacts on the sexually dimorphic neural control of circulation. This study was designed to investigate the expression profiles of NPY receptors in the nodose ganglion (NG) and nucleus tractus solitary (NTS) under hypertensive conditions. To this end, rats with hypertension induced by N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) or high fructose drinking (HFD), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were used to explore the effects/mechanisms of NPY on BP using functional, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. The data showed that BP was elevated along with baroreceptor sensitivity dysfunction in model rats; YR was up- or down-regulated in the NG or NTS of male and female HFD/L-NAME groups, while YR was only down-regulated in the HFD groups as well as in the NG of the male L-NAME group. In SHRs, YR and YR were both down-regulated in the NTS, and not in the NG. In addition to NPY-mediated energy homeostasis, leptin-melanocortin activation may be essential for  disturbance-related hypertension. We found that leptin and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) receptors were aberrantly down-regulated in HFD rats. In addition, α-MSH concentrations were reduced and NPY concentrations were elevated in the serum and NTS at 60 and 90 min after acute leptin infusion. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the decay time-constant and area under the curve of excitatory post-synaptic currents were decreased by YR activation in A-types, whereas, both were increased by YR activation in Ah- or C-types. These results demonstrate that sex- and afferent-specific NPY receptor expression in the baroreflex afferent pathway is likely to be a novel target for the clinical management of -related and essential hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663983>Do you have a "moment" to text?

Although melatonin was confirmed to alleviate salt stress in rapeseed seedlings recently, the mechanism governing the expression levels remains unknown. Therefore, the melatonin-induced transcriptome variation of salt-stressed seedlings was explored. In this study, the transcriptomes of leaves and roots under control (CK), salt (125 mM NaCl, ST) and melatonin (125 mM NaCl plus 50 µM melatonin, MS) treatments were evaluated by using next-generation sequencing techniques. After conducting comparisons of gene expression in the roots and leaves between MS and ST, the differentially expressed gene (DEG) pools were screened. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighted the significant , which were mainly related to plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction, lignin and fatty acid . The functional genes in the objective KEGG  were identified. Furthermore, members of several transcription factor (TF) families participated in the response process. Combined with the hormone (campesterol (CS), jasmonic acid (JA), and gibberellic acid 3 (GA3)) contents measured in the seedlings, it could be concluded that melatonin induced changes in the intrinsic hormone  network, which promoted seedling growth. Thus, this study identified new candidate genes and  active during the interactions between melatonin and salt stress, which provide clues for disclosing melatonin's function in resistance to salt injury.

MT-2 decreases the production of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis. In this study, the effects of four 3-amidinophenylalanine-derived combined matriptase-1/matriptase-2 (MT-1/2) inhibitors (MI-432, MI-441, MI-460, and MI-461) on hepcidin production were investigated in hepatocyte mono- and hepatocyte-Kupffer cell co-cultures. In MI-461-treated cell cultures, the extracellular hydrogen peroxide contents and the interleukin-6 and -8 (IL-6 and IL-8) levels were determined and compared to controls. Hepcidin overproduction was observed in hepatocytes upon treatment with MI-432, MI-441 and MI-461 at 50 μM. In contrast, extracellular hydrogen peroxide levels were not elevated significantly after matriptase inhibition with MI-461. Furthermore, MI-461 did not induce increases in IL-6 and IL-8 levels in these hepatic models. A model of the binding mode of inhibitor MI-461 in complex with MT-2 revealed numerous polar contacts contributing to the nanomolar potency of this compound. Based on the in vitro data on hepcidin regulation, treatment with MI-461 might be valuable in pathological states of iron  without causing excessive oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664223>Loss of Lkb1 impairs Treg function and stability to aggravate graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that a reduction in the number of Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs) contributes to the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), which is a major adverse complication that can occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, the precise features and mechanism underlying the defects in Tregs remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that Tregs were more dramatically decreased in bone marrow compared with those in peripheral blood from aGVHD patients and that bone marrow Treg defects were negatively associated with hematopoietic reconstitution. Tregs from aGVHD patients exhibited multiple defects, including the instability of Foxp3 expression, especially in response to IL-12, impaired suppressor function, decreased migratory capacity, and increased apoptosis. Transcriptional profiling revealed the downregulation of Lkb1, a previously identified critical regulator of murine Treg identity and , and murine Lkb1-regulated genes in Tregs from aGVHD patients. Foxp3 expression in human Tregs could be decreased and increased by the knockdown and overexpression of the Lkb1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, a loss-of-function assay in an aGVHD murine model confirmed that Lkb1 deficiency could impair Tregs and aggravate disease severity. These findings reveal that Lkb1 downregulation contributes to multiple defects in Tregs in human aGVHD and highlight the Lkb1-related  that could serve as therapeutic targets that may potentially be manipulated to mitigate aGVHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660870>Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of blast resistant and susceptible rice cultivars in response to salicylic acid.</a></h2><p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a significant signaling molecule that induces rice resistance against pathogen invasion. Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate , protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars.

Time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA was measured by accelerometer and transformed into isometric log-ratio coordinates. The associations between time spent in SB, LIPA and MVPA and biomarkers were examined by linear regression models. The change in each outcome of reallocating time between the three behaviors was estimated.ResultsThe findings show strong positive associations of time spent in MVPA and negative associations of time spent in SB relative to time spent in the other behaviors with sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and negative associations of time spent in SB with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Theoretically, reallocation of 19 minutes MVPA to SB or to LIPA was associated with a 17% and 17% larger SAD, 39% and 36% larger HOMA-IR values and 3.3% and 2.3% lower levels of HDL, respectively.ConclusionIn conclusion, our analysis from a time-use perspective supports the current evidence that sedentary time is devastating for the cardiometabolic health. While LIPA probably requires more time, maintaining or increasing time in MVPA are the most important features of the time use behaviors when promoting a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile in adults with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661763>Polyphenol Effects on Cholesterol  via Bile Acid Biosynthesis, CYP7A1: A Review.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis, the main contributor to coronary heart disease, is characterised by an accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol in the arterial wall. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) reduces cholesterol via its conversion into bile acids (BAs). During RCT in non-hepatic peripheral tissues, cholesterol is transferred to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and returned to the liver for conversion into BAs predominantly via the rate-limiting enzyme, cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Numerous reports have described that polyphenol induced increases in BA excretion and corresponding reductions in total and LDL cholesterol in animal and in-vitro studies, but the process whereby this occurs has not been extensively reviewed. There are three main mechanisms by which BA excretion can be augmented: (1) increased expression of CYP7A1; (2) reduced expression of intestinal BA transporters; and (3) changes in the gut microbiota. Here we summarise the BA   focusing on CYP7A1, how its gene is regulated via transcription factors, diurnal rhythms, and microRNAs. Importantly, we will address the following questions: (1) Can polyphenols enhance BA secretion by modulating the CYP7A1 biosynthetic pathway? (2) Can polyphenols alter the BA pool via changes in the gut microbiota? (3) Which polyphenols are the most promising candidates for future research? We conclude that while in rodents some polyphenols induce CYP7A1 expression predominantly by the LXRα pathway, in human cells, this may occur through FXR, NF-KB, and ERK signalling. Additionally, gut microbiota is important for the de-conjugation and excretion of BAs. Puerarin, resveratrol, and quercetin are promising candidates for further research in this area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661710>Bridging the gap or paving the way for uninvited guests?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664126>Rapid Effect of Nitrogen Supply for Soybean at the Beginning Flowering Stage on Biomass and Sucrose .</a></h2><p>Nitrogen application at the beginning flowering stage (R1 stage) increased the soybean grain yield, however, the rapid effect of enriched nitrogen at R1 growth stage on soybean dry matter accumulation and sugar  is still unclear.

Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are a type of drug-delivery systems (DDSs) which their core matrix is composed of both solid and liquid lipids.The aim of the current study was to prepare and characterize curcumin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (Cur-NLC) for malaria treatment.For the production of NLC, coconut oil and cetyl palmitate were selected as a liquid and solid lipid, respectively. In order to prepare the Cur-NLC, the microemulsion method was applied. General toxicity assay on Artemia salina and also hemocompatibility was investigated. Antimalarial activity was studied on mice infected with Plasmodium berghei.The NLCs mean particle size and polydispersity index (PI) was 145 nm and 0.3, respectively. Moreover, the zeta potential of the Cur-NLC was -25 mV, as well as, the NLCs showed pseudo-spherical shape which revealed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The loading capacity and encapsulation efficacy of the obtained Cur-NLC were 3.1 ± 0.015% and 74 ± 3.32%, respectively. In vitro, Cur release profiles showed a sustained-release pattern up to 5 days in synthesized Cur-NLC. The results of in vivo anti-plasmodial activity against P. berghei revealed that antimalarial activity of Cur-NLC was high 2-fold compared with bare Cur at the tested dosage level.The results of this study showed that NLC would be used as a potential nanocarrier for the treatment of malaria.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665600>Molecular oxygen binding in the mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide are potentially harmful byproducts of the aerobic  in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and complexes I (the ETF enzyme) and III (the cytochrome bc1 complex) of the electron transport chain have been identified as primary sources. The exact mechanisms of superoxide production have not been fully established, but a crucial starting point would be the binding of molecular oxygen within one of the protein complexes. The present investigation offers a comprehensive computational approach for the determination of binding modes and characteristic binding times of small molecules inside proteins, which is then used to reveal several O2 binding sites near the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor of the ETF enzyme. The binding sites are further characterized to extract the necessary parameters for further studies of possible electron transfer between flavin and O2 leading to radical pair formation and possible superoxide production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665416>IMG-ABC v.5.0: an update to the IMG/Atlas of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters Knowledgebase.</a></h2><p>Microbial secondary  is a reservoir of bioactive compounds of immense biotechnological and biomedical potential. The biosynthetic machinery responsible for the production of these secondary metabolites (SMs) (also called natural products) is often encoded by collocated groups of genes called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). High-throughput genome sequencing of both isolates and metagenomic samples combined with the development of specialized computational workflows is enabling systematic identification of BGCs and the discovery of novel SMs. In order to advance exploration of microbial secondary  and its diversity, we developed the largest publicly available database of predicted BGCs combined with experimentally verified BGCs, the Integrated Microbial Genomes Atlas of Biosynthetic gene Clusters (IMG-ABC) (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/abc-public). Here we describe the first major content update of the IMG-ABC knowledgebase, since its initial release in 2015, refreshing the BGC prediction pipeline with the latest version of antiSMASH (v5) as well as presenting the data in the context of underlying environmental metadata sourced from GOLD (https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/).

The mitochondrial gatekeeper, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), mediates transport of metabolites and ions in and out of mitochondria, and is involved in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Here, we compared the effects of reducing hVDAC1 expression in a glioblastoma xenograft using human-specific si-RNA (si-hVDAC1) for a short (19 days) and a long term (40 days). Tumors underwent reprograming, reflected in rewired , eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and differentiation. Short- and long-term treatments of the tumors with si-hVDAC1 similarly reduced the expression of -related enzymes, and translocator protein (TSPO) and CSCs markers. In contrast, differentiation into cells expressing astrocyte or neuronal markers was noted only after a long period during which the tumor cells were hVDAC1-depleted. This suggests that tumor cell differentiation is a prolonged process that precedes  reprograming and the "disappearance" of CSCs. Tumor proteomics analysis revealing global changes in the expression levels of proteins associated with signaling, synthesis and degradation of proteins, DNA structure and replication and epigenetic changes, all of which were highly altered after a long period of si-hVDAC1 tumor treatment. The depletion of hVDAC1 greatly reduced the levels of the multifunctional translocator protein TSPO, which is overexpressed in both the mitochondria and the nucleus of the tumor. The results thus show that VDAC1 depletion-mediated cancer cell  reprograming involves a chain of events occurring in a sequential manner leading to a reversal of the unique properties of the tumor, indicative of the interplay between  and oncogenic signaling .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664907>Expression profiles of cell-wall related genes vary broadly between two common maize inbreds during stem development.</a></h2><p>The cellular machinery for cell wall synthesis and  is encoded by members of large multi-gene families. Maize is both a genetic model for grass species and a potential source of lignocellulosic biomass from crop residues. Genetic improvement of maize for its utility as a bioenergy feedstock depends on identification of the specific gene family members expressed during secondary wall development in stems.High-throughput sequencing of transcripts expressed in developing rind tissues of stem internodes provided a comprehensive inventory of cell wall-related genes in maize (Zea mays, cultivar B73). Of 1239 of these genes, 854 were expressed among the internodes at ≥95 reads per 20 M, and 693 of them at ≥500 reads per 20 M. Grasses have cell wall compositions distinct from non-commelinid species; only one-quarter of maize cell wall-related genes expressed in stems were putatively orthologous with those of the eudicot Arabidopsis. Using a slope-metric algorithm, five distinct patterns for sub-sets of co-expressed genes were defined across a time course of stem development. For the subset of genes associated with secondary wall formation, fifteen sequence motifs were found in promoter regions. The same members of gene families were often expressed in two maize inbreds, B73 and Mo17, but levels of gene expression between them varied, with 30% of all genes exhibiting at least a 5-fold difference at any stage. Although presence-absence and copy-number variation might account for much of these differences, fold-changes of expression of a CADa and a FLA11 gene were attributed to polymorphisms in promoter response elements.Large genetic variation in maize as a species precludes the extrapolation of cell wall-related gene expression  even from one common inbred line to another. Elucidation of genotype-specific expression patterns and their regulatory controls will be needed for association panels of inbreds and landraces to fully exploit genetic variation in maize and other bioenergy grass species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664643>Allopregnanolone Reverses Bioenergetic Deficits in Female Triple Transgenic Alzheimer's Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (Allo) promoted neural stem cell regeneration, restored cognitive function, and reduced Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology in the triple transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model (3xTgAD). To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain , we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling  while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty acid , and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A)  while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)  to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662018>Long-term training in diabetes-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practice among diabetes liaison nurses.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664455>The Thyrotropin Reference Range Should Be Changed in Older Patients.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664441>Effect of Weight Loss via Severe vs Moderate Energy Restriction on Lean Mass and Body Composition Among Postmenopausal Women With Obesity: The TEMPO Diet Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Severely energy-restricted diets are the most effective dietary obesity treatment. However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects on body composition.To compare the long-term effects of weight loss via severe vs moderate energy restriction on lean mass and other aspects of body composition.The Type of Energy Manipulation for Promoting Optimum  Health and Body Composition in Obesity (TEMPO) Diet Trial was a 12-month, single-center, randomized clinical trial. A total of 101 postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 65 years with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) from 30 to 40, who were at least 5 years after menopause, had fewer than 3 hours of structured physical activity per week, and lived in the Sydney metropolitan area of New South Wales, Australia, were recruited between March 2013 and July 2016. Data analysis was conducted between October 2018 and August 2019.Participants were randomized to either 12 months of moderate (25%-35%) energy restriction with a food-based diet (moderate intervention) or 4 months of severe (65%-75%) energy restriction with a total meal replacement diet followed by moderate energy restriction for an additional 8 months (severe intervention). Both interventions had a prescribed protein intake of 1.0 g/kg of actual body weight per day, and physical activity was encouraged but not supervised.The primary outcome was whole-body lean mass at 12 months after commencement of intervention. Secondary outcomes were body weight, thigh muscle area and muscle function (strength), bone mineral density, and fat mass and distribution, measured at 0, 4, 6, and 12 months.A total of 101 postmenopausal women were recruited (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [4.2] years; mean [SD] weight, 90.8 [9.1] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 34.4 [2.5]). Compared with the moderate group at 12 months, the severe group lost more weight (effect size, -6.6 kg; 95% CI, -8.2 to -5.1 kg), lost more whole-body lean mass (effect size, -1.2 kg; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4 kg), and lost more thigh muscle area (effect size, -4.2 cm2; 95% CI, -6.5 to -1.9 cm2). However, decreases in whole-body lean mass and thigh muscle area were proportional to total weight loss, and there was no difference in muscle (handgrip) strength between groups. Total hip bone mineral density (effect size, -0.017 g/cm2; 95% CI, -0.029 to -0.005 g/cm2), whole-body fat mass (effect size, -5.5 kg; 95% CI, -7.1 to -3.9 kg), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (effect size, -1890 cm3; 95% CI, -2560 to -1219 cm3), and visceral adipose tissue (effect size, -1389 cm3; 95% CI, -1748 to -1030 cm3) loss were also greater for the severe group than for the moderate group at 12 months.Severe energy restriction had no greater adverse effect on relative whole-body lean mass or handgrip strength compared with moderate energy restriction and was associated with 2-fold greater weight and fat loss over 12 months. However, there was significantly greater loss of total hip bone mineral density with severe vs moderate energy restriction. Therefore, caution is necessary when implementing severe energy restriction in postmenopausal women, particularly those with osteopenia or osteoporosis.anzctr.org.au Identifier: 12612000651886.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664509>Correlation of machine learning computed tomography-based fractional flow reserve with instantaneous wave free ratio to detect hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis.</a></h2><p>Fractional flow reserve based on coronary CT angiography (CT-FFR) is gaining importance for non-invasive hemodynamic assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). We evaluated the on-site CT-FFR with a machine learning algorithm (CT-FFR) for the detection of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis in comparison to the invasive reference standard of instantaneous wave free ratio (iFR).This study evaluated patients with CAD who had a clinically indicated coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) and underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with iFR-measurements. Standard cCTA studies were acquired with third-generation dual-source computed tomography and analyzed with on-site prototype CT-FFR software.We enrolled 40 patients (73% males, mean age 67 ± 12 years) who had iFR-measurement and CT-FFR calculation. The mean calculation time of CT-FFR values was 11 ± 2 min. The CT-FFR algorithm showed, on per-patient and per-lesion level, respectively, a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 64-99%) and 87% (95% CI 59-98%), a specificity of 96% (95% CI 81-99%) and 95% (95% CI 84-99%), a positive predictive value of 92% (95% CI 64-99%), and 87% (95% CI 59-98%), and a negative predictive value of 96% (95% CI 81-99%) and 95% (95% CI 84-99%).

Seventy-two hours following uninephrectomy, 12-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received the following renal interstitial (RI) infusions for 1 hour after a 1-hour control: vehicle (n = 10), ghrelin (3 μg/minute; n = 8), ghrelin + phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY-294002 (0.1 μg/kg/minute; n = 7), ghrelin + protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (10 μg/kg/minute; n = 8), ghrelin + microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole (0.3 μg/kg/minute; n = 7), or ghrelin + actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D (0.3 μg/kg/minute; n = 6). Compared with vehicle infusion, RI ghrelin induced a significant anti-natriuresis (urine Na excretion was reduced by 53.7% ± 6.8%;  < 0.001). This effect was abolished during concomitant PKA or microtubule inhibition (106.4% ± 9.4% and 109.7% ± 10.6% of vehicle infusion, respectively;  < 0.01 from ghrelin) but not during concomitant PI3K or actin inhibition (reduced by 48.6% ± 3.9% and 52.8% ± 12.7%, respectively;  < 0.001 and  < 0.01 from vehicle, respectively;  = not significant from ghrelin). Infusions had no effect on mean arterial pressure. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CD membrane but not total EC expression increased in response to ghrelin infusion compared with vehicle, (0.39 ± 0.05 vs 0.12 ± 0.02 arbitrary units;  < 0.01). This effect was abolished during PKA or microtubule inhibition but persisted during PI3K or actin inhibition. Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4 isoform 2 (Nedd4-2) dependent internalization of EC was not affected by ghrelin, indicating that microtubule-dependent forward trafficking of EC is necessary for anti-natriuretic responses to ghrelin.

Using the transparent visibility of zebrafish, the strains for intestinal peristalsis were quickly screened. The methods and results were as follows: (1) 18 strains with outstanding gastrointestinal viability via their surface hydrophobicity, self-aggregation ability, acid tolerance, bile tolerance, simulated gastric digestion and intestinal fluid tolerance were determined from 54 unpublished strains. (2) 5dpf zebrafish were randomly selected and divided into 22 groups with 12 tails in each group. The intestinal peristalsis frequency of each group within 1 min was calculated after immersing the model zebrafish in a 108 CFU mL-1 strain solution, with 5 effective strains obtained. (3) The serotonin in zebrafish was measured by Elisa and fluorescence immunization.

Genetic knowledge of metribuzin tolerance in wheat is needed to develop new cultivars for the industry. Here, we investigated gene effects for metribuzin tolerance in nine crosses of wheat by partitioning the means and variances of six basic generations from each cross into their genetic components to assess the gene action governing the inheritance of this trait. Metribuzin tolerance was measured by a visual senescence score 21 days after treatment. The wheat 90 K iSelect SNP genotyping assay was used to identify the distribution of alleles at SNP sites in tolerant and susceptible groups.The scaling and joint-scaling tests indicated that the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat was adequately described by the additive-dominance model, with additive gene action the most significant factor for tolerance. The potence ratio for all the crosses ranged between - 1 and + 1 for senescence under metribuzin-treated conditions indicating a semi-dominant gene action in the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat. The number of segregating genes governing metribuzin tolerance was estimated between 3 and 15. The consistent high heritability range (0.82 to 0.92) in F generations of Chuan Mai 25 (tolerant) × Ritchie (susceptible) cross indicated a significant contribution of additive genetic effects to metribuzin tolerance in wheat. Several genes related to photosynthesis (e.g. photosynthesis system II assembly factor YCF48),  detoxification of xenobiotics and cell growth and development (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, glycosyltransferase, ATP-binding cassette transporters and glutathione peroxidase) were identified on different chromosomes (2A, 2D, 3B, 4A, 4B, 7A, 7B, 7D) governing metribuzin tolerance.The simple additive-dominance gene effects for metribuzin tolerance will help breeders to select tolerant lines in early generations and the identified genes may guide the development of functional markers for metribuzin tolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662435>Structural comparisons of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases reveal the evolutionary trajectories of these phosphodiester energy-conversion enzymes.</a></h2><p>Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) consists of two phosphate molecules and can act as an energy and phosphate donor in cellular reactions similar to ATP. Several kinases use PPi as a substrate and these kinases have recently been suggested to have evolved from ATP-dependent functional homologs, which have significant amino acid sequence similarity to PPi-utilizing enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) can be divided into three types according to the phosphate donor (ATP, GTP, or PPi), and the amino acid sequence similarity of these PEPCKs is too low to confirm that they share a common ancestor. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a PPi-PEPCK homolog from the bacterium Actinomyces israelii (AiPEPCK) at 2.6 Å resolution and compared it with previously reported structures from ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs to assess the degrees of similarities and divergences among these PEPCKs and to determine the structural basis for the PPi specificity of PPi-type PEPCKs. These comparisons revealed that the amino acid residues directly contributing to substrate recognition, except for those that recognize purine moieties, are conserved. Furthermore, the order of secondary structure elements between PPi-, ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs was strictly conserved. The structure-based comparisons of the three PEPCK types provide key insights into the structural basis for PPi specificity and suggest that all of these PEPCKs are derived from a common ancestor.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660975>Association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with cardiometabolic risk factors and  syndrome: a mendelian randomization study.</a></h2><p>Low circulating vitamin D levels have been associated with increased risk of  syndrome (MS) and cardiometabolic risk factors in multiple epidemiology studies.

We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its  traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030).

Previous research observed enhanced activity of the cyanide-detoxifying enzyme β-cyanoalanine synthase (β-CAS) and reduced ethylene production in the resistant line, suggesting β-CAS-mediated cyanide detoxification and insensitivity to quinclorac stimulation as the resistance mechanisms. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of quinclorac resistance, we characterized the β-CAS genes alongside plant transformation studies. The association of β-CAS activity and ethylene production to quinclorac resistance was assayed in the F6 progeny of susceptible and resistant lines of E. phyllopogon.A single nucleotide polymorphism in a β-CAS1 intron deleted aberrantly spliced mRNAs and enhanced β-CAS activity in the resistant line. The enhanced activity, however, was not associated with quinclorac resistance in F6 lines. The results were supported by lack of quinclorac resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana expressing E. phyllopogon β-CAS1 and no difference in quinclorac sensitivity between β-CAS knockout and wild type rice. Reduced ethylene production co-segregated with quinclorac resistance in F6 lines which were previously characterized to be resistant to other herbicides by enhanced .β-CAS does not participate in quinclorac sensitivity in E. phyllopogon.

In recent years, some researchers have identified that COX7A1 is implicated in human cancer cell  and therapy. In this study, we mainly explored the effect of COX7A1 on the cell viability of lung cancer cells. COX7A1 overexpression was induced by vector transfection in NCI-H838 cells. Cell proliferation, colony formation and cell apoptosis were evaluated in different groups. In addition, autophagy was analyzed by detecting the expression level of p62 and LC3, as well as the tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter assay respectively. Our results indicated that the overexpression of COX7A1 suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation ability, and promoted cell apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Besides, the overexpression of COX7A1 blocked autophagic flux and resulted in the accumulation of autophagosome via downregulation of PGC-1α and upregulation of NOX2. Further analysis showed that the effect of COX7A1 overexpression on cell viability was partly dependent of the inhibition of autophagy. Herein, we identified that COX7A1 holds a key position in regulating the development and progression of lung cancer by affecting autophagy. Although the crosstalk among COX7A1, PGC-1α and NOX2 needs further investigation, our study provides a novel insight into the therapeutic action of COX7A1 against human non-small cell lung cancer.© 2019 The Authors.

However, Cc has moonlighting roles outside mitochondria driving the transition of apoptotic cells from life to death. When living cells are damaged, Cc escapes its natural mitochondrial environment and, once in the cytosol, it binds other proteins to form a complex named the apoptosome-a platform that triggers caspase activation and further leads to controlled cell dismantlement. Early released Cc also binds to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, which stimulates further massive Cc release from mitochondria. Besides the well-characterized binding proteins contributing to the pro-apoptotic functions of Cc, many novel protein targets have been recently described. Among them, histone chaperones were identified as key partners of Cc following DNA breaks, indicating that Cc might modulate chromatin dynamics through competitive binding to histone chaperones. In this article, we review the ample set of recently discovered anti-apoptotic proteins-involved in DNA damage, transcription and energetic -reported to interact with Cc in the cytoplasm and even the nucleus upon DNA breaks.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid .</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired inflammation at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and inflammation, leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid  genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659504>Correction to: Pathological impact of transanal colorectal tube for obstructive colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>In Methods of Abstract, the word "2015" should be changed to "2011".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660150>A yeast phenomic model for the influence of Warburg  on genetic buffering of doxorubicin.</a></h2><p>The influence of the Warburg phenomenon on chemotherapy response is unknown.  mimics the Warburg effect, repressing respiration in the presence of adequate glucose. Yeast phenomic experiments were conducted to assess potential influences of Warburg  on gene-drug interaction underlying the cellular response to doxorubicin. Homologous genes from yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics data were analyzed to infer evolutionary conservation of gene-drug interaction and predict therapeutic relevance.Cell proliferation phenotypes (CPPs) of the yeast gene knockout/knockdown library were measured by quantitative high-throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP), treating with escalating doxorubicin concentrations under conditions of respiratory or glycolytic . Doxorubicin-gene interaction was quantified by departure of CPPs observed for the doxorubicin-treated mutant strain from that expected based on an interaction model. Recursive expectation-maximization clustering (REMc) and Gene Ontology (GO)-based analyses of interactions identified functional biological modules that differentially buffer or promote doxorubicin cytotoxicity with respect to Warburg . Yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics data were integrated to predict differential gene expression causally influencing doxorubicin anti-tumor efficacy.Yeast compromised for genes functioning in chromatin organization, and several other cellular processes are more resistant to doxorubicin under glycolytic conditions. Thus, the Warburg transition appears to alleviate requirements for cellular functions that buffer doxorubicin cytotoxicity in a respiratory context. We analyzed human homologs of yeast genes exhibiting gene-doxorubicin interaction in cancer pharmacogenomics data to predict causality for differential gene expression associated with doxorubicin cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This analysis suggested conserved cellular responses to doxorubicin due to influences of homologous recombination, sphingolipid homeostasis, telomere tethering at nuclear periphery, actin cortical patch localization, and other gene functions.Warburg status alters the genetic network required for yeast to buffer doxorubicin toxicity. Integration of yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics data suggests evolutionary conservation of gene-drug interaction  and provides a new experimental approach to model their influence on chemotherapy response. Thus, yeast phenomic models could aid the development of precision oncology algorithms to predict efficacious cytotoxic drugs for cancer, based on genetic and  profiles of individual tumors.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664444>Effect of Combination l-Citrulline and Metformin Treatment on Motor Function in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.</a></h2><p>Nitric oxide precursors, such as the amino acid l-arginine and the biguanide antidiabetic drug metformin, have been associated with  and muscle function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The treatment of DMD remains an unmet medical need.To evaluate the benefits and harms of a combination of l-citrulline and metformin treatment among patients with DMD.A single-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between December 12, 2013, and March 30, 2016, at the University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland. A total of 47 ambulant male patients aged 6.5 to 10 years with genetically confirmed DMD were recruited locally and from the patient registries of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and France. Data were analyzed from April 6, 2016, to September 5, 2019.Patients in the treatment group received 2500 mg of l-citrulline and 250 mg of metformin (combination therapy) 3 times a day for 26 weeks compared with patients in the control group, who received placebo.The primary end point was the change in transfer and standing posture, as assessed by the first dimension of the Motor Function Measure, version 32, from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included assessments of timed function, quantitative muscle force, biomarkers for muscle necrosis, and adverse events. The 2 prespecified subgroups comprised patients who were able to walk 350 m or more in 6 minutes (stable subgroup) and patients who were not able to walk 350 m in 6 minutes (unstable subgroup) at baseline.Among 49 ambulant male children with DMD who were screened for eligibility, 47 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.2 (1.1) years were randomized to a treatment group receiving combination therapy (n = 23) or a control group receiving placebo (n = 24), and 45 patients completed the study. No significant differences between groups were found in the results of timed function and muscle force tests for overall, proximal and axial, and distal motor function. Among patients receiving combination therapy, the Motor Function Measure first dimension subscore decrease was 5.5% greater than that of patients receiving placebo (95% CI, -1.0% to 12.1%; P = .09). The administration of combination therapy had significantly favorable effects on the first dimension subscore decrease among the 29 patients in the stable subgroup (6.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-12.6%; P = .03) but not among the 15 patients in the unstable subgroup (3.9%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 20.9%; P = .63). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with only mild adverse effects.Treatment with combination therapy was not associated with an overall reduction in motor function decline among ambulant patients with DMD; however, a reduction in motor function decline was observed among the stable subgroup of patients treated with combination therapy. The statistically nonsignificant difference of distal motor function in favor of combination therapy and the reduced degeneration of muscle tissue appear to support the treatment concept, but the study may have lacked sufficient statistical power. Further research exploring this treatment option with a greater number of patients is warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664493>Glucose sensitizes the stationary and persistent population of Vibrio cholerae to ciprofloxacin.</a></h2><p>The subject of analysis in this report was the antibiotic susceptibility of V. cholerae under glucose supplementation since the metabolites can significantly alter the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.

Here we report on the phases of developing and validating the self-report Type 1 Diabetes and Life (T1DAL) measures for children (age 8-11) and adolescents (age 12-17).Measure development included qualitative interviews with youth and parents (n = 16 dyads) followed by piloting draft measures and conducting cognitive debriefing with youth (n = 9) to refine the measures. To evaluate the psychometric properties, children (n = 194) and adolescents (n = 257) at three T1D Exchange Clinic Network sites completed the age-appropriate T1DAL measure and previously validated questionnaires measuring related constructs. Using psychometric data, the investigators reduced the length of each T1DAL measure to 21 and 23 items, respectively, and conducted a final round of cognitive debriefing with six children and adolescents.The T1DAL measures for children and adolescents demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.84 and 0.89, respectively) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.78 and 0.80, respectively). Significant correlations between the T1DAL scores and measures of general quality of life, generic and diabetes-specific HRQOL, diabetes burden, and diabetes strengths demonstrated construct validity. Correlations with measures of self-management (child and adolescent) and glycemic control (adolescent only) demonstrated criterion validity. Factor analyses indicated four developmentally specific subscales per measure. Participants reported satisfaction with the measures.The new T1DAL measures for children and adolescents with T1D are reliable, valid, and suitable for use in care settings and clinical research.© The Author(s) 2019.

To determine whether a single dose of Zynamite administered 1 h before exercise increases repeated-sprint performance, 20 men and 20 women who were physically active were randomly assigned to three treatments following a double-blind cross-over counterbalanced design. Treatment A, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, 147.7 mg of maltodextrin, and 420 mg of sunflower lecithin; Treatment B, 140 mg of Zynamite, 140 mg of quercetin, and 2126 mg of maltodextrin and Treatment C, 2548 mg of maltodextrin (placebo). Subjects performed three Wingate tests interspaced by 4 min and a final 15 s sprint after ischemia. Treatments A and B improved peak power output during the first three Wingates by 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively (treatment x sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Vastus Lateralis oxygenation (NIRS) was reduced, indicating higher O extraction (treatment × sprint interaction,  = 0.01). Improved O extraction was observed in the sprints after ischemia ( = 0.008; placebo vs. mean of treatments A and B). Blood lactate concentration was 5.9% lower after the ingestion of Zynamite® with quercetin in men (treatment by sex interaction,  = 0.049). There was a higher Vastus Lateralis O extraction during 60 s ischemia with polyphenols (treatment effect,  = 0.03), due to the greater muscle VO in men ( = 0.001). In conclusion, a single dose of Zynamite combined with quercetin one hour before exercise improves repeated-sprint performance and muscle O extraction and mitochondrial O consumption during ischemia.

The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663060>Microbial enzymes in the Mediterranean Sea: relationship with climate changes.</a></h2><p>In most of the aquatic ecosystems, microorganisms are major players in the biogeochemical and nutrients cycles (Carbon Nitrogen, Phosphorus), through their enzymatic activities (leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucosidase) on organic polymers such as polypeptides, organophosphate esters and polysaccharides, respectively. The small monomers released by decomposition are metabolised by microbes, supporting their growth. Most of the extracellular enzymes are adaptative and their synthesis and activity is strongly affected by environmental factors, consequently the relative importance of leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucosidase reflects differences in the composition of organic matter and assume a different meaning. Since more than two decades, at the CNR the influence of climate changes, seasonal variability, depth and coastal input on the patterns of enzymatic activities in the Mediterranean Sea have been studied. Its particular characteristics of a semi-closed basin, high summer evaporation and the occurrence of important water dynamics, make this ecosystem particularly suitable as a model site for climate changes-related observations. The present paper reviews the current information of environmental changes on extracellular enzymatic activity obtained in the Mediterranean areas with the aim of evaluating the effects of environmental changes on the microbial activities. The obtained results revealed significant variations in the rates of hydrolytic activities in relation to space and time, with the highest levels generally found in the epipelagic layer (0-100m) and in coastal zones during warm periods. In the Central Mediterranean Sea their relationship with temperature changes was demonstrated. Spatial variations in the relative enzyme activities also suggested a modulation in the  profiles of the prokaryotic communities, with biogeochemical implications in nutrient regeneration. Long term studies on microbial activity and abundances in relation with rising temperatures can have a predictive value to describe the evolutionary scenario of microbial processes and the response of microbial  to climate changes in the Mediterranean Sea.© 2019 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661893>Novel Series of Methyl 3-(Substituted Benzoyl)-7-Substituted-2-Phenylindolizine-1-Carboxylates as Promising Anti-Inflammatory Agents: Molecular Modeling Studies.</a></h2><p>The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is considered to be an important target for developing novel anti-inflammatory agents.

Compound  was identified as the most active compound of the series with an IC of 6.71 M, which is comparable to the IC of indomethacin, a marketed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Molecular modeling and crystallographic studies were conducted to further characterize the compounds and gain better understanding of the binding interactions between the compounds and the residues at the active site of the COX-2 enzyme. The pharmacokinetic properties and potential toxic effects were predicted for all the synthesized compounds, which indicated good drug-like properties.

The model simulations matched experimental results for 17 of 18 carbon source utilization assays and 47 of 49 nutrient depletion assays. We also simulated the effects of single gene deletions. The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets. Our manually curated model is more accurate than  models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines and more complete than other manually curated models.

Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino acid cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, lipid , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661298>Hepatic IKK epsilon expression is dispensable for high-fat feeding-induced increases in liver lipid content and alterations in glucose tolerance.</a></h2><p>There are endocrine and immunological changes that occur during onset and progression of the overweight and obese states. The inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε) was originally described as an inducible protein kinase; whole-body gene deletion or systemic pharmaceutical targeting of this kinase improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice. To investigate the primary sites of action associated with IKKε during weight gain, we describe the first mouse line with conditional elimination of IKKε in the liver (IKKε ). IKKε  mice and littermate controls gain weight, show similar changes in body composition, and do not display any improvements in insulin sensitivity or whole-body glucose tolerance. These studies were conducted using both breeder chow diets and also matched low-  high-fat diets. While glycogen accumulation in the liver is reduced in IKKε mice, lipid storage in liver is similar IKKε mice and littermate controls.

Obesity is not only a merely aesthetic disease but is the "mother" of most chronic diseases such as associated with a range of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer. However, although there is a need to find a strategy to stop this epidemic disease, most of the times the current nutritional strategies are not effective in weight loss and in long term weight maintenance. Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKD) is increasingly establishing as a successful nutritional pattern to manage obesity; this is due to rapid weight loss that gives rise to a positive psychological cycle which in turn increases the compliance to diet. Another important key point of VLCKD is the ability to preserve fatty free mass which is known to play a role of paramount importance in glucose . Despite the clinical evidence of VLCKD there are paucity of data regarding to its management.

Using a murine RYGB surgery model, we performed multi-organ proteomics and bioinformatics to monitor the proteins and molecular  that change in this early glycemic response. Multiplexed proteomic kinetics data analysis revealed that the Roux limb, biliopancreatic limb, liver and pancreas each exhibited unique temporal and molecular responses to the RYGB surgery. In addition, protein-protein network analysis indicated that the changes to the microbial environment in the intestine may play a crucial role in the beneficial effects of RYGB surgery. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (Igfbp7) was identified as an early induced protein in the Roux limb. Known secretory properties of Igfbp7 prompted us to further investigate its role as a remote organ regulator of glucose . Igfbp7 overexpression decreased blood glucose levels in diet-induced obese mice, and attenuated gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver. Secreted Igfbp7 appeared to mediate these beneficial effects.

Effectiveness analyses of current regimens used 3598 person-visit-pairs (745 men) on cART in 2014-2017. Inverse-probability-of-treatment-and-censoring weighted Poisson regression with robust variances was used to evaluate the association between regimens and switching, adherence and HIV RNA <20 copies/mL.Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen usage has increased since 2008. Almost 90% of cART initiators started with INSTI-cART in 2016-2017; cART adherence was stable around 90% and 83%-85% suppressed virus (<20 cp/mL).

Compared to EFV/TDF/FTC users, ATV/r+TDF/FTC users switched more (rate ratio [RR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.76), while those on DTG/ABC/3TC (RR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.08-0.31]) or EVG/c/TAF/FTC (RR [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.06-0.27]) switched less. The rate of suppressed HIV RNA was 15% (95% CI, 2%-26%) lower among younger EVG/c/TDF/FTC users and 18% (95% CI, 3%-34%) higher in older DRV/r+TDF/FTC users; adherence did not differ by regimen.Consistent with guidelines, recent cART initiators started with INSTI-cART, which was associated with less switching early after initiation.

Rate ratio (RR) calculations, subgroup analyses and modelling of continuous variables using splines were based on a Poisson regression model, adjusted for exposure time.Azithromycin significantly reduced TF by 24% within 3 m (RR = 0.76, 95%CI:0.59;0.97, p = 0.031) through a 50% reduction in SH (RR = 0.50, 95%CI:0.30;0.81, p = 0.006), which comprised of a 53% reduction in hospital readmissions (RR = 0.47, 95%CI:0.27;0.80; p = 0.007). A significant interaction between the intervention, CRP and blood eosinophil count at hospital admission was found, with azithromycin significantly reducing hospital readmissions in patients with high CRP (> 50 mg/L, RR = 0.18, 95%CI:0.05;0.60, p = 0.005), or low blood eosinophil count (<300cells/μL, RR = 0.33, 95%CI:0.17;0.64, p = 0.001). No differences were observed in treatment response by age, FEV1, CRP or blood eosinophil count in continuous analyses.This post-hoc analysis of the BACE trial shows that azithromycin initiated at the onset of an infectious COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization reduces the incidence rate of TF within 3 m by preventing hospital readmissions. In patients with high CRP or low blood eosinophil count at admission this treatment effect was more pronounced, suggesting a potential role for these biomarkers in guiding azithromycin therapy.ClinicalTrials.gov number.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661517>'Fat's chances': Loci for phenotypic dispersion in plasma leptin in mouse models of diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Leptin, a critical mediator of feeding,  and diabetes, is expressed on an incidental basis according to satiety. The genetic regulation of leptin should similarly be episodic.Data from three mouse cohorts hosted by the Jackson Laboratory- 402 (174F, 228M) F2 Dilute Brown non-Agouti (DBA/2)×DU6i intercrosses, 142 Non Obese Diabetic (NOD/ShiLtJ×(NOD/ShiLtJ×129S1/SvImJ.H2g7) N2 backcross females, and 204 male Nonobese Nondiabetic (NON)×New Zealand Obese (NZO/HlLtJ) reciprocal backcrosses-were used to test for loci associated with absolute residuals in plasma leptin and arcsin-transformed percent fat ('phenotypic dispersion'; PDpLep and PDAFP). Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665639>Dysregulation of Mitochondrial Ca Uptake and Sarcolemma Repair Underlie Muscle Weakness and Wasting in Patients and Mice Lacking MICU1.</a></h2><p>Muscle function is regulated by Ca, which mediates excitation-contraction coupling, energy , adaptation to exercise, and sarcolemmal repair. Several of these actions rely on Ca delivery to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca uniporter, the pore of which is formed by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). MCU's gatekeeping and cooperative activation are controlled by MICU1. Loss-of-protein mutation in MICU1 causes a neuromuscular disease. To determine the mechanisms underlying the muscle impairments, we used MICU1 patient cells and skeletal muscle-specific MICU1 knockout mice. Both these models show a lower threshold for MCU-mediated Ca uptake. Lack of MICU1 is associated with impaired mitochondrial Ca uptake during excitation-contraction, aerobic  impairment, muscle weakness, fatigue, and myofiber damage during physical activity. MICU1 deficit compromises mitochondrial Ca uptake during sarcolemmal injury, which causes ineffective repair of the damaged myofibers. Thus, dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca uptake hampers myofiber contractile function, likely through energy  and membrane repair.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated that UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 suppressed CYP3A4 activity through an interaction. In the present study, we target UGT1A9 as another candidate modulator of CYP3A4.We prepared coexpressed enzymes using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, and compared CYP3A4 activity in the presence and absence of UGT1A9. Wistar rats were treated with dexamethasone and liver microsomes were used to elucidate the role of CYP3A-UGT1A interactions.UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 interacted with and suppressed CYP3A4. Kinetic analyses showed that both of the UGTs significantly reduced Vmax of CYP3A4 activity. In addition, C-terminal truncated mutants of UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 still retained the suppressive capacity. Dexamethasone treatment induced hepatic CYP3As and UGT1As at different magnitudes. Turnover of CYP3A was enhanced about two fold by this treatment.The changes of kinetic parameters suggested that UGT1A9 suppressed CYP3A4 activity with almost the same mechanism as UGT2B7. The luminal domain of UGTs contains the suppressive interaction site(s), whereas the C-terminal domain may contribute to modulating suppression in a UGT isoform-specific manner. CYP3A-UGT1A interaction seemed to be disturbed by dexamethasone treatment, and the suppression was partially canceled. CYP3A4-UGT interactions would help to better understand the causes of inter/intra-individual differences in CYP3A4 activity.This article is protected by copyright.

Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive  plasticity, TIC  is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with  features, with some focus on oxidative , including fatty acid and lipid . These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their  will require advanced methodologies.</p></html>
