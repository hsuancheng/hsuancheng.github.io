Basal glucose production was measured after an overnight fast with [6,6-2H]. At 0 min Bay 27-9955 or placebo was administered and at 120 min an infusion of somatostatin [0.1 microg x (kg x min)(-1)], insulin [24 pmol x ( x min)(-1)] and glucagon [3 ng x (kg x min)(-1)] was initiated.Basal plasma glucose concentrations were about 5 mmol/l and basal rates of glucose production were about 13 micromol x (kg x min)(-1). During the hyperglucagonaemic period, plasma glucagon concentrations doubled to 100 pg/ml, plasma glucose concentration increased by 75 % to a peak of about 10 mmol/l and glucose production doubled to about 23 micromol x (kg x min)(-1) (p < 0.0001 vs basal). In the High Dose Group these effects of glucagon were markedly blunted, plasma glucose concentrations were 7.6 +/- 1.1 mmol/l (p = 0.012 vs placebo) and rates of glucose production increased minimally to 15.3 +/- 1.9 micromol x (kg-min)(-1) (p < 0.0003 vs placebo]. In the Low Dose Group, there was a proportional decrease in the effects of Bay 27-9955 on these parameters.Bay 27-9955 is an effective and safe glucagon antagonist in humans. Given the potentially important role of glucagon in increasing glucose production and  in patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus this agent could represent an innovative class of therapeutic agents for the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15928240>Effects of dietary macronutrient intake on insulin sensitivity and secretion and glucose and lipid metabolism in healthy, obese adolescents.</a></h2><p>Adolescent obesity is a serious public health concern.The aim of the study was to determine whether obese adolescents can adapt metabolically to changes in dietary macronutrient intake.Using a random cross-over design, 13 healthy obese volunteers (six boys and seven girls; age, 14.7 +/- 0.3 yr; body mass index, 34 +/- 1 kg/; body fat, 42 +/- 1%) were studied twice after 7 d of isocaloric, isonitrogenous diets with 60% carbohydrate (CHO) and 25% fat (high CHO), or 30% CHO and 55% fat (low CHO).Glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and first- and second-phase insulin secretory indices were measured by stable isotope techniques and the stable labeled iv glucose tolerance test. The results were compared with those of previously studied lean adolescents.Obese adolescents increased first- and second-phase insulin secretory indices by 18 (P = 0.05) and 36% (P = 0.05), respectively, to maintain normoglycemia during the high-CHO diet because they failed to increase insulin sensitivity as did the lean adolescents. Regardless of diet, in obese adolescents, insulin sensitivity was half (P < 0.05) and first- and second-phase insulin secretory indices twice (P < 0.01), compared with the the corresponding values in lean subjects. In obese adolescents,  increased by 32% during the low-CHO (high-fat diet) (P < 0.01).In obese adolescents, insulin secretory demands were increased regardless of diet. Failure to increase insulin sensitivity while receiving a high-CHO diet required a further increase in insulin secretion, which may lead to earlier beta-cell failure. A low-CHO/high-fat diet resulted in increased , which may be a prelude to the increased glucose production and hyperglycemia observed in type 2 diabetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028535>Baicalin and its metabolites suppresses  through activation of AMPK or AKT in insulin resistant HepG-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (S. baicalensis), as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is an important component of several famous Chinese medicinal formulas for treating patients with diabetes mellitus. Baicalin (BG), a main bioactive component of S. baicalensis, has been reported to have antidiabetic effects. However, pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that BG has poor oral bioavailability. Therefore, it is hard to explain the pharmacological effects of BG in vivo. Interestingly, several reports show that BG is extensively metabolized in rats and humans. Therefore, we speculate that the BG metabolites might be responsible for the pharmacological effects. In this study, BG and its three metabolites (M1-M3) were examined their effects on glucose consumption in insulin resistant HepG-2 cells with a commercial glucose assay kit. Real-time PCR and western blot assay were used to confirm genes and proteins of interest, respectively. The results demonstrate that BG and its metabolites (except for M3) enhanced the glucose consumption which might be associated with inhibiting the expression of the key gluconeogenic genes, including glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Further study found that BG and M1 could suppress hepatic  via activation of the AMPK pathway, while  could suppress hepatic  via activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that both BG and its metabolites have antihyperglycemic activities, and might be the active forms of oral doses of BG in vivo.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Besides, BRIN-BD11 cells were used to evaluate both insulinotropic and beta-cell protective effect of Fructus Corni.Firstly, both methanol extract (CO-W-M) and fraction (CO-W-) had potent insulin mimic activity on PEPCK expression. Secondly, possibility of both loganin and ursolic acid as the responsible compounds was excluded. Moreover, indication of the existence of phenolic compounds in CO-W- was noticed. In the presence of CO-W-, not only was the viability of BRIN-BD11 cells treated with alloxan, streptozotcin, or cytokine mix all significantly increased but also glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was potentiated.The ability of CO-W- to reduce gene expression for hepatic , to protect beta-cell against toxic challenge, and to enhance insulin secretion strengthen the role of Fructus Corni in diabetes therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8200993>Increased epinephrine and skeletal muscle responses to hypoglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>We evaluated skeletal muscle counterregulation during hypoglycemia in nine subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (HbA1c 9.4 +/- 0.5%, nl < 6.2%) compared with six normal controls, matched for age (51 +/- 3 and 49 +/- 5 yr, respectively) and body mass index (27.3 +/- 1.2 and 27.0 +/- 2.1 kg/). After 60 min of euglycemia (plasma insulin approximately 140 microU/ml), plasma glucose was lowered to 62 +/- 2 mg/dl by 120 min. Hypoglycemia induced a 2.2-fold greater increase in plasma epinephrine in NIDDM (P < 0.001), while the plasma glucagon response was blunted (P < 0.01). Hepatic glucose output ([3H-3]glucose) suppressed similarly during euglycemia, but during hypoglycemia was greater in NIDDM (P < 0.005). Conversely, glucose uptake during euglycemia was 150% greater in controls (P < 0.01) and remained persistently higher than in NIDDM during hypoglycemia. In NIDDM, plasma FFA concentrations were approximately fivefold greater (P < 0.001), and plasma lactate levels were approximately 40% higher than in controls during hypoglycemia (P < 0.01); the rates of glycolysis from plasma glucose were similar in the two groups despite a 49% lower rate of glucose uptake in NIDDM (3.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 6.9 +/- 1.3 mg/kg per minute, P < 0.001). Muscle glycogen synthase activity fell by 42% with hypoglycemia (P < 0.01) in NIDDM but not in controls. In addition, glycogen phosphorylase was activated by 56% during hypoglycemia in NIDDM only (P < 0.01). Muscle glucose-6-phosphate concentrations rose during hypoglycemia by a twofold greater increment in NIDDM (P < 0.01). Thus, skeletal muscle participates in hypoglycemia counterregulation in NIDDM, directly by decreased removal of plasma glucose and, indirectly, by providing lactate for hepatic . Consequently, in addition to inherent insulin resistance in NIDDM, the enhanced plasma epinephrine response during hypoglycemia may partially offset impaired glucagon secretion and counteract the effects of hyperinsulinemia on liver, fat, and skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10075057>Impact of exogenous beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on hepatosplanchnic oxygen kinetics and metabolic activity in septic shock.</a></h2><p>To investigate the impact of exogenous beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on splanchnic blood flow, oxygen kinetics, glucose-precursor flux, and liver metabolism in septic shock.Prospective trial.University hospital intensive care unit.Six patients with hyperdynamic (cardiac index >4.0 L/min/) septic shock, all requiring norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure >65 mm Hg.We compared norepinephrine and phenylephrine titrated to achieve similar systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange. Splanchnic hemodynamics, oxygen kinetics, and metabolic parameters were measured before, during, and after replacing norepinephrine with phenylephrine.Splanchnic blood flow and oxygen kinetics were derived from the steady-state indocyanine-green clearance based on hepatic dye extraction and arterial and hepatic venous blood gases. Endogenous glucose production rate was derived from the plasma appearance rate of stable-isotope-labeled glucose using a primed-constant infusion. Splanchnic lactate, alanine (high-performance liquid chromatography) uptake, and hepatic monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) (fluorescence polarization immunoassay) formation rates were calculated from splanchnic blood flow and arterial-hepatic venous concentration differences. Replacing norepinephrine with phenylephrine induced no change in systemic hemodynamics or gas exchange. While splanchnic oxygen consumption and alanine uptake rate remained unaffected, splanchnic blood flow, oxygen delivery, and lactate uptake rate were significantly decreased. Glucose production rate also decreased significantly. A return to norepinephrine restored splanchnic blood flow, oxygen delivery, and lactate uptake rate to baseline values, while glucose production rate remained depressed. Hepatic MEGX formation rate was not influenced during the investigation.Exogenous beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation determines splanchnic blood flow, oxygen delivery, and glucose precursor flux but not splanchnic oxygen utilization in septic shock.  is not directly affiliated to hepatosplanchnic oxygen kinetics. The different response of glucose and MEGX production rates, metabolic pathways of the periportal and perivenous region, may document intrahepatic heterogeneity associated with hepatocellular metabolic compartmentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9442422>Mitochondria, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase isozymes in the aerobic glycolysis of tumor cells.</a></h2><p>At 9 mM glucose, experimental results show that mitochondrial phosphate depletion (induced by glucose phosphorylation, catalyzed by mitochondrial hexokinase) reduces the activities of the respiratory chain, oxidative phosphorylation, and glutaminase. Consequently, the 14C-lactate oxidation to 14CO2 is lowered in the presence of glucose. The fall of ATP level triggers a high aerobic glycolysis by deinhibiting fructose-6-P kinase. NADH, generated by enhanced glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase activity, increases the reducing power. Moreover, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) system is shifted toward lactate formation, while NAD+ is regenerated and the oligomycin-inhibited ATP production is replaced by the iodoacetate-inhibited ATP production. From 14CO2 production and lactate accumulation it is calculated that about 60% of 14C-glucose which disappears is channelled into extraglycolytic reactions. On the contrary, 82% of glucose below l mM is metabolized through non-glycolytic reactions. The pyruvate kinase- (PK-) inhibition does not limit the glycolytic flow from 9 mM glucose, but it may cause sustained .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3532969>Survival from hepatic transplantation. Relationship of protein synthesis to histological abnormalities in patient selection and postoperative management.</a></h2><p>Forty-one patients, all in end stage hepatic failure, underwent 46 liver transplantations with a long-term survival rate of 63%. Six patients died of uncontrollable bleeding due to primary graft malfunction at or immediately after operation. Nine died early or late with overwhelming infection. In addition to clinical assessment, needle liver biopsy, central plasma clearance rate of amino acids (CPCR-AA), and routine "liver function tests" were employed to aid in selection of patients for transplantation and for guidance in postoperative management. Although liver biopsies usually afforded an exact diagnosis, neither they nor the routine liver function tests quantitated the extent to which hepatocyte function was impaired. CPCR-AA, which measures the rate of amino acid uptake by the liver and other central tissues for oxidation, , and protein synthesis was 91 +/- 9 ml//min in the preoperative transplant group. This compares with a value of 97 +/- 16 in a previously studied series of cirrhotics who died following other forms of surgery and a CPCR-AA of 220 +/- 26 ml//min in those who survived. In addition, the preoperative CPCR-AA was found to correlate with the in vitro hepatic protein synthetic rate of slices from the resected recipient liver (r = 0.72, p less than 0.02). After operation, serial hepatic needle biopsies were classified by histology into four grades of injury, ranging from normal liver transplant (Grade I) to mild hypoxic or rejection injury (Grade II), viral hepatitis (Grade III), and severe hypoxic or rejection injury (Grade IV). Significant relationships of the histological grades to ultimate mortality, CPCR-AA, and prothrombin times were found. CPCR-AA and prothrombin time correlate inversely (r = 0.57, p less than 0.001), further demonstrating the relationship of CPCR-AA to protein synthesis of clotting factors. These patterns of posttransplant response were delineated by serial CPCR-AA values. "Early" responders had values over 290 ml//min and all survived. Twelve patients with delayed response were characterized by values of 150 +/- 12, rising to over 200 ml//min after 2 weeks. Two who failed to increase CPCR-AA died. In six "poor" responders, CPCR-AA with Grade IV injury remained below 110 ml//min. All died except for one whose CPCR-AA subsequently rose following retransplantation. It is concluded that percutaneous hepatic needle biopsies and CPCR-AA measurements in combination are of proven value, not only in understanding the nature of injury and functional impairment of the liver, but are also important as guides to selection of patients and for their posttransplant management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10647056>Insulin sensitivity predicts glycemia after a protein load.</a></h2><p>Protein ingestion results in small but distinct changes in plasma glucose and insulin. We hypothesized that the glycemic and/or insulin response to protein might be related to the degree of insulin sensitivity. Our aim was to determine the relationships between insulin sensitivity (assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) and postprandial glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon responses to a 75-g protein meal and a 75-g glucose load. Sixteen lean healthy Caucasian subjects (mean +/- SD age, 25 +/- 6 years; body mass index [BMI], 23.1 +/- 1.7 kg/) participated in the study. After the protein meal, the mean plasma glucose declined gradually below fasting levels to a nadir of -0.36 +/- 0.46 mmol/L from 60 to 120 minutes, showing wide intraindividual variation. Insulin sensitivity (M value) was 1.1 to 3.9 mmol/L/ min in the subjects and correlated inversely with the plasma glucose response to the protein meal (r = -.58, P = .03), ie, the most insulin-sensitive subjects showed the greatest decline in plasma glucose. In contrast, there was no correlation between insulin sensitivity and the insulin or glucagon response to the protein load, or between the M value and the metabolic responses (glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon) to the glucose load. Our study suggests that the net effect of insulin and glucagon secretion on postprandial glucose levels after a protein meal might depend on the individual's degree of insulin sensitivity.  in the liver may be less susceptible to inhibition by insulin in the more highly resistant subjects, thereby counteracting a decline in plasma glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573846>The Antagonist of CXCR1 and CXCR2 Protects db/db mice from Metabolic Diseases through Modulating Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Interleukin-8 (IL-8，also named CXCL8) binds to its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) with subsequent recruitment of neutrophils and enhancement of their infiltration into inflamed sites, which exaggerates inflammation in many diseases. Recent studies have proposed metabolic disorders can be attenuated by counteracting certain inflammatory signal pathways. In this study, we examined whether intervention with G31P, an antagonist of CXCL8, could attenuate tissue inflammation and development of metabolic disorders in db/db mice. The db/m and db/db mice were injected with G31P or equivalent normal saline for six weeks. The physical and metabolic parameters, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid accumulation, and inflammation markers were measured. G31P improved hepatic insulin sensitivity by modulating expression of genes related to  and phosphorylated AKT level. The expressions of several genes encoding proteins involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL) were decreased in G31P-treated db/db mice. Meanwhile, immune cells infiltration and cytokines release were attenuated in db/db mice with G31P treatment. G31P also improved the ratio of pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory  macrophages. Furthermore, G31P ameliorates inflammation-associated metabolic disorders via inhibition of CXCR1 and CXCR2 pathways. These data suggest the selective inhibition of CXC chemokines may have therapeutic effect on inflammation and its related metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8923861>Metabolic effects of metformin on glucose and lactate metabolism in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Metformin is a biguanide that has been shown to effectively lower plasma glucose levels in subjects with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). However, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Studies that have examined the effect of metformin on hepatic glucose production (HGP) and muscle glucose utilization in NIDDM have yielded conflicting results, and little information is available about the action of metformin on lactate turnover and  from lactate in humans. We studied 20 NIDDM subjects and 8 nondiabetic controls in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of 15 weeks of treatment with metformin or placebo on glucose and lactate metabolism. Before and after treatment, all participants received a 7-h infusion of [6-3H]glucose and [3-14C]lactate in combination with indirect calorimetry and estimation of lactate central vein specific activity. A euglycemic insulin clamp (20 mU/.min) was performed during the last 3 h of the tracer infusions. The study design allowed us to evaluate the effects of metformin vs. placebo treatment on glycemic control, plasma lipid profile, HGP, insulin-mediated glucose uptake, oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism, and lactate turnover. Metformin treatment significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (196 +/- 18 vs. 152 +/- 12 mg/dL; P < 0.01), hemoglobin A1 (12.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 9.2 +/- 0.3%; P < 0.01), and plasma triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. When diabetics were compared to nondiabetic controls, basal HGP was higher (12.9 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.8 +/- 1.2 mumol/kg.min; P < 0.01) despite the presence of fasting hyperinsulinemia and insulin-mediated total body glucose disposal (10.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 20.2 +/- 3.3 mumol/kg.min; P < 0.01) was decreased. Metformin significantly reduced fasting HGP (from 12.9 +/- 0.7 to 11.0 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg.min; P < 0.01), but did not enhance total body glucose disposal during insulin stimulation (10.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 11.0 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg.min; P = NS). Neither oxidative nor nonoxidative glucose disposal was improved by metformin treatment. The fasting plasma lactate concentration (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) and lactate turnover (14.0 +/- 0.8 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.6 mumol/kg.min) were significantly increased in diabetics and strongly correlated (r = 0.68; P < 0.001). The percent  derived from lactate was similar in diabetic and control subjects (17 +/- 2% vs. 15 +/- 2%; P = NS), but the estimated rate of  from lactate was increased in the diabetic group (P < 0.01). Despite the significant reduction in HGP after metformin treatment, the percentage of  from lactate and the rate of lactate-derived  were unchanged from baseline. Basal lactate turnover (15.4 +/- 1.4 vs. 14.8 +/- 1.4 mumol/kg.min) and lactate oxidation (7.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.9 mumol/ kg.min) as well as total lactate turnover and lactate oxidation during the insulin clamp were similar before and after metformin treatment. There were no changes in any of the above metabolic parameters in the placebo-treated group. In poorly controlled NIDDM subjects, the primary mechanism by which metformin improves glycemic control is related to the suppression of accelerated basal HGP, and this most likely is secondary to an inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis. Metformin has no effect on the rate of lactate turnover or  from lactate in either the basal or insulin-stimulated states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1936594>No reduction in total hepatic glucose output by inhibition of  with ethanol in NIDDM patients.</a></h2><p>Increased  has been suggested to account for all of the increase in basal glucose production in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). We studied the effect of inhibition of  with ethanol on total hepatic glucose output (HGO) in patients with NIDDM. Fourteen patients with NIDDM (mean +/- SE age 61 +/- 2 yr, fasting plasma glucose 11.4 +/- 0.8 mM; body mass index 27 +/- 1 kg/) were studied twice after an overnight fast, once during ethanol administration (blood ethanol approximately 12 mM) and once during saline administration. Total HGO rate was measured with [3H]glucose. Inhibition of  by ethanol was followed qualitatively with [U-14C]lactate (n = 8) and [U-14C]glycerol (n = 6) as tracers. Ethanol inhibited  from lactate by 71 +/- 5% (0.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.1 mumol glucose.kg-1.min-1, 240-300 min, P less than 0.001; ethanol vs. saline, P less than 0.001) and from glycerol by 65 +/- 6% (0.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.6 mumol glucose.kg.min-1, P less than 0.001). Total HGO rate remained unchanged and averaged 12.8 +/- 1.8 and 11.8 +/- 2.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1 in the saline and ethanol studies, respectively (NS). We concluded that inhibition of  by ethanol does not decrease total HGO in patients with NIDDM.

The infusate also contained 14C-labeled lactate and [3-3H]glucose. Glucose, alanine, glutamate, and glutamine were isolated from liver and blood. There was near complete equilibration of lactate and alanine, and the relative specific activities and relative enrichments were the same in blood and liver. Glucose was cleaved enzymatically to lactate. The compounds were examined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. From the mass isotopomer spectra of the lactate, glutamate, and glutamine and their cleavage fragments the positional isotopomer composition of these compounds was obtained. The enrichment and isotopomer pattern in the lactate from cleaved glucose represents that in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). When [1,2,3-13C]lactate was infused the mass isotopomer spectrum of glutamates consisted only of compounds containing either one, two, or three 13C carbons per molecule (m1, , and m3). There was little 13C in C-4 and C-5 of glutamate. The rate of pyruvate decarboxylation is low, and 3-4% of the acetyl-CoA flux in the Krebs cycle is contributed by lactate carbon. The major isotopomers in lactate, alanine, and PEP were m3 and  with 13C in C-2 and C-3. The predominant isotopomer in PEP from [2,3-13C]lactate was  with 13C in C-2 and C-3. There was much more of m1 isotopomer with 13C in C-3 and C-2 than the m1 isotopomer with 13C in C-1. There was very little m3, the isotopomer with 13C in all three carbons. Most of the 13C in C-3 and C-4 of glucose and C-1 of glutamate was introduced via 13CO2 fixation. From the isotopomer distribution and the rate of glucose turnover we deduced, applying the analysis described in the "Appendix," the absolute rates of gluconeogenic pathways, recycling of PEP and the Cori cycle, and flux in the Krebs cycle. The flux from oxaloacetate (OAA)-->PEP was seven times that of OAA-->citrate, and about half of PEP was recycled to pyruvate via pyruvate kinase. The mass isotopomer patterns in glutamate and glutamine were similar but differed from those of lactate and glucose. It appears that the glutamates are derived from alpha-ketoglutarate from a different Krebs cycle pool than PEP. The flux from OAA to PEP in this pool was two to three times that of OAA to citrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11172474>Quantitative contributions of  to glucose production during fasting in type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Contributions of  to glucose production were determined between 14 to 22 hours into a fast in type 2 diabetics (n = 9) and age-weight-matched controls (n = 7); ages, 60.4 +/- 2.3 versus 55.6 +/- 1.2 years and body mass indices (BMI) 28.6 +/- 2.3 versus 26.6 +/- 0.8 kg/. Production was measured using a primed-continuous [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion and  from 2H enrichment at carbons 2 and 5 of blood glucose on 2H2O ingestion. Plasma glucose concentration declined from 9.6 +/- 0.6 at 14 hours to 7.3 +/- 0.6 at 22 hours in the diabetics (P = .001) and from 5.4 +/- 0.1 to 5.0 +/- 0.1 in the controls (P < .05).

Recently, numerous attempts have been made to treat cancer by targeting one or more gene products involved in this pathway without notable success. This work outlines a transcriptomic approach to identify genes that are highly perturbed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC).We developed a model of the extended Warburg effect and outlined the model using Cytoscape. Following this, gene expression fold changes (FCs) for tumor and adjacent normal tissue from patients with CCRCC (GSE6344) were mapped on to the network. Gene expression values with FCs of greater than two were considered as potential targets for treatment of CCRCC.The Cytoscape network includes glycolysis, , the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the TCA cycle, the serine/glycine pathway, and partial glutaminolysis and fatty acid synthesis pathways. Gene expression FCs for nine of the 10 CCRCC patients in the GSE6344 data set were consistent with a shift to aerobic glycolysis. Genes involved in glycolysis and the synthesis and transport of lactate were over-expressed, as was the gene that codes for the kinase that inhibits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, genes that code for unique proteins involved in  were strongly under-expressed as was also the case for the serine/glycine pathway. These latter two results suggest that the role attributed to the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), frequently the principal isoform of PK present in cancer: i.e. causing a buildup of glucose metabolites that are shunted into branch pathways for synthesis of key biomolecules, may not be operative in CCRCC. The fact that there was no increase in the expression FC of any gene in the PPP is consistent with this hypothesis. Literature protein data generally support the transcriptomic findings.A number of key genes have been identified that could serve as valid targets for anti-cancer pharmaceutical agents. Genes that are highly over-expressed include ENO2, HK2, PFKP, SLC2A3, PDK1, and SLC16A1. Genes that are highly under-expressed include ALDOB, PKLR, PFKFB2, G6PC, PCK1, FBP1, PC, and SUCLG1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17003306>The effect of pioglitazone on the liver: role of adiponectin.</a></h2><p>Diabetic hyperglycemia results from insulin resistance of peripheral tissues and glucose overproduction due to increased  (GNG). Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) improve peripheral insulin sensitivity, but the effect on the liver is less clear. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of TZDs on GNG.Twenty sulfonylurea-treated type 2 diabetic subjects were randomly assigned (double-blind study) to receive pioglitazone (PIO group; 45 mg/day) or placebo (Plc group) for 4 months to assess endogenous glucose production (EGP) (3-(3)H-glucose infusion), GNG (D2O technique), and insulin sensitivity by two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (240 and 960 pmol/min per ).Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (10.0 +/- 0.8 to 7.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/l) and HbA1c (9.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.3 +/- 0.6%) decreased in the PIO and increased in Plc group (P < 0.05 PIO vs. Plc). Insulin sensitivity increased approximately 40% during high insulin clamp after pioglitazone (P < 0.01) and remained unchanged in the Plc group (P < 0.05 PIO vs. Plc). EGP did not change, while GNG decreased in the PIO group (9.6 +/- 0.7 to 8.7 +/- 0.6 micromol x min(-1) x kg(ffm)(-1)) and increased in the Plc group (8.0 +/- 0.5 to 9.6 +/- 0.8) (P < 0.05 PIO vs. Plc). Change in FPG correlated with change in GNG flux (r = 0.63, P < 0.003) and in insulin sensitivity (r = 0.59, P < 0.01). Plasma adiponectin increased after pioglitazone (P < 0.001) and correlated with delta FPG (r = -0.54, P < 0.03), delta GNG flux (r = -0.47, P < 0.05), and delta insulin sensitivity (r = 0.65, P < 0.005). Plasma free fatty acids decreased after pioglitazone and correlated with delta GNG flux (r = 0.54, P < 0.02). From stepwise regression analysis, the strongest determinant of change in FPG was change in GNG flux.Pioglitazone improves FPG, primarily by reducing GNG flux in type 2 diabetic subjects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6588241>Glucose interorgan exchange in chronic renal failure.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms responsible for the altered glucose metabolism observed in chronic renal failure (CRF) were investigated in the postabsorptive state. In 11 patients with CRF and in 15 subjects with normal renal function, the hepato-splanchnic (HS), leg, and brain exchanges of glucose were measured; the HS exchange of gluconeogenic amino acids was also evaluated. Patients with CRF had normal glucose levels, whereas insulin levels and the ratio of insulin to glucose were significantly increased in comparison with controls. In CRF, HS glucose output was slightly lower in comparison with controls (0.46 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.57 +/- 0.04 mmoles/min X 1.73  in controls; P less than 0.1). Arterial levels of alanine and glycine and their uptake by the HS bed were similar in both groups, but in CRF HS serine uptake disappeared, mainly as a consequence of a reduction of its fractional extraction. Conversely, a significant proline extraction became evident, primarily depending on the increased arterial levels of this amino acid. The total HS uptake of potential gluconeogenic amino acids was not different in the two groups, and its ratio to glucose output was increased in CRF (28.0 +/- 4.7 vs. 16.0 +/- 1.9 in controls). In CRF, the arterial-femoral venous differences of glucose were significantly reduced (0.11 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.04 mmoles/liter in controls), as was the fractional extraction of glucose in the leg. Finally, in CRF both glucose uptake and its fractional extraction by the brain were unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17160914>The sibutramine metabolite  improves muscle glucose uptake and reduces hepatic glucose output: preliminary data.</a></h2><p>The satiety agent sibutramine acts in part through a primary amine metabolite, .

Compared with controls (who received vehicle only),  (10 mg/kg) decreased basal plasma glucose concentrations, with a maximal decrease of about 25% at 48 hours (p < 0.05). Soleus muscles were isolated from the mice at intervals: insulin-mediated glucose uptake by the muscles from controls progressively decreased over 24 hours whereas uptake was maintained by muscles from -treated mice. Hepatic  was reduced about 40% by liver snips isolated from -treated mice after 24 hours (p < 0.05).

Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent that increases peripheral insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic , and decreases intestinal glucose absorption.Thirty-one patients (24 women, 7 men; mean age, 61.8 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 28.0 kg/) were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, 2-way, crossover, placebo-controlled study. Patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated previously with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents and who had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level >9% or a fasting blood glucose level >8 mmol/L were included. Patients who were being treated with oral agents were switched to insulin therapy and required to maintain stable blood glucose control for 2 months prior to randomization. Patients received insulin plus either metformin 1,700 mg/d or placebo for 5 months, followed by a 2-month washout period, and were then crossed over to the other treatment arm for 5 months of additional treatment (total treatment period: 12 months).Thirty patients completed the study; 1 patient withdrew early because of hypoglycemia. Compared with placebo, metformin produced significant reductions from overall baseline in mean daily insulin dose requirement (-8.69 units (17.2%], P < 0.001), HbA1c level (-0.74 [9.9%], P = 0.005), serum fructosamine level (-44.40 micromol/L, P = 0.026), 24-hour blood glucose profile (P = 0.008), and total cholesterol level (-0.42 mmol/L, P = 0.005). No treatment effects were observed on body weight, blood pressure, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, or serum triglyceride levels. There was no correlation between BMI and reduction in HbA1C. No major side effects were reported.Combination therapy with metformin and insulin improves glycemic control and reduces insulin requirements. with no major side effects, in patients with type 2 diabetes and may improve the risk profile in this patient population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7642173>Long-term effect of octreotide in acromegaly on insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>An important feature of acromegaly is a reduced action of insulin on hepatic  and peripheral glucosal disposal. Octreotide (SMS) exerts complex effects on hormonal and metabolic regulations affecting glucose homeostasis. Eight patients with active acromegaly despite surgical intervention (age 44.8 +/- 3.5 years, BMI 27.3 +/- 1.6 kg/, lean body mass (LBM) 70 +/- 3.2%, blood glucose 5.24 +/- 0.26 mmol/l, HbA1c < or = 6.5%) were investigated before and after 6 months of treatment with SMS in an open trial. SMS was injected sc. at a dosage between 100-200 micrograms t.i.d. Mean GH and IGF1 levels during SMS therapy were significantly reduced (GH 9.6 +/- 1.9 ng/ml vs. 4.9 +/- 1.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05; IGF1 729.5 +/- 84 ng/ml vs. 415 +/- 49 ng/ml, p < 0.05). OGTT and euglycaemic-clamp-studies were performed before and after 6 months of SMS treatment. The glucosal disposal rate on average (insulin infusion rate 40 mU//min) was not significantly changed following SMS treatment (McLBM before 3.60 +/- 0.38, after 3.95 +/- 0.41 mg/kg LBM/min). There was a positive correlation (r = 0.620) between the individual change of IGF1 and the change of McLBM. Additionally there was no significant difference of serum basal insulin levels (0.19 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.06 nmol/l) as well as basal C-peptide levels (0.79 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.04 nmol/l) before and with SMS treatment.

Mean overnight serum free fatty acid concentrations averaged 242 +/- 8 microM after acipimox and 721 +/- 30 microM after placebo (P < 0.001).

The rate of infusion was adapted to the height of the central venous pressure and the administration of electrolytes to their serum concentration. Insulin was withheld until no further decrease of blood glucose was noted. Group A consisted of 8 pts with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (blood glucose higher than 25 mmol/l, pH below 7.0 and/or bicarbonate below 10 mmol/l). The duration of insulinfree rehydration was 8.8 +/- 1.3 (x +/- SE) hrs and the fluid retention 4060 +/- 3 633 ml. The osmolality in serum decreased from 356 +/- 12 to 340 +/- 8 mosm/kg H2O and the blood glucose from 37.9 +/- 2.9 to 28.6 +/- 3.4 mmol/l. No correlation existed between the decrease of blood glucose and the expansion of the intravascular volume. Therefore, the decrease of blood glucose was not caused by a simple dilution effect. High renal glucose excreation was observed (408 +/- 83 mmol) but could not explain the decrease of blood glucose. The glucose clearance fell from 25.9 +/- 6.9 to 21.5 +/- 3.8 ml/min/1.73  body surface from the first to the last 2-hr periods. It must be concluded that the initial rehydration deminished gluconeogeneses and/or increased tissue glucose utilization without exogenous insulin administration. This conclusion is supported by the decrease in the plasma concentration of the contrainsular hormons. Glucagon decreased 579 +/- 209 to 319 +/- 88 pg/ml (n.s.). Cortisol from 49.9 +/- 4.6 to 35.8 +/- 6.7 micrograms/100 ml (p < 0.05) and Adrenalin from 2.43 +/- 1.03 to 0.4 +/- 0.22 ng/ml (p < 0.05). Blood gas analysis revealed only minimal and ketobodies in serum no changes. Therefore, it can be concluded that rehydration and decrease of plasma concentration of contrainsular hormones do not influence the enhenced lipolyses in diabetic ketoacidosis. Group B consisted of 8 pts with nonacidotic diabetic derangements (blood glucose higher than 25 mmol/l, pH above 7.3 and/or bicarbonate above 18 mmol/l) and an acute weightloss of more than 3 kg. The insulinfree rehydration lasted 13 +/- 1.6 hrs and the fluid retention was 4620 +/- 380 ml. The serum osmolality decreased from 317 +/- 5.3 to 288 +/- 1.9 mmol/l. The decrease of blood glucose could not be explained by delution effect. The renal glucose excreation was 370 +/- 120 mmol/l in total and the glucose clearance decreased from 15.3 +/- 8.4 to 8.0 +/- 2.8 ml/min/1.73  body surface (p < 0.01). Decrease of gluconeogenese and/or increase of glucose assimilation of the tissues can also be expected for the pts with nonacidotic diabetic derangements during plain rehydration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099811>Increased body mass index after kidney transplantation in activating transcription factor 6 single polymorphism gene carriers.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) and of metabolic disorders.

Tacrolimus may induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic beta cells. Since studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ATF6 are associated with type 2 diabetes, we sought to determine whether their mutations were associated with NODAT among renal transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus.We genotyped 269 renal transplant recipients using TaqMan assays for allelic discrimination for 6 ATF6 gene polymorphisms: rs10918215, rs7514053, rs1058405, rs4479731, rs2340721, and rs13401. All patients received an immunosuppressive regimen including tacrolimus. We analyzed all previously known risk factors for NODAT.We could not confirm are association between ATF6 SNP and NODAT. We observed a significant association between ATF6 SNP rs2340721 and increased body weight and body mass index (BMI) both upon univariate and multivariate analyses. The average BMI was higher among patients with 2 mutant SNP2 (rs2340721) alleles (CC) than those with 2 wild-type alleles (AA): 23.8 ± 3.7 versus 25.5 ± 4.4 kg/ (P = .02). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) for BMI associated with the CC genotype was 2.43 (1.16-5.09; P = .02).ATF6 polymorphisms were not associated with NODAT among our population of renal transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus. However, these data underscore the role of ATF6 and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the regulation of metabolic flux among patients treated with tacrolimus, suggesting that inherited disturbances of endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling could predispose people to obesity.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the present study investigated the role of miR-99a in macrophage phenotype activation and adipose tissue inflammation.  BMDMs showed a significant increase in miR-99a expression when compared to the M0 and M1 phenotypes. Phenotype-switching experiments established an association between upregulated miR-99a expression and the  phenotype. Overexpression of miR-99a prevented M1 phenotype activation and attenuated bactericidal activity. Likewise, knockdown of miR-99a abolished  phenotype activation. By means of in silico target prediction tools and a luciferase reporter assay, TNFα was identified as a direct target of miR-99a. Knockdown of TNFα recapitulated the effect of miR-99a overexpression in M1 BMDMs. In a db/db mice model, miR-99a expression was reduced in eWAT and F4/80 ATMs. Systemic overexpression of miR-99a in db/db mice attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy with increased CD301 and reduced CD86 immunostaining. Flow cytometry analysis also showed an increased  and a reduced M1 macrophage population. Mimics of miR-99a also improved the diabetic dyslipidemia and insulin signaling in eWAT and liver, with an attenuated expression of  and cholesterol metabolism genes in the liver. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of miR-99a-overexpressing macrophages in the db/db mice recapitulated in vivo miR-99a mimic effects with increased  and reduced M1 macrophage populations and improved systemic glucose, insulin sensitivity, and insulin signaling in the eWAT and liver. The present study demonstrates that miR-99a mimics can regulate macrophage M1 phenotype activation by targeting TNFα. miR-99a therapeutics in diabetic mice reduces the adipose tissue inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/215501>Increase of the gluconeogenic and decrease of the glycolytic capacity of rat liver with a change of the metabolic zonation after partial hepatectomy.</a></h2><p>During the first 72 h after 67% partial hepatectomy of female Wistar rats (160 g) the specific activities [mumol X min-1 X (g liver)-1] of the glucogenic glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-bisphosphatase and of the glycolytic hexokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase remained essentially constant.

Between 10 and 40 h after partial hepatectomy, when the proliferation started in the periportal area, a shift of the glucogenic glucose-6-phosphatase-rich zone from its normal periportal to an intermediate or even perivenous position was observed histochemically. After 48 h, when the proliferation was no longer restricted to the periportal zone, the normal glucose-6-phosphatase zonation (as before partial hepatectomy) was restored. Glycogen was degraded rapidly during the first 4 h after operation; it was later repeatedly resynthesized and degraded in correlation with the feeding rhythm of the animals.

A metabolic pathway may switch to another pathway in accordance with the current state of parameters in both normal and cancer cells. Here, most of the parameter values are unknown to us. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been developed here for the purpose of modeling metabolic networks by approximating the reasons for the behaviour of a system and applying expert knowledge to track switching between metabolic pathways. The simulation results can track the switching between glycolysis and , as well as glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP) in normal cells. Unlike normal cells, pyruvate kinase ( isoform) (PKM2) switches alternatively between its two oligomeric forms, i.e. an active tetramer and a relatively low activity dimer, in cancer cells. Besides, there is a coordination among PKM2 switching and enzymes catalyzing PPP. These phenomena help cancer cells to maintain their high energy demand and macromolecular synthesis. However, the reduction of initial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a very low concentration, decreasing initial glucose uptake, destroying coordination between glycolysis and PPP, and replacement of PKM2 by its relatively inactive oligomeric form (dimer) or inhibition of the translation of PKM2 may destabilize the mutated control mechanism of the mammalian central carbon metabolic (CCM) pathway in cancer cells.

Candida albicans is the most important opportunistic fungus in nosocomial infections, and it is contended by neutrophils and macrophages during the first steps of the invasive infection. Murine macrophages responses to C. albicans have been widely studied, whereas the responses of human-polarized macrophages remain less characterized. In this study, we have characterized the proteomic differences between human M1- and -polarized macrophages, both in basal conditions and in response to C. albicans, by quantitative proteomics (2DE). This proteomic approach allowed us to identify metabolic routes and cytoskeletal rearrangement components that are the most relevant differences between M1 and  macrophages. The analysis has revealed fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1, a critical enzyme in , up-regulated in M1, as a novel protein marker for macrophage polarization. Regarding the response to C. albicans, an M1-to- switch in polarization was observed. This M1-to- switch might contribute to Candida pathogenicity by decreasing the generation of specific immune responses, thus enhancing fungal survival and colonization, or instead, may be part of the host attempt to reduce the inflammation and limit the damage of the infection.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this paper, a comparison is made of basal glucose production (3H-6 glucose), insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in vivo (hyperglycemic clamp) and in vitro (binding to circulating monocytes) in 24 patients with recently diagnosed type II diabetes, matched for age and fasting glycemia and divided into non-obese (14 subjects) and moderately obese (10 subjects), and in 9 non-obese controls. The non-obese diabetics were slightly hyperinsulinemic during fasting (10.8 +/- 1.0 vs 4.8 +/- 0.8 microU/ml in controls, p less than 0.0005), with a significant reduction in early and late insulin secretion (14.0 +/- 1.5 vs 20.8 +/- 2.0 microU/ml, p less than 0.01 and 24.8 +/- 3.3 vs 34.7 +/- 2.14 microU/ml, p less than 0.025). The insulin sensitivity index MCR/I was significantly reduced (2.30 +/- 0.32 vs 4.14 +/- 0.40, p less than 0.005). Endogenous glucose production was significantly increased (107 +/- 10.2 vs 84 +/- 3.7 mg/ per min, p less than 0.025) and displayed a positive correlation with fasting glycemia (r = 0.51, p less than 0.05). Insulin binding to monocytes was significantly lower than in controls (2.36 +/- 0.22% vs 4.06 +/- 0.32%, p less than 0.0005). Moderately obese diabetics also were significantly hyperinsulinemic in the fasting state (18.1 +/- 2.8 microU/ml, p less than 0.0005 vs controls) but, typically, lacked the early secretory phase (20.6 +/- 3.6 microU/ml vs baseline, n.s.). A similar increase of hepatic glucose production (107 +/- 11.2 mg/ per min, p less than 0.025 vs controls, n.s. vs non-obese diabetics) and decrease of peripheral sensitivity to insulin (MCR/I = 1.78 +/- 0.31, p less than 0.0005 vs controls, n.s. vs non-obese diabetics) was found in moderately obese diabetics, as well as a significant reduction of insulin binding to insulated monocytes (2.62 +/- 0.4% p less than 0.01 vs controls, n.s. vs non-obese diabetics). These results confirm that common defects of both non-obese and moderately obese type II diabetics are: lack of early phase of glucose induced insulin secretion, increase in hepatic glucose production and decrease of peripheral insulin sensitivity together with reduction of insulin binding to circulating monocytes. The hypothesis of a unique defect as a cause of hyperglycemia in type II diabetes in early clinical phase is not borne out by the results of this study. Moderate obesity, even if able to reduce insulin sensitivity, seems to be less important in determining hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2660587>Insulin inhibition of overnight glucose production and  from lactate in NIDDM.</a></h2><p>Increased  contributes to fasting hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

Seven patients with NIDDM (age 51 +/- 4 yr, body mass index 28 +/- 2 kg/) were studied before and 3 wk after achieving normoglycemia with evening insulin therapy. Basal glucose production (Ra) and utilization were measured overnight [( 3-3H]glucose infusion from 9 P.M. to 8 A.M.) and lactate turnover and conversion to glucose between 4 and 8 A.M. [( U-14C]lactate infusion) before and after insulin therapy. During insulin therapy, fasting plasma glucose decreased from 188 +/- 13 to 99 +/- 7 mg/dl (P less than 0.001) due to inhibition of glucose Ra from 3.0 +/- 0.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.005). Plasma free insulin increased from 6 +/- 1 to 11 +/- 1 microU/ml (P less than 0.005). Plasma lactate concentrations (1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l before vs. after insulin therapy) and the lactate turnover rate (15.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 14.2 +/- 0.8 mumol.kg.min) remained unchanged, whereas the amount of glucose formed from lactate decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.4 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.02) and the percent of lactate turnover converted to glucose decreased from 26 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 2% (P less than 0.05).

During starvation, a reduction in hepatic glycogen stores was demonstrated by the absence of a rise in plasma glucose and glucose production (using [3-3H]glucose) in response to glucagon infusion. The increases in plasma epinephrine and glucose during the epinephrine infusion were comparable before and after starvation. Most importantly, the increase in endogenous glucose production produced by epinephrine was virtually unaffected, i.e. the initial rise in glucose production (59% vs. 49%), the incremental area under the curve (2.6 vs. 3.1 g/), and the spike-decline pattern of the response were no different before and after starvation, respectively. Similarly, epinephrine-induced elevations in gluconeogenic precursors (lactate and alanine) were not altered by starvation. However, starvation accentuated the rise in FFA by 200%. We conclude that starvation does not diminish the rise in endogenous glucose production in response to stress-like elevations of epinephrine. This occurs even though the liver fails to respond to high physiological doses of glucagon, possibly because epinephrine enhances the mobilization of gluconeogenic precursors and FFA. These data suggest that epinephrine is a potent stimulator of  and may be more effective than glucagon in accelerating glucose production in patients with depleted glycogen stores.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903651>T Cells Encountering Myeloid Cells Programmed for Amino Acid-dependent Immunosuppression Use Rictor/mTORC2 Protein for Proliferative Checkpoint Decisions.</a></h2><p>Modulation of T cell proliferation and function by immunoregulatory myeloid cells are an essential means of preventing self-reactivity and restoring tissue homeostasis. Consumption of amino acids such as arginine and tryptophan by immunoregulatory macrophages is one pathway that suppresses local T cell proliferation. Using a reduced complexity in vitro macrophage-T cell co-culture system, we show that macrophage arginase-1 is the only factor required by  macrophages to block T cells in G, and this effect is mediated by l-arginine elimination rather than metabolite generation. Tracking how T cells adjust their metabolism when deprived of arginine revealed the significance of macrophage-mediated arginine deprivation to T cells. We found mTORC1 activity was unaffected in the initial G block. After 2 days of arginine deprivation, mTORC1 activity declined paralleling a selective down-regulation of SREBP target gene expression, whereas mRNAs involved in glycolysis, , and T cell activation were unaffected. Cell cycle arrest was reversible at any point by exogenous arginine, suggesting starved T cells remain poised awaiting nutrients. Arginine deprivation-induced cell cycle arrest was mediated in part by Rictor/mTORC2, providing evidence that this nutrient recognition pathway is a central component of how T cells measure environmental arginine.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929538>[The effect of metformin on fasting and postprandial insulin secretion in obese patients with diabetes mellitus type 2].</a></h2><p>The main causes of reduced glucose levels during metformin therapy appear to be an increase in insulin action in peripheral tissues and reduced hepatic glucose output due to inhibition .The purpose of the study was to establish the effect of metformin on fasting and postprandial insulin secretion.The study carried out was double blind, controlled, comparative, randomized, multicentric, including two groups of out-patient department (OPD) patients. 43 patients were administered metformin (Tefor ICN Canada), and 46 patients were given placebo. Patients enrolled in the study were newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, glycaemia < 12 mmol/l, and had the Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/. Before treatment, blood biochemistry was done: fasting and postprandial glycaemia, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) value, fasting and postprandial insulinaemia, blood lipids (total cholesterol, total triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol), and gamma glutaryl transferase (GGT) level. BMI was also established. After 42 days of treatment, fasting and postprandial insulinaemia were tested again. Analysis of the effects of therapy, and identification of co-variants for fasting and postprandial insulinaemia, were done by ANOVA two way and ANCOVA method.It was shown that metformin accompanied by diet, as compared to placebo accompanied by diet, lowered the fasting insulinaemia value during six weeks of therapy in obese patients with DM type 2 (24.392 mU/l vs. 25.667 mU/l), interacting both with BMI pre-therapy, and interacting with fasting insulinaemia pre-therapy (p < 0.001). A significant effect of the interaction of covariants BMI and GGT was defined. As for the effect of therapy on postprandial insulinaemia, it was found that there was a high statistical significance of the effect of BMI interacting with initial values for postprandial insulinaemia before therapy, and interacting with therapy (p < 0.01). Adjusted mean values for postprandial insulinaemia after therapy in the placebo group were lower as compared to the metformin group (44.807 mU/l vs. 47.114 mU/l).It can be concluded that, as compared to place- bo, metformin is more efficient in reducing insulin resistance in obese patients with DM type 2. In addition, as compared to placebo, metformin maintains more efficient productive insulin secretion, indicating that metformin protects the pancreas from beta cell depletion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510756>Glucose homeostasis, obesity and diabetes.</a></h2><p>Plasma glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range in normal individuals. Both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent processes contribute to fasting and postprandial plasma glucose regulation. The brain and nervous system are insulin independent. Muscle and adipose tissue are responsive to insulin and can use either glucose or ketones and free fatty acids as their primary metabolic fuel. The essential components of metabolic syndrome are obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, lipid disturbances, and hypertension. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases exponentially as body mass index increases above about 25 kg/. The links between obesity and type 2 diabetes include proinflammatory cytokines, insulin resistance, deranged fatty acid metabolism, and cellular processes. Modest weight reduction can improve glycaemic control and reduce diabetes risk. Obesity also leads to hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance, with a progressive decrease in insulin secretory function. Ageing is another important risk factor for metabolic disorders, including obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aims to assess the role of metformin in lactate production in a group of diabetic patients with GFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2undergoing coronary angiography.In the present randomized clinical trial, 162 metformin-treated diabetic patients were enrolled. The enlisted patients were scheduled to undergo coronary angiography at Modarres Hospital from Feb 2012 to Nov 2012. Patients were randomly allocated to continue metformin during peri-angiography period (M (+) group) or to stop the medication 24 hours prior the procedure (M (-) group). All the patients had glomerular filtration rate of >60 mL/min per 1.73 . Iodixanol was the only contrast media which in all patients. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) was defined as an arterial pH <7.35 and plasma lactate concentration >5 mmol⁄L.162 patients, including79 (48.7%) male and 83 (51.3%) female patients were enrolled in the study. The average of GFR was comparable in both groups (76 ml/min per 1.73  in the M (+) group versus 79 ml/min per 1.73  in the M (-) group, p=0.53). No significant difference was observed in the mean dose of metformin before the study between the 2 groups (2.18 tablets per day in M (+) group vs. 2.21 tablets per day in M(-) group, p=0.62).No lactic acidosis was observed in the studied groups.In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that metformin continuation in diabetic patients with a GFR of more than 60 ml/min per 1.73  undergoing coronary angiography does not enhance the risk of MALA development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9800330>Mitochondrial PEPCK: a highly polymorphic gene with alleles co-selected with Marek's disease resistance in chickens.</a></h2><p>The gene coding for the mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M), a pivotal component in  from lactate via the Cori cycle, was highly polymorphic in strains of egg-type chickens (White Leghorn) of different origins. Based on MspI restriction fragment polymorphisms a total of seven alleles could be distinguished. The allele frequencies were determined in six pairs of strains derived from different genetic base populations. Each pair consisted of two strains which differed in their susceptibility to Marek's disease (MD), a virus-induced neoplastic disease. The frequency of the most common haplotype () was consistently higher in the susceptible strains than in the corresponding resistant strains (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test), indicating that the observed differences were not due to random genetic drift. This result suggests that PEPCK-M may be a candidate gene which contains genetic variants affecting MD susceptibility.

However, there have also been suggestions that their insulin resistance may relate to obesity and android fat distribution. To assess whether PCOS induces metabolic disturbances independently of obesity, we studied seven lean patients with PCOS (age, 27.1 +/- 2.0 yr; body mass index, 22.2 +/- 0.78 kg/; waist/hip ratio, 0.79 +/- 0.02; fat-free mass, 46.38 +/- 1.13 kg) and seven normal women (age, 25.7 +/- 1.4 yr; body mass index, 21.3 +/- 0.69 kg/; waist/hip ratio, 0.74 +/- 0.02; fat-free mass, 50.1 +/- 1.51 kg) for 3 h in the basal period and 2 h during a hyperinsulinemic (0.4 mU/kg.min) euglycemic clamp. In the basal state, comparable metabolic indices were recorded: serum insulin, 35.9 +/- 7.7 (PCOS) vs. 37.3 +/- 2.87 pmol/L (controls); plasma C-peptide, 364.1 +/- 66.2 vs. 397.2 +/- 66.2 pmol/L; plasma glucose, 4.95 +/- 0.09 vs. 4.77 +/- 0.09 mmol/L; forearm arterio-venous difference in glucose, 0.17 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.07 mmol/L; isotopically determined endogenous glucose production, 1.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 mg/kg.min; and serum nonesterified fatty acids, 545 +/- 40 vs. 617 +/- 54 mumol/L (all P > 0.05). During the clamp, all recordings were again similar: serum insulin, 282.7 +/- 21.5 vs. 270.5 +/- 13.6 pmol/L; plasma C-peptide, 331.0 +/- 33.1 vs. 364.1 +/- 66.2 pmol/L; plasma glucose, 4.99 +/- 0.07 vs. 4.99 +/- 0.05 mmol/L; glucose arterio-venous difference, 1.01 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.12 mmol/L; endogenous glucose production, -0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. -0.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg.min; amount of exogenous glucose necessary to maintain euglycemia, 4.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.5 mg/kg.min; and nonesterified fatty acids, 205 +/- 7 vs. 246 +/- 18 mumol/L (all P > 0.05). By showing normal basal and insulin-stimulated substrate metabolism in lean hyperandrogenemic PCOS patients, these data suggest that insulin resistance may be an epiphenomenon, rather than a primary feature of PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7860750>Insulin secretion, insulin action, and hepatic glucose production in identical twins discordant for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>12 identical twin pairs discordant for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were studied for insulin sensitivity (euglycemic insulin clamp, 40 mU/ per min), hepatic glucose production (HGP, [3-3H]glucose infusion), and insulin secretion (oral glucose tolerance test and hyperglycemic [12 mM] clamp, including glucagon administration). Five of the nondiabetic twins had normal and seven had impaired glucose tolerance. 13 matched, healthy subjects without a family history of diabetes were included as control subjects. The NIDDM twins were more obese compared with their non-diabetic co-twins. The nondiabetic twins were insulin resistant and had a delayed insulin and C-peptide response during oral glucose tolerance tests compared with controls. Furthermore, the nondiabetic twins had a decreased first-phase insulin response and a decreased maximal insulin secretion capacity during hyperglycemic clamping and intravenous glucagon administration. Nondiabetic twins and controls had similar rates of HGP. Compared with both nondiabetic twins and controls, the NIDDM twins had an elevated basal rate of HGP, a further decreased insulin sensitivity, and a further impaired insulin secretion pattern as determined by all tests. In conclusion, defects of both in vivo insulin secretion and insulin action are present in non- and possibly prediabetic twins who possess the necessary NIDDM susceptibility genes. However, all defects of both insulin secretion and glucose metabolism are expressed quantitatively more severely in their identical co-twins with overt NIDDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/595501>[Effect of Ca2+ ions on the pyruvate kinase isoenzymes from rabbit kidney cortex].</a></h2><p>Ca2 ions showed the various effect on isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase from rabbit kidney cortex.

In presence of Ca2+ the activating effect of PDP on "L" and "" types of pyruvate kinase was absent; the inhibitory action of ATP on the "M" type of pyruvate kinase was increased at all the concentrations above 1.3 mM.

The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of nutrient supply and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge on hepatic intermediate metabolism of early- and mid-lactation cows by employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with stable isotope tracer. Twelve multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in early (n = 6; 12 ± 4.2 d in milk) and mid (n = 6; 115 ± 13.5 d in milk) lactation were used for this study. Liver biopsies were performed on all cows. Liver slices (40-60 mg) were incubated in a 37°C water bath for 2 h with either control (phosphate buffered saline), pyruvate (PYR; 1mM unlabeled pyruvate and 1mM [(13)C3]pyruvate), pyruvate + propionate (PYR+PRO; 1mM unlabeled pyruvate, 1mM [(13)C3]pyruvate, and 2mM sodium propionate), or pyruvate + AA (PYR+AA; 1mM unlabeled pyruvate, 1mM [(13)C3]pyruvate, and 2mM AA solution), and LPS (0.0 or 0.2 μg/mL) was added to flasks per treatment. Enrichment of isotopomers in metabolic equilibrium with Krebs cycle intermediates was assessed. Pyruvate fluxes and the enzymatic activity of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) versus pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were calculated. Media were analyzed for concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glucose, and haptoglobin. Data were analyzed as randomized block (stage of lactation) design in a factorial arrangement of nutrient treatments by LPS dose. Challenge with LPS increased the mRNA abundance of TNF-α, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A 2, and the concentration of TNF-α in media. Challenge with LPS increased mRNA abundance of PC but reduced the enrichment of (13)C1[M1] and (13)C2[]alanine and tended to reduce the enzymatic activity of PEPCK. Incubation with PYR+PRO and PYR+AA increased the flux of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. However, only PYR+PRO increased the enzymatic activity of PEPCK and PDH versus PC and decreased the mRNA abundance of PC. Cows in early lactation tended to receive a greater contribution of pyruvate to the oxaloacetate flux via the lower PDH versus PC activity and a higher mRNA abundance of PC than cows in mid lactation. Our results suggest that regardless of stage of lactation and nutrient supplement, hepatic  was impaired during inflammation. Further research examining how various nutrients support liver function and improve the immunometabolic response of liver during inflammation is warranted.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

When 5 U of insulin/hr were added to the infusate, arterial insulin levels rose significantly from 39.7 +/- 4.1 microU/ml to approximately the pretrauma levels (74.6 +/- 7.7 microU/ml). Despite this normalization of insulin levels, excretion of nitrogen and 3-methylhistidine and the efflux of amino acids from forearm muscle fell but did not return to pretraumatic levels, suggesting some insulin resistance. Visceral  from amino acids appeared to decrease, since insulin infusion decreased the efflux of alanine from skeletal muscle with no change in its arterial level. Insulin also significantly reduced the efflux of isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, glutamine, and total amino acid nitrogen from forearm muscle. These findings, along with the partial reduction in the excretion of 3-methylhistidine and nitrogen, suggest that insulin, in combination with infused calories and protein, decreases the loss of muscle protein after trauma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1517368>Lipolysis and  from glycerol are increased in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The rate of lipolysis (glycerol Ra),  from glycerol, and its contribution to overall hepatic glucose production (glucose Ra) were determined in 10 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) [body mass index (BMI) 27.2 +/- 1.0 kg/, fasting plasma glucose 10.3 +/- 1.2 mmol/L], and in 6 matched control subjects (BMI 27.3 +/- 1.1 kg/, fasting plasma glucose 5.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/L) using infusions of [3-3H]glucose (0-600 min) and [U-14C]glycerol (360-600 min). Glycerol Ra was increased in the patients with NIDDM (120 +/- 16 mumol/.min) compared to the normal subjects (84 +/- 9 mumol/.min, P less than 0.05).  from glycerol was 1.7-fold higher in the patients (96 +/- 16 mumol/.min) than in the normal subjects (56 +/- 10 mumol/.min, P less than 0.05), and explained 9 +/- 1% and 7 +/- 1% (NS) of total glucose Ra in patients with NIDDM and normal subjects, respectively. To determine whether these abnormalities are more pronounced in overweight patients with NIDDM, glucose and glycerol Ra were also determined in 5 obese patients with NIDDM (BMI 36.4 +/- 1.0 kg/, fasting plasma glucose 11.3 +/- 1.3 mmol/L). Glycerol Ra (154 +/- 26 mumol/.min) was again higher than in the normal subjects (P less than 0.05) but not different from that in the less obese patients with NIDDM. The rate of  from glycerol (159 +/- 20 mumol/.min) was significantly higher in the obese than in the less obese patients with NIDDM (P less than 0.05) but its contribution to total glucose Ra (10 +/- 1%) was similar to that in the less obese patients with NIDDM. When all data were analyzed together,  from glycerol (r = 0.57, P less than 0.01) but not lipolysis (r = 0.02, NS) correlated with the percentage of lipolysis diverted toward  suggesting that the rate of  from glycerol is regulated by intrahepatic mechanisms rather than by glycerol availability. Neither the rate of lipolysis nor the rate of glycerol  correlated with BMI, serum triglyceride, or insulin concentrations. We conclude that  from glycerol is increased in patients with NIDDM. This increase appears to be the consequence of both accelerated lipolysis and increased intrahepatic conversion of glycerol to glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3004599>Localization and role of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and pyruvate recycling in rat kidney cortex.</a></h2><p>This work was performed to gain more information on the role of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes in the regulation of renal carbohydrate metabolism. Immunohistochemically, pyruvate kinase type L is shown to be localized in the proximal tubule of the nephron and pyruvate kinase type  in the distal tubule and the collecting duct. a tight relationship between  and pyruvate recycling was found. The rate of  (8 mumol/g wet wt. per 30 min) was of the same order of magnitude as the rate of pyruvate recycling (10.92 mumol/g wet wt. per 30 min). Stimulation of  from 20 mM lactate in kidney cortex slices of 24-h-starved rats by dibutyryl-cAMP, alanine and parathyroid hormone was connected with a decrease in pyruvate recycling; inhibition of  due to a lack of Ca2+ in the incubation medium was linked with an increase in pyruvate recycling. The degradation of [6-14C]glucose to lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies and CO2 and of [2-14C]lactate was unaffected by dibutyryl-cAMP, alanine, epinephrine, vasopressin or the omission of Ca2+ from the incubation medium. 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP or 5 mM alanine did not alter the activities of oxaloacetate decarboxylase, 'malic' enzyme and malate dehydrogenase from rat kidney cortex. Since aerobic glycolysis in the distal tubules and the collecting ducts is not influenced by hormones, dibutyryl-cAMP and Ca2+, pyruvate kinase type  residing in this tissue is unlikely to be a control point of glycolysis. Since this tissue degrades only one-seventh of the glucose formed via , it does not contribute significantly to pyruvate recycling. Therefore, the decrease of pyruvate recycling in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP and alanine in rat kidney cortex slices, leading to increased renal , has to be ascribed to the regulation of pyruvate kinase type L.</p></html>
