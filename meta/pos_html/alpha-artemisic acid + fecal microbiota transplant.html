Studies of    (FMT) and antibiotics on neonatal pig mainly focused on intestinal development and mucosal immunity, but the information on metabolism is lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate the responses of metabolome and transcriptome in the livers of neonatal piglets that were orally inoculated with maternal  bacteria suspension and amoxicillin (AM) solution. Five litters of Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire neonatal piglets were used as five replicates and nine piglets in each litter were randomly assigned to the control (CO), AM or FMT groups. Neonatal piglets in three groups were fed with 3 mL saline (0.9%), AM solution (6.94 mg/mL) or  bacteria suspension (>10/mL), respectively, on days 1-6. At the age of 7 and 21 days, one piglet from each group in each litter was sacrificed, and the serum and liver were collected for analysis. The RNA sequencing analysis showed that the mRNA expressions of  () () () () and  () were downregulated ( < ) by AM on day 7, and that the mRNA expressions of  () and  were downregulated () by FMT on day 7. GC-MS analysis showed that AM and FMT treatments mainly affected fatty  metabolism and amino  metabolism on days 7 and 21. AM and FMT both reduced () the blood levels of triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on day 7. AM reduced ) the blood level of cholesterol on day 21, and FMT reduced the blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-C on day 21. These results indicate that early intervention with FMT or AM can reduce fatty  oxidative catabolism and amino  biosynthesis of neonatal piglets, which provides a reference for regulation host metabolism through early intervention in animal production and even human health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816855>Microbial bile salt hydrolases mediate the efficacy of faecal   in the treatment of recurrent  infection.</a></h2><p>Faecal   (FMT) effectively treats recurrent  infection (rCDI), but its mechanisms of action remain poorly defined. Certain bile  affect  germination or vegetative growth. We hypothesised that loss of gut -derived bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) predisposes to CDI by perturbing gut bile metabolism, and that BSH restitution is a key mediator of FMT's efficacy in treating the condition.Using stool collected from patients and donors pre-FMT/post-FMT for rCDI, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing, ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) bile  profiling, BSH activity measurement, and qPCR of /CD genes involved in bile metabolism. Human data were validated in  batch cultures and a C57BL/6 mouse model of rCDI.From metataxonomics, pre-FMT stool demonstrated a reduced proportion of BSH-producing bacterial species compared with donors/post-FMT. Pre-FMT stool was enriched in taurocholic  (TCA, a potent  germinant); TCA levels negatively correlated with key bacterial genera containing BSH-producing organisms. Post-FMT samples demonstrated recovered BSH activity and /CD gene copy number compared with pretreatment (p<0.05). In batch cultures, supernatant from engineered -expressing  and naturally BSH-producing organisms ( and ) reduced TCA-mediated  germination relative to culture supernatant of wild-type (BSH-negative)  total viable counts were ~70% reduced in an rCDI mouse model after administration of  expressing highly active BSH relative to mice administered BSH-negative  (p<0.05).Restoration of gut BSH functionality contributes to the efficacy of FMT in treating rCDI.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Mice were divided into four groups, namely the normal control, DSS, 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) and FMT group. Mice in the DSS, 5-ASA and FMT groups were orally administered 3% DSS (w/v) solution for 7 days to induce colitis. On days 1, 3, 5 and 7, mice in the DSS, 5-ASA and FMT groups were respectively administered 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 5-ASA suspension and  suspension by enema. The disease activity index of each mouse was calculated on a daily basis. All mice were sacrificed on day 8, and the length of their colons was measured. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 in the colon tissues of each group were also measured. Compared with that in the DSS group, FMT ameliorated the severity of inflammation due to ulcerative colitis in mice, which was accompanied by a significantly decreased MPO activity, reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, and an increased level of IL-10 in colon tissue (all P<0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrated that FMT exerted a therapeutic effect on experimental colitis in mice, and the associated mechanism is likely to involve the remodeling of the intestinal flora and regulation of intestinal T-cell immunity homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27999162>Complete  Engraftment Is Not Essential for Recovery from Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection following   .</a></h2><p>Bacterial communities from subjects treated for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) by    (FMT), using either heterologous donor stool samples or autologous stool samples, were characterized by Illumina next-generation sequencing. As previously reported, the success of heterologous FMT (90%) was superior to that of autologous FMT (43%) (P = 0.019), and post-FMT intestinal bacterial communities differed significantly between treatment arms (P < 0.001). Subjects cured by autologous FMT typically had greater abundances of the Clostridium XIVa clade and Holdemania bacteria prior to treatment, and the relative abundances of these groups increased significantly after FMT compared to heterologous FMT and pre-FMT samples. The typical shift to post-FMT, donor-like assemblages, featuring high relative abundances of genera within the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla, was not observed in the autologous FMT subjects. Autologous FMT patient bacterial communities were significantly different in composition than those for heterologous FMT patients and donors (P < 0.001). The SourceTracker program, which employs a Bayesian algorithm to determine source contributions to sink communities, showed that patients initially treated by heterologous FMT had significantly higher percentages of engraftment (i.e., similarity to donor communities, mean value of 74%) compared to those who suffered recurrence following autologous FMT (1%) (P ≤ 0.013). The findings of this study suggest that complete donor engraftment may be not necessary if functionally critical taxa are present in subjects following antibiotic therapy.This study provides a detailed characterization of  bacterial communities in subjects who participated in a previously published randomized clinical trial to treat recurrent C. difficile infection (rCDI). Bacterial communities were characterized to determine differences between subjects who received  bacteria either from healthy donor stool samples or their own stool samples as "placebo" in order to determine which groups of bacteria were most important in achieving a cure. The results of this study suggested that bacteria associated with secondary bile  metabolism could potentially provide resistance to infection and that complete transfer of healthy donor microorganisms was not necessary to resolve CDI following unsuccessful antibiotic treatment.Copyright © 2016 Staley et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332389>Healthspan and lifespan extension by    into progeroid mice.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is emerging as a key regulator of several metabolic, immune and neuroendocrine pathways. Gut microbiome deregulation has been implicated in major conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty  liver disease and cancer, but its precise role in aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we find that two different mouse models of progeria are characterized by intestinal dysbiosis with alterations that include an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and a decrease in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia. Consistent with these findings, we found that human progeria patients also display intestinal dysbiosis and that long-lived humans (that is, centenarians) exhibit a substantial increase in Verrucomicrobia and a reduction in Proteobacteria.    from wild-type mice enhanced healthspan and lifespan in both progeroid mouse models, and  with the verrucomicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila was sufficient to exert beneficial effects. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of ileal content points to the restoration of secondary bile  as a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of reestablishing a healthy microbiome. Our results demonstrate that correction of the accelerated aging-associated intestinal dysbiosis is beneficial, suggesting the existence of a link between aging and the gut  that provides a rationale for microbiome-based interventions against age-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190584>Clinical response to    in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome is associated with normalization of   composition and short-chain fatty  levels.</a></h2><p> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be associated with disturbances in gut  composition and functions. We recently performed a study of    (FMT) in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and found that IBS symptoms improved and the gut  profile changed following FMT. We now aimed to explore the effects of FMT on the gut microenvironment in further detail by using 16S rRNA sequencing for more extended  profiling and analyzing bacterial fermentation products (SCFAs: short chain fatty ).  The study included 13 patients (four females and nine males) with IBS-D according to Rome III criteria and 13 healthy donors. Freshly donated  were administered into duodenum via gastroscopy. The patients completed symptom and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and delivered  before and 1, 3, 12 and 20/28 weeks after FMT.  analysis was performed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene with Illumina Miseq technology.  concentrations of SCFAs were analyzed by vacuum distillation followed by gas chromatography.  Several gut  taxa and SCFAs were significantly different in the patients at baseline compared to their donors. These differences normalized by the third week following FMT in parallel with significant improvement in symptoms and QoL. Responders had different gut  profile and SCFAs than nonresponders. Significant correlations were found between the gut microenvironment and IBS symptoms. No adverse effects were reported.  FMT restores alterations of the gut microenvironment in IBS-D patients during the first 3 weeks and improves their symptoms for up to 28 weeks.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550391>Gut-liver axis, cirrhosis and portal hypertension: the chicken and the egg.</a></h2><p>The term gut-liver axis is used to highlight the close anatomical and functional relationship between the intestine and the liver. The intestine has a highly specialized epithelial membrane which regulates transport across the mucosa. Due to dysbiosis, impairment of the intestinal barrier and altered immunity status, bacterial products can reach the liver through the portal vein, where they are recognized by specific receptors, activate the immune system and lead to a proinflammatory response. Gut  and bacterial translocation play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and its complications, such as portal hypertension, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopaty. The gut  also plays a critical role as a modulator of bile  metabolism which can also influence intestinal permeability and portal hypertension through the farnesoid-X receptor. On the other hand, cirrhosis and portal hypertension affect the  and increase translocation, leading to a "chicken and egg" situation, where translocation increases portal pressure, and vice versa. A myriad of therapies targeting gut  have been evaluated specifically in patients with chronic liver disease. Further studies targeting intestinal  and its possible hemodynamic and metabolic effects are needed. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the role of gut  in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases and portal hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29903041>Saturated long-chain fatty -producing bacteria contribute to enhanced colonic motility in rats.</a></h2><p>The gut  is closely associated with gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorder, but the mechanism(s) by which bacteria interact with and affect host GI motility remains unclear. In this study, through using metabolomic and metagenomic analyses, an animal model of neonatal maternal separation (NMS) characterized by accelerated colonic motility and gut dysbiosis was used to investigate the mechanism underlying -driven motility dysfunction.An excess of intracolonic saturated long-chain fatty  (SLCFAs) was associated with enhanced bowel motility in NMS rats. Heptadecanoic  (C17:0) and stearic  (C18:0), as the most abundant odd- and even-numbered carbon SLCFAs in the colon lumen, can promote rat colonic muscle contraction and increase stool frequency. Increase of SLCFAs was positively correlated with elevated abundances of Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Alistipes. Functional annotation found that the level of bacterial LCFA biosynthesis was highly enriched in NMS group. Essential synthetic genes Fabs were largely identified from the genera Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Alistipes. Pseudo germ-free (GF) rats receiving   from NMS donors exhibited increased defecation frequency and upregulated bacterial production of intracolonic SLCFAs. Modulation of gut dysbiosis by neomycin effectively attenuated GI motility and reduced bacterial SLCFA generation in the colon lumen of NMS rats.These findings reveal a previously unknown relationship between gut bacteria, intracolonic SLCFAs, and host GI motility, suggesting the importance of SLCFA-producing bacteria in GI motility disorders. Further exploration of this relationship could lead to a precise medication targeting the gut  for treating GI motility disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30010734>Faecal   Reduces Susceptibility to Epithelial Injury and Modulates Tryptophan Metabolism of the Microbial Community in a Piglet Model.</a></h2><p>Faecal   [FMT] has shown promise as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Using a piglet model, our previous study indicated that exogenous faecal  can increase the expressions of tight junction proteins, mucin and antimicrobial peptide in the intestinal mucosa, suggesting a beneficial effect of FMT on gut barrier and gastrointestinal health. However, specific connections between FMT-induced microbial changes and modulation of the intestinal barrier remain to be fully illustrated. Here, we aimed to determine the potential role of metabolic function of gut  in the beneficial effects of FMT.The influence of FMT on the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis was assessed by early-life gut  intervention on newborn piglets and subsequent lipopolysaccharide [LPS] challenge. Analysis of the gut microbiome and metabolome was carried out by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiple mass spectrometry platforms.FMT modulated the diversity and composition of colonic  and reduced the susceptibility to LPS-induced destruction of epithelial integrity and severe inflammatory response. Metabolomic analysis revealed functional changes of the gut metabolome along with a significant increase of the typical -derived tryptophan catabolite indole-3-acetic  in the colonic lumen. In concordance with the metabolome data, metagenomics prediction analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing also demonstrated that FMT modulated the metabolic functions of gut  associated with indole alkaloid biosynthesis, cytochrome P450 and intestinal homeostasis, which coincided with up-regulation of cytokine interleukin-22 and enhanced activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the recipient colon.Our data reveal a regulatory effect of FMT on tryptophan metabolism of gut  in the recipient colon, which may play a potential role in maintenance of the intestinal barrier.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29268595>, a key player in alcoholic liver disease.</a></h2><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Only 20% of heavy alcohol consumers develop alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The intestinal  (IM) has been recently identified as a key player in the severity of liver injury in ALD. Common features of ALD include a decrease of gut epithelial tight junction protein expression, mucin production, and antimicrobial peptide levels. This disruption of the gut barrier, which is a prerequisite for ALD, leads to the passage of bacterial products into the blood stream (endotoxemia). Moreover, metabolites produced by bacteria, such as short chain fatty , volatile organic compounds (VOS), and bile  (BA), are involved in ALD pathology. Probiotic treatment, IM , or the consumption of dietary fiber, such as pectin, which all alter the ratio of bacterial species, have been shown to improve liver injury in animal models of ALD and to be associated with an improvement in gut barrier function. Although the connections between the  and the host in ALD are well established, the underlying mechanisms are still an active area of research. Targeting the microbiome through the use of prebiotic, probiotic, and postbiotic modalities could be an attractive new approach to manage ALD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738579>BaiCD gene cluster abundance is negatively correlated with Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. Secondary bile  were shown to confer resistance to colonization by C. difficile. 7α-dehydroxylation is a key step in transformation of primary to secondary bile  and required genes have been located in a single bile -inducible (bai) operon in C. scindens as well as in C. hiranonis, two Clostridium sp. recently reported to protect against C. difficile colonization.To analyze baiCD gene abundance in C. difficile positive and negative  samples.A species-specific qPCR for detecting baiCD genes was established.  samples of patients with CDI, asymptomatic toxigenic C. difficile colonization (TCD), non-toxigenic C. difficile colonization (NTCD), of C. difficile negative (NC) patients, and of two patients before and after    (FMT) for recurrent CDI (rCDI) were tested for the presence of the baiCD genes.The prevalence of the baiCD gene cluster was significantly higher in C. difficile negative  samples than in samples of patients diagnosed with CDI (72.5% (100/138) vs. 35.9% (23/64; p<0.0001). No differences in baiCD gene cluster prevalence were seen between NC and NTCD or NC and TCD samples. Both rCDI patients were baiCD-negative at baseline, but one of the two patients turned positive after successful FMT from a baiCD-positive donor. samples of CDI patients are less frequently baiCD-positive than samples from asymptomatic carriers or C. difficile-negative individuals. Furthermore, we present a case of baiCD positivity observed after successful FMT for rCDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859364>Beneficial effects of ginger on prevention of obesity through modulation of gut  in mice.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence has demonstrated that the gut  plays a critical role in the treatment of obesity and other metabolic dysfunctions. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), one of the most commonly used spices and dietary supplements, has been shown to exert beneficial effects against obesity and related disorders. However, to date, the mechanisms linking these effects to the gut  remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the gut  and the metabolic adaptations resulting from ginger supplementation in mice.Four groups of mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without ginger supplementation for 16 weeks. Lipid profiles, proinflammatory cytokines, glucose tolerance,  composition and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) concentrations were analyzed at the end of the experiment. In addition, -depleted mice were transplanted with the   of mice fed a HFD or mice fed a HFD along with ginger supplementation. Glucose tolerance and  composition were assessed after a 8-week    (FMT).We observed marked decreases in body weight, liver steatosis, and low-grade inflammation as well as amelioration of insulin resistance in the HFD-fed mice treated with ginger. Furthermore, ginger supplementation modulated the gut  composition and increased species belonging to the Bifidobacterium genus and SCFA-producing bacteria (Alloprevotella and Allobaculum), along with increases in  SCFA concentrations. The FMT experiment showed anti-obesity and -modulating effects similar to those observed in the oral ginger-feeding experiment.This study suggests that modulation of the gut  as a result of ginger supplementation has a therapeutic effect on obesity in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30034913>Targeting the gut barrier for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.</a></h2><p>Alcohol consumption remains one of the predominant causes of liver disease and liver-related death worldwide. Intriguingly, dysregulation of the gut barrier is a key factor promoting the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). A functional gut barrier, which consists of a mucus layer, an intact epithelial monolayer and mucosal immune cells, supports nutrient absorption and prevents bacterial penetration. Compromised gut barrier function is associated with the progression of ALD. Indeed, alcohol consumption disrupts the gut barrier, increases gut permeability, and induces bacterial translocation both in ALD patients and in experimental models with ALD. Moreover, alcohol consumption also causes enteric dysbiosis with both numerical and proportional perturbations. Here, we review and discuss mechanisms of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction to better understand the contribution of the gut-liver axis to the pathogenesis of ALD. Unfortunately, there is no effectual Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for any stage of ALD. Therefore, we conclude with a discussion of potential strategies aimed at restoring the gut barrier in ALD. The principle behind antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics and    is to restore microbial symbiosis and subsequently gut barrier function. Nutrient-based treatments, such as dietary supplementation with zinc, niacin or fatty , have been shown to regulate tight junction expression, reduce intestinal inflammation, and prevent endotoxemia as well as liver injury caused by alcohol in experimental settings. Interestingly, saturated fatty  may also directly control the gut microbiome. In summary, clinical and experimental studies highlight the significance and efficacy of the gut barrier in treating ALD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27256713>The metabolic role of the gut  in health and rheumatic disease: mechanisms and interventions.</a></h2><p>The role of the gut microbiome in animal models of inflammatory and autoimmune disease is now well established. The human gut microbiome is currently being studied as a potential modulator of the immune response in rheumatic disorders. However, the vastness and complexity of this host-microorganism interaction is likely to go well beyond taxonomic, correlative observations. In fact, most advances in the field relate to the functional and metabolic capabilities of these microorganisms and their influence on mucosal immunity and systemic inflammation.

In a recent study oral-delivery of encapsulated, freeze-dried donor material, resulted in comparable rates of cure to colonoscopic approaches. Here we characterize shifts in the  bacterial community structure of patients treated for rCDI using encapsulated donor material. Prior to FMT, patient  samples showed declines in diversity and abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with concurrent increases in members of the Proteobacteria, specifically Enterobacteriaceae. Moreover, patients who experienced recurrence of CDI within the 2-month clinical follow-up had greater abundances of Enterobacteriaceae and did not show resolution of dysbioses. Despite resolution of rCDI following oral-administration of encapsulated  , community composition was slow to return to a normal donor-like assemblage. Post-FMT taxa within the Firmicutes showed rapid increases in relative abundance and did not vary significantly over time. Conversely, Bacteroidetes taxa only showed significant increases in abundance after one month post-FMT, corresponding to significant increases in the community attributable to the donors. Changes in the associations among dominant OTUs were observed at days, weeks, and months post-FMT, suggesting shifts in community dynamics may be related to the timing of increases in abundance of specific taxa. Administration of encapsulated, freeze-dried,   to rCDI patients resulted in restoration of bacterial diversity and resolution of dysbiosis. However, shifts in the  microbiome were incremental rather than immediate, and may be driven by changes in community dynamics reflecting changes in the host environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306229>Current understanding of gut  alterations and related therapeutic intervention strategies in heart failure.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this review is to stress the complicated interactions between the  and the development of heart failure. Moreover, the feasibility of modulating intestinal microbes and metabolites as novel therapeutic strategies is discussed.This study was based on data obtained from PubMed up to March 31, 2019. Articles were selected using the following search terms: "gut ," "heart failure," "trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)," "short-chain fatty  (SCFA)," "bile ," "uremic toxin," "treatment," "diet," "probiotic," "prebiotic," "antibiotic," and "  ."Accumulated evidence has revealed that the composition of the gut  varies obviously in people with heart failure compared to those with healthy status. Altered gut microbial communities contribute to heart failure through bacterial translocation or affecting multiple metabolic pathways, including the trimethylamine/TMAO, SCFA, bile , and uremic toxin pathways. Meanwhile, modulation of the gut  through diet, pre/probiotics,  , and microbial enzyme inhibitors has become a potential therapeutic approach for many metabolic disorders. Specifically, a few studies have focused on the cardioprotective effects of probiotics on heart failure.The composition of the gut  in people with heart failure is different from those with healthy status. A reduction in SCFA-producing bacteria in patients with heart failure might be a notable characteristic for patients with heart failure. Moreover, an increase in the microbial potential to produce TMAO and lipopolysaccharides is prominent. More researches focused on the mechanisms of microbial metabolites and the clinical application of multiple therapeutic interventions is necessarily required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29983136>Early intervention with faecal  : an effective means to improve growth performance and the intestinal development of suckling piglets.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate that early postnatal period is a critical window for gut  manipulation to optimise the immunity and body growth. This study investigated the effects of maternal faecal  orally administered to neonatal piglets after birth on growth performance, selected microbial populations, intestinal permeability and the development of intestinal mucosal immune system. In total, 12 litters of crossbred newborn piglets were selected in this study. Litter size was standardised to 10 piglets. On day 1, 10 piglets in each litter were randomly allotted to the faecal   (FMT) and control groups. Piglets in the FMT group were orally administrated with 2ml faecal suspension of their nursing sow per day from the age of 1 to 3 days; piglets in the control group were treated with the same dose of a placebo (0.1M potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% glycerol (vol/vol)) inoculant. The experiment lasted 21 days. On days 7, 14 and 21, plasma and faecal samples were collected for the analysis of growth-related hormones and cytokines in plasma and lipocalin-2, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), selected  and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) in faeces. Faecal   increased the average daily gain of piglets during week 3 and the whole experiment period. Compared with the control group, the FMT group had increased concentrations of plasma growth hormone and IGF-1 on days 14 and 21. Faecal   also reduced the incidence of diarrhoea during weeks 1 and 3 and plasma concentrations of zonulin, endotoxin and diamine oxidase activities in piglets on days 7 and 14. The populations of Lactobacillus spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the concentrations of faecal and plasma acetate, butyrate and total SCFAs in FMT group were higher than those in the control group on day 21. Moreover, the FMT piglets have higher concentrations of plasma transforming growth factor-β and immunoglobulin G, and faecal sIgA than the control piglets on day 21. These findings indicate that early intervention with maternal faecal  improves growth performance, decreases intestinal permeability, stimulates sIgA secretion, and modulates gut  composition and metabolism in suckling piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463925>Impact of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate followed by Autologous    on  Microbiome Structure and Metabolic Potential.</a></h2><p>Strategies to prevent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are scarce, but autologous    (autoFMT) may limit gastrointestinal MDRO expansion. AutoFMT involves banking one's  during a healthy state for later use in restoring gut  following perturbation. This pilot study evaluated the effect of autoFMT on gastrointestinal microbiome taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity after exposure to amoxicillin-clavulanic  (Amox-Clav). Ten healthy participants were enrolled. All received 5 days of Amox-Clav. Half were randomized to autoFMT, derived from stool collected pre-antimicrobial exposure, by enema, and half to saline enema. Participants submitted stool samples pre- and post-Amox-Clav and enema and during a 90-day follow-up period. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity. Amox-Clav significantly altered gut taxonomic composition in all participants ( = 10,  < 0.01); however, only three participants exhibited major changes at the phylum level following exposure. In the cohort as a whole, beta-lactamase genes were enriched following Amox-Clav ( < 0.05), and predicted metabolic capacity was significantly altered ( < 0.01). Species composition, metabolic capacity, and beta-lactamase abundance returned to pre-antimicrobial exposure state 7 days after either autoFMT or saline enema ( > 0.05, compared to enrollment). Alterations to microbial metabolic capacity occurred following antimicrobial exposure even in participants without substantial taxonomic disruption, potentially creating open niches for pathogen colonization. Our findings suggest that metabolic potential is an important consideration for complete assessment of antimicrobial impact on the microbiome. AutoFMT was well tolerated and may have contributed to phylogenetic recovery. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier .) The spread of multidrug resistance among pathogenic organisms threatens the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment options. The human gut serves as a reservoir for many drug-resistant organisms and their resistance genes, and perturbation of the gut microbiome by antimicrobial exposure can open metabolic niches to resistant pathogens. Once established in the gut, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can persist even after antimicrobial exposure ceases. Strategies to prevent multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) infections are scarce, but autologous    (autoFMT) may limit gastrointestinal MDRO expansion. AutoFMT involves banking one's  during a healthy state for later use in restoring gut  following perturbation. This pilot study evaluated the effect of amoxicillin-clavulanic  (Amox-Clav) exposure and autoFMT on gastrointestinal microbiome taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity. Importantly, we found that metabolic capacity was perturbed even in cases where gross phylogeny remained unchanged and that autoFMT was safe and well tolerated.Copyright © 2018 Bulow et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391545> of  from drug-free patients with schizophrenia causes schizophrenia-like abnormal behaviors and dysregulated kynurenine metabolism in mice.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that gut  plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia via the -gut-brain axis. This study sought to investigate whether  of   from drug-free patients with schizophrenia into specific pathogen-free mice could cause schizophrenia-like behavioral abnormalities. The results revealed that  of   from schizophrenic patients into antibiotic-treated mice caused behavioral abnormalities such as psychomotor hyperactivity, impaired learning and memory in the recipient animals. These mice also showed elevation of the kynurenine-kynurenic  pathway of tryptophan degradation in both periphery and brain, as well as increased basal extracellular dopamine in prefrontal cortex and 5-hydroxytryptamine in hippocampus, compared with their counterparts receiving  from healthy controls. Furthermore, colonic luminal filtrates from the mice transplanted with patients'   increased both kynurenic  synthesis and kynurenine aminotransferase II activity in cultured hepatocytes and forebrain cortical slices. Sixty species of donor-derived bacteria showed significant difference between the mice colonized with the patients' and the controls'  , highlighting 78 differentially enriched functional modules including tryptophan biosynthesis function. In conclusion, our study suggests that the abnormalities in the composition of gut  contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia partially through the manipulation of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28530702>Metformin alters the gut microbiome of individuals with treatment-naive type 2 diabetes, contributing to the therapeutic effects of the drug.</a></h2><p>Metformin is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but its mechanism of action is poorly defined. Recent evidence implicates the gut  as a site of metformin action. In a double-blind study, we randomized individuals with treatment-naive T2D to placebo or metformin for 4 months and showed that metformin had strong effects on the gut microbiome. These results were verified in a subset of the placebo group that switched to metformin 6 months after the start of the trial. Transfer of  samples (obtained before and 4 months after treatment) from metformin-treated donors to germ-free mice showed that glucose tolerance was improved in mice that received metformin-altered . By directly investigating metformin- interactions in a gut simulator, we showed that metformin affected pathways with common biological functions in species from two different phyla, and many of the metformin-regulated genes in these species encoded metalloproteins or metal transporters. Our findings provide support for the notion that altered gut  mediates some of metformin's antidiabetic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29933742>Effects of chronic noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in senescence-accelerated prone mice: implications for Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic noise exposure is associated with neuroinflammation and gut  dysregulation and increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Environmental hazards are also thought to be associated with genetic susceptibility factors that increase AD pathogenesis. However, there is limited experimental evidence regarding the link between chronic noise stress and microbiome-gut-brain axis alterations, which may be closely related to AD development.The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the effects of chronic noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain. We established SAMP8 mouse models to examine the consequences of noise exposure on the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Hippocampal amyloid-β (Aβ) assessment and the Morris water maze were used to evaluate AD-like changes, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analyses were used for intestinal flora measurements, and assessment of endothelial tight junctions and serum neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator levels, as well as   , was conducted to explore the underlying pathological mechanisms.Chronic noise exposure led to cognitive impairment and Aβ accumulation in young SAMP8 mice, similar to that observed in aging SAMP8 mice. Noise exposure was also associated with decreased gut  diversity and compositional alterations. Axis-series studies showed that endothelial tight junction proteins were decreased in both the intestine and brain, whereas serum neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator levels were elevated in young SAMP8 mice exposed to chronic noise, similar to the observations made in the aging group. The importance of intestinal bacteria in noise exposure-induced epithelial integrity impairment and Aβ accumulation was further confirmed through   experiments. Moreover, the effects of chronic noise were generally intensity-dependent.Chronic noise exposure altered the gut , accelerated age-related neurochemical and inflammatory dysregulation, and facilitated AD-like changes in the brain of SAMP8 mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004524>Impaired Chylomicron Assembly Modifies Hepatic Metabolism Through Bile -Dependent and Transmissible Microbial Adaptations.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms by which alterations in intestinal bile  (BA) metabolism improve systemic glucose tolerance and hepatic metabolic homeostasis are incompletely understood. We examined metabolic adaptations in mice with conditional intestinal deletion of the abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) gene microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp-IKO), which blocks chylomicron assembly and impairs intestinal lipid transport. Mttp-IKO mice exhibit improved hepatic glucose metabolism and augmented insulin signaling, without weight loss. These adaptations included decreased BA excretion, increased pool size, altered BA composition, and increased fibroblast growth factor 15 production. Mttp-IKO mice absorb fructose normally but are protected against dietary fructose-induced hepatic steatosis, without weight loss or changes in energy expenditure. In addition, Mttp-IKO mice exhibit altered cecal microbial communities, both at baseline and following fructose feeding, including increased abundance of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus genera.  of cecal  from chow-fed Mttp-IKO mice into antibiotic-treated wild-type recipients conferred transmissible protection against fructose-induced hepatic steatosis in association with a bloom in Akkermansia and increased Clostridium XIVa genera, whose abundance was positively correlated with  coprostanol and total neutral sterol excretion in recipient mice. However, antibiotic-treated Mttp-IKO mice were still protected against fructose-induced hepatic steatosis, suggesting that changes in  are not required for this phenotype. Nevertheless, we found increased abundance of  Akkermansia from two adult ABL subjects with MTTP mutations compared to their heterozygous parents and within the range noted in six healthy control subjects. Furthermore, Akkermansia abundance across all subjects was positively correlated with  coprostanol excretion. Conclusion: The findings collectively suggest multiple adaptive pathways of metabolic regulation following blocked chylomicron assembly, including shifts in BA signaling and altered microbial composition that confer a transmissible phenotype.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27058556>The Intestinal  in Metabolic Disease.</a></h2><p>Gut bacteria exert beneficial and harmful effects in metabolic diseases as deduced from the comparison of germfree and conventional mice and from   studies. Compositional microbial changes in diseased subjects have been linked to adiposity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Promotion of an increased expression of intestinal nutrient transporters or a modified lipid and bile  metabolism by the intestinal  could result in an increased nutrient absorption by the host. The degradation of dietary fiber and the subsequent fermentation of monosaccharides to short-chain fatty  (SCFA) is one of the most controversially discussed mechanisms of how gut bacteria impact host physiology. Fibers reduce the energy density of the diet, and the resulting SCFA promote intestinal gluconeogenesis, incretin formation and subsequently satiety. However, SCFA also deliver energy to the host and support liponeogenesis. Thus far, there is little knowledge on bacterial species that promote or prevent metabolic disease. Clostridium ramosum and Enterococcus cloacae were demonstrated to promote obesity in gnotobiotic mouse models, whereas bifidobacteria and Akkermansia muciniphila were associated with favorable phenotypes in conventional mice, especially when oligofructose was fed. How diet modulates the gut  towards a beneficial or harmful composition needs further research. Gnotobiotic animals are a valuable tool to elucidate mechanisms underlying diet-host-microbe interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529583>Specific Bacteria and Metabolites Associated With Response to    in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) can induce remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). In a randomized controlled trial of FMT in patients with active UC, we aimed to identify bacterial taxonomic and functional factors associated with response to therapy.We performed a double-blind trial of 81 patients with active UC randomly assigned to groups that received an initial colonoscopic infusion and then intensive multidonor FMT or placebo enemas, 5 d/wk for 8 weeks. Patients in the FMT group received blended homogenized stool from 3-7 unrelated donors. Patients in the placebo group were eligible to receive open-label FMT after the double-blind study period. We collected 314  samples from the patients at screening, every 4 weeks during treatment, and 8 weeks after the blinded or open-label FMT therapy. We also collected 160 large-bowel biopsy samples from the patients at study entry, at completion of 8 weeks of blinded therapy, and at the end of open-label FMT, if applicable. We analyzed 105  samples from the 14 individual donors (n = 55), who in turn contributed to 21 multidonor batches (n = 50). Bacteria in colonic and  samples were analyzed by both 16S ribosomal RNA gene and transcript amplicon sequencing; 285  samples were analyzed by shotgun metagenomics, and 60  samples were analyzed for metabolome features.FMT increased microbial diversity and altered composition, based on analyses of colon and  samples collected before vs after FMT. Diversity was greater in  and colon samples collected before and after FMT treatment from patients who achieved remission compared with patients who did not. Patients in remission after FMT had enrichment of Eubacterium hallii and Roseburia inulivorans compared with patients who did not achieve remission after FMT and had increased levels of short-chain fatty  biosynthesis and secondary bile . Patients who did not achieve remission had enrichment of Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Sutterella wadsworthensis, and Escherichia species and increased levels of heme and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Bacteroides in donor stool were associated with remission in patients receiving FMT, and Streptococcus species in donor stool was associated with no response to FMT.In an analysis of  and colonic mucosa samples from patients receiving FMT for active UC and stool samples from donors, we associated specific bacteria and metabolic pathways with induction of remission.

In humans, severe alcoholic hepatitis is associated with key changes to intestinal  (IM), which influences individual sensitivity to develop advanced ALD. We used the different susceptibility to ALD observed in two distinct animal facilities to test the efficiency of two complementary strategies (   and prebiotic treatment) to reverse dysbiosis and prevent ALD.Mice were fed alcohol in two distinct animal facilities with a Lieber DeCarli diet.    was performed with fresh  from alcohol-resistant donor mice to alcohol-sensitive receiver mice three times a week. Another group of mice received pectin during the entire alcohol consumption period.Ethanol induced steatosis and liver inflammation, which were associated with disruption of gut homeostasis, in alcohol-sensitive, but not alcohol resistant mice. IM analysis showed that the proportion of Bacteroides was specifically lower in alcohol-sensitive mice (p<0.05). Principal coordinate analysis showed that the IM of sensitive and resistant mice clustered differently. We targeted IM using two different strategies to prevent alcohol-induced liver lesions: (1) pectin treatment which induced major modifications of the IM, (2)    which resulted in an IM very close to that of resistant donor mice in the sensitive recipient mice. Both methods prevented steatosis, liver inflammation, and restored gut homeostasis.Manipulation of IM can prevent alcohol-induced liver injury. The IM should be considered as a new therapeutic target in ALD.Sensitivity to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is driven by intestinal  in alcohol fed mice. Treatment of mice with alcohol-induced liver lesions by   from alcohol fed mice resistant to ALD or with prebiotic (pectin) prevents ALD.

In recent years, our understanding of gut microbial regulation of intestinal immunometabolic and redox homeostasis have evolved mainly out of in vivo studies associated with high-fat feeding induced metabolic diseases. Techniques utilizing   and germ-free mice have been instrumental in reproducibly demonstrating how the gut  affects disease pathogenesis. However, the pillars of modern drug discovery i.e. evidence-based pharmacological studies critically lack focus on intestinal microflora. This is primarily due to targeted in vitro molecular-approaches at cellular-level that largely overlook the etiology of disease pathogenesis from the physiological perspective. Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key notions of intestinal  and dysbiosis, and highlight the -phytochemical bidirectional interactions that affects bioavailability and bioactivity of parent phytochemicals and their metabolites. Potentially by focusing on the three major aspects of gut  i.e. microbial abundance, diversity, and functions, I will discuss phytochemical- reciprocal interactions, biotransformation of phytochemicals and plant-derived drugs, and pre-clinical and clinical efficacies of herbal medicine on dysbiosis. Additionally, in relation to phytochemical pharmacology, I will briefly discuss the role of dietary-patterns associated with changes in microbial profiles and review pharmacological study models considering possible microbial effects. This review therefore, emphasize on the timely and critically needed evidence-based phytochemical studies focusing on gut  and will provide newer insights for future pre-clinical and clinical phytopharmacological interventions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a fat-rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut  on hosts including bile salt metabolism, short-chain fatty , and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between  and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut  interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut microbiome approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with probiotics.

Dysbiosis of the gut  due to consumption of antibiotics is a major contributor to CDI. Recently,    (FMT) has been applied to treat CDI. However, FMT has important limitations including uncontrolled exposure to pathogens and standardization issues. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate alternative treatment methods, such as bacteriotherapy, as well as the mechanism through which beneficial bacteria inhibit the growth of C. difficile. Here, we report bile -mediated inhibition of C. difficile by Bacteroides strains which can produce bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Bacteroides strains are not commonly used to treat CDI; however, as they comprise a large proportion of the intestinal , they can contribute to bile -mediated inhibition of C. difficile. The inhibitory effect on C. difficile growth increased with increasing bile  concentration in the presence of Bacteroides ovatus SNUG 40239. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect on C. difficile growth was significantly attenuated when bile  availability was reduced by cholestyramine, a bile  sequestrant. The findings of this study are important due to the discovery of a new bacterial strain that in the presence of available bile  inhibits growth of C. difficile. These results will facilitate development of novel bacteriotherapy strategies to control CDI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358877>Relationship between intestinal  and ulcerative colitis: Mechanisms and clinical application of probiotics and   .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease that mainly affects the colon and rectum. It is believed that genetic factors, host immune system disorders, intestinal  dysbiosis, and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of UC. However, studies on the role of intestinal  in the pathogenesis of UC have been inconclusive. Studies have shown that probiotics improve intestinal mucosa barrier function and immune system function and promote secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, thereby inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the intestine.    (FMT) can reduce bowel permeability and thus the severity of disease by increasing the production of short-chain fatty , especially butyrate, which help maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier. FMT can also restore immune dysbiosis by inhibiting Th1 differentiation, activity of T cells, leukocyte adhesion, and production of inflammatory factors. Probiotics and FMT are being increasingly used to treat UC, but their use is controversial because of uncertain efficacy.

In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of the brain-gut axis in relation to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome.A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate GI and brain interactions.Evidence suggests reduced microbial diversity in obesity and metabolic dysregulation. However, findings of  composition in obese individuals are inconsistent, and the investigation of causality between gut  and energy homeostasis is complex because multiple variables contribute to the gut  composition. The microbial metabolites short chain fatty  are found to exert numerous physiologic effects, including energy homeostasis through the regulation of GI hormones such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, and leptin. Preclinical studies show that modifying rodents'  through   results in alterations of these GI hormones and subsequently an altered metabolism and behavior. However, whether and to what extent preclinical findings translate to human metabolism is unclear.One of the major limitations and challenges in this field of research is interindividual variability of the microbiome. Future research needs to combine recent insights gained into tracking the dynamics of the microbiome as well as the metabolic responses. Furthermore, advanced mapping of the human microbiome is required to investigate the metabolic implications of the gut-brain axis to develop targeted interventions for obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123416>Butyrate production in patients with end-stage renal disease.</a></h2><p> Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a decreased intestinal barrier function, causing bacterial translocation over the intestinal wall and triggering a systemic inflammatory response. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty  produced by certain bacterial strains, is considered instrumental to keep the intestinal barrier intact. There are indications that a decreased amount of these specific bacterial species is part of the cause of the decreased intestinal barrier function in CKD. The aim of this study is (i) to determine if Dutch patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a decreased amount of butyrate-producing species and butyrate-producing capacity and (ii) whether this correlates with systemic inflammation.  We used qPCR to evaluate the most abundant butyrate-producing species  and . and the BCoAT gene, which reflects the butyrogenic capacity of the intestinal .  samples were collected from healthy kidney donors (n=15), preemptive renal  recipients (n=4) and dialysis patients (n=31).

Neither was there a significant correlation with CRP, IL-6 or D-lactate.

Here we investigated if the gut  modulates obesity and associated phenotypes through FXR.We fed germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) wild-type and  mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. We monitored weight gain and glucose metabolism and analysed the gut  and bile  composition, beta-cell mass, accumulation of macrophages in adipose tissue, liver steatosis, and expression of target genes in adipose tissue and liver. We also transferred the  of wild-type and -deficient mice to GF wild-type mice.The gut  promoted weight gain and hepatic steatosis in an FXR-dependent manner, and the bile  profiles and composition of faecal  differed between  and wild-type mice. The obese phenotype in colonised wild-type mice was associated with increased beta-cell mass, increased adipose inflammation, increased steatosis and expression of genes involved in lipid uptake. By transferring the caecal  from HFD-fed  and wild-type mice into GF mice, we showed that the obesity phenotype was transferable.Our results indicate that the gut  promotes diet-induced obesity and associated phenotypes through FXR, and that FXR may contribute to increased adiposity by altering the  composition.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Faecal  diversity of recipients significantly increased, and the composition of the  resembled that of the donor. Patients with C. difficile infection exhibited significantly lower faecal levels of secondary/ bile  and higher levels of primary bile . Levels of secondary bile  were restored in all  recipients, but to a lower degree with the OpenBiome . The abundance increased of bacterial genera known from previous studies to confer resistance to growth and germination of C. difficile. These were significantly negatively associated with primary bile  levels and positively related with secondary bile  levels.

Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of FMT could help us design safer, targeted therapies. We aimed to identify microbial metabolites that are important for C difficile growth.We used a CDI chemostat model as a tool to study the effects of FMT in vitro. The following analyses were performed: C difficile plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry bile  profiling. FMT mixtures were prepared using fresh  samples provided by donors enrolled in an FMT program in the United Kingdom. Results from chemostat experiments were validated using human stool samples, C difficile batch cultures, and C57BL/6 mice with CDI. Human stool samples were collected from 16 patients with recurrent CDI and healthy donors (n = 5) participating in an FMT trial in Canada.In the CDI chemostat model, clindamycin decreased valerate and deoxycholic  concentrations and increased C difficile total viable counts and valerate precursors, taurocholic , and succinate concentrations. After we stopped adding clindamycin, levels of bile  and succinate recovered, whereas levels of valerate and valerate precursors did not. In the CDI chemostat model, FMT increased valerate concentrations and decreased C difficile total viable counts (94% decrease), spore counts (86% decrease), and valerate precursor concentrations; concentrations of bile  were unchanged. In stool samples from patients with CDI, valerate was depleted before FMT but restored after FMT. Clostridioides difficile batch cultures confirmed that valerate decreased vegetative growth, and that taurocholic  was required for germination but had no effect on vegetative growth. Clostridioides difficile total viable counts were decreased by 95% in mice with CDI given glycerol trivalerate compared with phosphate buffered saline.We identified valerate as a metabolite that is depleted with clindamycin and only recovered with FMT.

Recently, the evidence has shown the associations between alteration in gut  composition and obesity, diabetes, and osteoporosis. However, the causality of gut  on metabolic health has yet to be explored in intervention studies and the underlying mechanisms need to be investigated more in depth. Gut  plays critical roles in the control of immunity, food intake, lipid accumulation, production of short chain fatty , insulin signaling, and regulation of bone mass.

The human microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms that live in or on the human body. They influence human physiology by interfering in several processes such as providing nutrients and vitamins in Phase I and Phase II drug metabolism. The human gut  is represented mainly by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and to a lesser degree by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, with each individual harbouring at least 160 such species. Gut  contributes to blood pressure homeostasis and the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension through production, modification, and degradation of a variety of microbial-derived bioactive metabolites. Animal studies and to a lesser degree human research has unmasked relative mechanisms, mainly through the effect of certain microbiome metabolites and their receptors, outlining this relationship. Interventions to utilize these pathways, with probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics and  microbiome  have shown promising results. Personalized microbiome-based disease prediction and treatment responsiveness seem futuristic. Undoubtedly, a long way of experimental and clinical research should be pursued to elucidate this novel, intriguing and very promising horizon.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29673295>Gut , metabolism and psychopathology: A critical review and novel perspectives.</a></h2><p>Psychiatric disorders are often associated with metabolic comorbidities. However, the mechanisms through which metabolic and psychiatric disorders are connected remain unclear. Pre-clinical studies in rodents indicate that the bidirectional signaling between the intestine and the brain, the so-called microbiome-gut-brain axis, plays an important role in the regulation of both metabolism and behavior. The gut microbiome produces a vast number of metabolites that may be transported into the host and play a part in homeostatic control of metabolism as well as brain function. In addition to short chain fatty , many of these metabolites have been identified in recent years. To what extent both  and their products control human metabolism and behavior is a subject of intense investigation. In this review, we will discuss the most recent findings concerning alterations in the gut  as a possible pathophysiological factor for the co-occurrence of metabolic comorbidities in psychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31425750> of   rich in short chain fatty  and butyric  treat cerebral ischemic stroke by regulating gut .</a></h2><p>The gut  and its short chain fatty  (SCFA) metabolites have been established to play an important protective role against neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that cerebral ischemic stroke triggers dysfunctional gut  and increased intestinal permeability. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which gut  and SCFAs can treat cerebral ischemic stroke in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion models and use the information to develop new therapies. Our results show that oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics reduced neurological impairment and the cerebral infarct volume, relieved cerebral edemas, and decreased blood lipid levels by altering the gut . We also found that ischemic stroke decreased intestinal levels of SCFAs. And that transplanting   rich in these metabolites was an effective means of treating the condition. Compared with other SCFAs, butyric  showed the highest negative correlation with ischemic stroke. Supplementation with butyric  treated models of ischemic stroke effectively by remodeling the gut , enriching the beneficial Lactobacillus, and repairing the leaky gut. In conclusion, interfering with the gut  by transplanting  bacteria rich in SCFAs and supplementing with butyric  were found to be effective treatments for cerebral ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Improvement of intestinal inflammation occurs through restoration of the immunological balance between pro-inflammatory T-helper 1 (Th1) responses and both T-helper 2 (Th2) and regulatory responses. However, detailed mechanisms explaining how P28GST prevents colitis and promotes gut homeostasis remain unknown. Considering the complex interplay between the adaptive and innate immune system and the intestinal , we raised the question of the possible role of the microbial ecosystem in the anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the helminth-derived P28GST protein. We first analyzed, by 16S rRNA sequencing, the bacterial profiles of mice   at several time points of the P28GST-immunomodulation period prior to trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-colitis. The influence of gut  in the P28GST-mediated anti-inflammatory effects was then assessed by    experiments from P28GST-immunized mice to either conventional or  depleted naïve recipient mice. Finally, the experimental data were supplemented by the temporal   compositions of P28GST-treated Crohn's disease patients from a pilot clinical study (). The P28GST administration slightly modulated the diversity and composition of mouse   while it significantly reduced experimental colitis in mice.    experiments failed to restore the P28GST-induced anti-inflammatory effects. In Crohn's disease patients, P28GST also induced slight changes in their overall  bacterial composition. Collectively, these results provide key elements in both the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and the safe therapeutic use of immunomodulation with such promising helminth-derived molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920413>Manipulation of the Gut-Liver Axis Using Microbiome Restoration Therapy in Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Alteration of the normal gut-liver axis is important in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Lack of effective medical therapy for PSC makes microbiome restoration an alluring therapeutic target. Allegretti et al. performed an open-label safety trial of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in noncirrhotic PSC patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission on minimal therapy. FMT was safe in this population, and after FMT, there was a stable, early increase in microbial diversity and donor engraftment with mixed effects on alkaline phosphatase but no significant change in fecal bile  profile. Further trials are needed to find whether FMT has a role to play in PSC therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638679>Modulation of autoimmune arthritis by environmental 'hygiene' and commensal .</a></h2><p>Observations in patients with autoimmune diseases and studies in animal models of autoimmunity have revealed that external environmental factors including exposure to microbes and the state of the host gut  can influence susceptibility to autoimmunity and subsequent disease development. Mechanisms underlying these outcomes continue to be elucidated. These include deviation of the cytokine response and imbalance between pathogenic versus regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, specific commensal organisms are associated with enhanced severity of arthritis in susceptible individuals, while exposure to certain microbes or helminths can afford protection against this disease. In addition, the role of metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty , tryptophan catabolites), produced either by the microbes themselves or from their action on dietary products, in modulation of arthritis is increasingly being realized. In this context, re-setting of the microbial dysbiosis in RA using prebiotics, probiotics, or  microbial  is emerging as a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of arthritis. It is hoped that advances in defining the interplay between gut , dietary products, and bioactive metabolites would help in the development of therapeutic regimen customized for the needs of individual patients in the near future.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We therefore studied the effect of lean donor (allogenic) versus own (autologous)    (FMT) to male recipients with the metabolic syndrome. Whereas we did not observe metabolic changes at 18 weeks after FMT, insulin sensitivity at 6 weeks after allogenic FMT was significantly improved, accompanied by altered  composition. We also observed changes in plasma metabolites such as γ-aminobutyric  and show that metabolic response upon allogenic FMT (defined as improved insulin sensitivity 6 weeks after FMT) is dependent on decreased  microbial diversity at baseline. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of lean donor FMT on glucose metabolism are associated with changes in intestinal  and plasma metabolites and can be predicted based on baseline   composition.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Colonization in a susceptible individual, with risk factors such as prior antibiotic use, advanced age, or medical comorbidities, may result in symptomatic infection. Although patients with a gynecologic malignancy may be at a higher risk of developing CDI due to an increased likelihood of having one or more risk factors, data do not consistently support the idea that chemotherapy or cancer itself are independently associated with CDI. For diagnosis of CDI, we recommended using a multi-step approach, with a highly sensitive initial rapid test such as the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) or nucleic  amplification testing (NAAT), followed by confirmatory testing with of the above two tests or EIA toxin A/B, which has high specificity. Treatment varies based on the severity of disease. We recommend vancomycin as first-line therapy for an initial episode of mild/moderate or severe CDI, with consideration of fidaxomicin for patients at particularly high risk for recurrence. Rectal vancomycin may play an adjunctive role for some severe cases, while surgical intervention is indicated for fulminant CDI if no improvement six or more days after initiating medical therapy. For non-severe recurrent disease, the initial treatment regimen should be repeated, while subsequent episodes are more appropriately treated with a tapered and pulsed dose of vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or   .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th) century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut micro-inflammation, intestinal  composition, function and selection of an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis. Finally, the  of  from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat CD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619640>Therapeutic manipulation of the : past, present, and considerations for the future.</a></h2><p>The growing appreciation of the potential role of indigenous  in disease has resulted in a concomitant interest in manipulating the microbiome for therapeutic effect.

The intestinal  has diverse effects on the development and function of the gut-specific immune system, and provides some protection from infectious pathogens. However, interactions between intestinal immunity and microorganisms are very complex, and recent studies have revealed that this intimate crosstalk may depend on the production and sensing abilities of multiple bioactive small molecule metabolites originating from direct produced by the gut  or by the metabolism of dietary components.

Allo-HSCT recipients often develop neutropenic fever, which is treated with antibiotics that may target anaerobic bacteria in the gut. We retrospectively examined 857 allo-HSCT recipients and found that treatment of neutropenic fever with imipenem-cilastatin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics was associated with increased GVHD-related mortality at 5 years (21.5% for imipenem-cilastatin-treated patients versus 13.1% for untreated patients, P = 0.025; 19.8% for piperacillin-tazobactam-treated patients versus 11.9% for untreated patients, P = 0.007). However, two other antibiotics also used to treat neutropenic fever, aztreonam and cefepime, were not associated with GVHD-related mortality (P = 0.78 and P = 0.98, respectively). Analysis of stool specimens from allo-HSCT recipients showed that piperacillin-tazobactam administration was associated with perturbation of gut microbial composition. Studies in mice demonstrated aggravated GVHD mortality with imipenem-cilastatin or piperacillin-tazobactam compared to aztreonam (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). We found pathological evidence for increased GVHD in the colon of imipenem-cilastatin-treated mice (P < 0.05), but no difference in the concentration of short-chain fatty  or numbers of regulatory T cells. Notably, imipenem-cilastatin treatment of mice with GVHD led to loss of the protective mucus lining of the colon (P < 0.01) and the compromising of intestinal barrier function (P < 0.05). Sequencing of mouse stool specimens showed an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila (P < 0.001), a commensal bacterium with mucus-degrading capabilities, raising the possibility that mucus degradation may contribute to murine GVHD. We demonstrate an underappreciated risk for the treatment of allo-HSCT recipients with antibiotics that may exacerbate GVHD in the colon.Copyright © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28542523>Impact of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy on the  microbiome of renal  recipients: Comparison between an everolimus- and a standard tacrolimus-based regimen.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is the full set of microbes living in the gastrointestinal tract and is emerging as an important dynamic/fluid system that, if altered by environmental, dietetic or pharmacological factors, could considerably influence drug response. However, the immunosuppressive drug-induced modifications of this system are still poorly defined.We employed an innovative bioinformatics approach to assess differences in the whole-gut microbial metagenomic profile of 20 renal  recipients undergoing maintenance treatment with two different immunosuppressive protocols. Nine patients were treated with everolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil (EVE+MMF group), and 11 patients were treated with a standard therapy with tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil (TAC+MMF group).A statistical analysis of comparative high-throughput data demonstrated that although similar according to the degree of Shannon diversity (alpha diversity) at the taxonomic level, three functional genes clearly discriminated EVE+MMF versus TAC+MMF (cutoff: log2 fold change≥1, FDR≤0.05). Flagellar motor switch protein (fliNY) and type IV pilus assembly protein pilM (pilM) were significantly enriched in TAC+MMF-treated patients, while macrolide transport system mrsA (msrA) was more abundant in patients treated with EVE+MMF. Finally, PERMANOVA revealed that among the variables analyzed and included in our model, only the consumption of sugar significantly influenced beta diversity.Our study, although performed on a relatively small number of patients, showed, for the first time, specific immunosuppressive-related effects on  microbiome of renal  recipients and it suggested that the analysis of the gut microbes community could represent a new tool to better understand the effects of drugs currently employed in organ transplantations.

Prebiotics can inhibit the growth of these pathogenic microbes by nourishing beneficial bacteria, while probiotics--live microorganisms--can balance the gut bacteria; thus, both together can maintain healthy bacteria in the gut. The present study was conducted to find the effect of probiotics and prebiotics in balancing the gut flora in a rodent model of autism linked with a clindamycin-induced altered gut. The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on oxidative stress markers in the brain were also evaluated. Eight groups of hamsters were assigned, with Group I serving as the control; Group II, as the autistic model, was treated with 250 mg propionic /kg BW/day for 3 days; Group III was treated with clindamycin 30 mg/kg BW for 3 days; Groups IV and V were treated with bee pollen and propolis (supposed prebiotics) at a dose of 250 mg/kg BW/day for 28 days; Group VI and Group VII were treated with Lactobacillus paracaseii and Protexin® (supposed probiotics) for 28 days; and finally, Group VIII was anorectally transplanted with stool from normal animals for 5 days. Remarkable changes were measured in oxidative stress markers, primarily glutathione and vitamin C, in the brains of hamsters in the propionic - and clindamycin-treated group.

Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, B., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

We hypothesized that children with ESRD have an altered intestinal  and increased serum levels of bacterially derived uremic toxins.Four groups of subjects were recruited: peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD), post-kidney  and healthy controls. Stool bacterial composition was assessed by pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-lactate, p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate were measured.Compared to controls, the relative abundance of Firmicutes (P = 0.0228) and Actinobacteria (P = 0.0040) was decreased in PD patients. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was increased in HD patients (P = 0.0462). Compared to HD patients the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (P = 0.0233) was increased in PD patients. At the family level, Enterobacteriaceae was significantly increased in PD patients (P = 0.0020) compared to controls; whereas, Bifidobacteria showed a significant decrease in PD and  patients (P = 0.0020) compared to control. Alpha diversity was decreased in PD patients and kidney  using both phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic diversity measures (P = 0.0031 and 0.0003, respectively), while beta diversity showed significant separation (R statistic = 0.2656, P = 0.010) between PD patients and controls.

To identify the core gut bacteria in healthy mice and explore their relationships with the host phenotypes would help to understand the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we identified 37 genus-level core bacteria from  of 101 healthy mice with different ages, sexes, and mouse strains in three previous studies. They collectively represented nearly half of the total sequences, and predominantly included carbohydrate- and amino -metabolizing bacteria and immunomodulatory bacteria.

For example, the abundances of Group C2 including probiotics  and  slightly positively correlated with those of Group C1. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analysis of variance test revealed that these core gut genera were distinguished with age and sex, and also associated with their health/disease state. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method showed that bacteria in Group C1 and C2/C3 increased with the age in infancy and early adulthood, and were more abundant in female mice than in male ones. The metabolic syndrome (MS) induced by high fat diet (HFD) and accelerated postnatal growth would decrease Group C2 genera, whereas probiotics intervention would reverse HFD-induced reduction of Group C2. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the principal components based on the abundance of the 37 core genera were significantly correlated with host characteristic parameters of MS.

Development of new therapies is needed to re-establish long-term immune tolerance in IBD patients without increasing the risk of opportunistic infections and cancer. Aberrant purinergic signaling pathways have been implicated in disordered thromboregulation and immune dysregulation, as noted in the pathogenesis of IBD and other gastrointestinal/hepatic autoimmune diseases. Expression of CD39 on endothelial or immune cells allows for homeostatic integration of hemostasis and immunity, which are disrupted in IBD. Our focus in this review is on novel aspects of the functions of CD39 and related NTPDases in IBD. Regulated CD39 activity allows for scavenging of extracellular nucleotides, the maintenance of P2-receptor integrity and coordination of adenosinergic signaling responses. CD39 together with CD73, serves as an integral component of the immunosuppressive machinery of dendritic cells, myeloid cells, T and B cells. Genetic inheritance and environental factors closely regulate the levels of expression and phosphohydrolytic activity of CD39, both on immune cells and released microparticles. Purinergic mechanisms associated with T regulatory and supressor T helper type 17 cells modulate disease activity in IBD, as can be modeled in experimental colitis. As a recent example, upregulation of CD39 is dependent upon ligation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), as with natural ligands such as bilirubin and 2-(1' H-indole-3'-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic  methyl ester (ITE). Decreased expression of CD39 and/or dysfunctional AHR signaling, however, abrogates the protective effects of immunosuppressive AHR ligands. These factors could also serve as biomarkers of disease activity in IBD. Heightened thrombosis, inflammation, and immune disturbances as seen in IBD appear to be associated with aberrant purinergic signaling. Ongoing development of therapeutic strategies augmenting CD39 ectonucleotidase bioactivity via cytokines or AHR ligands offers promise for management of thrombophilia, disordered inflammation, and aberrant immune reactivity in IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526488>Targeting the gut-liver axis in liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is widely implicated in the pathogenesis of liver diseases, where it is increasingly the focus of clinical research.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and    combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29742710>   treatment for refractory ulcerative colitis with allergy to 5-aminosalicylic : A case report.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) is currently being explored as a potential therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we report the first case of a UC patient with allergy to 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) who underwent FMT and achieved clinical remission.This patient had a 9-year history of UC and was allergic to 5-ASA. He suffered from gradually aggravated abdominal pain and frequent bloody diarrhea. There was a continuous distribution of superficial erosion and ulceration by colonoscopy. After steroid therapy failed, he underwent FMT. The donated  microbes were purified in laboratory and then transplanted into the terminal ileum and right colon of the patient by colonoscopy.

To understand the role of the gut microbiome and brain insulin resistance in these disorders, we evaluated behaviors and insulin action in brain of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) with and without antibiotic treatment. We find that DIO mice have behaviors reflective of increased anxiety and depression. This is associated with decreased insulin signaling and increased inflammation in in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Treatment with oral metronidazole or vancomycin decreases inflammation, improves insulin signaling in the brain and reduces signs of anxiety and depression. These effects are associated with changes in the levels of tryptophan, GABA, BDNF, amino , and multiple acylcarnitines, and are transferable to germ-free mice by  . Thus, changes in gut  can control brain insulin signaling and metabolite levels, and this leads to altered neurobehaviors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26799197>Novel prevention strategies for bacterial infections in cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Bacterial infections are a serious complication of cirrhosis, as they can lead to decompensation, multiple organ failure, and/or death. Preventing infections is therefore very relevant. Because gut bacterial translocation is their main pathogenic mechanism, prevention of infections is mostly based on the use of orally administered poorly absorbed antibiotics such as norfloxacin (selective intestinal decontamination). However, antibiotic prophylaxis leads to antibiotic resistance, limiting therapy and increasing morbidity and mortality. Prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhosis should therefore move away from antibiotics.This review focuses on various potentially novel methods to prevent infections in cirrhosis focusing on non-antibiotic strategies. The use of probiotics, nonselective intestinal decontamination with rifaximin, prokinetics and beta-blockers or    as means of targeting altered gut , bile  and FXR agonists are all potential alternatives to selective intestinal decontamination. Prokinetics and beta-blockers can improve intestinal motility, while bile  and FXR agonists help by improving the intestinal barrier. Finally, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and statins are emerging therapeutic strategies that may improve immune dysfunction in cirrhosis.Evidence for these strategies has been restricted to animal studies and proof-of concept studies but we expect this to change in coming years.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639376>The interplay among gut , hypertension and kidney diseases: The role of short-chain fatty .</a></h2><p>The bacteria community living in the gut maintains a symbiotic relationship with the host and its unbalance has been associated with progression of a wide range of intestinal and extra intestinal conditions. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely associated diseases with high incidence rates all over the world. Increasing data have supported the involvement of gut microbiome in the blood pressure regulation and the impairment of CKD prognosis. In hypertension, the reduced number of short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) producing bacteria is associated with modifications in gut environment, involving reduction of the hypoxic gut profile and worsening of the microbial balance, leading to a loss of epithelial barrier integrity, development of gut inflammation and the reduction of SCFAs plasma levels. These modifications compromise the blood pressure regulation and, as a consequence, favor the end organ damage, also affecting the kidneys. In CKD, impaired renal function leads to accumulation of high levels of uremic toxins that reach the intestine and cause alterations in bacteria composition and  metabolite profile, inducing a positive feedback that allows translocation of endotoxins into the bloodstream, which enhances local kidney inflammation and exacerbate kidney injury, compromising even more CKD prognosis. In line with these data, the use of prebiotics, probiotics and    are becoming efficient therapies to improve the gut dysbiosis aiming hypertension and CKD treatment. This review describes how changes in gut  composition can affect the development of hypertension and the progression of kidney diseases, highlighting the importance of the gut microbial composition uncovering to improve human health maintenance and, especially, for the development of new alternative therapies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile , SCFA and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut  and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics),  microbial , and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Microbial gut dysbiosis is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial    (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function,  composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial dysbiosis improvement after FMT was considered. However, there were no signs of patient clinical improvement. The need for an in-depth analysis of the donor´s stool and correct selection pre-FMT is evident.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586712>Loss of Gut  Alters Immune System Composition and Cripples Postinfarction Cardiac Repair.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut  on the regulation of host physiology has recently garnered considerable attention, particularly in key areas such as the immune system and metabolism. These areas are also crucial for the pathophysiology of and repair after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role of the gut  in the context of MI remains to be fully elucidated.To investigate the effects of gut  on cardiac repair after MI, C57BL/6J mice were treated with antibiotics 7 days before MI to deplete mouse gut . Flow cytometry was applied to examine the changes in immune cell composition in the heart. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted as a readout for changes in gut microbial composition. Short-chain fatty  (SCFA) species altered after antibiotic treatment were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography.  reconstitution,  of monocytes, or dietary SCFA or Lactobacillus probiotic supplementation was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of  on the mice after MI.Antibiotic-treated mice displayed drastic, dose-dependent mortality after MI. We observed an association between the gut  depletion and significant reductions in the proportion of myeloid cells and SCFAs, more specifically acetate, butyrate, and propionate. Infiltration of CX3CR1+ monocytes to the peri-infarct zone after MI was also reduced, suggesting impairment of repair after MI. Accordingly, the physiological status and survival of mice were significantly improved after  reconstitution,  of monocytes, or dietary SCFA supplementation. MI was associated with a reorganization of the gut microbial community such as a reduction in Lactobacillus. Supplementing antibiotic-treated mice with a Lactobacillus probiotic before MI restored myeloid cell proportions, yielded cardioprotective effects, and shifted the balance of SCFAs toward propionate.Gut -derived SCFAs play an important role in maintaining host immune composition and repair capacity after MI. This suggests that manipulation of these elements may provide opportunities to modulate pathological outcome after MI and indeed human health and disease as a whole.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29654837>Restoration of short chain fatty  and bile  metabolism following    in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.</a></h2><p>A significant proportion of individuals develop recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) following initial disease.    (FMT), a highly effective treatment method for recurrent CDI, has been demonstrated to induce  recovery. One of the proposed functions associated with restoration of colonization resistance against C. difficile has been recovery of bile  metabolism. In this study, we aimed to assess recovery of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in addition to bile  alongside microbial community structure in six patients with recurrent CDI following treatment with FMT over time. Using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing, we observed marked similarity of the  between recipients following FMT (n = 6, sampling up to 6 months post-FMT) and their respective donors. Sustained increases in the levels of the SCFAs butyrate, acetate, and propionate were observed post-FMT, and variable recovery over time was observed in the secondary bile  deoxycholate and lithocholate. To correlate these changes with specific microbial taxa at an individual level, we applied a generalized estimating equation approach to model metabolite concentrations with the presence of specific members of the . Metabolites that increased following FMT were associated with bacteria classified within the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and unclassified Clostridiales families.

Participants were assigned randomly (1:1) to groups that received FMT by capsules (induction dose of 30 capsules at week 4 and maintenance dose of 12 capsules at week 8) or placebo capsules. FMT capsules were derived from a single lean donor (BMI, 17.5 kg/m). Patients were followed up through week 26; the primary outcome was safety. Stool and serum samples were collected from patients at baseline and at weeks 1, 4, 6, 8, and 12 after administration of the first dose of FMT or placebo and analyzed by 16S RNA gene sequencing. Stool and serum samples were analyzed for metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additional outcomes were the change in area under the curve for GLP1 at week 12.We observed no significant differences in adverse events between patients who received FMT vs placebo. There was no increase in the area under the curve of GLP1 in either group. Patients who received FMT had sustained shifts in microbiomes associated with obesity toward those of the donor (P < .001). Patients who received FMT had a sustained decrease in stool levels of taurocholic  (P < .05) compared with baseline; bile  profiles began to resemble those of the donor more closely. We did not observe significant changes in mean BMI at week 12 in either group.In a placebo-controlled pilot study, we found that FMT capsules (derived from a lean donor) were safe but did not reduce BMI in obese metabolically uncompromised patients. The FMT capsules were well tolerated and led to sustained changes in the intestinal microbiome and bile  profiles that were similar to those of the lean donor.

Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the pivotal role played by CD44 in the regulation of EAE, a murine model of multiple sclerosis. In the current study, we determined whether these effects resulted from an alteration in gut  and the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production in CD44 knockout (CD44KO) mice.  transfer from naïve CD44KO but not C57BL/6 wild type (CD44WT) mice, into EAE-induced CD44WT mice, led to significant amelioration of EAE. High-throughput bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and biochemical analysis, revealed that EAE-induced CD44KO mice showed significant diversity, richness, and evenness when compared to EAE-induced CD44WT mice at the phylum level, with dominant Bacteroidetes (68.5%) and low Firmicutes (26.8%). Further, data showed a significant change in the abundance of SCFAs, propionic , and i-butyric  in EAE-CD44KO compared to EAE-CD44WT mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the attenuation of EAE seen following CD44 gene deletion in mice may result from alterations in the gut  and SCFAs.

Recent data indicates that exercise can also alter the gut , but little is known as to whether these changes affect host function. Here, we use a germ-free (GF) animal model to test whether exercise-induced modifications in the gut  can directly affect host responses to  colonization and chemically-induced colitis. Donor mice (n = 19) received access to a running wheel (n = 10) or remained without access (n = 9) for a period of six weeks.

First, mice were euthanized five weeks after the   and tissues were collected for analysis. A second cohort of GF mice were colonized by donor microbiotas for four weeks before dextran-sodium-sulfate was administered to induce acute colitis, after which mice were euthanized for tissue analysis. We observed that microbial  from donor (exercised or control) mice led to differences in  β-diversity, metabolite profiles, colon inflammation, and body mass in recipient mice five weeks after colonization. We also demonstrate that colonization of mice with a gut  from exercise-trained mice led to an attenuated response to chemical colitis, evidenced by reduced colon shortening, attenuated mucus depletion and augmented expression of cytokines involved in tissue regeneration.

A    procedure (FMTp), using  extracts from highly feed-efficient pigs, was performed in pregnant sows ( = 11), with a control group ( = 11) receiving no FMTp. At weaning, offspring were allocated, within sow treatment, to (i) control ( = 67; no dietary supplement) or (ii) inulin ( = 65; 6-week dietary inulin supplementation) treatments. The sow FMTp, alone or in combination with inulin supplementation in offspring, reduced offspring body weight by 8.1 to 10.6 kg at ∼140 days of age, but there was no effect on feed intake. It resulted in better FE, greater bacterial diversity, and higher relative abundances of potentially beneficial bacterial taxa ( and ) in offspring. Due to the FMTp and/or inulin supplementation, relative abundances of potential pathogens ( and ) in the ileum and cecal concentrations of butyric  were significantly lower. The maternal FMTp led to a greater number of jejunal goblet cells in offspring. Inulin supplementation alone did not affect growth or FE but upregulated duodenal genes linked to glucose and volatile fatty  homeostasis and increased the mean platelet volume but reduced ileal propionic  concentrations, granulocyte counts, and serum urea concentrations. Overall, the FMTp in pregnant sows, with or without dietary inulin supplementation in offspring, beneficially modulated offspring intestinal  (albeit mostly low-relative-abundance taxa) and associated physiological parameters. Although FE was improved, the detrimental effect on growth limits the application of this FMTp-inulin strategy in commercial pig production. As previous research suggests a link between  and FE, modulation of the intestinal microbiome may be effective in improving FE in pigs. The FMTp in gestating sows, alone or in combination with postweaning dietary inulin supplementation in offspring, achieved improvements in FE and resulted in a higher relative abundance of intestinal bacteria associated with fiber degradation and a lower relative abundance of potential pathogens. However, there was a detrimental effect on growth, although this may not be wholly attributable to  , as antibiotic and other interventions were also part of the FMT regimen. Therefore, further work with additional control groups is needed to disentangle the effects of each component of the FMTp in order to develop a regimen with practical applications in pig production.

In this study, we report the successful use of FMT for the treatment of recurrent D-LA in a child who was unresponsive to conventional therapies. Importantly, we also present profiles of the enteric , as well as  D-/L-lactic  metabolites, before and longitudinally after FMT. These data provide valuable insight into the putative mechanisms of D-LA pathogenesis and its treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514066>Lactobacillus gasseri in the Upper Small Intestine Impacts an ACSL3-Dependent Fatty -Sensing Pathway Regulating Whole-Body Glucose Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL)-dependent upper small intestinal lipid metabolism activates pre-absorptive pathways to regulate metabolic homeostasis, but whether changes in the upper small intestinal  alter specific fatty -dependent pathways to impact glucose homeostasis remains unknown. We here first find that upper small intestinal infusion of Intralipid, oleic , or linoleic  pre-absorptively increases glucose tolerance and lowers glucose production in rodents. High-fat feeding impairs pre-absorptive fatty  sensing and reduces upper small intestinal Lactobacillus gasseri levels and ACSL3 expression.  of healthy upper small intestinal  to high-fat-fed rodents restores L. gasseri levels and fatty  sensing via increased ACSL3 expression, while L. gasseri probiotic administration to non-transplanted high-fat-fed rodents is sufficient to restore upper small intestinal ACSL3 expression and fatty  sensing.

An inadequate immune response against bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract is the basic mechanism mediating the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The risk of IBD is partially heritable and approximately 12 % of patients have a family history of IBD. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were able to identify 240 genetic regions associated with IBD. Many of the implicated genes have a function in the immune system, are associated with primary immunodeficiencies or the defense against mycobacteria. Together these 240 genetic regions form an excellent framework for further investigations into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD. However, GWAS so far were able to unravel only a fraction of the genetic IBD risk. New strategies like genome wide sequencing are currently used to identify additional (rare) genetic variants. In rare cases, IBD is also inherited as a monogenetic disease. Moreover, there likely is significant interaction between genes and environmental factors which can only be unraveled if both, genes and the environment are simultaneously considered. Interestingly, the information provided by genetic risk factors for IBD is unable to predict the clinical course of IBD. New GWAS therefore focus on IBD prognosis and first insights have already been made. The gastrointestinal tract harbors a huge number of microorganisms (). It remains an enormous challenge for the immune system to contain this bacterial load while enabling the host to benefit from the many essential contributions of the . In IBD, the  is altered to a dysfunctional (dysbiotic) state showing reduced diversity and a higher amount of potential pathogenic Proteobacteriae, such as Escherichia coli. In IBD, the  is also more dynamic in its composition over time compared to health. Further, IBD dysbiosis is more pronounced in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In animal experiments, dysbiosis could be transferred by    from one mouse to another, triggering inflammation in the recipient. In contrast, a healthy  can downregulate the immune response of the host, for instance by bacterial short chain fatty  (SCFA) synthesis. In addition, some bacteria with close physical contact to the intestinal wall also have specific immunosuppressive properties. So far, the highly complex network of , genetics, immune system and environment is only partially understood. The  is a potential therapeutic target which up to now can only be non-specifically influenced by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or   .

Deleterious changes to the composition or number of gut bacteria, commonly referred to as gut dysbiosis, has been linked to the development and progression of numerous diet-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most CVD risk factors, including aging, obesity, certain dietary patterns, and a sedentary lifestyle, have been shown to induce gut dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal inflammation and reduced integrity of the gut barrier, which in turn increases circulating levels of bacterial structural components and microbial metabolites that may facilitate the development of CVD. The aim of the current review is to summarize the available data regarding the role of the gut microbiome in regulating CVD function and disease processes. Particular emphasis is placed on nutrition-related alterations in the microbiome, as well as the underlying cellular mechanisms by which the microbiome may alter CVD risk.Copyright © 2018.

The development of a stable and diverse gut  is essential to various host physiologic functions such as immunoregulation, pathogen prevention, energy harvest, and metabolism. At the same time, a dysbiotic gut  associated with disease is altered in structure and function, and often characterized by a decrease in species richness and proliferation of pathogenic bacterial taxa. As a shared substrate between the host and the gut , diet significantly impacts the health and disease states of the host both directly and through gut microbial metabolite production. This is demonstrated in the examples of short-chain fatty  and trimethylamine production via bacterial metabolism of dietary complex carbohydrates and choline, respectively. In disorders related to mucosal immune dysregulation such as inflammatory bowel disease, the dysbiotic gut  and diet contribute to its pathogenesis. Reversal of dysbiosis through    and dietary interventions may thus represent important strategies to modify the gut  and its metabolite production for health maintenance as well as disease prevention and management.© 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

NAFLD may progress to fibrosis, compensated cirrhosis, advanced cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, definitive medical treatment has not been established, with the exception of lifestyle modification with exercise. Because of the direct connection via portal vein between the intestines and the liver (gut-gut -liver axis), gut  and associated dysbiosis have been known as regulators in the pathophysiology of NAFLD.

This review focuses on the available evidences for new therapies modulating gut  in the management and the prevention of NAFLD.

While mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood, most models rely on the viability of transplanted microbes. We hypothesised that protocols commonly used in the preparation of faecal  will substantially reduce the number, diversity and functional potential of viable microbes.Stools from eight screened donors were processed under strict anaerobic conditions, in ambient air, and freeze-thawed. Propidium monoazide (PMA) sample treatment was combined with quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) analysis to define the viable  composition and functional potential.Approximately 50% of bacterial content of stool processed immediately under strict anaerobic conditions was non-viable. Homogenisation in ambient air or freeze-thaw reduced viability to 19% and 23% respectively. Processing of samples in ambient air resulted in up to 12-fold reductions in the abundance of important commensal taxa, including the highly butyrogenic species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Subdoligranulum variable, and Eubacterium hallii. The adverse impact of atmospheric oxygen exposure on the capacity of the transplanted  to support SCFA biosynthesis was demonstrated by significantly reduced butyrate and acetate production by faecal slurries processed in ambient air. In contrast, while reducing overall levels of viable bacteria, freeze-thaw did not significantly alter viable  composition.The practice of preparing material for faecal  in ambient air profoundly affects viable microbial content, disproportionately reducing the abundance of anaerobic commensals and the capacity for biosynthesis of important anti-inflammatory metabolites.

One way in which the risk for PCOS may be increased in daughters of affected women is through exposure to elevated androgens in utero. Hyperandrogenemic conditions have serious health consequences, including increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been found to induce hypertension in rats, such that blood pressure can be normalized through  microbial . Therefore, we hypothesized that the hypertension seen in PCOS has early origins in gut dysbiosis caused by in utero exposure to excess androgen. We investigated this hypothesis with a model of prenatal androgen (PNA) exposure and maternal hyperandrogenemia by single-injection of testosterone cypionate or sesame oil vehicle (VEH) to pregnant dams in late gestation. We then completed a gut  and cardiometabolic profile of the adult female offspring.The metabolic assessment revealed that adult PNA rats had increased body weight and increased mRNA expression of adipokines: adipocyte binding protein 2, adiponectin, and leptin in inguinal white adipose tissue. Radiotelemetry analysis revealed hypertension with decreased heart rate in PNA animals. The   profile of PNA animals contained higher relative abundance of bacteria associated with steroid hormone synthesis, Nocardiaceae and Clostridiaceae, and lower abundance of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Clostridium. The PNA animals also had an increased relative abundance of bacteria associated with biosynthesis and elongation of unsaturated short chain fatty  (SCFAs).We found that prenatal exposure to excess androgen negatively impacted cardiovascular function by increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreasing heart rate. Prenatal androgen was also associated with gut microbial dysbiosis and altered abundance of bacteria involved in metabolite production of short chain fatty . These results suggest that early-life exposure to hyperandrogenemia in daughters of women with PCOS may lead to long-term alterations in gut  and cardiometabolic function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28767077>Gut-Liver Axis Derangement in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent type of chronic liver disease in the pediatric age group, paralleling an obesity pandemic. A "multiple-hit" hypothesis has been invoked to explain its pathogenesis. The "first hit" is liver lipid accumulation in obese children with insulin resistance. In the absence of significant lifestyle modifications leading to weight loss and increased physical activity, other factors may act as "second hits" implicated in liver damage progression leading to more severe forms of inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. In this regard, the gut-liver axis (GLA) seems to play a central role. Principal players are the gut , its bacterial products, and the intestinal barrier. A derangement of GLA (namely, dysbiosis and altered intestinal permeability) may promote bacteria/bacterial product translocation into portal circulation, activation of inflammation via toll-like receptors signaling in hepatocytes, and progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH). Among other factors a relevant role has been attributed to the farnesoid X receptor, a nuclear transcriptional factor activated from bile  chemically modified by gut  (GM) enzymes. The individuation and elucidation of GLA derangement in NAFLD pathomechanisms is of interest at all ages and especially in pediatrics to identify new therapeutic approaches in patients recalcitrant to lifestyle changes. Specific targeting of gut  via pre-/probiotic supplementation,  , and farnesoid X receptor modulation appear promising.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634282>Sex-Dependent Effects of Cadmium Exposure in Early Life on Gut  and Fat Accumulation in Mice.</a></h2><p>Environmental cadmium, with a high average dietary intake, is a severe public health risk. However, the long-term health implications of environmental exposure to cadmium in different life stages remain unclear.We investigated the effects of early exposure to cadmium, at an environmentally relevant dosage, on adult metabolism and the mechanism of action.We established mouse models with low-dose cadmium (LDC) exposure in early life to examine the long-term metabolic consequences. Intestinal flora measurement by 16S rDNA sequencing, microbial ecological analyses, and    was conducted to explore the potential underlying mechanisms.Early LDC exposure (100 nM) led to fat accumulation in adult male mice. Hepatic genes profiling revealed that fatty  and lipid metabolic processes were elevated. Gut  were perturbed by LDC to cause diversity reduction and compositional alteration. Time-series studies indicated that the gut flora at early-life stages, especially at 8 weeks, were vulnerable to LDC and that an alteration during this period could contribute to the adult adiposity, even if the  recovered later. The importance of intestinal bacteria in LDC-induced fat accumulation was further confirmed through   and removal experiments. Moreover, the metabolic effects of LDC were observed only in male, but not female, mice.An environmental dose of cadmium at early stages of life causes gut  alterations, accelerates hepatic lipid metabolism, and leads to life-long metabolic consequences in a sex-dependent manner.

Most published literature and guidelines address treatment rather than prevention, yet this approach may be too downstream to limit morbidity and mortality from the disease and its complications. Mechanisms to prevent CDI successfully include reducing modifiable risk factors and minimizing horizontal transmission of C. difficile spores between patients and the health care environment. Because CDI prevention is characterized by a bundled approach, it is difficult to quantify the individual impact of any one element; however, a number of patient- and facility-level strategies can be considered for CDI prevention. Robust hygiene strategies, diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship, and particular prophylaxis maneuvers such as continuation of oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin in the setting of systemic antibiotics have all demonstrated benefit. The preventive roles of deprescribing  suppressants, routine use of probiotics, or early    remain unclear.

Here, we investigated the effect of exogenous   on gut function from the perspective of analysis of the mucosal proteomes in a piglet model. A total of 289 differentially expressed proteins were annotated with 4,068 gene ontology (GO) function entries in the intestinal mucosa, and the levels of autophagy-related proteins in the forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway were increased whereas the levels of proteins related to inflammation response were decreased in the recipient. Then, to assess the alleviation of epithelial injury in the Escherichia coli K88-infected piglets following FMT, intestinal microbiome-metabolome responses were determined. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the abundances of beneficial bacteria, such as  and , were increased whereas those of  and  bacteria were decreased in the infected piglets following FMT. Metabolomic analysis revealed that levels of 58 metabolites, such as lactic  and succinic , were enhanced in the intestinal lumen and that seven metabolic pathways, such as branched-chain amino  metabolism pathways, were upregulated in the infected piglets following FMT. In concordance with the metabolome data, results of metagenomics prediction analysis also demonstrated that FMT modulated the metabolic functions of gut  associated with linoleic  metabolism. In addition, intestinal morphology was improved, a result that coincided with the decrease of intestinal permeability and the enhancement of mucins and mucosal expression of tight junction proteins in the recipient. Taken together, the results showed that FMT triggered intestinal mucosal protective autophagy and alleviated gut barrier injury through alteration of the gut microbial structure.  The gut  plays a crucial role in human and animal health, and its disorder causes multiple diseases. Over the past decade, FMT has gained increasing attention due to the success in treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although FMT appears to be effective, how FMT functions in the recipient remains unknown. Whether FMT exerts this beneficial effect through a series of changes in the host organism caused by alteration of gut microbial structure is also not known. In the present study, newborn piglets and E. coli K88-infected piglets were selected as models to explore the interplay between host and gut  following FMT. Our results showed that FMT triggered intestinal mucosal autophagy and alleviated gut barrier injury caused by E. coli K88.

An important, however often underappreciated, characteristic of probiotics is that individual strains may have different, even opposing, effects on the host. This strain specificity exists also within the same species. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms at the strain level is therefore crucial for the selection of suitable probiotic strains.The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanisms employed by specific probiotic strains of the Lactobacillus and the Bifidobacterium genuses, which showed efficacy in the treatment of obesity and T2D. Some probiotic strains employ recurring beneficial effects, including the production of anti-microbial lactic , while other strains display highly unique features, such as hydrolysis of tannins.A major obstacle in the evaluation of probiotic strains lays in the great number of strains, differences in detection methodology and measured outcome parameters. The understanding of further research should be directed towards the development of standardized evaluation methods to facilitate the comparison of different studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219825> and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: promising prospects for clinical interventions?</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most important cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries but no pharmacological therapy is currently available. Growing evidence suggests that the  plays a role in the occurrence and evolution of this disease, namely through the production of bioactive metabolites.Omics technologies (metagenomic, metabolomic, and phenomic data) allow providing a robust prediction of steatosis. More than just correlations, causative effects of certain bacterial metabolites have been evidenced in vitro and in rodent models. Butyrate has been shown to be a potent metabolic and inflammatory modulator in the liver. Several aromatic amino- such as phenylacetic , imidazole propionate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic inflammation, whereas indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-acetate) seem to preserve liver integrity. Current clinical trials aim at evaluating the efficacy of novel approaches (functional foods, prebiotic and probiotics, and  microbial ).The  brings new hopes in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adequate intervention studies in targeted patients are needed to unravel the relevance of such approaches in the management of those liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29380645>Variations in diet cause alterations in  and metabolites that follow changes in disease severity in a multiple sclerosis model.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a metabolically demanding disease involving immune-mediated destruction of myelin in the central nervous system. We previously demonstrated a significant alteration in disease course in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) preclinical model of MS due to diet. Based on the established crosstalk between metabolism and gut , we took an unbiased sampling of , in the stool, and metabolites, in the serum and stool, from mice (Mus musculus) on the two different diets, the Teklad global soy protein-free extruded rodent diet (irradiated diet) and the Teklad sterilisable rodent diet (autoclaved diet). Within the , the genus Lactobacillus was found to be inversely correlated with EAE severity. Therapeutic treatment with Lactobacillus paracasei resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of disease, clinical scores and the amount of weight loss in EAE mice. Within the metabolites, we identified shifts in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic  cycle that may explain the differences in disease severity between the different diets in EAE. This work begins to elucidate the relationship between diet,  and metabolism in the EAE preclinical model of MS and identifies targets for further study with the goal to more specifically probe the complex metabolic interaction at play in EAE that may have translational relevance to MS patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329806>Understanding the mechanisms of faecal  .</a></h2><p>This Review summarizes mechanistic investigations in faecal   (FMT), which has increasingly been adapted into clinical practice as treatment for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that cannot be eliminated with antibiotics alone. Administration of healthy donor faecal  in this clinical situation results in its engraftment and restoration of normal gut microbial community structure and functionality. In this Review, we consider several main mechanisms for FMT effectiveness in treatment of CDI, including direct competition of C. difficile with commensal  delivered by FMT, restoration of secondary bile  metabolism in the colon and repair of the gut barrier by stimulation of the mucosal immune system. Some of these mechanistic insights suggest possibilities for developing novel, next-generation CDI therapeutics. FMT might also have potential applications for non-CDI indications. The gut can become a reservoir of other potential antibiotic-resistant pathogens under pressure of antibiotic treatments, and restoration of normal microbial community structure by FMT might be a promising approach to protect against infections with these pathogens as well. Finally, FMT could be considered for multiple chronic diseases that are associated with some form of dysbiosis. However, considerable research is needed to optimize the FMT protocols for such applications before their therapeutic promise can be evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178233>Mechanistic and therapeutic advances in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by targeting the gut .</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common metabolic diseases currently in the context of obesity worldwide, which contains a spectrum of chronic liver diseases, including hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic carcinoma. In addition to the classical "Two-hit" theory, NAFLD has been recognized as a typical gut -related disease because of the intricate role of gut  in maintaining human health and disease formation. Moreover, gut  is even regarded as a "metabolic organ" that play complementary roles to that of liver in many aspects. The mechanisms underlying gut -mediated development of NAFLD include modulation of host energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and bile  and choline metabolism. As a result, gut  have been emerging as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD by manipulating it in various ways, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics,   , and herbal components. In this review, we summarized the most recent advances in gut -mediated mechanisms, as well as gut -targeted therapies on NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815845>Neuroprotection of Fasting Mimicking Diet on MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Gut  and Metabolites.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is strongly associated with life style, especially dietary habits, which have gained attention as disease modifiers. Here, we report a fasting mimicking diet (FMD), fasting 3 days followed by 4 days of refeeding for three 1-week cycles, which accelerated the retention of motor function and attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), known to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons, were increased in PD mice after FMD, suggesting an involvement of BDNF in FMD-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, FMD decreased the number of glial cells as well as the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in PD mice, showing that FMD also inhibited neuro-inflammation. 16S and 18S rRNA sequencing of   showed that FMD treatment modulated the shifts in gut  composition, including higher abundance of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Opisthokonta and lower abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level in PD mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that FMD modulated the MPTP-induced lower propionic  and isobutyric , and higher butyric  and valeric  and other metabolites.  of  , from normal mice with FMD treatment to antibiotic-pretreated PD mice increased dopamine levels in the recipient PD mice, suggesting that gut  contributed to the neuroprotection of FMD for PD.

There have been many well-conducted randomized controlled trials and thousands of patients reported in case series that describe success rates of approximately 90% following one or more FMT. Although the exact mechanisms of FMT have yet to be fully elucidated, replacement or restoration of a 'normal'  (or at least a  resembling those who have never had CDI) appears to have a positive effect on the gut dysbiosis that is thought to exist in these patients. Furthermore, despite being aesthetically unappealing, this 'ultimate probiotic' is a particularly attractive solution to a difficult problem that avoids repeated courses of antibiotics. The lack of clarity about the exact mechanism of action and the 'active ingredient' of FMT (e.g., individual or communities of bacteria, bacteriophage, or bioactive molecules such as bile ) has hindered the ability to produce a standardized and well-characterized FMT product. There is no standard method to produce material for FMT, and there are a multitude of factors that can vary between institutions that offer this therapy. Only a few studies have directly compared clinical efficacy in groups of patients who have been treated with FMT prepared differently (e.g., fresh vs. frozen) or administered by different route (e.g., by nasojejunal tube, colonoscopy or by oral administration of encapsulated product). More of these studies should be undertaken to clarify the superiority or otherwise of these variables. This review describes the methods and protocols that two English NHS hospitals independently adopted over the same time period to provide FMT for patients with recurrent CDI. There are several fundamental differences in the methods used, including selection and testing of donors, procedures for preparation and storage of material, and route of administration. These methods are described in detail in this review highlighting differing practice. Despite these significant methodological variations, clinical outcomes in terms of cure rate appear to be remarkably similar for both FMT providers. Although both hospitals have treated only modest numbers of patients, these findings suggest that many of the described differences may not be critical factors in influencing the success of the procedure. As FMT is increasingly being proposed for a number of conditions other than CDI, harmonization of methods and techniques may be more critical to the success of FMT, and thus it will be important to standardize these as far as practically possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27404502> : What Is Being Transferred?</a></h2><p>  are increasingly utilized for treatment of recurrent infections (i.e., Clostridium difficile) in the human gut and as a general research tool for gain-of-function experiments (i.e., gavage of  pellets) in animal models. Changes observed in the recipient's biology are routinely attributed to bacterial cells in the donor  (~1011 per gram of human wet stool). Here, we examine the literature and summarize findings on the composition of  matter in order to raise cautiously the profile of its multipart nature. In addition to viable bacteria, which may make up a small fraction of total  matter, other components in unprocessed human  include colonocytes (~107 per gram of wet stool), archaea (~108 per gram of wet stool), viruses (~108 per gram of wet stool), fungi (~106 per gram of wet stool), protists, and metabolites.

Furthermore, the potential implications for host physiology of these FMT-related changes in gut bile  metabolism are also not well explored. In this study, we investigated the impact of FMT for rCDI upon signalling through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Herein, we identify that in addition to restoration of gut  and bile  profiles, FMT for rCDI is accompanied by a significant, sustained increase in circulating levels of FGF19 and reduction in FGF21. These FGF changes were associated with weight gain post-FMT, to a level not exceeding the pre-rCDI baseline. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the restoration of gut microbial communities by FMT for rCDI is associated with an upregulated FXR-FGF pathway, and highlight the potential systemic effect of FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30310254>Focus on the gut-brain axis: Multiple sclerosis, the intestinal barrier and the microbiome.</a></h2><p>The brain-gut axis serves as the bidirectional connection between the gut microbiome, the intestinal barrier and the immune system that might be relevant for the pathophysiology of inflammatory demyelinating diseases.

Experimental evidence suggests that these changes can lead to profound alterations of peripheral and central nervous system immune regulation. Besides being of pathophysiological interest, the brain-gut axis could also open new avenues of therapeutic targets.

Probiotics are powerful weapons to combat metabolic disturbance and intestinal dysbiosis. Previously we isolated a Lactobacillus strain named DM9218 that could reduce the serum uric  (UA) level by assimilating purine nucleosides. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of DM9218 on high-fructose-induced hyperuricemia and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Mice were fed a normal diet, a high-fructose diet, or high-fructose diet with DM9218. Metabolic parameters, fructose- and UA-related metabolites, and   were investigated. Whole-genome sequencing of strain DM9218 was also conducted. In addition, an inosine hydrolase from DM9218 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and its inosine-degrading activity was detected.Our results indicated that DM9218 could decrease serum UA level and hepatic xanthine oxidase activity in fructose-fed mice. It could protect against high-fructose-induced liver damage and retard UA accumulation by degrading inosine. The modulation effect of DM9218 on high-fructose-induced intestinal dysbiosis resulted in enhancement of intestinal barrier function and reduction of liver lipopolysaccharide, which was closely correlated with the down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine-stimulated xanthine oxidase expression and activity.Lactobacillus brevis DM9218 is a probiotic strain with the potential to ameliorate fructose-induced hyperuricemia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Experts from academia and industry examined interactions of prebiotics, probiotics, or vitamins with the gut microbiome in health and disease, the development of the microbiome in early-life and the role of the microbiome on the gut-brain axis. The gut  changes dramatically during pregnancy and intrinsic factors (such as stress), in addition to extrinsic factors (such as diet, and drugs) influence the composition and activity of the gut microbiome throughout life. Microbial metabolites, e.g. short-chain fatty  affect gut-brain signaling and the immune response.

Not only improvements in endoscopic techniques, but also advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, have expanded knowledge of how intestinal diseases develop. This review discusses how the host interacts with intestinal  by the direct contact of host receptors with highly conserved structural motifs or molecules of microbes and also by microbe-derived metabolites (produced by the microbe during adaptation to the gut environment), such as short-chain fatty , vitamins, bile  and amino . These metabolites are recognised by metabolite-sensing receptors expressed by immune cells to influence functions of macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells, such as migration, conversion and maintenance of regulatory T cells and regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production, which is essential for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and the development of intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases. First interventions in these complex interactions between microbe-derived metabolites and the host immune system for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, such as modification of the diet, treatment with antibiotics, application of probiotics and faecal  , have been introduced into the clinic. Specific targeting of metabolite sensing receptors for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases is in development.

These -mediated mechanisms were previously identified by observing loss of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment or dietary changes, which severely disrupt  communities. We identify a -mediated mechanism of colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) by comparing high-complexity commensal communities with different levels of colonization resistance. Using inbred mouse strains with different infection dynamics and S.

Propionate directly inhibits pathogen growth in vitro by disrupting intracellular pH homeostasis, and chemically increasing intestinal propionate levels protects mice from S. Typhimurium. In addition, administering susceptible mice Bacteroides, but not a propionate-production mutant, confers resistance to S. Typhimurium.

In this study, we aimed to unravel the role of both intestinal barrier integrity and  in NAFLD/NASH development.C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient diet for 1 week or longer to recapitulate aspects of NASH (steatosis, inflammation, insulin resistance). Genetic and pharmacological strategies were then used to modulate intestinal barrier integrity.We show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier (GVB) are early events in NASH pathogenesis. Mice fed HFD for only 1 week undergo a diet-induced dysbiosis that drives GVB damage and bacterial translocation into the liver.    from HFD-fed mice into specific pathogen-free recipients induces GVB damage and epididymal adipose tissue enlargement. GVB disruption depends on interference with the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by genetic intervention driving β-catenin activation only in endothelial cells, preventing GVB disruption and NASH development. The bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  (OCA) drives β-catenin activation in endothelial cells. Accordingly, pharmacologic intervention with OCA protects against GVB disruption, both as a preventive and therapeutic agent. Importantly, we found upregulation of the GVB leakage marker in the colon of patients with NASH.We have identified a new player in NASH development, the GVB, whose damage leads to bacteria or bacterial product translocation into the blood circulation. Treatment aimed at restoring β-catenin activation in endothelial cells, such as administration of OCA, protects against GVB damage and NASH development.The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier are early events in the development of NASH. We show that the drug obeticholic  protects against barrier disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Lipid peroxidation procedurally appears, ferroptosis, apoptosis and necrosis are often induced, subsequently, mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and even cell death occur. As a result, the intestinal epithelial cells are destroyed, leading to the incompleteness of intestinal mechanical barrier. Simultaneously, iron supplement can change the compositions and metabolic processes of intestinal microbes, and the intestinal inflammatory may be worsened. In principle, the easier dissociation of Fe from oral iron supplements is, the more serious intestinal inflammation will occur. Fortunately, some interventions have been developed to alleviate these side effects. For instance, some antioxidants e.g. VE and ferulic  have been used to prevent the formation of free radicals or to neutralize the formed free radicals.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension.

In this review, we underscore specific pathways and mechanisms by which the gut microbiome can promote the development of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. First, we review the involvement of the stress response and immune system activation in the development of depression and anxiety. Then, we examine germ-free murine models used to uncover the role of the gut microbiome in developing and modulating pertinent activity in the brain and the immune system. We also document multiple pathways by which stress-induced inflammation harms brain function and ultimately affects mental health, and review how probiotic and prebiotic treatments have shown to be beneficial.

Remarkably,    (FMT) reduced gut microbial dysbiosis, decreased  SCFAs, alleviated physical impairment, and increased striatal DA and 5-HT content of PD mice. Further, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra, and reduced expression of TLR4/TNF-α signaling pathway components in gut and brain. Our study demonstrates that gut microbial dysbiosis is involved in PD pathogenesis, and FMT can protect PD mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing TLR4/TNF-α signaling.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Alistipes and Blautia, were positively correlated with colonic melatonin receptor expression in FMT rats. Additionally, acetate and propionate significantly increased melatonin receptor-1 expression in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, the gut  may promote melatonin receptor expression, and the mechanism may involve the action of SCFAs. This finding may facilitate the development of new therapeutic treatments for various gastrointestinal disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29793999>The  of ω3 PUFA-Altered Gut  of fat-1 Mice to Wild-Type Littermates Prevents Obesity and Associated Metabolic Disorders.</a></h2><p>Altering the gut microbiome may be beneficial to the host and recently arose as a promising strategy to manage obesity. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)-mediated alterations in the  to metabolic parameter changes in mice. Four groups were compared: male fat-1 transgenic mice (with constitutive production of ω3 PUFAs) and male wild-type (WT) littermates fed an obesogenic (high fat/high sucrose [HFHS]) or a control diet. Unlike WT mice, HFHS-fed fat-1 mice were protected against obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. Unlike WT mice, fat-1 mice maintained a normal barrier function, resulting in a significantly lower metabolic endotoxemia. The fat-1 mice displayed greater phylogenic diversity in the cecum, and    from fat-1 to WT mice was able to reverse weight gain and to normalize glucose tolerance and intestinal permeability. We concluded that the ω3 PUFA-mediated alteration of gut  contributed to the prevention of metabolic syndrome in fat-1 mice. It occurred independently of changes in the PUFA content of host tissues and may represent a promising strategy to prevent metabolic disease and preserve a lean phenotype.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28140325>Gut  in Obesity and Undernutrition.</a></h2><p>Malnutrition is the result of an inadequate balance between energy intake and energy expenditure that ultimately leads to either obesity or undernutrition.

The gut  exists in a symbiotic relationship with its host, playing a decisive role in the host's nutrition, immunity and metabolism. Accumulating studies have revealed the associations between gut dysbiosis or some special bacteria and various cancers. Emerging data suggest that gut  can modulate the effectiveness of cancer therapies, especially immunotherapy. Manipulating the microbial populations with therapeutic intent has become a hot topic of cancer research, and the most dramatic manipulation of gut  refers to    (FMT) from healthy individuals to patients. FMT has demonstrated remarkable clinical efficacy against Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and it is highly recommended for the treatment of recurrent or refractory CDI. Lately, interest is growing in the therapeutic potential of FMT for other diseases, including cancers. We briefly reviewed the current researches about gut  and its link to cancer, and then summarized the recent preclinical and clinical evidence to indicate the potential of FMT in cancer management as well as cancer-treatment associated complications. We also presented the rationale of FMT for cancer management such as reconstruction of intestinal , amelioration of bile  metabolism, and modulation of immunotherapy efficacy.

Capsaicin (CAP) is the major pungent bioactivator in chili peppers and has potent anti-obesity functions, yet the mechanisms linking this effect to gut  remain obscure. Here we show that mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with CAP exhibit lower levels of metabolic endotoxemia and CLGI associated with lower body weight gain. High-resolution responses of the  were examined by 16S rRNA sequencing, short-chain fatty  (SCFA) measurements, and phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis. The results showed, among others, that dietary CAP induced increased levels of butyrate-producing  and , while it caused lower levels of members of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing family S24_7. Predicted function analysis (PICRUSt) showed depletion of genes involved in bacterial LPS synthesis in response to CAP. We further identified that inhibition of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB) by CAP also contributes to prevention of HFD-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Importantly,    experiments conducted in germfree mice demonstrated that dietary CAP-induced protection against HFD-induced obesity is transferrable. Moreover,  depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block the CAP-induced protective phenotype against obesity, further suggesting the role of  in this context. Together, our findings uncover an interaction between dietary CAP and gut  as a novel mechanism for the anti-obesity effect of CAP acting through prevention of microbial dysbiosis, gut barrier dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Metabolic endotoxemia due to gut microbial dysbiosis is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI), which primarily mediates the development of obesity. A dietary strategy to reduce endotoxemia appears to be an effective approach for addressing the issue of obesity. Capsaicin (CAP) is the major pungent component in red chili (genus ). Little is known about the role of gut  in the anti-obesity effect of CAP. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that CAP significantly increased butyragenic bacteria and decreased LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., members of the S24-7 family) and LPS biosynthesis. By using antibiotics and  , we prove that gut  plays a causal role in dietary CAP-induced protective phenotype against high-fat-diet-induced CLGI and obesity. Moreover, CB inhibition was partially involved in the beneficial effect of CAP. Together, these data suggest that the gut microbiome is a critical factor for the anti-obesity effects of CAP.Copyright © 2017 Kang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572201>Xanthoceraside Could Ameliorate Alzheimer's Disease Symptoms of Rats by Affecting the Gut  Composition and Modulating the Endogenous Metabolite Levels.</a></h2><p>Xanthoceraside (XAN) is a natural-derived compound with anti-Alzheimer activity from the husks of . Although its therapeutic effect had been confirmed in previous studies, the mechanism was still unclear due to its poor solubility and low permeability. In this study, the pharmacological effect of XAN on Alzheimer's disease (AD) was confirmed by behavior experiments and H&E staining observation.    (FMT) experiment also replicated the therapeutic effects, which indicates the potential targets of XAN on gut . The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes in  samples demonstrated that XAN reversed gut  dysbiosis in AD animals. XAN could change the relative abundances of several phyla and genus of bacterial, particularly the ratio of . Among them, , , , and  had been reported to be involved in the pathologic developments of AD and other central nervous system disease. In metabolomics study, a series of host endogenous metabolites were detected, including amino , lysophosphatidylcholine, dihydrosphingosine, phytosphingosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine, which were all closely associated with the development of AD. Combined with the Spearman's correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the increases of five bacterial strains and decreases of six bacterial strains were closely correlated with the increases of nine host metabolites and the decreases of another five host metabolites. Therefore, XAN can modulate the structure of gut  in AD rats; the changes of gut  were significantly correlated with endogenous metabolites, and symptom of AD was ultimately alleviated. Our findings suggest that XAN may be a potential therapeutic drug for AD, and the gut  may be potential targeting territory of XAN  microbiome-gut-brain pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Tai, Xu, Lu and Meng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31354670>   From Highly Feed Efficient Donors Affects Cecal Physiology and  in Low- and High-Feed Efficient Chickens.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) may be used to improve chicken's feed efficiency (FE) via modulation of the intestinal  and microbe-host signaling. This study investigated the effect of the administration of FMT from highly feed efficient donors early in life on the jejunal and cecal , visceral organ size, intestinal morphology, permeability, and expression of genes for nutrient transporters, barrier function and innate immune response in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; a metric for FE). Chicks ( = 110) were inoculated with the FMT or control  (CT) on 1, 6, and 9 days posthatch (dph), from which 56 chickens were selected on 30 dph as the extremes in RFI, resulting in 15 low and 13 high RFI chickens receiving the FMT and 14 low and 14 high RFI chickens receiving the CT. RFI rank and FMT only caused tendencies for alterations in the jejunal  and only one unclassified  genus in cecal digesta was indicative of high RFI. By contrast, the FMT caused clear differences in the short-chain fatty  (SCFA) profile in the crop and cecal  composition compared to the CT, which indicated alterations in amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria such as , , and . Moreover, the FMT caused alterations in intestinal development as indicated by the longer duodenum and shallower crypts in the ceca. From the observed RFI-associated variation, energy-saving mechanisms and moderation of the mucosal immune response were indicated by higher jejunal permeability, shorter villi in the ileum, and enhanced cecal expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  in low RFI chickens. Relationships obtained from supervised multigroup data integration support that certain bacteria, including , and unclassified -phylotypes, and SCFA in jejunal and cecal digesta modulated expression levels of cytokines, tight-junction protein  and nutrient transporters for glucose and SCFA uptake. In conclusion, results suggest that the intestine only played a moderate role for the RFI-associated variation of the present low and high RFI phenotypes, whereas modulating the early microbial colonization resulted in long-lasting changes in bacterial taxonomic and metabolite composition as well as in host intestinal development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383855>   alleviated Alzheimer's disease-like pathogenesis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia in the elderly.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of FMT for the treatment of AD. We used an APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (Tg) mouse model. Cognitive deficits, brain deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylation of tau, synaptic plasticity as well as neuroinflammation were assessed. Gut  and its metabolites short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing and H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our results showed that FMT treatment could improve cognitive deficits and reduce the brain deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (Tg) mice. These improvements were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of tau protein and the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42. We observed an increases in synaptic plasticity in the Tg mice, showing that postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and synapsin I expression were increased after FMT. We also observed the decrease of COX-2 and CD11b levels in Tg mice after FMT. We also found that FMT treatment reversed the changes of gut  and SCFAs.

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut  as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut  is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut  could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty  (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; (b) increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system.   studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut  in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut , leading to lean host phenotype body composition.

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation,  obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes,  profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated deoxycholic  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice.   using butyrate-deficient  derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

This change in microbial composition with age occurs in parallel with a decline in function of the gut immune system; however, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the two. Here we report that the defective germinal centre reaction in Peyer's patches of aged mice can be rescued by faecal transfers from younger adults into aged mice and by immunisations with cholera toxin, without affecting germinal centre reactions in peripheral lymph nodes.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile  synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased  and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells.

The gut  is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of organisms and a sophisticated genomic structure. Bacteria within the gut are estimated to weigh in excess of 1 kg in the adult human and the microbes within not only produce antimicrobial peptides, short chain fatty , and vitamins, but also most of the common neurotransmitters found in the human brain. That the microbial content of the gut plays a key role in immune development is now beyond doubt. Early disruption of the host-microbe interplay can have lifelong consequences, not just in terms of intestinal function but in distal organs including the brain. It is clear that the immune system and nervous system are in continuous communication in order to maintain a state of homeostasis. Significant gaps in knowledge remain about the effect of the gut  in coordinating the immune-nervous systems dialogue. However, studies using germ-free animals, infective models, prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics have increased our understanding of the interplay. Early life stress can have a lifelong impact on the microbial content of the intestine and permanently alter immune functioning. That early life stress can also impact adult psychopathology has long been appreciated in psychiatry. The challenge now is to fully decipher the molecular mechanisms that link the gut , immune, and central nervous systems in a network of communication that impacts behavior patterns and psychopathology, to eventually translate these findings to the human situation both in health and disease.

Mexico is no exception, and therefore the Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología brought together a multidisciplinary group (gastroenterologists, endoscopists, internists, infectious disease specialists, and microbiologists) to carry out the "Consensus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection", establishing useful recommendations (in relation to the adult population) for the medical community. Said recommendations are presented herein. Among them, it was recognized that CDI should be suspected in subjects with diarrhea that have a history of antibiotic and/or immunosuppressant use, but that it can also be a community-acquired infection. A 2-step diagnostic algorithm was proposed, in which a highly sensitive test, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), is first utilized, and if positive, confirmed by the detection of toxins through immunoassay or nucleic  detection tests. Another recommendation was that CDI based on clinical evaluation be categorized as mild-moderate, severe, and complicated severe, given that such a classification enables better therapeutic decisions to be made. In mild-moderate CDI, oral vancomycin is the medication of choice, and metronidazole is recommended as an alternative treatment. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation was recognized as an efficacious option in patients with recurrence or in the more severe cases of infection, and surgery should be reserved for patients with severe colitis (toxic megacolon), in whom all medical treatment has failed.Copyright © 2019 Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología.

A personalized and optimal use of available drugs and the integration of new drug classes are the cornerstones underpinning the new treatment paradigms. Areas covered: A structured literature search in Medline and PubMed, Cochrane meta-analyses, and abstracts of international congresses has been performed to review therapeutic approaches to ulcerative colitis. The primary therapeutic objective of therapy is to achieve clinical remission since persistence of active disease, even if mild, leads to a significant reduction in quality of life. Current treatment paradigms of ulcerative colitis are based on the use of 5-aminosalycilates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, TNF-α inhibitors and α4ß7 integrin blockers. The main determinants for drug class selection are disease extension, disease severity, and previous drug history. New drug classes that will likely become available in the foreseeable future include inhibitors of Janus kinases, modulators of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, SMAD-7 antisense oligonucleotides, interleukin-12/23 blockers, and   . Expert commentary: Increasing therapeutic options for ulcerative colitis make predictors of response highly relevant. While these are not available, judicious use of therapies, avoidance of underdosing, or persistent therapy when criteria for drug failure are met are essential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27809778>Pectin enhances the effect of    in ulcerative colitis by delaying the loss of diversity of gut flora.</a></h2><p>   (FMT) induces remission in ulcerative colitis (UC).

We investigated whether transgenic (TG) expression of the human regenerating family member 3 alpha gene (REG3A) alters the   and affects development of colitis in mice.We performed studies with C57BL/6 mice that express human regenerating family member 3 alpha (hREG3A) in hepatocytes, via the albumin gene promoter. In these mice, hREG3A travels via the bile to the intestinal lumen. Some mice were given dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis.  were collected from mice and the composition of the  was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The  microbiome was also analyzed from mice that express only 1 copy of human REG3A transgene but were fed  from control mice (not expressing hREG3A) as newborns. Mice expressing hREG3A were monitored for DSS-induced colitis after cohousing or feeding  from control mice. Colitis was induced in another set of control and hREG3A-TG mice by administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic ; some mice were given intrarectal injections of the hREG3A protein. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry to detect mucin 2, as well as by 16S ribosomal RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, transcriptional analyses, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bacterial cultures and   using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and flow cytometry.The   of mice that express hREG3A had a significant shift in composition, compared with control mice, with enrichment of Clostridiales (Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae) and depletion of Bacteroidetes (Prevotellaceae); the TG mice developed less-severe colitis following administration of DSS than control mice, associated with preserved gut barrier integrity and reduced bacterial translocation, epithelial inflammation, and oxidative damage. A similar shift in the composition of the   occurred after a few months in TG mice heterozygous for REG3A that harbored a wild-type maternal  at birth; these mice developed less-severe forms of colitis following DSS administration. Cohoused and germ-free mice fed  from REG3A-TG mice and given DSS developed less-severe forms of colitis and had reduced lipopolysaccharide activation of the toll-like receptor 4 and increased survival times compared with mice not fed  from REG3A-TG mice. REG3A TG mice developed only mild colonic inflammation after exposure to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic , compared with control mice. Control mice given intrarectal hREG3A and exposed to 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  showed less colon damage and inflammation than mice not given intrarectal hREG3A.  samples from REG3A-TG mice had lower levels of ROS than  from control mice during DSS administration. Addition of hREG3A to bacterial cultures reduced levels of ROS and increased survival of oxygen-sensitive commensal bacteria (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia intestinalis).Mice with hepatocytes that express hREG3A, which travels to the intestinal lumen, are less sensitive to colitis than control mice. We found hREG3A to alter the colonic  by decreasing levels of ROS.   from REG3A-TG mice protect non-TG mice from induction of colitis. These findings indicate a role for reduction of oxidative stress in preserving the gut  and its ability to prevent inflammation.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

HFD was fed for 12 weeks. At the end of two-week HFD, FMT was carried out for two weeks. The gastrointestinal transit, serotonin concentration, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), and the levels of bile  in intestinal contents were examined.Compared with the control group, the gastrointestinal transit and small intestinal serotonin concentration of HFD-fed rats were increased. In HFD-fed rats, TPH1 protein expression was increased significantly, while SERT protein expression was decreased, but not significant. The levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with the control group. After HFD-fed rats receiving FMT treatment, the gastrointestinal transit, small intestinal serotonin concentration, and TPH1 expression were decreased, while SERT expression was not affected. Moreover, the levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also decreased.FMT could alleviate small intestinal transit in the HFD-fed rats by regulating the serotonin biosynthesis.

Sparse partial-least-square analysis was used to identify correlations between the two datasets.The patients'  post-FMT tended to shift towards the donor , specifically through proportional increases of Bacteroides, Blautia, and Ruminococcus, and proportional decreases of Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Klebsiella. However, although cured of infection, one patient, who suffers from chronic alcohol abuse, retained the compositional characteristics of the pre-FMT . Following FMT, increased levels of short-chain fatty , particularly butyrate and acetate, were observed in all patients. Sparse partial-least-square analysis confirmed a positive correlation between butyrate and Bacteroides, Blautia, and Ruminococcus, with a negative correlation between butyrate and Klebsiella and Enterococcus.Clear differences were observed in the  composition and metabolic profiles between donors and rCDI patients, which were largely resolved in patients following FMT.

Emerging evidence suggests that gut bile  have significant influence on the physiology of C. difficile, and therefore on patient susceptibility to recurrent infection. We analyzed spore germination of 10 clinical C. difficile isolates exposed to combinations of bile  present in patient  before and after FMT. Bile  at concentrations found in patients'  prior to FMT induced germination of C. difficile, although with variable potency across different strains. However, bile  at concentrations found in patients after FMT did not induce germination and inhibited vegetative growth of all C. difficile strains. Sequencing of the newly identified germinant receptor in C. difficile, CspC, revealed a possible correspondence of variation in germination responses across isolates with mutations in this receptor. This may be related to interstrain variability in spore germination and vegetative growth in response to bile  seen in this and other studies. These results support the idea that intra-colonic bile  play a key mechanistic role in the success of FMT, and suggests that novel therapeutic alternatives for treatment of R-CDI may be developed by targeted manipulation of bile  composition in the colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498019>A Review of  and Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Future in Therapies.</a></h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), one of the most frequent digestive disorders, is characterized by chronic and recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel habit. The origin seems to be multifactorial and is still not well defined for the different subtypes. Genetic, epigenetic and sex-related modifications of the functioning of the nervous and immune-endocrine supersystems and regulation of brain-gut physiology and bile  production and absorption are certainly involved. Acquired predisposition may act in conjunction with infectious, toxic, dietary and life event-related factors to enhance epithelial permeability and elicit mucosal microinflammation, immune activation and dysbiosis.

Gut microbes were shown to degrade organophosphates and cause intestinal dysfunction. The diabetogenic nature of organophosphates was recently reported but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. We aimed to understand the role of gut  in organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia and to unravel the molecular mechanism behind this process.Here we demonstrate a high prevalence of diabetes among people directly exposed to organophosphates in rural India (n = 3080). Correlation and linear regression analysis reveal a strong association between plasma organophosphate residues and HbA1c but no association with acetylcholine esterase was noticed. Chronic treatment of mice with organophosphate for 180 days confirms the induction of glucose intolerance with no significant change in acetylcholine esterase. Further   and culture  experiments confirm the involvement of gut  in organophosphate-induced glucose intolerance. Intestinal metatranscriptomic and host metabolomic analyses reveal that gut microbial organophosphate degradation produces short chain fatty  like acetic , which induces gluconeogenesis and thereby accounts for glucose intolerance. Plasma organophosphate residues are positively correlated with  esterase activity and acetate level of human diabetes.Collectively, our results implicate gluconeogenesis as the key mechanism behind organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia, mediated by the organophosphate-degrading potential of gut . This study reveals the gut microbiome-mediated diabetogenic nature of organophosphates and hence that the usage of these insecticides should be reconsidered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550826>[Efficacy analysis of    in the treatment of 2010 patients with intestinal disorders].</a></h2><p> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of    (FMT) for intestinal disorders.  A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out.

Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in  donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative  examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.).

The intestinal  contributes to resistance against viral and bacterial pathogens in the lung. However, whether intestinal  composition and associated changes in microbe-derived metabolites contribute to the risk of LRTI following upper respiratory tract viral infection remains unexplored in the setting of allo-HCT.  samples from 360 allo-HCT patients were collected at the time of stem cell engraftment and subjected to deep, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to determine  composition, and short-chain fatty  levels were determined in a nested subset of  samples.

Best practice advice 1: A stepwise approach to rule-out ongoing inflammatory activity should be followed in IBD patients with persistent GI symptoms (measurement of  calprotectin, endoscopy with biopsy, cross-sectional imaging). Best practice advice 2: In those patients with indeterminate  calprotectin levels and mild symptoms, clinicians may consider serial calprotectin monitoring to facilitate anticipatory management. Best practice advice 3: Anatomic abnormalities or structural complications should be considered in patients with obstructive symptoms including abdominal distention, pain, nausea and vomiting, obstipation or constipation. Best practice advice 4: Alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms should be considered and evaluated (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, bile  diarrhea, carbohydrate intolerance, chronic pancreatitis) based on predominant symptom patterns. Best practice advice 5: A low FODMAP diet may be offered for management of functional GI symptoms in IBD with careful attention to nutritional adequacy. Best practice advice 6: Psychological therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnotherapy, mindfulness therapy) should be considered in IBD patients with functional symptoms.

A causal relation relationship between gut , inflammation, and atherosclerosis has not been explored previously.Here, we investigated whether a proinflammatory  from Caspase1 ( Casp1) mice accelerates atherogenesis in Ldlr mice.We treated female Ldlr mice with antibiotics and subsequently transplanted them with   from Casp1 mice based on a cohousing approach. Autologous  of   of Ldlr mice served as control. Mice were cohoused for 8 or 13 weeks and fed chow or high-fat cholesterol-rich diet.  samples were collected, and factors related to inflammation, metabolism, intestinal health, and atherosclerotic phenotypes were measured. Unweighted Unifrac distances of 16S rDNA (ribosomal DNA) sequences confirmed the introduction of the Casp1 and Ldlr  into Ldlr mice (referred to as Ldlr( Casp1) or Ldlr( Ldlr) mice). Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root demonstrated a significant 29% increase in plaque size in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) mice compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. We found increased numbers of circulating monocytes and neutrophils and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels in plasma in high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the aortic root of Ldlr( Casp1) mice was enhanced compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice. 16S-rDNA-encoding sequence analysis in  identified a significant reduction in the short-chain fatty -producing taxonomies Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae, Clostridium, and Odoribacter in Ldlr( Casp1) mice. Consistent with these findings, cumulative concentrations of the anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty  propionate, acetate and butyrate in the cecum were significantly reduced in 13-week high-fat cholesterol-fed Ldlr( Casp1) compared with Ldlr( Ldlr) mice.Introduction of the proinflammatory Casp1  into Ldlr mice enhances systemic inflammation and accelerates atherogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594647>Therapeutic potential of an anaerobic cultured human intestinal , ACHIM, for treatment of IBS.</a></h2><p>By administering an anaerobic cultivated human intestinal  (ACHIM) via upper gastrointestinal route using endoscopy we aimed to rectify intestinal dysbiosis and simultaneously achieve a treatment response in IBS patients. The study population fulfilled the Rome III IBS criteria and comprised 50 patients. During 10 days, patients recorded the irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) along with the Bristol stool scale and number of stools/day. The enrolled patients were categorized as follows: 37 with diarrhea, 5 with constipation and 8 with mixed symptoms. The treatment response showed reduction in a majority of patients, 32 of which with 50-point reduction of IBS-SSS and 21 with a 100-point IBS-SSS reduction. The percentage improvement was 36 (23-49) and 28 (18-38) for women and men respectively. Short-chain fatty  were not changed.

In two separate experiments, cesarean-delivered, preterm pigs were administered combined oral + rectal, or exclusively rectal donor , and compared with saline controls. After 5 days, stomach and colon bacterial compositions were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and organic  metabolites measured. Further, gut pathology, mucosa bacterial adherence, and goblet cell density were assessed. FMT increased the relative abundance of obligate anaerobes in the colon without affecting total bacterial load. Bacteroides colonized recipients despite low abundance in the donor , whereas highly abundant Prevotella and Ruminococcaceae did not. Further, FMT changed carbohydrate metabolism from lactate to propionate production thereby increasing colonic pH. Besides, FMT preserved goblet cell mucin stores and reduced necrotizing enterocolitis incidence. Only rectal FMT increased the stomach-to-colon pH gradient and resistance to mucosa bacterial adhesion. Conversely, oral + rectal FMT increased bacterial adhesion, internal organ colonization, and overall mortality. Our results uncovered distinctions in bacterial colonization patterns along the gastrointestinal tract, as well as host tolerability between oral and rectal FMT administration in preterm newborns.

However, the effect of LT on microbial functionality, which can be related to overall patient benefit, is unclear and could affect the post-LT course. The aims were to determine the effect of LT on gut microbial functionality focusing on endotoxemia, bile  (BA), ammonia metabolism, and lipidomics. We enrolled outpatient patients with cirrhosis on the LT list and followed them until 6 months after LT.  composition (Shannon diversity and individual taxa) and function analysis (serum endotoxin, urinary metabolomics and serum lipidomics, and stool BA profile) and cognitive tests were performed at both visits. We enrolled 40 patients (age, 56 ± 7 years; mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, 22.6). They received LT 6 ± 3 months after enrollment and were re-evaluated 7 ± 3 months after LT with a stable course. A significant improvement in cognition with increase in microbial diversity, increase in autochthonous and decrease in potentially pathogenic taxa, and reduced endotoxemia were seen after LT compared with baseline. Stool BAs increased significantly after LT, and there was evidence of greater bacterial action (higher secondary, oxo and iso-BAs) after LT although the levels of conjugated BAs remained similar. There was a reduced serum ammonia and corresponding rise in urinary phenylacetylglutamine after LT. There was an increase in urinary trimethylamine-N-oxide, which was correlated with specific changes in serum lipids related to cell membrane products. The ultimate post-LT lipidomic profile appeared beneficial compared with the profile before LT. In conclusion, LT improves gut  diversity and dysbiosis, which is accompanied by favorable changes in gut microbial functionality corresponding to BAs, ammonia, endotoxemia, lipidomic, and metabolomic profiles.

Metagenome analyses have demonstrated that the gut microbiota differs between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy subjects, and several studies have shown that impaired glucose metabolism is associated with decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. Gut microbiota-produced metabolites, such as short-chain fatty , amino  derivatives and secondary bile , participate in metabolic and immunologic processes and, hence, pose putative links between the gut microbiota and glucose homeostasis. Strategies to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes through manipulation of the gut microbiota are being developed. These include replacement of the gut microbiota by fecal transplantation, consumption of fibres to promote the function and growth of beneficial bacteria and treatment with probiotic bacterial strains. Furthermore, it has been shown that many drugs, including drugs used for treatment of diabetes, have major impacts on gut microbiota and, thereby, potentially on glucose metabolism. In particular, the commonly used drug metformin has been shown to influence the functional capacity of the gut microbiota, and recent evidence indicates that this may contribute to the antidiabetes effect of metformin.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Studies using antibiotic-treated mice reveal mechanisms that increase susceptibility to  infection (CDI), but risk factors associated with CDI in humans extend beyond antibiotic use. Here, we studied the dysbiotic gut  of a subset of patients with diarrhea and modeled the gut  of these patients by   into germ-free mice. When challenged with , the germ-free mice transplanted with  samples from patients with dysbiotic microbial communities showed increased gut amino  concentrations and greater susceptibility to CDI. A  mutant that was unable to use proline as an energy source was unable to robustly infect germ-free mice transplanted with a dysbiotic or healthy human gut . Prophylactic dietary intervention using a low-proline or low-protein diet in germ-free mice colonized by a dysbiotic human gut  resulted in decreased expansion of wild-type  after challenge, suggesting that amino  availability might be important for CDI. Furthermore, a prophylactic    in mice with dysbiosis reduced proline availability and protected the mice from CDI. Last, we identified clinical risk factors that could potentially predict gut microbial dysbiosis and thus greater susceptibility to CDI in a retrospective cohort of patients with diarrhea. Identifying at-risk individuals and reducing their susceptibility to CDI through gut -targeted therapies could be a new approach to preventing  infection in susceptible patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In this study, we extracted and analyzed  in  from constipated donors who had undergone effective therapy with   , transplanted  into pseudo-germ-free mice, and measured gut motility. These mice presented with lower pellet frequency and water percentage, smaller pellet size, delayed gastrointestinal transit time, and weaker spontaneous contractions of colonic smooth muscle. To determine the mechanism underlying delayed gut motility, microbial metabolites were measured. Short chain fatty  and secondary bile  were decreased in mice receiving  from constipated donors. Moreover, the compositional changes of gut  in constipated patients were identified, including the operational taxonomic unit, and the species richness and α diversity were much greater than those in healthy volunteers. These findings suggest that alterations of the microbiome might affect gut motility via altered microbial-derived metabolites in the development of constipation, and the restoration of disturbed  might improve the clinical phenotype.

We investigated how gut  manipulation by antibiotics (7-day administration of amoxicillin, vancomycin, or placebo) affects host metabolism in 57 obese, prediabetic men. Vancomycin, but not amoxicillin, decreased bacterial diversity and reduced Firmicutes involved in short-chain fatty  and bile  metabolism, concomitant with altered plasma and/or  metabolite concentrations. Adipose tissue gene expression of oxidative pathways was upregulated by antibiotics, whereas immune-related pathways were downregulated by vancomycin. Antibiotics did not affect tissue-specific insulin sensitivity, energy/substrate metabolism, postprandial hormones and metabolites, systemic inflammation, gut permeability, and adipocyte size. Importantly, energy harvest, adipocyte size, and whole-body insulin sensitivity were not altered at 8-week follow-up, despite a still considerably altered microbial composition, indicating that interference with adult  by 7-day antibiotic treatment has no clinically relevant impact on metabolic health in obese humans.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Gut  is implicated in the maturation of the host immune system and in many fundamental metabolic pathways including sugars and proteins fermentation and metabolism of bile  and xenobiotics. Imbalance of gut microbial populations or dysbiosis has important functional consequences and is implicated in many digestive diseases (inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, etc.) but also in obesity and autism.

Dietary fibers, i.e. prebiotics, are fermented by human gut  into the short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate. SCFAs promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic health. Therefore, the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology.In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, 14 healthy, overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U-C-inulin (INU) or B) 24 g maltodextrin placebo (PLA), with a wash-out period of at least five days. Fat oxidation was measured via an open-circuit ventilated hood and blood samples were collected up to 7 h after ingestion. Plasma, breath, and  samples were collected, and appetite and satiety scores were assessed.Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase (0-3 h), and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA (all P < 0.05). Plasma free fatty  were higher in the early, and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma acetate concentrations after INU compared with PLA (P < 0.05). In addition, we found continuous increases in plasma C-SCFA enrichments (P < 0.05 from t = 120 onwards) and breath CO enrichments after INU intake. There were no effects on plasma triglycerides, free glycerol, satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and appetite and satiety scores.Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men.

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of colonization using human donors in germ-free (GF) mice on the gut-liver-brain axis. GF and conventional mice were made cirrhotic using carbon tetrachloride and compared with controls in GF and conventional state. Additional GF mice were colonized with stool from controls (Ctrl-Hum) and patients with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum). Stools from patients with HE cirrhosis after antibiotics were pooled (pre-FMT). Stools from the same patients 15 days after FMT from a healthy donor were also pooled (post-FMT). Sterile supernatants were created from pre-FMT and post-FMT samples. GF mice were colonized using stools/sterile supernatants. For all mice, frontal cortex, liver, and small/large intestines were collected. Cortical inflammation, synaptic plasticity and gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) signaling, and liver inflammation and intestinal 16s ribosomal RNA  sequencing were performed. Conventional cirrhotic mice had higher degrees of neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, GABA signaling, and intestinal dysbiosis compared with other groups. Cirr-Hum mice had greater neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, and GABA signaling and lower synaptic plasticity compared with Ctrl-Hum mice. This was associated with greater dysbiosis but no change in liver histology. Pre-FMT material colonization was associated with neuroinflammation and microglial activation and dysbiosis, which was reduced significantly with post-FMT samples. Sterile pre-FMT and post-FMT supernatants did not affect brain parameters. Liver inflammation was unaffected. Conclusion:  microbial colonization from patients with cirrhosis results in higher degrees of neuroinflammation and activation of GABAergic and neuronal activation in mice regardless of cirrhosis compared with those from healthy humans. Reduction in neuroinflammation by using samples from post-FMT patients to colonize GF mice shows a direct effect of   independent of active liver inflammation or injury.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29665102>Antibiotic-Associated Disruption of  Composition and Function in Cirrhosis Is Restored by  .</a></h2><p>Patients with cirrhosis are often exposed to antibiotics that can lead to resistance and fungal overgrowth.

FMT was well tolerated. Postantibiotics, there was a reduced microbial diversity and autochthonous taxa relative abundance. This was associated with an altered  SCFA and BA profile. Correlation linkage changes from beneficial at baseline to negative after antibiotics. All of these parameters became statistically similar post-FMT to baseline levels.

Here, we aimed to identify bacterial signatures associated with sustained remission. To this end, samples from healthy donors and UC patients-grouped into responders and non-responders at a primary end point (week 12) and further stratified by sustained clinical remission and relapse assessed at ⩾1-year follow-up were analysed, comparing the efficacy of FMT from either a healthy donor or autologous faeces.  composition was determined with a 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic microarray on faecal and mucosal samples, and functional profiles were predicted using PICRUSt with quantitative PCR verification of the butyrate production capacity; short-chain fatty  were measured in faecal samples. At baseline, UC patients showed reduced amounts of bacterial groups from the Clostridium cluster XIVa, and significantly higher levels of Bacteroidetes as compared with donors. These differences were reduced after FMT mostly in responders. Sustained remission was associated with known butyrate producers and overall increased butyrate production capacity, while relapse was associated with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Ruminococcus gnavus was found at high levels in donors of failed FMT. A microbial ecosystem rich in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and low in Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa observed in UC patients after FMT was predictive of poor sustained response, unless modified with a donor  rich in specific members from the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa.

Cumulative data support the pivotal role of gut  in NASH. Here, we investigated the hypothesis regarding whether    (FMT) is effective in attenuating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatohepatitis in mice. Mice were randomized into control, HFD and HFD + FMT groups. After an 8-week HFD, FMT treatment was initiated and carried out for 8 weeks. The gut  structure, butyrate concentrations of the cecal content, liver pathology and intrahepatic lipid and cytokines were examined. Our results showed that after FMT, the gut  disturbance was corrected in HFD-fed mice with elevated abundances of the beneficial bacteria Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillus. FMT also increased butyrate concentrations of the cecal content and the intestinal tight junction protein ZO-1, resulting in relief of endotoxima in HFD-fed mice. Steatohepatitis was alleviated after FMT, as indicated by a significant decrease in intrahepatic lipid accumulation (reduced Oli-red staining, decreased intrahepatic triglyceride and cholesterol), intrahepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the NAS score. Accordingly, intrahepatic IFN-γ and IL-17 were decreased, but Foxp3, IL-4 and IL-22 were increased after FMT intervention. These data indicate that FMT attenuated HFD-induced steatohepatitis in mice via a beneficial effect on the gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26854221>The Gut  Modulates Energy Metabolism in the Hibernating Brown Bear Ursus arctos.</a></h2><p>Hibernation is an adaptation that helps many animals to conserve energy during food shortage in winter. Brown bears double their fat depots during summer and use these stored lipids during hibernation. Although bears seasonally become obese, they remain metabolically healthy. We analyzed the  of free-ranging brown bears during their active phase and hibernation. Compared to the active phase, hibernation  had reduced diversity, reduced levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and increased levels of Bacteroidetes. Several metabolites involved in lipid metabolism, including triglycerides, cholesterol, and bile , were also affected by hibernation.  of the bear  from summer and winter to germ-free mice transferred some of the seasonal metabolic features and demonstrated that the summer  promoted adiposity without impairing glucose tolerance, suggesting that seasonal variation in the  may contribute to host energy metabolism in the hibernating brown bear.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Modifying the gut microbiome is a potential route to improve gastrointestinal (GI) and behavioral symptoms in children with ASD, and fecal microbiota transplant could transform the dysbiotic gut microbiome toward a healthy one by delivering a large number of commensal microbes from a healthy donor. We previously performed an open-label trial of Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) that combined antibiotics, a bowel cleanse, a stomach- suppressant, and fecal microbiota transplant, and observed significant improvements in GI symptoms, autism-related symptoms, and gut microbiota. Here, we report on a follow-up with the same 18 participants two years after treatment was completed. Notably, most improvements in GI symptoms were maintained, and autism-related symptoms improved even more after the end of treatment. Important changes in gut microbiota at the end of treatment remained at follow-up, including significant increases in bacterial diversity and relative abundances of Bifidobacteria and Prevotella. Our observations demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of MTT as a potential therapy to treat children with ASD who have GI problems, and warrant a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899006>Assessing the viability of transplanted gut  by sequential tagging with D-amino -based metabolic probes.</a></h2><p>Currently, there are more than 200    (FMT) clinical trials worldwide. However, our knowledge of this microbial therapy is still limited. Here we develop a strategy using sequential tagging with D-amino -based metabolic probes (STAMP) for assessing the viabilities of transplanted microbiotas. A fluorescent D-amino  (FDAA) is first administered to donor mice to metabolically label the gut microbiotas in vivo. The labeled microbiotas are transplanted to recipient mice, which receive a second FDAA with a different color. The surviving  should incorporate both FDAAs and can be readily distinguished by presenting two colors simultaneously. Isolation of surviving bacteria and 16S rDNA sequencing identify several enriched genera, suggesting the importance of specific bacteria in FMT. In addition, using STAMP, we evaluate the effects on  survival of pre-treating recipients using different antibiotics. We propose STAMP as a versatile tool for deciphering the complex biology of FMT, and potentially improving its treatment efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27148613>Early Diagnosis, Prevention, and Treatment of : Update [Internet].</a></h2><p>Update a 2011 review of differences in accuracy of diagnostic tests and the effects of interventions to prevent and treat  infection (CDI) in adults.Medline, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry, and Embase from 2010 through April 2015 plus reference lists of included studies and recent systematic reviews.Two investigators screened abstracts and full texts of identified references for eligibility. Eligible studies included studies of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic tests in patients at risk for CDI. We included randomized controlled trials or high-quality cohort studies enrolling adult patients with CDI or suspected CDI for treatment interventions. Prevention studies also included adult patients at risk for CDI and observational study designs. Two investigators extracted data, assessed individual study risk of bias, and evaluated the strength of evidence for each comparison and outcome. Pooled estimates were analyzed to assess the efficacy and comparative effectiveness of a variety of treatments.We identified 37 diagnostic studies and 56 studies evaluating prevention or treatment interventions to update the review. High-strength evidence showed that nucleic amplification tests were sensitive and specific for CDI when using culture as the reference standard. Low-strength evidence was found that some institutional prevention interventions, such as antibiotic prescribing practices and transmission interruption (terminal room cleaning with hydrogen peroxide vapor and handwashing campaigns), reduce CDI incidence. Low-strength evidence also suggested that prevention programs can be sustained over several years. For CDI treatment, vancomycin is more effective than metronidazole (high-strength evidence), and the effect does not vary by severity (moderate-strength evidence). Fidaxomicin remains noninferior to vancomycin for the initial cure of CDI (moderate-strength evidence) but is superior to vancomycin for prevention of recurrent CDI (now high-strength evidence). Although both    (FMT) and probiotics were the subject of a significant number of new studies, the overall high risk of bias of many of these studies necessitated ratings of low strength of evidence. Specifically, low-strength evidence suggests that FMT may have a significant effect on reducing recurrent CDI. Similarly, low-strength evidence suggests that lactobaccilus strains and multiorganism probiotics also can reduce recurrent CDI. However,  was no more effective than placebo in preventing recurrent CDI. Evidence for FMT for refractory CDI was insufficient. Few studies reported adverse events; when reported, few events were noted.Research on diagnostic testing for and interventions to treat CDI expanded considerably in 4 years. Nucleic  amplification tests have high sensitivity and specificity for CDI. Vancomycin is more effective than metronidazole for initial CDI, while fidaxomicin is more effective than vancomycin for the prevention of recurrent CDI. FMT and lactobacillus probiotics to restore colonic biodiversity and improve patient resistance to CDI or recurrence have low-strength but relatively consistent positive evidence for efficacy.</p></html>
