Punch biopsies from depigmented vitiliginous skin (VS), normal-looking pigmented skin (), and marginal skin (MS) from patients with generalized vitiligo (n = ) were labeled with K 1.2.58, OKM1 (CD11b), Leu 11b (CD16), Leu 19 (CD56), IFN-gamma receptor, IL-2 receptor (CD25), IgG, IgM, C3c, and C3d MoAbs. In addition, in vitro effects of vitiligo sera (n = 13) on human newborn melanocytes (HMel) under different culture conditions were studied. The immunohistochemical findings showed absence of K 1.2.58+ epidermal melanocytes in VS and abnormal morphology in MS. In these areas, a few CD11b+ cells in the dermis and epidermis could be detected but no significant numbers of CD16+ or CD56+ cells were seen among the mononuclear cellular infiltrate. IL-2 and IFN-gamma receptors were clearly expressed by the cellular infiltrate. No significant deposition of complement or immunoglobulin was seen. The addition of vitiligo sera to HMel cultures induced a significant cellular proliferation. The stimulation of cell proliferation occurred regardless whether the sera were added alone or when preheated (56 degrees C for 1 hr) and then supplemented with a complement source (P < .01 at 2%, P < .001 at 10%, and P < .01 at 20% for sera alone) (P > .05 at 2%, P < .05 at 10%, and P < .01 at 20% for decomplemented sera plus complement).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27460204>Pseudomonas kribbensis sp. nov., isolated from garden soils in Daejeon, Korea.</a></h2><p>Two bacterial strains, 46-1 and 46-2, were isolated from garden soil. These strains were observed to be aerobic, Gram-stain negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, motile and catalase and oxidase positive. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the two strains shared 100 % sequence similarity with each other and belong to the genus Pseudomonas in the class Gammaproteobacteria. The concatenated 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD gene sequences further confirmed that the isolates belong to the Pseudomonas koreensis subgroup (SG), with P. koreensis  9-14, Pseudomonas moraviensis 1B4 and Pseudomonas granadensis F-278,770 as their close relatives (>96 % pairwise similarity). DNA-DNA hybridization with the closely related type strain P. koreensis SG revealed a low level of relatedness (<50 %). A cladogram constructed using whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (WC-MALDI-TOF) MS analysis showed the isolates formed a completely separate monophyletic group. The isolates were negative for utilization of glycogen, D-psicose, α-keto butyric acid, α-keto valeric acid, succinamic acid and D, L-α-glycerol phosphate. In contrast, all these reactions were positive in P. koreensis JCM 14769 and P. moraviensis DSM 16007. The fatty acid C cyclo was detected as one of the major cellular fatty acids (> %) in the isolates but it was a minor component (<4 %) in both reference type strains. In contrast, the fatty acid, C was not observed in the isolates but was present in both reference strains. Based on differences such as phylogenetic position, low-level DNA-DNA hybridization, WC-MALDI-TOF MS analysis, fluorescence pigmentation, fatty acid profiles, and substrate utilization, we propose that the isolates 46-1 and 46-2 represent a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas kribbensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 46-2 (=KCTC 32541 = DSM 100278).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20603027>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and acute-phase proteins in early pregnant ewes after challenge with peptidoglycan-polysaccharide.</a></h2><p>Bacterial infection shortly after mating interferes with establishment of pregnancy. Injection of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-), a component of gram-positive bacteria, into sheep on day 5 after mating reduces pregnancy rate. Experiments were designed to evaluate the acute-phase response (APR) in ewes to injection of PG- on day 5 after mating (day ). Catheters were inserted into the jugular and posterior vena cava on day 4. On day 5, ewes were challenged with saline or 30 microg/kg body weight (BW) PG- (Exp 1) or 60 microg/kg BW PG- (Exp 2). Blood samples were collected every  min for 6 h (Exp 1) and every  min for 2 h, hourly for 12 h, and at 24, 36, and 48 h (Exp 2). Body temperature and clinical signs of infection were monitored in Exp 2. Plasma was assayed for concentrations of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); 2 APR proteins, serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp); and progesterone (P(4)). Ewes injected with 60 microg/kg BW PG- exhibited fever, vaginal discharge, loss of appetite, and lethargy. After challenge with either 30 microg/kg or 60 microg/kg BW PG-, TNF-alpha increased in the posterior vena cava. Concentrations of SAA and Hp in the jugular increased after challenge with 60 microg/kg BW PG-. Only half (5/10) of the ewes treated with 60 microg/kg BW PG- had ultrasonically visible embryos, and none of them had functional corpora lutea (CL) (<1 ng/mL of P(4)) on day 21. On the other hand, 8/9 (88.9%) control ewes had visible embryos and all had functional CL on day 21. Using logistic regression, pregnancy on day 21 was predicted to depend on concentrations of TNF-alpha and Hp on day 5 and concentration of P(4) on day 14. In summary, injection of PG- on day 5 after mating resulted in fever; increased concentrations of TNF-alpha, Hp, and SAA on the day of and the day after the PG- challenge; and decreased concentrations of P(4) on days 14 and 21. These factors were related to failure to establish pregnancy.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, there are limited data on the effect of vaccination or prior exposure on stool shedding.Six Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi human challenge studies were conducted between 2011 and 2017. Participants were either unvaccinated or vaccinated with 1 of 4 vaccines: Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-), Vi-tetanus-toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT), live oral Ty21a vaccine, or an experimental vaccine (M01ZH09). Daily stool cultures were collected for 14 days after challenge.There were 4934 stool samples collected from 430 volunteers. Participants who received Vi- or Vi-TT shed less than unvaccinated participants (odds ratio [OR], .34; 95% confidence interval [CI], .-.77; P = .010 and OR, .41; 95% CI, .19-.91, P = .029 for Vi- and Vi-TT, respectively). Higher anti-Vi immunoglobulin G titers were associated with less shedding of S. Typhi (P < .0001). A nonsignificant reduction in shedding was associated with Ty21a vaccine (OR, .57; 95% CI, .27-1.20; P = .140). Individuals previously exposed to S. Typhi shed less than previously unexposed individuals (OR, .30; 95% CI, .1-.8; P = .016). Shedding of S. Typhi was more common than S. Paratyphi.Prior vaccination with Vi vaccines, or natural infection, reduces onward transmission of S. Typhi. Field trials of Vi-TT should be designed to detect indirect protection, reflecting the consequence of reduced stool shedding observed in the human challenge model.© The Author(s) 2018.

Based on the proposed delay measurement scheme, the quantization resolution of the proposed OCDS can be reduced to several picoseconds. Additionally, the proposed cascade-stage delay measurement circuit can enhance immunity to supply-voltage variations of the delay measurement resolution without extra self-biasing or calibration circuits. Simulation results show that the delay measurement resolution can be improved to 1.2 ; the average delay resolution variation is .55% with supply-voltage variations of ±10%. Moreover, the proposed delay sensor can be implemented in an all-digital manner, making it very suitable for high-performance electronic system applications as well as system-level integration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109818>Immunomodulating activity of Nymphaea rubra Roxb. extracts: activation of rat dendritic cells and improvement of the T(H)1 immune response.</a></h2><p>Polysaccharides play a key role in enhancing immune function and facilitating cellular communication. Here, we purified Nymphaea rubra Roxb. polysaccharides (NR-) by treating them with pullulanase. They were then cultured with immature dendritic cells (DCs) derived from rat bone marrow hematopoietic cells (BMHCs). After treatment with bioactive NR- with a degree of polymerization (DP) value of 359.8, we found that the DCs underwent morphological changes indicative of activation. CD80/86 (87.16% ± 8.49%) and MHC class II (52.01% ± 10.11%) expression levels were significantly up-regulated by this treatment compared to the controls (65.45% ± .97% and 34.87% ± 1.96%). In parallel, endocytosis was also reduced (167.94% ± 60.59%) after treatment with 25 μg/mL of NR- as measured by the medium fluorescence intensity compared to the control (261.67% ± 47.26%). Furthermore, the DCs after treatment with 25 μg/mL NR- showed increased IL-12 (102.09 ± 10.16 to 258.78 ± 25.26 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (11.76 ± .11 to .51 ± 1.66 pg/mL) secretion together with reduced IL-10 secretion (30.75 ± 3.35 to .37 ± 2.35 pg/mL), which indicates a T(H)1 immune response. In conclusion, NR- exhibits stimulatory effects on rat DCs and promotes the secretion of T(H)1 cytokines. Taken together, our studies are the first to show that NR- is an immunomodulator affecting the maturation and functioning of DCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24276792>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,  and susceptibility among men who have sex with men (MSM), Los Angeles County, USA.</a></h2><p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. We used serologic data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system to determine the prevalence and correlates of HBV infection, immunization, and susceptibility in a sample of Los Angeles County MSM. Approximately 19 % (95 % CI -24 %) had serologic evidence of current or past infection, while 35 % (95 % CI 30-40 %) were susceptible. Compared with the youngest age group, MSM ages 40-49 years had a lower prevalence of immunization (aPR .28, 95 % CI .17-.45) and a higher prevalence of infection (aPR 8.53, 95 % CI 3.95-18.4) and susceptibility (aPR 2.02, 95 % CI 1.13-3.63). We also observed poor concordance between self-reported and serologic measures of vaccination. Our results indicate the possibility of missed opportunities to vaccinate MSM. Gaps in implementing existing vaccination strategies must be addressed to increase hepatitis B vaccination coverage for MSM, especially in older age groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16040982>Protection by natural human immunoglobulin M antibody to meningococcal serogroup B capsular polysaccharide in the infant rat protection assay is independent of complement-mediated bacterial lysis.</a></h2><p>Neisseria meningitidis, an important cause of bacterial meningitis and septicemia worldwide, is associated with high mortality and serious sequelae. Natural  against meningococcal disease develops with age, but the specificity and functional activity of natural antibodies associated with protection are poorly understood. We addressed this question by using a selected subset of prevaccination sera (n = 26) with convergent or discrepant serum bactericidal activity (SBA) and infant rat protective activity (IRPA) against the serogroup B meningococcal strain 44/76-SL (B::P1.7,16) from Icelandic teenagers. The sera were analyzed by opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) assay, immunoblotting, immunoglobulin G (IgG) quantitation against live meningococcal cells by flow cytometry, and enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA). High levels of SBA and OPA were reflected in distinct IgG binding to major outer membrane proteins and/or lipopolysaccharide in immunoblots. However, we could not detect any specific antibody patterns on blots that could explain IRPA. Only IgM antibody to group B capsular polysaccharide (B-), measured by EIA, correlated positively (r = .76, P < .001) with IRPA. Normal human sera (NHS; n = 20) from healthy Finnish children of different ages (7, 14, and 24 months and 10 years) supported this finding and showed an age-related increase in IRPA that coincided with the acquisition of B- specific IgM antibody. The protection was independent of complement-mediated bacterial lysis, as detected by the inability of NHS to augment SBA in the presence of human or infant rat complement and the equal protective activity of NHS in rat strains with fully functional or C6-deficient complement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323848>Evaluation of the Peri-Implant Bone Level around Platform-Switched Dental Implants: A Retrospective 3-Year Radiographic Study.</a></h2><p>To describe remodeling of the mesial and distal marginal bone level around platform-switched () and platform-matched (PM) dental implants that were sandblasted with large grit and etched with acid over a three-year period.Digital periapical radiographs were obtained at the following time-points: during Stage I of the surgical placement of dental implants, before loading, immediately after loading (baseline), and one, three, six, 12, and 36 months after loading for measuring the horizontal and vertical marginal bone levels.Sixty implants were successfully osseointegrated during the overall observation period. Vertical marginal bone levels for the  and PM dental implants were .78 ± .77 and .98 ± .81 mm, respectively, whereas the horizontal marginal bone levels for the  and PM implants were .84 ± .45 and .98 ± .68 mm, respectively. During the time leading up to the procedure until 36 months after the procedure, the average vertical marginal bone level resulted in less bone loss for the  and PM groups-.96 ± 1.28 and .30 ± 1. mm, respectively ( < .05). The mean levels of the horizontal marginal bone also showed increases of .48 ± 1.01 mm in the  and .37 ± .77 mm in the PM groups from the time before loading until 36 months after the procedure. However, these increases were not statistically significant ( > .05). dental implants appeared to be more effective than PM implants for minimizing the mean marginal vertical and horizontal marginal bone loss during the three-year period. Regardless of which abutment connection was used, the dental implant in the present retrospective investigation exhibited minimal marginal bone remodeling, thus indicating long-term stability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756968>Can tonsillectomy modify the innate and adaptive  pathways involved in IgA nephropathy?</a></h2><p>The benefits of tonsillectomy in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are still debated. Tonsillectomy may remove pathogen sources and reduce the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), limiting degalactosylated IgA1 (deGal-IgA1) production, which is considered to be the initiating pathogenetic event leading to IgA glomerular deposition. In the European network VALIGA, 62/1147 IgAN patients underwent tonsillectomy (TxIgAN). In a cross-sectional study  of these patients were tested and compared to 45 non-tonsillectomized IgAN (no-TxIgAN) and healthy controls (HC) regarding levels of deGal-IgA1, and markers of innate  and oxidative stress, including toll-like receptors (TLR)2, 3, 4 and 9 mRNAs, proteasome () and immunoproteasome (iPS) mRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP). Levels of deGal-IgA1 were lower in TxIgAN than in no-TxIgAN (p = .015), but higher than in HC (p = .003). TLR mRNAs were more expressed in TxIgAN than in HC (TLR4, p = .021; TLR9, p = .027), and higher in TxIgAN than in no-TxIgAN (p ≤ .001 for TLR2, 4, 9). A switch from  to iPS was detected in PBMC of TxIgAN in comparison to HC and it was higher than in no-TxIgAN [large multifunctional peptidase (LMP)2/β1, p = .039; LPM7/β5, p < .0001]. The levels of AOPP were significantly higher in TxIgAN than HC (p < .001) and no-TxIgAN (p = .033). In conclusion, the activation of innate  via TLRs and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways and the pro-oxidative milieu were not affected by tonsillectomy, even though the levels of aberrantly galactosylated IgA1 were lower in patients with IgAN who had tonsillectomy. The residual hyperactivation of innate  in tonsillectomized patients may result from extra-tonsillar MALT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504950>Interactive effects of threonine levels and protein source on growth performance and carcass traits, gut morphology, ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids, and  in broilers.</a></h2><p>An experiment was executed to test the hypothesis that supplementation of dietary threonine (d-Thr), above NRC recommendation to diets containing poorly digestible protein source () may compensate its detrimental effects on overall performance of broilers. In total, nine hundred 1-day-old mixed sex broilers (Ross-308) were randomly distributed over 6 (2 × 3) experimental diets comprising 5 replicates of 30 broilers each for 35 d. The experimental diets contain either soybean meal (SBM) or canola meal (CM) with 3 levels (100, 110, and 120% of NRC recommendation) of d-Thr. During the course of the trial ( to 35 D), interactions (P < .05) between  and d-Thr were observed for feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass, and gut health parameters. The broilers fed recommended level (100%) of d-Thr had 7 and 5% poorer FCR compared with those fed diets with 110 and 120% d-Thr, respectively. For villus height (VH), an interaction (P = .007) was found between  and d-Thr level. Broilers consuming SBM diets had 22% longer villi, 10% deeper crypts, and 30% greater VH to crypt depth ratio (VCR) compared to those fed CM. The broilers fed 110% d-Thr diets had 9% lower crypt depth (CD) and % greater VCR compared with those fed diets containing NRC recommended levels. CM resulted in 9% lower protein digestibility with lower (P < .05) of some AA, whereas it was improved by 7% in broilers fed 120% d-Thr supplemented diets. The bursa and spleen weights were positively affected (P < .001) by . Threonine supplementation (10%) resulted in 25% greater thymus, 18% heavier bursa, and 30% greater infectious bursal disease titer. In conclusion, supplementation of d-Thr, above NRC recommendation, resulted in a better growth performance and carcass traits, improved ileal digestibility of protein and amino acids, better gut health, and  in broilers.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436834>Age-dependent V region expression in the human antibody response to the Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide.</a></h2><p>The human L chain antibody repertoire specific for the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide () is composed of kappa I, kappa II, kappa III, kappa IV, and lambda L chain V regions, but the most commonly occurring VL is encoded by the unmutated V kappa II-A2 gene. To determine whether this VL repertoire is influenced by age, we used idiotypic probes to monitor V kappa II-A2, V lambda, and V kappa III usage in the antibody response to an Hib -protein conjugate vaccine. A single dose of a vaccine consisting of Hib  coupled to an outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis was administered. Adults (n = 35), 18-month-old infants (n = 35), and 2-month-old infants (n = 46), all with > or = .9 microgram/ml anti-Hib  antibodies, were tested for VL region markers in postvaccination sera. V kappa III anti-Hib  antibodies were not detected in any of the 2-month-old infants but were detected in 29% of the 18-month-old infants and 69% of the adults (p < .001). The lack of kappa III antibodies in 2-month-old infants could not be accounted for by lack of a kappa response, because kappa antibodies to Hib  were present (> . microgram/ml) in 45% of these infants. Hibld-1, an idiotope expressed by anti-Hib  antibodies having the kappa II-A2 V region, was present in postvaccination sera of 66% of the adults and 80% of the 18-month-old infants but was less frequent in the 2-month-old infants (35%, p < .001). In contrast, Hibld-2, which is an idiotope expressed by a subset of V lambda VII anti-Hib  antibodies, was rare or infrequent in adults and 18-month-old infants (% and 6%, respectively) but was present in 43% of 2-month-old infants (p < .001). Our findings demonstrate that dramatic changes in VL region utilization occur in the human antibody response to this Hib  conjugate vaccine as a function of age. Because previous studies have shown that V region usage correlates with antibody fine specificity and avidity for Hib , these age-related differences in V region expression may affect the ability of vaccines to confer protective  at different ages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28841909>Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable locally recurrent anal squamous cell carcinoma: a phase II study of French interdisciplinary GERCOR and FFCD groups (Epitopes-HPV02 study).</a></h2><p>The squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) is a rare disease, but its incidence is markedly increasing. About % of patients are diagnosed at metastatic stage, and more than 20% with a localized disease treated by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) will recur. In advanced SCCA, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) combination is the standard option but complete response is a rare event and the prognosis remains poor with most disease progression occurring within the first 12 months. We have previously published the potential role of the addition of docetaxel (D). Among 8 consecutive patients with advanced recurrent SCCA after CRT, the DCF regimen induced a complete response in 4 patients, including 3 pathological complete responses. Then, the Epitopes-HPV02 study was designed to confirm the interest of DCF regimen in SCCA patients.This multicentre phase II trial assesses the DCF regimen in advanced SCCA patients. Main eligibility criteria are: histologically proven SCCA, unresectable locally advanced recurrent or metastatic disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-) <2, and being eligible for DCF. Patients receive either 6 cycles of standard DCF or 8 cycles of modified DCF depending on age (> vs. ≤ 75 years-old) and ECOG- ( vs. 1). The trial was set up based on a Simon's optimal two-stage design for phase II trials, allowing an early futility interim analysis. The primary endpoint is the observed progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months from the first DCF cycle. A PFS rate below 10% is considered uninteresting, while a PFS rate above 25% is expected. With a unilateral alpha error of 5% and a statistical power of 90%, 66 evaluable patients should be included. Main secondary endpoints are overall survival, PFS, response rate, safety, health-related quality of life, and the correlation of biomarkers with treatment efficacy.Since the recommended CF regimen is based in a small retrospective analysis and generates a low rate of complete responses, the Epitopes-HPV02 study will establish a new standard in case of a positive result.

Other studies have reported that shearing at early pregnancy influences the development of the placenta and lamb live weight at birth. However, there was a lack of information on the effect of early-prepartum shearing on the behavior of the offspring from weaning onward. This study evaluated the effect of shearing ewes at 50 days of gestation on the growth, reproductive behavior and response to a gastrointestinal parasite challenge in the female offspring from weaning to 18 months old. Fifty-seven Polwarth female lambs were used, 22 being singles and 35 twins born to ewes either shorn at 50 days of pregnancy (, n = 23) or shorn at 62 days postpartum (U, control, n = 34) resulting in four subgroups: single lambs born to  ewes (n = 8), born to U ewes (n = 14), twin lambs born to  ewes (n = ) or born to U ewes (n = 20). All progeny were managed together under improved pasture with a minimum forage allowance of 6% live weight on dry basis. Body weight, body condition score and fecal eggs count were recorded every 14 days from weaning to 18 months of age. Concentrations of progesterone were measured weekly (from 4 to 10 months of age and from 14 to 18 months of age) to establish the onset of puberty. Ovulation rate at an induced and a natural heat (545 ± 1. and 562 ± 1. day old) was recorded. Prepartum shearing did not affect the age at puberty or the ovulation rate of female offspring, but those born as singles were more precocious ( P = .03) and heavier ( P = .02) at puberty than twin born lambs. Both the average value of parasite egg count ( P = . 7) and the Famacha index ( P = .02) for the entire study period were lower in lambs born to prepartum shorn ewes than those born to postpartum shorn ewes. In conclusion, shearing at 50 days of gestation did not affect the growth or the reproductive behavior of female offspring. However, female lambs born from ewe shorn during gestation showed a better response to the parasitic challenge, and further research is required to confirm this.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24965393>Treatment decision plans matter in elderly patients with gastrointestinal cancer: suboptimal or optimal?</a></h2><p>Aging is an important risk factor for cancer. Molecular changes and defective  associated with aging result in increased susceptibility to many carcinogens of the gastrointestinal system (GIS). Comorbidities and changes in drug metabolism in elderly patients make the treatment of GIS cancers difficult.Between January 2009 and December 2012, a total of 790 patients diagnosed with GIS cancers were retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 357 patients aged ≥ 65 years constituted the study population in which the patient characteristics, disease location, TNM stage, ECOG , co-morbidities, chemotherapy regimens and overall survival (OS) were assessed.The patient median age was 71 years (range 65-94). Cancer localizations were colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer, and the pancreaticobiliary system (PBS) cancer in 178 (49.9%), 124 (34.7%), and 55 (.4%) patients, respectively. A total of 260 (69%) patients underwent chemotherapy: 167 (64.3%) patients received optimal chemotherapy, and 93 (35.7%) suboptimal chemotherapy. The median OS was 47, 14, and 11 months in CRC, gastric, and PBS cancers, respectively. OS was better in the optimally-treated group than in the suboptimally-treated group among patients with all types of cancer. OS was 67 vs 19 months (p<.001), 17 vs 8 months (p=.004), and 12 vs 10 months (p=.46) in CRC, gastric, and PBS cancers in the optimal and suboptimal chemotherapy groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the disease stage in all cancer types and optimal chemotherapy in the CRC group were important predictors of survival (p<.001 and p=.021, respectively).Cancer is usually in advanced stage at the time of diagnosis in these elderly patients and screening programs might improve outcomes in this age group.

Mucosal  is important for protection against acquisition and subsequent meningococcal carriage. In this study, we assessed salivary antibody levels against meningococcal serogroup A (MenA), W (MenW) and Y (MenY) after vaccination with a quadrivalent MenACWY conjugated vaccine. We also compared salivary meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) antibody levels after monovalent MenC and quadrivalent MenACWY conjugated vaccination.Healthy participants, who had received MenC conjugate vaccine between 14 months and 3 years of age, received a (booster) MenC or MenACWY vaccination at age 10- years. MenA-, MenC-, MenW- and MenY-polysaccharide () specific IgG and IgA levels in saliva and serum and  specific secretory component levels in saliva were measured using the fluorescent-bead-based multiplex immunoassay.MenACYW vaccination increased salivary -specific IgA (2-fold) and IgG levels(>10-fold) for MenA, MenY, and MenW. After one year, salivary IgA levels had returned to baseline levels. Both vaccines induced an increase in salivary MenC- specific IgA (>3-fold) and IgG (>100-fold), with higher levels after MenC as compared to MenACWY vaccination. The antibody decay rate of MenC in saliva between one month and one year was similar for both vaccines. The overall correlation between serum and saliva IgA levels was low (R = .39, R = .58, R = .31, and R = .36 for MenA, MenC, MenW and MenY, respectively). Serogroup- specific IgG levels between serum and saliva correlated better (R ranged from .51 to .88).Both primary (MenA, MenY, and MenW) and booster (MenC) parenteral meningococcal conjugate vaccination induced high salivary antibody levels. The strong correlation for MenC, MenW and MenY between saliva and serum IgG levels indicates that saliva might be used as a reliable tool to measure vaccine responses after both primary and booster meningococcal vaccination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28389372>Rat tissue reaction and cytokine production induced by antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.</a></h2><p>The antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) inactivates the target cell via reactions among the photosensitizer (), Laser or Led and O. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tissue reaction and cytokine production promoted by aPDT with curcumin photosensitizer.Polyethylene tubes containing saline solution (control), 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and aPDT with curcumin  500mg/L, were implanted into dorsal connective tissue of Wistar rats. After 7, , 30, 60 and 90days of implantation, the animals were euthanized and the tubes with surrounding tissues were removed. The specimens were divided in two part, one half was processed, fixed and prepared for histological analysis by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. The other half was collected for IL-1β and IL-6 cytokine production using ELISA assay. The results were statistically analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn test (p<.05) for tissue reaction and ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's correction (p<.05) for ELISA.All groups showed severe tissue reactions at 7days, whilst a significantly decrease by time was observed. Regarding to cytokine production, aPDT increases the IL-1β levels in all periods of time (p<.05). However, for IL-6 levels, the highest value was observed with aPDT on the 90th day (p<.05).aPDT with curcumin  500mg/L demonstrated biocompatibility similar to saline solution and induced the IL-1β and IL-6 cytokines production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a nationwide serological survey during November-December 2012 of 2154 women aged -39 years to assess immunity to polio, measles, and rubella and to estimate congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) incidence. Measles and rubella antibodies were detected by IgG ELISA and polio antibodies by microneutralization testing. Age-structured catalytic models were fitted to rubella serological data to predict CRS cases. Overall, 29.8% of women lacked immunity to at least one poliovirus (PV); seroprevalence to PV1, PV2 and PV3 was 85.9%, 93.4% and 83.3%, respectively. Rubella and measles antibody seroprevalence was 73.3% and 95.9%, respectively. In the -19 years age group, 48.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 42.4-54.1] were susceptible to either PV1 or PV3, and 40.3% (95% CI 33.-47.5) to rubella virus. Based on rubella antibody seroprevalence, we estimate that >600 infants are born with CRS in Cambodia annually. Significant numbers of Cambodian women are still susceptible to polio and rubella, especially those aged -19 years, emphasizing the need to include adults in VPD surveillance and a potential role for vaccination strategies targeted at adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137469>S. typhi Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine-induced humoral  in travellers with immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease.</a></h2><p>Typhoid fever is a global health problem, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, the most widely used vaccine is the typhoid Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi-) vaccine. While epidemiological studies on its efficacy have been performed in children in endemic countries, there are no efficacy studies evaluating its use in travel medicine. Response to vaccination may differ in travellers receiving immunosuppressive therapy. This study investigates the humoral response to Vi- vaccination in travellers receiving immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease.We recruited patients from the LUMC rheumatology outpatient clinic and travellers from the travel clinic who had previously received Vi- vaccination and also immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid disease. We analysed blood samples acquired from 42 patients over a period of 3 years. We estimated the length of persistence of protective titres using the survival analysis using multiple cut-off values for protection and measured titre half-life and the influence of immunosuppressive medication on titre half-life using mixed models.Anti-Vi- antibody levels stayed above 10 EU/ml for a mean of 13.3 years, above  EU/ml for a mean of 10.1 years and above 20 EU/ml for a mean of 8.6 years after Vi- vaccination. Titre half-life was 7.5 years (95% CI 5.-14.7 years, P < .001). No significant influence of medication on titre half-life was found.Both persistence of protective antibody titres and titre half-life are longer than expected based on other studies. This warrants further study in adult volunteers, both in healthy individuals and patients suffering from rheumatoid disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8783351>Passively acquired anti-tetanus and anti-Haemophilus antibodies and the response to Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in infancy.</a></h2><p>To study the influence of maternally inherited tetanus antitoxin (anti-TT) antibodies on the response to the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) capsular polysaccharide ()-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T) vaccine.One hundred thirty healthy infants received their first dose of PRP-T in the same syringe with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP) at 1 to 2 months, and 66 of them received a second dose at 3 to 4 months of age.Maternal anti-TT antibodies did not interfere with the anti-Hib  response to the first PRP-T vaccination; the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti-Hib  was .14 microgram/ml in those with the lowest preimmunization anti-TT (< .3 IU/ml, n = ) and .13 microgram/ml in those with the highest anti-TT (> or = 3 IU/ml, n = 25). After the second dose of PRP-T there was a positive correlation (r = .37, P = .004) between the anti-Hib  response and the preimmunization anti-TT; those with the lowest preimmunization anti-TT (< .3 IU/ml, n = 9) achieved GMC of anti-Hib  of 1.22 micrograms/ml and those with anti-TT > or = IU/ml (n = 22) anti-Hib  GMC of 2.67 micrograms/ml.

While many studies have looked into the host genetic response to Salmonella infection, relatively few have used correlation of shedding traits with gene expression patterns to identify genes whose variable expression among different individuals may be associated with differences in Salmonella clearance and resistance. Here, we aimed to identify porcine genes and gene co-expression networks that differentiate distinct responses to Salmonella challenge with respect to faecal Salmonella shedding.Peripheral blood transcriptome profiles from 16 pigs belonging to extremes of the trait of faecal Salmonella shedding counts recorded up to 20 days post-inoculation (low shedders (LS), n = 8; persistent shedders (), n = 8) were generated using RNA-sequencing from samples collected just before (day ) and two days after (day 2) Salmonella inoculation. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of day  samples identified four modules of co-expressed genes significantly correlated with Salmonella shedding counts upon future challenge. Two of those modules consisted largely of innate  related genes, many of which were significantly up-regulated at day 2 post-inoculation. The connectivity at both days and the mean gene-wise expression levels at day  of the genes within these modules were higher in networks constructed using LS samples alone than those using  alone. Genes within these modules include those previously reported to be involved in Salmonella resistance such as SLC11A1 (formerly NRAMP1), TLR4, CD14 and CCR1 and those for which an association with Salmonella is novel, for example, SIGLEC5, IGSF6 and TNFSF13B.Our analysis integrates gene co-expression network analysis, gene-trait correlations and differential expression to provide new candidate regulators of Salmonella shedding in pigs. The comparatively higher expression (also confirmed in an independent dataset) and the significantly higher connectivity of genes within the Salmonella shedding associated modules in LS compared to  even before Salmonella challenge may be factors that contribute to the decreased faecal Salmonella shedding observed in LS following challenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29191581>Prognostic value of HLA-A2 status in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.</a></h2><p>The class I human leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a critical role as an escape mechanism of antitumoral . HLA-A2 status has been evaluated as a prognostic factor in lung cancer, mostly in localized disease and with inconsistent findings. We evaluated the role of HLA-A2 status as a prognostic factor in a large and homogeneus cohort of advanced NSCLC patients.Advanced NSCLC patients eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy were consecutively included in a single center between October 2009 and July 2015 in the prospective MSN study (). HLA-A2 status was analysed by flow cytometry. Clinical, pathological and molecular data were collected. A Cox model was used for prognostic analyses.Of 545 stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients included, 344 (63%) were male, 466 (85%) were smokers, 447 (83%) had  -1, 508 (93%) had stage IV, 407 (75%) had an adenocarcinoma and median age was 61 years (range, 21-84). Incidence of patients with EGFRmut, ALK-positive and KRASmut was 14% (49/361), 9% (29/333) and 31% (107/350), respectively. The overall rate of HLA-A2 positivity was 48%. No association was observed between HLA-A2 status and any patient or tumor characteristics analyzed. With a median follow-up of 27.1 months, median OS was 12.8 months [95%CI 11.-14.6] in HLA-A2+ vs. 12.5 months [95%CI 10.4-.3] in HLA-A2- patients (HR 1.05 [95%CI .86-1.29], p=.61). Median progression-free survival was similar in the two cohorts.HLA-A2 status was not identified as prognostic for benefit in a large advanced NSCLC population treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

If a disease associated causal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) operates essentially through a complex mechanism that involves multiple SNPs or possible environmental factors, its effect might be missed if the causal SNP is studied in isolation without accounting for these unknown genetic influences. In this study, we attempt to address the issue of reduced power that is inherent in single point association studies by accounting for genetic influences that negatively impact the detection of causal variant in single point association analysis. In our method we use propensity score () to adjust for the effect of SNPs that influence the marginal association of a candidate marker. These SNPs might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and/or epistatic with the target-SNP and have a joint interactive influence on the disease under study. We therefore propose a propensity score adjustment method (PSAM) as a tool for dimension reduction to improve the power for single locus studies through an estimated  to adjust for influence from these SNPs while regressing disease status on the target-genetic locus. The degree of freedom of such a test is therefore always restricted to 1.We assess PSAM under the null hypothesis of no disease association to affirm that it correctly controls for the type-I-error rate (<.05). PSAM displays reasonable power (>70%) and shows an average of % improvement in power as compared with commonly-used logistic regression method and PLINK under most simulated scenarios. Using the open-access multifactor dimensionality reduction dataset, PSAM displays improved significance for all disease loci. Through a whole genome study, PSAM was able to identify 21 SNPs from the GAW16 NARAC dataset by reducing their original trend-test p-values from within .001 and .05 to p-values less than .0009, and among which 6 SNPs were further found to be associated with immunity and .PSAM improves the significance of single-locus association of causal SNPs which have had marginal single point association by adjusting for influence from other SNPs in a dataset. This would explain part of the missing heritability without increasing the complexity of the model due to huge multiple testing scenarios. The newly reported SNPs from GAW16 data would provide evidences for further research to elucidate the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis. PSAM is proposed as an exploratory tool that would be complementary to other existing methods.

Mares were blocked by expected foaling date and assigned randomly within block to dietary treatments. Dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial with 2 planes of nutrition, pasture or pasture + grain mix (fed at .75% of BW on an as-fed basis) and 2 concentrations of Se yeast ( or .3 mg/kg of DMI). This resulted in 4 treatments: pasture (PA), pasture + Se (), pasture + grain mix (PG), and pasture + grain mix + Se (PGS). Assuming DMI at 2% of BW, the mares fed PA and  received approximately 100% of the calculated NRC (2007) DE requirements, whereas PG and PGS received 120%. Selenium supplementation began 110 d before the estimated foaling date, and all dietary treatments were terminated at parturition. At parturition, foaling variables were recorded. Additionally, placental weight was recorded and 2 samples from each placenta were collected for analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein. Colostrum was obtained for fat, protein, milk urea N, somatic cell count, and IgG analyses. Foal blood samples were collected at , 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after parturition for IgG analysis. There was no effect (P >or= .21) of Se or plane of nutrition on foaling variables; however, foal BW as a percentage of mare BW tended (P = .10) to be reduced in foals from mares on grain mix (PG and PGS; 7.6%) compared with mares not fed grain mix (PA and ; 8.%). There was also no effect (P >or= .20) of Se or plane of nutrition on placental cell number (mg of DNA/g), potential cellular activity (RNA:DNA), expulsion time, or weight. However, mares fed supplemental Se ( and PGS) had decreased (P = .02) placental cell size (24.1 mg of protein/mg of DNA) compared with mares not fed supplemental Se (PA and PG; 32.5 mg of protein/mg of DNA). There was also no effect (P >or= .18) of Se or plane of nutrition on colostral fat, protein, milk urea N, or somatic cell count. However, mares fed grain mix (PG and PGS) had less (P = .03) colostral IgG (76.5 g/L) compared with mares not fed grain mix (PA and ; 126.6 g/L). Foals from mares fed grain (PG and PGS) tended (P = .06) to have less overall serum IgG (13.6 g/L) compared with foals from mares not fed grain (PA and ; .3 g/L). These data indicate that the maternal diet during the last one-third of gestation affects placental efficiency and colostral IgG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30500939>A randomized, double-blind, phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination for recurrent glioblastoma.</a></h2><p>We conducted a phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24+ recurrent glioblastoma to develop a new treatment modality.We randomly assigned 88 recurrent glioblastoma patients to receive PPV (n = 58) or the placebo (n = 30) at a 2-to-1 ratio. Four of 12 warehouse peptides selected based on preexisting peptide-specific immunoglobulin G levels or the corresponding placebos were injected 1×/week for 12 weeks.Our trial met neither the primary (overall survival [OS]) nor secondary endpoints. Unfavorable factors for OS of 58 PPV patients compared with 30 placebo patients were SART2-93 peptide selection (n = 13 vs 8, hazard ratio [HR]: .9), ≥70 years old (4 vs 4, 7.87), >70 kg body weight (10 vs 7, 4.11), and performance status ()3 (8 vs 2, 2.82), respectively. Consequently, the median OS for PPV patients without SART2-93 selection plus one of these 3 favorable factors (<70 y old, ≤70 kg, or PS0-2) was significantly longer than that for the corresponding placebo patients (HR: .49, .44, and .51), respectively. Preexisting  against both all 12 warehouse peptides besides SART2-93 and the other cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope peptides was significantly depressed in the patients with SART2-93 selection (n = 21) compared with that of the patients without SART2-93 selection (n = 67). Biomarkers correlative for favorable OS of the PPV patients were a lower percentage of CD11b+CD14+HLA-DRlow immunosuppressive monocytes and a higher percentage of CD4+CD45RA- activated T cells, the intermediate levels of chemokine C-C ligand 2 (CCL2), vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, or haptoglobin, respectively.This phase III trial met neither the primary nor secondary endpoints.© The Author(s) 2018.

Our objective was to compare mechanical ventilator weaning duration for critically ill adults and children when managed with automated systems versus non-automated strategies. Secondary objectives were to determine differences in duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and adverse events.Electronic databases were searched to 30 September 2013 without language restrictions. We also searched conference proceedings; trial registration websites; and article reference lists. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We combined data using random-effects modelling.We identified 21 eligible trials totalling 1,676 participants. Pooled data from 16 trials indicated that automated systems reduced the geometric mean weaning duration by 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 45%), with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = 87%, P <.00001). Reduced weaning duration was found with mixed or medical ICU populations (42%, 95% CI 10% to 63%) and Smartcare/ (28%, 95% CI 7% to 49%) but not with surgical populations or using other systems. Automated systems reduced ventilation duration with no heterogeneity (10%, 95% CI 3% to 16%) and ICU LOS (8%, 95% CI % to %). There was no strong evidence of effect on mortality, hospital LOS, reintubation, self-extubation and non-invasive ventilation following extubation. Automated systems reduced prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Overall quality of evidence was high.Automated systems may reduce weaning and ventilation duration and ICU stay. Due to substantial trial heterogeneity an adequately powered, high quality, multi-centre randomized controlled trial is needed.</p></html>
