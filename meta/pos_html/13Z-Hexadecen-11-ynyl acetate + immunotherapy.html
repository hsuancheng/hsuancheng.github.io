<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27709828>Understanding the role of new systemic agents in the treatment of prostate cancer.</a></h2><p>To examine the current literature and identify key consensus findings from the available studies to better educate urologists and medical oncologists on agents used in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC).Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature on reported trials of systemic therapies for mPC. Two search terms were used: 'metastatic prostate cancer' and 'treatment'.A variety of agents have demonstrated improved overall survival in patients with mPC. Twenty recently documented trials were reported in the literature with a focus on enzalutamide, abiraterone , docetaxel and other newer agents. These studies were grouped based on patient populations.The increasing number of high-quality clinical trials, with overlapping patient populations has made defining the correct therapy for men with mPC challenging for urologists and medical oncologists. The data suggests that the optimal sequence of drugs is not only unknown but also not necessarily the same for each patient. As such, we suggest a more individualized approach to the treatment of prostate cancer depending on patient and disease factors.© 2016 The Authors BJU International © 2016 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27590486>Reduction of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) by prolyl-hydroxylase-inhibitors activating hypoxia-inducible transcription factors in an experimental mouse model.</a></h2><p>Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is the major limiting factor for long-term survival after lung transplantation. As previously shown, donor treatment with a PHD-inhibitor activating hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) prevents graft injury both in an allogenic kidney and aortic allograft transplant model. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HIF activation with a PHD-inhibitor on the development of OB.Fully MHC-mismatched C57BL/6 (H-2) donor tracheas were orthotopically transplanted into CBA/J (H-2) recipients. Donor animals received a single dose of PHD-inhibitor 2-(1-chloro-4-hydroxyisoquinoline-3-carboxamido)  (ICA) (40mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle control 4h before transplantation. Transplanted tracheas were harvested 14 or 30days after transplantation and were analyzed by histology, by immunofluorescence and by rtPCR for mRNA expression.Donor pre-conditioning with ICA resulted in HIF accumulation and induction of HIF target genes: HO-1, VEGF, MIF, TGFβ, and EpoR, which persisted during different times of ischemia. Grafts of vehicle treated controls showed substantially more luminal obliteration on postoperative day 30 in contrast to groups pre-treated with ICA [luminal obliteration 29.2±5% (ICA) vs. 36.7±8% (control), p<0.01]. We found significantly lower expression of TNFα, PDGFß, MCP-1, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 14days after ICA premedication. In addition ICA pre-treated groups revealed decreased T-cell and macrophage infiltration in tracheal grafts on days 30 after transplantation (p<0.05).Pre-treatment with ICA effectively reduced obliterative bronchiolitis. Our data suggest that activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) and thereby adaptation to low oxygen prevents the development of OB and allograft injury. Pharmaceutical inhibition of PHDs appears to be an attractive strategy for organ preservation that deserves further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Four fractions from whole bee venom (BV) were separated using medium pressure liquid chromatography. Their ability to induce the production of cytokines TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 in phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA)-treated U937 cells was assessed. The levels of the three cytokines produced by stimulation with the four fractions and crude BV without LPS were not significantly different from negative control values. However, co-stimulation of the cells with LPS and Fraction 4 (F-4) induced a 1.6-fold increase in TNF-α level (p < 0.05) compared to LPS alone. Likewise, LPS-induced IL-1β production was significantly synergised in the presence of F-1 (nine-fold), F-2 (six-fold), F-3 (four-fold) and F-4 (two-fold) fractions, but was only slightly enhanced with crude BV (1.5-fold) relative to LPS. Furthermore, the LPS-stimulated production of IL-6 was not significantly increased in cells co-treated with F-2 and F-3, but the organic fraction (F-4) showed an inhibitory effect (p < 0.05) on IL-6 production. The latter was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and found to contain(Z)-9-eicosen-1-ol. The effects observed with the purified BV fractions were more marked than those obtained with the crude sample.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26810718>Efficacy of glatiramer  in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: a multicenter retrospective study.</a></h2><p>Glatiramer  (GA) is an approved therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but its efficacy for the prevention of attacks in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) remains unknown. We did a multicenter retrospective analysis of GA-treated patients with NMOSD, identified through a national registry. Annualized relapse rate and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were the main outcome measures. We identified 23 GA-treated patients (21 female, 16 aquaporin-4 antibody-positive). GA was given for <6 months in seven patients; reasons for stopping were relapses (n = 3), confirmation of NMOSD (n = 2) and side effects (n = 2). Of 16 patients treated ≥ 6 months with GA (15 female, 11 aquaporin-4 antibody-positive), 14 experienced at least one relapse. There was no reduction in the mean annualized relapse rate in the total group (1.9 ± 1.1 before vs. 1.8 ± 1.4 during GA therapy), as well as in those patients who were aquaporin-4 antibody-positive, or had a history of prior  or not. The median EDSS increased (2.5 start vs. 3.5 finish of GA, P < 0.05). GA therapy was discontinued in 15/16 patients; reasons were therapeutic inefficacy in 13 and post-injection skin reactions in two patients. We conclude that GA is not beneficial for preventing attacks in most patients with NMOSD, particularly in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive cases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011660>Single arm phase II trial assessing the safety, compliance with and activity of Bezafibrate and medroxyProgesterone  (BaP) therapy against myeloid and lymphoid cancers.</a></h2><p>We previously reported the safety and efficacy of low dose BaP [ezafibrate (Bez) nd Medroxyrogesterone  (MPA)] in 20 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients for whom chemotherapy was not an option. This study provided evidence that BaP had anti-AML activity and improved haemopoiesis; absence of haematological toxicity allowed continuous daily administration. Similarly a previous trial in endemic Burkitt lymphoma demonstrated anti-B cell lymphoma activity of low and high dose BaP again in the absence of toxicity. We conducted a study to further evaluate the safety and activity of high dose BaP therapy in adults with AML (and high risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (BHNL). Eighteen patients were recruited to the study over 20 months, 16 AML/MDS, 1 CLL, and 1 BNHL. Although MPA was well tolerated throughout the study, only 2 patients were able to tolerate Bez treatment for their whole trial duration, indicating that Bez escalation is not feasible in the setting of adult AML/MDS. Thus there has been no obvious benefit in improved haemopoiesis or overt anti-leukaemia activity from the attempts to escalate BaP dose over previous published studies. Since current therapeutic options in MDS are restricted it may be now of value to continue to evaluate low dose BaP based approaches in low risk MDS rather than AML/high risk MDS. Furthermore, screening of low dose BaP against libraries of other already available dugs may identify an addition to BaP that augments the anti-neoplastic efficacy without significant toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26129902>Influence of Yanyankang Powder on Th1/Th2 in rats with experimental autoimmune uveitis.</a></h2><p>To study the influence of Yanyankang powder on Th1/Th2 in rats with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU).The EAU models were induced in Lewis rats by immunization with interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) 1177-1191 in complete Freund's adjuvant. The rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: a model control group, a Yanyankang group, and a prednisone group, 9 rats in each group. The model control group was intervened with saline solution by gavage. The Yanyankang group was intervened with Yanyankang powder 4 g/(kg day) by gavage. The prednisone group were intervened with prednisone  tablets 5 mg/(kg d) by gavage. All groups were intervened after immunization once every 2 days for 18 days and monitored by slit-lamp biomicroscopy daily until day 18. The levels of gamma interferon (INF-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the supernatants of T cells were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology was used for measuring Th1 and Th2 related cytokine mRNA expressions.Slighter intraocular inflammation was found in the Yanyankang group and the prednisone group than the control group. The levels of the IFN-γ and IL-10 in the supernatants of the spleen lymph node cells were 382.33±6.30, 155.87±4.46 μg/L in the Yanyankang group and 270.93±7.76, 265.32±11.88 μg/L in the prednisone group. Both had significant differences compared with the control group (941.53±8.59, 20.67±4.65 μg/L; =0.01). The PCR results showed the same tendency.Yanyankang powder showed favorable effects in the rats with EAU by influencing the function of Th1 and Th2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937130>H NMR-based metabolomic study of metabolic profiling for pollinosis.</a></h2><p>Allergic rhinitis is the main symptom of pollinosis, relieved by non-specific treatment universally. This study aimed to find the changes of serum metabolites between the seizure and remission periods of pollinosis and provide assistance in the diagnosis and/or therapy.Metabonomics based on H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to study the 37 serum samples of pollinosis patients.We believed that the decreased levels of isoleutine, leutine, valine, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, allo-threonine, alanine, methionine, glutamine, lysine, glycine, l-tyrosine, histidine, phenylalanine, lactate, , O-acetylcholine, creatine and creatinine and the increased level of -acetylglutamine at the seizure stage were statistically significant.Pollinosis could change the metabolic profiles of energy, amino acid and lipid in patients, which might be the diagnosis and/or prognosis markers for hay fever patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31038378>Implications of  with high-dose glatiramer  in acute phase of spinal cord injury in rats.</a></h2><p> Recently, many researches with different viewpoints have focused on application of  agents in treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) according to neuroprotective results in some neurodegenerative disease. Glatiramer  (GA) is the most commonly used drug for Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients that exerts an immunomodulatory effect against Myelin basic protein (MBP) antigen.  High-dose (2mg/kg) treatment of GA for 28 consecutive days after SCI was compared with its low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) treatment, SCI control and Sham control rat groups.  High-dose GA group had significantly worsened outcome in standard functional recovery evaluation test (BBB) 12 weeks after SCI compared to SCI control and low-dose GA groups, which was confirmed by augmented spinal cavity volume and reduced ventral horn motor neurons in high-dose GA group; however, there was no significant difference between low-dose GA and control SCI group. In addition, proliferation test performed on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes one week after SCI showed that high-dose GA injection has more significant effect on Division Index (DI) in response to MBP stimulation compared to low-dose GA and control SCI groups, which was associated with significant increase in IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17A secretion.  Along with confirmation of deleterious aspects of autoimmunity resulting from autoreactive lymphocytes against myelin antigens in SCI, this study has shown that high-dose  using GA, especially in acute phase after SCI, overwhelms any neuroprotective effect of adoptive immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28723476>Charting Recent Progress and Challenges in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Is There an Optimal Treatment Sequence?</a></h2><p>Recent developments in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have led to uncertainty about the optimal sequence of agents.To review and assess treatment options and sequence in patients with mCRPC.To identify data on the optimal use of approved treatments, we searched PubMed for studies on the use of recently approved agents for men with mCRPC published before March 2015. Phase 3 and other key studies were included in the review of efficacy and safety. In this review, we offer our critical interpretation of potential treatment sequences for drug use in the light of our clinical experience.Since 2004, the treatment landscape for mCRPC has changed dramatically following the approval of docetaxel, abiraterone , enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, denosumab, and radium-223 chloride. To date, only small-scale studies have been undertaken that provide evidence on the sequencing of these treatments. Ideally, randomised, prospective studies would evaluate different sequence options thoroughly so that physicians could make evidence-based decisions, but the number of new agents makes this impractical. When deciding which treatment to prescribe, physicians will need to use the available evidence combined with their own clinical judgement. The potential for cross-resistance between taxanes and hormonal therapies and the possibility that patients might not be suitable for aggressive therapies in later lines should be taken into account. Prevention of complications associated with bone metastases should also be a key consideration because of the major impact these events have on quality of life and healthcare costs.The recent approval of numerous new agents has resulted in considerable improvements in outcomes for patients with mCRPC. Further studies determining the optimal treatment algorithm, in addition to open discussion of best practice among physicians, are required to ensure patients obtain the maximum possible benefit from their treatment.In recent years a large number of new treatment options have been approved for use in men with prostate cancer. In the absence of clinical trials assessing the use of one option versus another in specific patient groups, it is important to review the currently published evidence to try to understand patients receive the best treatment options in the correct order.Copyright © 2016.

Here we show that RGC-32 expression in macrophages is induced by IL-4 and reduced by LPS, indicating a link between RGC-32 expression and M2 polarization. We demonstrated that the increased expression of RGC-32 is characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages, in which this protein suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and promotes the production of the anti-inflammatory mediator TGF-β. Consistent with in vitro data, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) express high levels of RGC-32, and this expression is induced by tumor-derived ascitic fluid in an M-CSF- and/or IL-4-dependent manner. Collectively, these results establish RGC-32 as a marker for M2 macrophage polarization and indicate that this protein is a potential target for cancer , targeting tumor-associated macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449370>Androgen Receptor Targeted Agents for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness [Internet].</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and is the fourth most common cancer in Canada. Approximately 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and 1 in 27 will die from the disease. However, the age-standardized mortality rate for all stages of prostate cancer have decreased by an average of 2.9% per year, or 41.0% from 1995 to 2012. The majority (75%) of diagnosed prostate cancer are stage I or stage II (localized), and the age-standardized incidence rate of these cancer stages have decreased by 3.2% per year from 2005 to 2015. The age-standardized incidence rate of stage III and IV cancers have remained relatively unchanged. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the mainstay treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Current ADT approaches include surgical castration or medical castration using a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist with or without an anti-androgen drug. Although over 80% of patients respond to ADT initially, nearly all eventually develop progressive disease following castration, a lethal stage known as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In 2004, docetaxel (DTX) was the first chemotherapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mCRPC. Since then, five newly developed agents were approved including a second generation taxane cabazitaxel (CTX), cellular  sipuleucel-T, radiopharmaceutical radium-223, and two androgen receptor-targeted agents (ARTA) abiraterone  (AA) and enzalutamide (ENZ). Since ARTA have been demonstrated by recent studies in improving overall survival (OS) in both chemotherapy-pretreated and chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC, both AA and ENZ have been approved as first-line treatment, instead of DTX. However, some patients have rapidly progressed on ARTA treatments despite the initial clinical effectiveness. After progression on first-line ARTA, it was unclear which subsequent therapy, such as second-line chemotherapy, an alternative ARTA, or an alternative ARTA with chemotherapy in between, would improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this report is to review the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of varying treatment sequences of ARTA in patients with CRPC.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686222>Multiple Sclerosis: Immunopathology and Treatment Update.</a></h2><p>The treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has changed over the last 20 years.

The most common injectable disease-modifying therapies in RRMS include β-interferons 1a or 1b and glatiramer . However, one of the major challenges of injectable disease-modifying therapies has been poor treatment adherence with approximately 50% of patients discontinuing the therapy within the first year. Herein, we go back to the basics to understand the immunopathophysiology of MS to gain insights in the development of new improved drug treatments.

The incidence rate of skin cancer has continuously increased over the past decades. In an effort to discover novel anticancer agents, we identified a novel tubulin inhibitor STK899704, which is structurally distinct from other microtubule-binding agents such as colchicine, vinca alkaloids and taxanes. STK899704 inhibited microtubule polymerization leading to mitotic arrest and suppressed the proliferation of various cancer cell lines as well as multidrug resistance cancer cell lines. In this study, our investigation is further extended into animal model to evaluate the effect of STK899704 on skin carcinogenesis in vivo. Surprisingly, almost 80% of the tumors treated with STK899704 were regressed with a one-fifth reduction in tumor volume. Furthermore, the efficacy of STK899704 was nearly 2 times higher than that of 5-fluorouracil, a widely used skin cancer therapeutic. Overall, our results suggest that STK899704 is a promising anticancer chemotherapeutic that may replace existing therapies, particularly for skin cancer.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Progestins are a first-line treatment for endometriosis via activation of pituitary progesterone receptors and suppression of systemic estrogen: a less than optimal treatment. Increasing evidence is beginning to show that progestins may also influence local endometriotic cells, which may contribute to their clinical efficacy.Endometrial stromal cells (ESC) isolated from women with endometriosis were cultured with TNF-α to simulate an inflammatory environment. ESC were treated with the progestins, medroxyprogesterone  (MPA), norethisterone  (NETA), or dienogest (DNG) and cytokine mRNA production, protein secretion, and cell viability measured.DNG, NETA, and MPA suppressed the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 from ESC. DNG and NETA only reduced the TNF-α-stimulated mRNA production. All three progestins suppressed TNF-α-stimulated ESC proliferation.Progestins may influence endometriotic stromal cells altering the inflammatory microenvironment and their clinical efficacy.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, the knowledge about the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on monocyte activation is limited. Conventional pharmacokinetic methods for immunosuppressive drug monitoring are not cell type-specific. In this study, phosphorylation of 3 signaling proteins was measured to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of immunosuppression on monocyte activation in kidney transplant patients.Blood samples from 20 kidney transplant recipients were monitored before and during the first year after transplantation. All patients received induction therapy with basiliximab, followed by tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone maintenance therapy. TAC whole-blood predose concentrations were determined using an antibody-conjugated magnetic immunoassay. Samples were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)/ionomycin, and phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ERK, and Akt in CD14 monocytes was quantified by phospho-specific flow cytometry.Phosphorylation of p38MAPK and Akt in monocytes of immunosuppressed recipients was lower after 360 days compared with before transplantation in the unstimulated samples [mean reduction in median fluorescence intensity 36%; range -28% to 77% for p-p38MAPK and 20%; range -22% to 53% for p-Akt; P < 0.05]. P-ERK was only decreased at day 4 after transplantation (mean inhibition 23%; range -52% to 73%; P < 0.05). At day 4, when the highest whole-blood predose TAC concentrations were measured, p-p38MAPK and p-Akt, but not p-ERK, correlated inversely with TAC (rs = -0.65; P = 0.01 and rs = -0.58; P = 0.03, respectively).Immunosuppressive drug combination therapy partially inhibits monocyte activation pathways after kidney transplantation.

Conversely, the effect of cancer treatments on the composition of the GI microbiota is poorly understood. We hypothesized that oral androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ATT), including bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone , may be associated with compositional differences in the GI microbiota.We profiled the fecal microbiota in a cross-sectional study of 30 patients that included healthy male volunteers and men with different clinical states of prostate cancer (i.e., localized, biochemically recurrent, and metastatic disease) using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Functional inference of identified taxa was performed using PICRUSt.We report a significant difference in alpha diversity in GI microbiota among men with versus without a prostate cancer diagnosis. Further analysis identified significant compositional differences in the GI microbiota of men taking ATT, including a greater abundance of species previously linked to response to anti-PD-1  such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae spp. In functional analyses, we found an enriched representation of bacterial gene pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis in the fecal microbiota of men taking oral ATT.There are measurable differences in the GI microbiota of men receiving oral ATT. We speculate that oral hormonal therapies for prostate cancer may alter the GI microbiota, influence clinical responses to ATT, and/or potentially modulate the antitumor effects of future therapies including .

Our previous investigations have confirmed that the total biflavonoids in ethyl  extract from S. doederleinii (SDEA) have favorable anticancer potentials. However, the in vivo process of its bioactive ingredients remains unknown. In this paper, a sensitive and reliable method was developed for simultaneous quantification of main five biflavonoids, including amentoflavone, robustaflavone, 2″,3″-dihydro-3',3″-biapigenin, 3',3″-binaringenin and delicaflavone in the ethyl  extract of S. doederleinii (SDEA extract) in rat plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Chromatographic separation was performed using an Ultimate XB-C18 (100×2.1mm, 3.5μm) with gradient elution of water (0.5% acetic acid) and acetonitrile at 0.2mL/min. All analytes with internal standard (chrysin) were detected using selective reaction monitoring (SRM) in negative ionization mode. The method showed a good linearity over a wide concentration range (r>0.99). The limits of quantification for the biflavonoids were less than 10ng/mL. The developed method was applied to the comparatively pharmacokinetic study of the five biflavonoids after oral or intravenous administration of SDEA extract in rats. In addition, in silico assessments of permeability and solubility of these biflavonoids were also performed to understand their poor bioavailability. It is the first time to report the in vivo process profiles of the biflavonoids of SDEA extract in rats.Copyright © 2017.

However, whether these cells play a beneficial or detrimental role is still a matter of debate. Although some studies showed that MBP-T cells are mainly helper T (Th) cells, their subtypes are still not very clear. One possible explanation for MBP-T immunization leading to conflicting results may be the different subtypes of T cells are responsible for distinct effects. In this study, the Th1 and Th2 type MBP-T cells (MBP-Th1 and -Th2) were polarized in vitro, and their effects on the local immune microenvironment and tissue repair of spinal cord injury (SCI) after adoptive immunization were investigated. In MBP-Th1 cell transferred rats, the high levels of pro-inflammatory cells (Th1 cells and M1 macrophages) and cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, -β, IL-1β) were detected in the injured spinal cord; however, the anti-inflammatory cells (Th2 cells, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages) and cytokines (IL-4, -10, and -13) were found in MBP-Th2 cell transferred animals. MBP-Th2 cell transfer resulted in decreased lesion volume, increased myelination of axons, and preservation of neurons. This was accompanied by significant locomotor improvement. These results indicate that MBP-Th2 adoptive transfer has beneficial effects on the injured spinal cord, in which the increased number of Th2 cells may alter the local microenvironment from one primarily populated by Th1 and M1 cells to another dominated by Th2, Treg, and M2 cells and is conducive for SCI repair.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we sought to develop an effective strategy to expand human iNK T cells for use in cell therapy to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in ASCT.Human iNK T cells were first enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using magnetic-activated cell sorting separation, then co-cultured with dendritic cells in the presence of agonist glycolipids, alpha-galactosylceramide, for 2 weeks.The single antigenic stimulation reliably expanded iNK T cells to an average of 2.8 × 10 per 5 × 10 PBMCs in an average purity of 98.8% in 2 weeks (N = 24). The expanded iNK T cells contained a significantly higher level of CD4 and central memory phenotype (CD45RACD62L) compared with freshly isolated iNK T cells, and maintained their ability to produce both Th-1 (interferon [IFN]γ and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]α) and Th-2 type cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5 and IL-13) upon antigenic stimulation or stimulation with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin. Interestingly, expanded iNK T cells were highly autoreactive and produced a Th-2 polarized cytokine production profile after being co-cultured with dendritic cells alone without exogenous agonist glycolipid antigen. Lastly, expanded iNK T cells suppressed conventional T-cell proliferation and ameliorated xenograft GVHD (hazard ratio, 0.1266; P < 0.0001).We have demonstrated a feasible approach for obtaining ex vivo expanded, highly enriched human iNK T cells for use in adoptive cell therapy to prevent GVHD in ASCT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Bu-Fei Decoction (BFD) is a classical formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to alleviate lung cancer related symptoms, whether it has antitumor effect or could influence cancer microenvironment deserves further study. The aim of the present study was to examine the antitumor effect of BFD on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to investigate the underlying mechanisms through tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). M2-polarized TAMs were induced by Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). The antitumor activity of BFD in vitro was investigated in A549 and H1975 cells using MTT assay. The in vivo anticancer effect of BFD was evaluated in athymic nude mouse xenograft model. The invasive and migration properties of NSCLC cells were measured using Transwell. The protein expression was assessed using western blotting, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The gene expression was examined using RT-PCR. TAMs was successfully established. Conditioned medium from TAMs increased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NSCLC cells (p<0.05). BFD showed dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities induced by TAMs. TAMs and rhIL-10 promoted the mRNA and protein expression of PD-L1 in NSCLC cells (p<0.01). Anti‑IL‑10 antibodies inhibited the elevated PD-L1 expression induced by TAMs. In vitro, the expression of PD-L1 and IL-10 was inhibited by BFD dose-dependently. In vivo, BFD suppressed A549 and H1975 tumor growth and decreased the expression of IL-10, PD-L1 and CD206. The results showed that TAMs play an important role in tumor progression of NSCLC, which was associated with tumor proliferation, migration, invasion and immunosuppression. Moreover, the antitumor mechanism of BFD is related to interruption of the link between TAMs and cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of IL-10 and PD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated BFD's potential as a novel treatment for NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29142857>Advances in Imaging: Brain Tumors to Alzheimer's Disease.</a></h2><p>Professor Black and colleagues have been working to improve the quality and sensitivity of imaging in the early detection of conditions from brain tumors to Alzheimer's disease to enhance treatment protocols and patient management. Professor Black et al introduced nanoparticles to improve MRI imaging. These nanoparticles consist of poly (b-L- malic acid (PMLA)) conjugates with monoclonal antibodies ((mAbs)) and Gd-DOTA. These are known as MRI nano-imaging agents (NIA). Most importantly, they can penetrate the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach brain tumors (primary or metastasis). This is effective in cases of brain tumors or breast cancer or other cancers such as lung cancer and gastric cancer having HER2 and/or EGFR positive crossing BBB. By the covalent conjugation of MR contrast (NIA), the MRI virtual biopsy can differentiate brain tumors from infections or other brain pathological conditions. The brain's intrinsic natural fluorescence such as NADH, FAD, lipopigments and porphyrin in the brain tissue can be identified by using time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) which is operated through the use of ultra-short laser. TRFS produces various color bands to differentiate the tumor from normal brain tissue in real time and registers the data on a 3D map. This is significant, as this will provide a greatly improved assessment methodology of tissue type. Consequently, this will potentially result in shorter operation times as well as more satisfactory tumor removal. In the detection of Alzheimer disease, amyloid plaque is deposited in retina tissue (including the RGC, RNFL and inner plexiform layer) which can produce a fluorescence effect by using curcumin as a contrast. This is then shown by human retina amyloid imaging device. Immunotherapies with glatiramer  (GA) have been shown to reduce amyloid deposits in brain and retinal AB deposits in mice. The study of advanced imaging technology and techniques including NIA, TRFS and the detection of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer disease are very important approaches to create a new era for diagnostic and therapeutic management of brain tumors and other cancers (HER2 and/or EGFR positive). This pioneering work by Professor Black, and colleagues, gives rise to a new hope for cancer patients for targeted therapy and for immunotherapies in Alzheimer's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448542>Development of a thermostable microneedle patch for influenza vaccination.</a></h2><p>The goal of this study is to develop thermostable microneedle patch formulations for influenza vaccine that can be partially or completely removed from the cold chain. During vaccine drying associated with microneedle patch manufacturing, ammonium  and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer salts stabilized influenza vaccine, surfactants had little effect during drying, drying temperature had weak effects on vaccine stability, and drying on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) led to increased stability compared with drying on stainless steel. A number of excipients, mostly polysaccharides and some amino acids, further stabilized the influenza vaccine during drying. Over longer time scales of storage, combinations of stabilizers preserved the most vaccine activity. Finally, dissolving microneedle patches formulated with arginine and calcium heptagluconate had no significant activity loss for all three strains of seasonal influenza vaccine during storage at room temperature for 6 months. We conclude that appropriately formulated microneedle patches can exhibit remarkable thermostability that could enable storage and distribution of influenza vaccine outside the cold chain.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28572622>Probing the action of a novel anti-leukaemic drug therapy at the single cell level using modern vibrational spectroscopy techniques.</a></h2><p>Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a life threatening cancer for which there is an urgent clinical need for novel therapeutic approaches. A redeployed drug combination of bezafibrate and medroxyprogesterone  (BaP) has shown anti-leukaemic activity in vitro and in vivo. Elucidation of the BaP mechanism of action is required in order to understand how to maximise the clinical benefit. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, Synchrotron radiation FTIR (S-FTIR) and Raman microspectroscopy are powerful complementary techniques which were employed to probe the biochemical composition of two AML cell lines in the presence and absence of BaP. Analysis was performed on single living cells along with dehydrated and fixed cells to provide a large and detailed data set. A consideration of the main spectral differences in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis reveals a significant change to the cellular lipid composition with drug treatment; furthermore, this response is not caused by cell apoptosis. No change to the DNA of either cell line was observed suggesting this combination therapy primarily targets lipid biosynthesis or effects bioactive lipids that activate specific signalling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636286>The role of assembly parameters on polyplex poly(beta-amino ester) nanoparticle transfections.</a></h2><p>Intracellular delivery of nucleic acids to mammalian cells using polyplex nanoparticles (NPs) remains a challenge both in vitro and in vivo, with transfections often suffering from variable efficacy. To improve reproducibility and efficacy of transfections in vitro using a next-generation polyplex transfection material poly(beta-amino ester)s (PBAEs), the influence of multiple variables in the preparation of these NPs on their transfection efficacy was explored. The results indicate that even though PBAE/pDNA polyplex NPs are formed by the self-assembly of polyelectrolytes, their transfection is not affected by the manner in which the components are mixed, facilitating self-assembly in a single step, but timing for self-assembly of 5-20 min is optimal. In addition, even though the biomaterials are biodegradable in water, their efficacy is not affected by up to eight freeze-thaw cycles of the polymer. It was found that there is a greater stability of nucleic acid-complexed polymer as a polyplex nanoparticle compared with free polymer. Finally, by exploring multiple buffer systems, it was identified that utilization of divalent cation magnesium or calcium  buffers at pH 5.0 is optimal for transfection using these polymeric materials, boosting transfection several folds compared with monovalent cations. Together, these results can improve the reproducibility and efficacy of PBAE and similar polyplex nanoparticle transfections and improve the robustness of using these biomaterials for bioengineering and biotechnology applications.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29734647>Recent Advances in Prostate Cancer Treatment and Drug Discovery.</a></h2><p>Novel drugs, drug sequences and combinations have improved the outcome of prostate cancer in recent years.

Adding abiraterone  to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in order to achieve complete androgen blockade has proven highly beneficial for treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Also, ADT together with docetaxel treatment showed significant benefit in mHSPC. Ongoing clinical trials for different subgroups of prostate cancer patients include the evaluation of the second-generation AR antagonists enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, of inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, of inhibitors of DNA damage response, of targeted alpha therapy and of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting approaches. Advanced clinical studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown limited benefits in prostate cancer and more trials are needed to demonstrate efficacy. The identification of improved, personalized treatments will be much supported by the major progress recently made in the molecular characterization of early- and late-stage prostate cancer using &ldquo;omics&rdquo; technologies.

Soluble form of CD40L has been widely studied as marker of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Here we analyze serum concentrations of sCD40L, as well as 14 cytokines, in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treated with Glatiramer  or Interferon beta. In the healthy control group, we found in serum a highly positive correlation between sCD40L and Interleukin (IL)-31, an anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine. Additionally, an important reduction in IL-31 and sCD40L serum levels, as well as a significant reduction in CD40 mRNA expression and complete depletion of CD40L mRNA, detected from peripheral blood cells, was found in treated patients with MS. Therefore, sCD40L and IL-31 must be taken into account as possible prognostic markers when analyzing the disease progress of MS in order to provide more personalized treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Therefore, development of effective vaccines against PEDV variant strains is urgently needed. Recently, it has been reported that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 domain of PEDV spike protein is responsible for binding to the 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a possible sugar co-receptor. Therefore, the NTD of S1 domain could be an attractive target for the development of subunit vaccines. In this study, the NTD spanning amino acid residues 25-229 (S25-229) of S1 domain of PEDV variant strain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). S25-229 IBs were solubilized in 20 mM sodium  (pH 4.5) buffer containing 8 M urea and 1 mM dithiothreitol with 95% yield. Solubilized S25-229 IBs were refolded by 10-fold flash dilution and purified by one-step cation exchange chromatography with >95% purity and 20% yield. The CD spectrum of S25-229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure. In an indirect ELISA, purified S25-229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti-PEDV sera. In addition, immunization of mice with 20 μg of purified S25-229 elicited highly potent serum IgG titers. Finally, mouse antisera against S25-229 showed immune reactivity with native PEDV S protein in an immunofluorescence assay. These results suggest that purified S25-229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine against PEDV variant strains.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Prostate cancer is the first most diagnosed cancer of men in developed countries and the forth one in developing countries in terms of incidence rate. It is also the third incident cancer of men in Iran along with a prevalence of about 10,000 cases. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a severe stage of the disease with a number of newly discovered treatment options. These therapeutic alternatives including abiraterone , enzalutamide, cabazitaxel,  with sipuleucel-T, radiopharmaceuticals and bone-targeted therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab) along with docetaxel have made the decision making process complex and challenging for clinicians. In addition to the challenges of selecting the best-fit treatment, high costs of new pharmaceuticals and technologies necessitates the health policy-makers to develop practice guidelines in adaptation with local resources and limitations. The aim of this paper is to review the clinical guidelines for the management of CRPC. For better comprehension of guideline recommendations, the main clinical trials on new treatments were also identified. The efficacy and safety outcomes including but not limited to overall survival, progression free survival, quality of life and adverse effects were summarized.

Despite widespread use of IFN-β, the therapeutic mechanism is still partially understood. Particularly, the clinical relevance of increased B cell activity during IFN-β treatment is unclear. In this article, we show that IFN-β pushes some B cells into a transitional, regulatory population that is a critical mechanism for therapy. IFN-β treatment increases the absolute number of regulatory CD19(+)CD24(++)CD38(++) transitional B cells in peripheral blood relative to treatment-naive and Copaxone-treated patients. In addition, we found that transitional B cells from both healthy controls and IFN-β-treated MS patients are potent producers of IL-10, and that the capability of IFN-β to induce IL-10 is amplified when B cells are stimulated. Similar changes are seen in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. IFN-β treatment increases transitional and regulatory B cell populations, as well as IL-10 secretion in the spleen. Furthermore, we found that IFN-β increases autoantibody production, implicating humoral immune activation in B cell regulatory responses. Finally, we demonstrate that IFN-β therapy requires immune-regulatory B cells by showing that B cell-deficient mice do not benefit clinically or histopathologically from IFN-β treatment. These results have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487906>EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE HYDRO-ETHANOLIC ROOT EXTRACT OF  ON HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN CYCLOPHOSPAMIDE TREATED RATS.</a></h2><p>The use of cyclophosphamide in cancer therapy is usually associated with challenging immunosuppression which exposes patients to increased risk of anemia and necessitating preventive measures during therapy.

Sipuleucel-T) or in vivo, for stimulating cellular immunity has been a leading approach for cancer vaccines. We have rationally engineered a nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery system for vaccines (InAc-NPs) using inulin  (InAc) as the polymer to target DCs. The material and the antigen-encapsulated InAc-NPs (∼190 nm in diameter) were characterized for their physicochemical properties. As a potent vaccine adjuvant, InAc-NPs activated TLR4 on multiple immune cells, including DCs and primary swine and human cells, to secrete various cytokines as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, InAc-NPs promoted the maturation of DCs as observed by a decreased phagocytic ability and enhanced capability to activate various maturation markers (MHC-I, MHC-II, CD40, and CD80) quantified using flow cytometry. In mice, the InAc-NPs produced strong serum antibody titers (total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) against the encapsulated antigen (ovalbumin) similar to complete Freund's adjuvant. Additionally, as a dose-sparing delivery system, antigen delivered through InAc-NPs generated higher antibody titers (IgG1, 1.57 times; IgG-total, 1.66 times; and IgG2a, 29.8 times) even at 100 times less antigen dose. High amounts of cytokines representing both humoral (IL4 and IL10) and cell-mediated (IL2 and IFN-γ) immunities were secreted from splenocytes of mice immunized with InAc-NPs. Importantly, InAc-NPs provided complete protection in 100% of the vaccinated mice from metastasis of intravenously injected melanoma cells (B-F) to lungs. In addition, the InAc-NPs were cleared from the injection site within 30 h of injection (in vivo imaging) and displayed no toxicity at the injection site (histology).

It has also been shown that CBD enhances IL-2 production in response to low-level T cell stimulation. Since IL-2, in combination with TGF-β1, are critical for Treg induction, we hypothesized that CBD would induce CD4CD25FOXP3 Tregs in response to low-level stimulation. Low-level T cell stimulation conditions were established based on minimal CD25 expression in CD4 cells using suboptimal PMA/Io (4nM/0.05μM, S/o), ultrasuboptimal PMA/Io (1nM/0.0125μM, Us/o) or soluble anti-CD3/28 (400-800ng each, s3/28). CBD increased CD25FOXP3 cells from CD4, CD4CD25, and CD4CD25 T cells, as well as in CD4 T cells derived from FOXP3-GFP mice. Most importantly, the Us/o+CBD-induced CD4CD25 Tregs robustly suppressed responder T cell proliferation, demonstrating that the mechanism by which CBD is immunosuppressive under low-level T cell stimulation involves induction of functional Tregs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The removal of activated leukocytes and several additional immunomodulatory mechanisms have been so far suggested to explain the anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment. Recent data indicate that, during centrifugation based apheresis, sHLA-I adsorbed to plastic circuits is able to induce TGFβ production in activated leukocytes. On these bases, the present study was aimed at analyzing if this model could be applied to a noncentrifugation based apheresis, such as granulocyte and monocyte apheresis. Ten patients with ulcerative colitis were enrolled. Every patient received 5 weekly apheresis treatments. Cellulose  beads removed from the column post-GMA were stained by fluorescent anticlass I mAb and examined by fluorescent microscope. Moreover, sFasL plasma concentration, TGFβ plasma levels, and the percentage of TGFβ positive neutrophils were evaluated before and immediately after each single apheresis. Immunofluorescent images revealed a homogeneous layer of a sHLA-I adsorbed to the surface of the beads recovered following the procedure. sFasL plasma concentration progressively increased both following the procedures and during inter-procedure periods. Consistently, also TGFβ plasma levels and the percentage of TGFβ positive neutrophils increased during the procedures with a meaningful relationship with sFasL plasma levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that the immunosuppressive effects attributed to granulocyte and monocyte apheresis might depend, at least in part, on the sensitivity of activated leucocytes to the bioactivity of sHLA-I molecules.

The coefficients of variation and relative errors obtained for the assessment of intra- and interassay precision and accuracy were less than 15%. CY and CEPM were found to be stable in human plasma after three successive freeze/thaw cycles, during storage for 4h at room temperature, and after 24h inside the autosampler at 4°C, with deviations less than 15%. The method was applied to the study of the pharmacokinetics of CY and its metabolite CEPM in patients with multiple sclerosis (n=10) who received a CY pretransplant conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The pharmacokinetic parameters showed plasma accumulation of the (S)-(-)-CY enantiomer (S/R ratio=1.3) and lack of enantioselective exposure to the CEPM metabolite (S/R ratio=1.0).Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Spleen cells were loaded with Copaxone(®), incubated with mitomycin C (MICCop) and injected into mice after the first bout of relapsing-remitting EAE. Immunosuppression mediated by MICCop was investigated in vivo by daily assessment of clinical signs of paralysis and in in vitro restimulation assays of peripheral immune cells. Cytokine profiling was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Migration of MICCop cells after injection was examined by biodistribution analysis of (111)Indium-labelled MICCop. The number and inhibitory activity of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells were analysed by histology, flow cytometry and in vitro mixed lymphocyte cultures. In order to assess the specificity of MICCop-induced suppression, treated EAE mice were challenged with the control protein ovalbumin. Humoral and cellular immune responses were then determined by ELISA and in vitro antigen restimulation assay.MICCop cells were able to inhibit the harmful autoreactive T-cell response and prevented mice from further relapses without affecting general immune responses. Administered MICCop migrated to various organs leading to an increased infiltration of the spleen and the central nervous system with CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) cells displaying a suppressive cytokine profile and inhibiting T-cell responses.We describe a clinically applicable cell therapeutic approach for controlling relapses in autoimmune encephalomyelitis by specifically silencing the deleterious autoimmune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728478>Multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression signatures in individual cells using flow or mass cytometry.</a></h2><p>Advances in single-cell analysis technologies are providing novel insights into phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within seemingly identical cell populations. RNA within single cells can be analyzed using unbiased sequencing protocols or through more targeted approaches using in situ hybridization (ISH). The proximity ligation assay for RNA (PLAYR) approach is a sensitive and high-throughput technique that relies on in situ and proximal ligation to measure at least 27 specific RNAs by flow or mass cytometry. We provide detailed instructions for combining this technique with antibody-based detection of surface/internal protein, allowing simultaneous highly multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression at single-cell resolution. PLAYR overcomes limitations on multiplexing seen in previous branching DNA-based RNA detection techniques by integration of a transcript-specific oligonucleotide sequence within a rolling-circle amplification (RCA). This unique transcript-associated sequence can then be detected by heavy metal (for mass cytometry)- or fluorophore (for flow cytometry)-conjugated complementary detection oligonucleotides. Included in this protocol is methodology to label oligonucleotides with lanthanide metals for use in mass cytometry. When analyzed by mass cytometry, up to 40 variables (with scope for future expansion) can be measured simultaneously. We used the described protocol to demonstrate intraclonal heterogeneity within primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, but it can be adapted to other primary cells or cell lines in suspension. This robust, reliable and reproducible protocol can be completed in 2-3 d and can be paused at several stages for convenience.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510995>Toll-Like Receptor 7 Agonist-Induced Dermatitis Causes Severe Dextran Sulfate Sodium Colitis by Altering the Gut Microbiome and Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are both chronic inflammatory diseases occurring in the skin and gut, respectively. It is well established that psoriasis and IBD have high concordance rates, and similar changes in immune cells and microbiome composition have been reported in both conditions. To study this connection, we used a combination murine model of psoriatic dermatitis and colitis in which mice were treated topically with the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) and fed dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).We applied IMQ topically to B6 mice (IMQ mice) and subsequently fed them 2% DSS in their drinking water. Disease activity and immune cell phenotypes were analyzed, and the microbial composition of fecal samples was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We transplanted feces from IMQ mice to germ-free IQI/Jic (IQI) mice and fed them DSS to assess the effect of the gut microbiome on disease.We first confirmed that IMQ mice showed accelerated DSS colitis. IMQ mice had decreased numbers of IgD and IgM B cells and increased numbers of non-cytokine-producing macrophages in the gut. Moreover, the gut microbiomes of IMQ mice were perturbed, with significant reductions of  and  populations. Germ-free mice transplanted with feces from IMQ mice, but not with feces from untreated mice, also developed exacerbated DSS colitis.These results suggest that skin inflammation may contribute to pathogenic conditions in the gut via immunologic and microbiological changes. Our finding of a novel potential skin-gut interaction provides new insights into the coincidence of psoriasis and IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849488>Sepsis Induces a Dysregulated Neutrophil Phenotype That Is Associated with Increased Mortality.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil dysfunction in sepsis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiorgan failure; however, the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) remains uncertain. We aimed to determine the sequential changes in ex vivo NETosis and its relationship with mortality in patients with sepsis and severe sepsis.This was a prospective observational cohort study enrolling 21 healthy age-matched controls and 39 sepsis and 60 severe sepsis patients from acute admissions to two UK hospitals. Patients had sequential bloods for the ex vivo assessment of NETosis in response to phorbol-myristate  (PMA) using a fluorometric technique and chemotaxis using time-lapse video microscopy. Continuous data was tested for normality, with appropriate parametric and nonparametric tests, whilst categorical data was analysed using a chi-squared test. Correlations were performed using Spearman's rho.Ex vivo NETosis was reduced in patients with severe sepsis, compared to patients with sepsis and controls ( = 0.002). PMA NETosis from patients with septic shock was reduced further ( < 0.001) compared to controls. The degree of metabolic acidosis correlated with reduced NETosis ( < 0.001), and this was replicated when neutrophils from healthy donors were incubated in acidotic media. Reduced NETosis at baseline was associated with an increased 30-day ( = 0.002) and 90-day mortality ( = 0.014) in sepsis patients. These findings were accompanied by defects in neutrophil migration and delayed apoptosis. Resolution of sepsis was not associated with the return to baseline levels of NETosis or migration.Sepsis induces significant changes in neutrophil function with the degree of dysfunction corresponding to the severity of the septic insult which persists beyond physiological recovery from sepsis. The changes induced lead to the failure to effectively contain and eliminate the invading pathogens and contribute to sepsis-induced immunosuppression. For the first time, we demonstrate that reduced ex vivo NETosis is associated with poorer outcomes from sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29149784>Anti-inflammatory Property of β-D-Mannuronic Acid (M2000) on Expression and Activity of Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 and -9 through CD147 Molecule in Phorbol Myristate -differentiated THP-1 Cells.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of M2000, a novel non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with immunosuppressive property and without gastro-nephrotoxicitic effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and (MMP)-9 in phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 cells. Gene expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are inhibited respectively by the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and (TIMP)-1 and are induced by extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (CD147/EMMPRIN). In this study, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2. Flow cytometry and zymography were applied to determine cellular surface expression of CD147 and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively. Our results showed that treatment of THP-1 cells with high concentration (25 µg/mL) of M2000 significantly decreased the cellular surface expression of CD147 (p<0.05) and the gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (p<0.05), and inhibited the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (p<0.05). According to our results, M2000 can reduce inflammation through inhibition of the cellular surface expression of CD147 and decrease the gene expression and gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30512399>[New treatments and strategy in multiple sclerosis]</a></h2><p>New treatments and strategy in multiple sclerosis. Currently, ten drugs are approved for the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS). Since 2007, 4 new disease-modifying therapies (DMT) have been approved and several DMT will soon be commercialized including new galenic forms of self-injectable DMTs (pegylated interferon beta 1a and glatiramer ). Although these self-injectable DMT have moderate efficacy they have proved to be safe on long term and able to delay disability progression and the entry in the secondary progressive phase of the disease. Some of the new DMT have similar efficacy to the first DMT, other are more efficient but carry the risk of serious adverse events. We report the efficacy and safety of these new drugs in reference to their pivotal study. The current therapeutic strategy is sequential: a first DMT is initiated, then in case of intolerance or failure an other DMT with a different mode of action or second line DMT is proposed. Others strategies may be proposed according to the patient's evolution such as an induction by an aggressive  followed by a maintenance with a first line DMT. Whatever the strategy used the most important goal is to reach a shared decison between the patient and his or her neurologist which guarantee the best adherence to DMTs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002323>Factors Associated With Use of Sipuleucel-T to Treat Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer.</a></h2><p>Sipuleucel-T is an  that has been approved for use in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, sipuleucel-T may not be available to some patients because of logistics, cost, and practice structure.To identify factors associated with the adoption of sipuleucel-T across the United States.In this retrospective cohort study, patients with prostate cancer who received therapy for mCRPC (docetaxel, abiraterone , enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, radium 223, or sipuleucel-T) from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2016, were identified in a large claims database of commercially insured patients. Patients who received sipuleucel-T were compared with patients who received any of the other treatments for mCRPC but did not receive sipuleucel-T. Data were analyzed from May 3, 2018, to February 24, 2019.Sipuleucel-T treatment.Patterns of treatment that involved the use of sipuleucel-T were elucidated, and binomial logistic regression was conducted to determine patient and physician factors that were associated with the use of sipuleucel-T and whether patients received sipuleucel-T in isolation or concurrently with other therapies.Among 7272 patients who received a treatment for mCRPC, 730 (10.0%) received sipuleucel-T. Mean (SD) age of patients in the entire cohort was 73.2 (9.2) years; 6739 (92.7%) were non-Hispanic and 975 (13.4%) were black. In multivariable analysis, patients who were Hispanic (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38-0.86) or lived in the Pacific region (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97) had lower odds of receiving sipuleucel-T than patients who were not Hispanic or who lived in the South Atlantic region. Patients with higher incomes had greater odds of receiving sipuleucel-T than patients with incomes of less than $50 000 (OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.04-1.61] for $50 000-$99 000; OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.10-1.85] for >$99 000). Patients treated by a urologist had greater odds of receiving sipuleucel-T than patients not treated by a urologist (OR, 8.89; 95% CI, 7.10-11.11). Sixty-seven patients received concurrent therapies with sipuleucel-T, most commonly abiraterone or enzalutamide, but no factors were independently associated with patients receiving sipuleucel-T concurrent with other therapies for mCRPC.In this study, 1 of 10 patients with prostate cancer who were treated for mCRPC received sipuleucel-T, with several variables associated with its use. Identifying disparities in receipt of sipuleucel-T may affect future access to this and other highly specialized cancer therapies by defining barriers to treatment that could be addressed in future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25200765>IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction and desensitization to glatiramer  in a pediatric patient.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29809285>Successful desensitization to gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin  using a sustained-release depot preparation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409649>Local therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis: a case series and review of the literature.</a></h2><p> and targeted therapy for metastatic cancer may cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as uveitis. If irAEs are severe or require systemic steroids, cancer therapy is often held or discontinued. Local steroid therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis allows the continuation of cancer therapy. This series demonstrates successful management of cancer therapy-associated uveitis with local therapy based on uveitis subtype.This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective case series of patients with uveitis secondary to  or targeted therapy managed with local treatment, and focused literature review.Five patients (median age: 54, range 31 to 75) were included. Time to uveitis onset following cancer therapy initiation was 3 to 12 months. All patients received checkpoint inhibitor therapy; one patient additionally received targeted therapy. Two patients presented with anterior uveitis, two with panuveitis and one with posterior uveitis. Four of five patients demonstrated evidence of posterior segment inflammation on multimodal imaging. Anterior uveitis was successfully treated with topical prednisolone  1% (PA 1%) alone, and posterior segment involvement recalcitrant to topical PA 1% was treated successfully with topical difluprednate, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or a combination. Patients with isolated anterior uveitis did not require maintenance topical therapy; those with posterior and panuveitis required chronic low-dose topical therapy.Based on our series as well as the existing literature demonstrating the use of local therapy for irAEs, we propose an approach to local therapy for cancer therapy-associated uveitis starting with topical steroids and initiating injectable steroids in cases of recalcitrant panuveitis or posterior uveitis. Subclinical inflammation on posterior segment imaging responds robustly to difluprednate or intravitreal steroid therapy, and patients with posterior segment involvement may require more aggressive management and long-term maintenance.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the possible molecular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with butein significantly inhibited cell surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression, ICAM-1 protein synthesis, and mRNA expression induced by tumor necrotic factor-α (TNF-α) and/or phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that butein blocked activation of transcription factors, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), induced by TNF-α and PMA. Moreover, butein abolished TNF-α- and PMA-induced IκBα phosphorylation, which participates in NF-κB activation, and PMA-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun, a subunit composed of AP-1. In vitro, butein inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun, binding to GST beads, mediated by JNK isolated from PMA-treated cells. The inhibitory action of butein on the JNK-mediated in vitro c-Jun phosphorylation was abrogated in the presence of ATP. These results indicate that in HUVECs, butein suppresses the expression of ICAM-1 mRNA and protein through the inhibition of the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 induced by TNF-α and PMA, that the inhibitory action of butein on NF-κB activation results from the inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation by IκB kinase (IKK), and that the inactivation of PMA-activated AP-1 by butein is due to the blocking of JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation through the inhibition of ATP binding.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In an attempt to shed light on uncertain areas in such field, in the present review we illustrate the main molecular mechanisms linking obesity and cancer, focusing on the correlation between obesity and tumor risk, disease progression and response to chemo- and  in patients with UC and the predictive/prognostic role of obesity in PCa patients treated with the currently available therapeutic approaches. : We did a large-scale literature search on existing scientific websites focusing on keywords "obesity", "body mass index (BMI)", "urothelial cancer", "prostate cancer", "docetaxel", "cabazitaxel", "abiraterone ", "enzalutamide", and "radium223". : Many adipocytes-induced molecules support tumor proliferation through activation of various cellular pathways. The available evidence in the postoperative setting do the role of BMI in oncological outcomes prediction still not completely clear. Likewise, in metastatic UC patients controversial results link the role of obesity/BMI with clinical outcomes of tumor response to chemotherapy. Adipose stromal cells recruitment, induced by PCa cells, from white adipose tissue to the tumor sites inducing cell invasiveness was associated with poor survival. Conflicting data, although more oriented towards a better survival outcome, resulted in obese patients treated with docetaxel. In PCa cell-lines a certain cabazitaxel chemo resistance adipose stromal cells (ASC)-mediated was demonstrated. In metastatic castration-resistant PCa patients with high BMI (>25 kg/m) receiving abiraterone  there were significant worse survival outcomes, while in enzalutamide patients BMI did not affect survival outcome. In radium 223 patients higher BMI significantly correlated with favorable overall survival. : The main focus of this review was to understand the interplay between obesity/BMI and UC/PCa. Several pathogenic cellular pathways exploring the issue are discussed, opening the way to challenging tailored treatments on the basis of BMI. Improving the knowledge of molecular connections between obesity and UC and PCa could favor the development of new therapies likely reducing chemo- and  drug resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29214032>New therapies for advanced, recurrent, and metastatic endometrial cancers.</a></h2><p>Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, accounting for 6% of cancers in women. In 2017, an estimated 61,380 women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer, and approximately 11,000 died from this disease. From 1987 to 2008, there was a 50% increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer, with an approximate 300% increase in the number of associated deaths. Although there are many chemotherapeutic and targeted therapy agents approved for ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers, since the 1971 approval of megestrol  for the palliative treatment of advanced endometrial cancer, only pembrolizumab has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) endometrial cancer; this highlights the need for new therapies to treat advanced, recurrent, metastatic endometrial cancer.

Today, several new treatment options are available for patients with tumor progression after first-line docetaxel: Abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T , and the radionuclide radium-223. However, despite the evolving scenario in CRPC treatment, the optimal sequencing of the innovative therapies remains unclear. The reintroduction of docetaxel at the occurrence of disease progression after a drug holiday (docetaxel rechallenge) was often proposed, and this chemotherapeutic agent showed to maintain antitumor activity in mCRPC patients. Docetaxel rechallenge may still constitute a valid treatment option mainly for patients with favorable response to first-line docetaxel, at least > 3 mo progression-free interval, age less than 75 years, good performance status, and acceptable docetaxel toxicity. The risk of cumulative toxicity must be evaluated, since sensory neuropathy, nail disorders and fatigue might occur on docetaxel rechallenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068593>Glatiramer  Enhances Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Function via Recognition of Paired Ig-like Receptor B.</a></h2><p>Glatiramer  (GA; Copaxone) is a copolymer therapeutic that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis. Despite an unclear mechanism of action, studies have shown that GA promotes protective Th2 immunity and stimulates release of cytokines that suppress autoimmunity. In this study, we demonstrate that GA interacts with murine paired Ig-like receptor B (PIR-B) on myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppresses the STAT1/NF-κB pathways while promoting IL-10/TGF-β cytokine release. In inflammatory bowel disease models, GA enhanced myeloid-derived suppressor cell-dependent CD4 regulatory T cell generation while reducing proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Human monocyte-derived macrophages responded to GA by reducing TNF-α production and promoting CD163 expression typical of alternative maturation despite the presence of GM-CSF. Furthermore, GA competitively interacts with leukocyte Ig-like receptors B (LILRBs), the human orthologs of PIR-B. Because GA limited proinflammatory activation of myeloid cells, therapeutics that target LILRBs represent novel treatment modalities for autoimmune indications.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325477>Nano-sized Soluplus® polymeric micelles enhance the induction of tetanus toxin neutralising antibody response following transcutaneous immunisation with tetanus toxoid.</a></h2><p>The use of Soluplus® polymeric micelles as a novel adjuvant for tetanus toxoid (TTxd) in transcutaneous immunisation was evaluated. TTxd was added to Soluplus® polymeric micelles to form TTxd-Soluplus® nano-aggregates with a size of 68nm. Non-adjuvanted TTxd commonly induces very poor antibody response by the transcutaneous route. However, in this study, the use of TTxd-Soluplus® resulted in a significant increase in the antibody response to TTxd, which was similar to that induced in the presence of CPG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CPG-ODNs) adjuvant. The toxin neutralising potency of the immune sera induced by TTxd-Soluplus® was also much stronger than that from TTxd alone, in a passive transfer experiment in mice. Soluplus® also enhanced the immunogenicity of the toxoid when TTxd-Soluplus® was stored at 4°C for 4weeks, but not at higher temperatures. Confocal microscopy imaging showed a much higher uptake of TTxd in the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin when it was associated with Soluplus®, suggesting that the mechanism for Soluplus® adjuvanticity is through enhanced uptake of the TTxd through the skin. Overall, our findings demonstrated that Soluplus® is an effective novel adjuvant for transcutaneous immunisation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of immune checkpoints limit the immune response of the host to metastatic tumor progression in prostate cancer, one of which is an immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic cell called the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC). Tasquinimod is a small molecular oral inhibitor of S100A9, a key cell surface regulator of MDSC function, and has shown anti-angiogenic, antitumor and immune-modulatory properties in preclinical models of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. A large randomized phase II trial of tasquinimod in men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC demonstrated a significant prolongation in radiographic and symptomatic progression-free survival compared with placebo, which was also associated with improvements in overall survival. Tasquinimod was studied in a global phase III randomized trial in men with bone mCRPC and, while it significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival, this did not result in an overall survival benefit. However, tasquinimod is under evaluation as well as a combination therapy with other systemic agents in prostate cancer and as a single agent in other solid tumors.

This was a phase II, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), international, multicentre study (). Patients aged 18-50 with RRMS, receiving intramuscular interferon-β1a or glatiramer , were randomised 1:1 to once-daily oral GSK239512 or placebo, up-titrated over 4-5 weeks to a maximum tolerable dose up to 80 µg and maintained until Week 48. The co-primary endpoints were mean changes in post-lesion MTR in gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) or Delta-MTR defined lesions from pre-lesion values. Adverse events (AE) and withdrawals were monitored. Of the 131 patients randomised, 114 patients completed the study (GSK239512, n = 51; placebo, n = 63) and 27 (GSK239512) and 28 (placebo) patients contributed lesions to the primary analysis.

In the first experiment, 28 gerbils were divided into seven groups infected by 2-6 × 103 larvae, with or without immunosuppression using corticosteroids. In the second experiment, eight gerbils were divided into two groups infected by 2 × 103 sheathed or exsheathed larvae. For the third assay, seven immunosuppressed gerbils were infected with 2 × 103 sheathed larvae and were killed 15 days post infection (PI). The highest number of parasites was recovered from methylprednisolone-immunosuppressed animals. We observed red and white blood cell alterations and biochemical parameters in infected animals that had undergone immunosuppression with methylprednisolone. We highlight that in the first and second experiments a satisfactory number of worms was recovered using sheathed larvae and immunocompetent animals. When exsheathed larvae were used, the number of worms recovered was unsatisfactory.

The antisera raised against the peptide in rabbits showed a strong reaction with the whole recombinant peptide as well as 37 kDa cMMP-11 mature peptide and cross-reactivity with a 43 kDa protein in murine breast tumor of 4T1 origin in Western blot analysis. The 43 kDa protein in the tumor homogenate showed immunoreactivity with a monoclonal antibody against human MMP-11, suggesting it to be murine MMP-11 having cross-reactivity with the antisera raised against cMMP-11 peptide. Altogether, the study characterized the production of a bioactive and immunogenic recombinant cMMP-11 peptide in E. coli.© 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26367474>Emerging agents for the therapy of advanced prostate cancer.</a></h2><p>Since 2010, multiple advances have been made in the field of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer including regulatory approvals for five new agents including androgen pathway inhibitors (enzalutamide, abiraterone ),  (sipuleucel-T), cytotoxic chemotherapy (cabazitaxel) and radiopharmaceuticals (radium-223) that have improved overall survival in this patient population. Despite these advances, each therapy has only extended median survival by 3-5 months and data suggest substantial cross-resistance among them. Given these modest increments, there is a major role for the vigorous investigation of new drugs and predictive biomarkers to select suitable patients who will benefit from them.

All indicators had statistically significant decreases during the first 4 months of the EVD outbreak, with all indicators having their lowest raw mean outputs in August 2014. Decreases in outputs comparing the end of the initial EVD period (September 2014) to May 2014 (pre-EVD) ranged in magnitude from a 67.3% decrease in measles vaccinations (95% CI: -77.9%, -56.8%, p < 0.001) and a 61.4% decrease in artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) treatments for malaria (95% CI: -69.0%, -53.8%, p < 0.001) to a 35.2% decrease in first antenatal care (ANC) visits (95% CI: -45.8%, -24.7%, p < 0.001) and a 38.5% decrease in medroxyprogesterone  doses (95% CI: -47.6%, -29.5%, p < 0.001). Following the nadir of system outputs in August 2014, all indicators showed statistically significant increases from October 2014 to December 2014. All indicators had significant positive trends during the post-EVD period, with every system output exceeding pre-Ebola forecasted trends for 3 consecutive months by November 2016. Health system outputs lost during and after the EVD outbreak were large and sustained for most indicators. Prior to exceeding pre-EVD forecasted trends for 3 months, we estimate statistically significant cumulative losses of -776,110 clinic visits (95% CI: -1,480,896, -101,357, p = 0.030); -24,449 bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccinations (95% CI: -45,947, -2,020, p = 0.032); -9,129 measles vaccinations (95% CI: -12,312, -5,659, p < 0.001); -17,191 postnatal care (PNC) visits within 6 weeks of birth (95% CI: -28,344, -5,775, p = 0.002); and -101,857 ACT malaria treatments (95% CI: -205,839, -2,139, p = 0.044) due to the EVD outbreak. Other outputs showed statistically significant cumulative losses only through December 2014, including losses of -12,941 first pentavalent vaccinations (95% CI: -20,309, -5,527, p = 0.002); -5,122 institutional births (95% CI: -8,767, -1,234, p = 0.003); and -45,024 acute respiratory infections treated (95% CI: -66,185, -24,019, p < 0.001). Compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends, medroxyprogesterone  doses and first ANC visits did not show statistically significant net losses. ACT treatment for malaria was the only indicator with an estimated net increase in system outputs through December 2016, showing an excess of +78,583 outputs (95% CI: -309,417, +450,661, p = 0.634) compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends, although this increase was not statistically significant. However, comparing December 2013 to December 2017, ACT malaria cases have increased 49.2% (95% CI: 33.9%, 64.5%, p < 0.001). Compared to pre-EVD forecasted trends, there remains a statistically significant loss of -15,144 PNC visits within 6 weeks (95% CI: -29,453, -787, p = 0.040) through December 2016.The Liberian public-sector primary healthcare system has made strides towards recovery from the 2014-2015 EVD outbreak. All primary healthcare indicators tracked have recovered to pre-EVD levels as of November 2016. Yet, for most indicators, it took more than 1 year to recover to pre-EVD levels. During this time, large losses of essential primary healthcare services occurred compared to what would have been expected had the EVD outbreak not occurred. The disruption of malaria case management during the EVD outbreak may have resulted in increased malaria cases. Large and sustained investments in public-sector primary care health system strengthening are urgently needed for EVD-affected countries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109552>Butyrate and propionate inhibit antigen-specific CD8 T cell activation by suppressing IL-12 production by antigen-presenting cells.</a></h2><p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as , butyrate and propionate, are products of microbial macronutrients fermentation that distribute systemically and are believed to modulate host immune responses. Recent data have indicated that certain SCFAs, such as butyrate and propionate, directly modulate human dendritic cell (DC) function. Given the role of DCs in initiating and shaping the adaptive immune response, we now explore how SCFAs affect the activation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells stimulated with autologous, MART1 peptide-pulsed DC. We show that butyrate reduces the frequency of peptide-specific CD8 T cells and, together with propionate, inhibit the activity of those cells. On the contrary,  does not affect them. Importantly, butyrate and propionate inhibit the production of IL-12 and IL-23 in the DCs and exogenous IL-12 fully restores the activation of the MART-1-specific CD8 T cells, whereas IL-23 has no effect. In conclusion, these results point to a pivotal role of butyrate and propionate in modulating CD8 T cell activation via the inhibition of IL-12 secretion from DCs. These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby bacterial fermentation products may modulate CD8 T cell function with possible implications in anti-cancer .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793206>MOG-IgG in NMO and related disorders: a multicenter study of 50 patients.

Median age at onset was 31 years (range 6-70). The disease followed a multiphasic course in 80 % (median time-to-first-relapse 5 months; annualized relapse rate 0.92) and resulted in significant disability in 40 % (mean follow-up 75 ± 46.5 months), with severe visual impairment or functional blindness (36 %) and markedly impaired ambulation due to paresis or ataxia (25 %) as the most common long-term sequelae. Functional blindess in one or both eyes was noted during at least one ON attack in around 70 %. Perioptic enhancement was present in several patients. Besides acute tetra-/paraparesis, dysesthesia and pain were common in acute myelitis (70 %). Longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions were frequent, but short lesions occurred at least once in 44 %. Fourty-one percent had a history of simultaneous ON and myelitis. Clinical or radiological involvement of the brain, brainstem, or cerebellum was present in 50 %; extra-opticospinal symptoms included intractable nausea and vomiting and respiratory insufficiency (fatal in one). CSF pleocytosis (partly neutrophilic) was present in 70 %, oligoclonal bands in only 13 %, and blood-CSF-barrier dysfunction in 32 %. Intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) and long-term immunosuppression were often effective; however, treatment failure leading to rapid accumulation of disability was noted in many patients as well as flare-ups after steroid withdrawal. Full recovery was achieved by plasma exchange in some cases, including after IVMP failure. Breakthrough attacks under azathioprine were linked to the drug-specific latency period and a lack of cotreatment with oral steroids. Methotrexate was effective in 5/6 patients. Interferon-beta was associated with ongoing or increasing disease activity. Rituximab and ofatumumab were effective in some patients. However, treatment with rituximab was followed by early relapses in several cases; end-of-dose relapses occurred 9-12 months after the first infusion. Coexisting autoimmunity was rare (9 %). Wingerchuk's 2006 and 2015 criteria for NMO(SD) and Barkhof and McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) were met by 28 %, 32 %, 15 %, 33 %, respectively; MS had been suspected in 36 %. Disease onset or relapses were preceded by infection, vaccination, or pregnancy/delivery in several cases.Our findings from a predominantly Caucasian cohort strongly argue against the concept of MOG-IgG denoting a mild and usually monophasic variant of NMOSD. The predominantly relapsing and often severe disease course and the short median time to second attack support the use of prophylactic long-term treatments in patients with MOG-IgG-positive ON and/or myelitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26918288>The exceptionally broad-based potential of active and passive vaccination targeting the conserved microbial surface polysaccharide PNAG.</a></h2><p>A challenging component of vaccine development is the large serologic diversity of protective antigens. Remarkably, there is a conserved surface/capsular polysaccharide, one of the most effective vaccine targets, expressed by a large number of bacterial, fungal and eukaryotic pathogens: poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG). Natural antibodies to PNAG are poorly effective at mediating in vitro microbial killing or in vivo protection. Removing most of the  substituents to produce a deacetylated glycoform, or using synthetic oligosaccharides of poly-β-1-6-linked glucosamine conjugated to carrier proteins, results in vaccines that elicit high levels of broad-based immunity. A fully human monoclonal antibody is highly active in laboratory and preclinical studies and has been successfully tested in a phase-I setting. Both the synthetic oligosaccharide conjugate vaccine and MAb will be further tested in humans starting in 2016; but, even if effective against only a fraction of the PNAG-producing pathogens, a major advance in vaccine-preventable diseases will occur.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29205701>Antibody response to seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving immunomodulatory therapy.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that patients with multiple sclerosis receiving immunomodulatory treatment have reduced seroprotection rates after influenza immunization. The aim of this study was to further investigate the influence of immunomodulatory therapies on the antibody response and seroprotection rates in patients immunized with seasonal influenza vaccine in 2012/2013 compared with healthy controls.Ninety patients receiving fingolimod, glatiramer , interferon beta-1a/1b, natalizumab or no therapy were compared with 62 healthy controls. All subjects received the inactivated split virus vaccine in 2012 and serum samples were collected pre-vaccination and 3, 6 and 12 months post-vaccination. The vaccine responses were evaluated by the hemagglutination inhibition assay and adjusted for age and gender.No significant differences in rates of protection against H1N1 for interferon beta-1a/1b and glatiramer  were observed as compared with controls at 3, 6 and 12 months. Fingolimod provided reduced protection at all time points post-vaccination, whereas natalizumab displayed reduced protection at 3 and 6 months. Patients without immunomodulation did not display protection rates that were significantly different from the controls at 3 and 12 months.These findings suggest that patients with multiple sclerosis receiving fingolimod or natalizumab should be considered for a second dose of the vaccine in cases of insufficient protection. Our results further indicate that new immunomodulatory treatment regimens should be systematically evaluated for their influence on influenza-specific vaccine responses.© 2017 EAN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31037384>Immune stimulation of rainbow trout reveals divergent regulation of MH class II-associated invariant chain isoforms.</a></h2><p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-associated invariant chain is a chaperone responsible for targeting the MHC class II dimer to the endocytic pathway, thus enabling the loading of exogenous antigens onto the MHC class II receptor. In the current study, in vivo and in vitro methods were used to investigate the regulation of the rainbow trout invariant chain proteins S25-7 and INVX, upon immune system activation. Whole rainbow trout and the macrophage/monocyte-like cell line RTS11 were treated with PMA at concentrations shown to induce IL-1β transcripts and homotypic aggregation of RTS11. S25-7 transcript levels remained unchanged in the gill, spleen, and liver and were found to be significantly decreased in head kidney beginning 24 h post-stimulation. Meanwhile, INVX transcript levels remained unchanged in all tissues studied. Both S25-7 and INVX proteins were produced in gill and spleen tissues but their expression was unaffected by immune system stimulation. Surprisingly, neither INVX nor S25-7 protein was detected in the secondary immune organ, the head kidney. Analysis of RTS11 cultures demonstrated that both INVX and S25-7 transcript levels significantly increased at 96 h and 120 h following PMA stimulation before returning to control levels at 168 h. Meanwhile, at the protein level in RTS11, S25-7 remained unchanged while INVX had a significant decrease at 168 h post-stimulation. These results indicate that neither INVX nor S25-7 is upregulated upon immune system activation; thus, teleosts have evolved a system of immune regulation that is different than that found in mammals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26337241>Improvement in survival and quality of life with new therapeutic agents in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: comparison among the results.</a></h2><p>Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for men affected by metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Unfortunately, nearly all patient will become resistant to the initial hormonal approach, developing a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). For many years, chemotherapy with docetaxel has been the only established standard of care for men with mCRPC. Recent developments in the knowledge of the disease biology have shown that during the progression to the castrate status PC remains dependent on androgens and androgen receptor (AR) pathway. As a consequence, new agents like abiraterone  and enzalutamide have been rapidly developed and approved for clinical use. Other drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, and radium-223 have shown to improve overall survival, symptom control and quality of life of mCRPC patients.

Activated T lymphocytes are involved in regulation of high blood pressure. The goal of the study was to investigate the role of Axl in T-lymphocyte functions and its contribution to salt-dependent hypertension.We report increased apoptosis in peripheral blood from Axl(-/-) mice because of lower numbers of white blood cells mostly lymphocytes. In vitro studies showed modest reduction in interferon gamma production in Axl(-/-) type 1 T helper cells. Axl did not affect basic proliferation capacity or production of interleukin 4 in Axl(-/-) type 2 T helper cells. However, competitive repopulation of Axl(-/-) bone marrow or adoptive transfer of Axl(-/-) CD4(+) T cells to Rag1(-/-) mice showed robust effect of Axl on T lymphocyte expansion in vivo. Adoptive transfer of Axl(-/-) CD4(+) T cells was protective in a later phase of deoxycorticosterone- and salt hypertension. Reduced numbers of CD4(+) T cells in circulation and in perivascular adventitia decreased vascular remodeling and increased vascular apoptosis in the late phase of hypertension.These findings suggest that Axl is critical for survival of T lymphocytes, especially during vascular remodeling in hypertension.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748017>Auger electron-emitting (111)In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 radioimmunoconjugates are cytotoxic to human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells displaying the CD123(+)/CD131(-) phenotype of leukemia stem cells.</a></h2><p>Chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody CSL360 recognizes the CD123(+)/CD131(-) phenotype expressed by leukemic stem cells (LSC).

Therefore, it was interestingly to find that current MS-treatments, believed to act via T cell inhibition, including: beta-interferons, glatiramer , cytostatic agents, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, cladribine, daclizumab, rituximab/ocrelizumab physically, or functionally in the case of natalizumab, also depleted CD19+, CD27+ memory B cells. This depletion was substantial and long-term following CD52 and CD20-depletion, and both also induced long-term inhibition of MS with few treatment cycles, indicating induction-therapy activity. Importantly, memory B cells were augmented by B cell activating factor (atacicept) and tumor necrosis factor (infliximab) blockade that are known to worsen MS. This creates a unifying concept centered on memory B cells that is consistent with therapeutic, histopathological and etiological aspects of MS.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Results shown in the current paper may be used to harness natural killer (NK) cells . It is observed that drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis such as glatiramer , dimethyl fumarate, and monomethyl fumarate upregulate the expression of chemokines receptor 10 (CCR10) on the surface of human IL-2-activated NK cells. This is corroborated with increased chemotaxis of these cells toward the concentration gradients of the ligands for CCR10, namely CCL27 and CCL28. It is also demonstrated that these three drugs enhance NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor target cells, an activity that is abrogated by prior incubation of the cells with anti-CCR10 antibody. Because CCL27 and CCL28 are secreted by selective tumor types such as malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinomas, and colorectal cancer, respectively, it is hypothesized that activated NK cells may be harnessed  with any of these drugs before utilizing them as a therapeutic modality for cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26953946>Relationship Between Values of Fowlpox ELISA and the Presence of "Takes" After Vaccination.</a></h2><p>Values from an ELISA for evaluating the immune response induced by a commercial vaccine against fowlpox virus and the lesion at the site of inoculation (i.e., swelling of the skin or a pox where the vaccine was applied) were compared.

The aim of the study was to characterize T-cell populations within tumor tissue and compare them with non-neoplastic liver tissue as well as circulating cells of the same patients.The presence of unique cell populations was investigated in 36 HCC patients by multidimensional flow cytometry followed by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis. Functional activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells was determined after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13- and ionomycin.Within the tumor there were more cells expressing CD137 and ICOS than in non-neoplastic liver tissue, possibly after recent antigenic activation. These cells contained several populations, including the following: (1) functionally impaired, proliferating CD4 cells co-expressing ICOS and TIGIT; (2) functionally active CD8 cells co-expressing CD38 and PD1; and (3) CD4-CD8 double-negative T-cell receptor αβ and γδ cells (both non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells). When the identified clusters were compared with histologic classification performed on the same samples, an accumulation of activated T cells was observed in immune-inflamed HCC. The same analyses performed in 7 patients receiving nivolumab treatment showed a remarkable reduction in the functionally impaired CD4 cells, which returned to almost normal activity over time.Unique populations of activated T cells are present in HCC tissue, whose antigen specificity remains to be investigated. Some of these cell populations are functionally impaired and nivolumab treatment restores their responsiveness.

Macrophages are the professional phagocytes that are important in the immune system. In this study, we utilized the macrophages derived from the THP-1 human monocyte cell line as the experimental model to study the functional suppression induced by arsenite (As), one of the most prevalent forms of inorganic arsenic, at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Apoptosis was observed in the THP-1 derived macrophages treated with 500 nM As for 18 h. Suppression of phagocytosis was induced by 18 h As treatment starting from 100 nM. Suppressive effects on the production of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, were also found with the treatment of low to moderate doses of As in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated THP-1 derived macrophages. The nitric oxide production was also inhibited by As treatments, which was negatively correlated with the production of superoxide. Collectively, the results from the study demonstrated that environmentally-relevant concentrations of As induced cytotoxicity and suppressed the major cellular functions in THP-1 derived macrophages. The macrophages were showed to be relatively sensitive to As, and could be the essential target of the toxicity induced by environmental arsenic exposures.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Progress continues to be made in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, and ongoing clinical trials continue to investigate novel agents and approaches to treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26832363>Patient experience in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: state of the science.</a></h2><p>Contemporary therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have shown survival improvements, which do not account for patient experience and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).This literature review included a search of MEDLINE for randomized clinical trials enrolling ⩾50 patients with mCRPC and reporting on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) since 2010.Nineteen of 25 publications describing seven treatment regimens (10 clinical trials and nine associated secondary analyses) met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. The most commonly used measures were the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (n=5 trials) and Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (n=4 trials) questionnaires. The published data indicated that HRQoL and pain status augmented the clinical efficacy data by providing a better understanding of treatment impact in mCRPC. Abiraterone  and prednisone, enzalutamide, radium-223 dichloride and sipuleucel-T offered varying levels of HRQoL benefit and/or pain mitigation versus their respective comparators, whereas three treatments (mitoxantrone, estramustine phosphate and docetaxel, and cabazitaxel) had no meaningful impact on HRQoL or pain. The main limitation of the data were that the PROs utilized were not developed for use in mCRPC patients and hence may not have comprehensively captured symptoms important to this population.Recently published randomized clinical trials of new agents for mCRPC have captured elements of the patient experience while on treatment. Further research is required to standardize methods for measuring, quantifying and reporting on HRQoL and pain in patients with mCRPC in the clinical practice setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650147>Identification and functional characterization of CD8+ T regulatory cells in type 1 diabetes patients.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where autoreactive T lymphocytes destroy pancreatic beta cells. We previously reported a defect in CD4+ Tregs cell proliferation and reduced CD4+ Tregs PD-1 expression in patients. Another 'memory-like' regulatory subset, CD8+ Tregs, evaluated as CD8+CD25+FOXP3+, has recently raised interest for their effective suppressive activity. Different CD8+ T cell populations, their proliferation capacity and expression of PD-1 molecule were evaluated by flow-cytometer analysis in newly diagnosed, long-term Type 1 diabetes patients compared to healthy normal donors. Under basal conditions, CD8+ Tregs and CD8+ Teffs were seemingly represented among study groups while there was evidence of diminished expression of PD-1 in Teff subsets of long-term patients. After 3 days of PMA/ionomycin stimulation, patients CD8+ Tregs showed decreased percentage in respect to control group. CD8+ Teffs were instead increased in long-term diabetics versus controls. PD-1+CD8+ Tregs were represented at a much lower percentage in long-term diabetic patients, in respect to controls. Importantly, patients CD8+ Tregs and CD8+ Teffs presented a significant proliferation defect in respect to the control group. In conclusion, our study indicates that a defect of CD8+ Tregs is observed in diabetics. This subset could thus represent a novel target of  in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153952>Preparation of F(ab') antivenom in Iraq against scorpion (Hottentotta saulcyi) venom.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to prepare specific F(ab') antivenom against Iraqi scorpion (Hottentotta saulcyi). Venom was obtained by electrical stimulation method, the scorpions venom storage capacity was 1.7 ± 0.4 mg and LD found to be 1.07 mg/kg by subcutaneous (s.c) route. Three local horses aging 3-4 years were selected for immunization. During the schedule each horse received 0.5-14 mg venom in 49 days by s.c route. The horses immune response was monitored by Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion method, however, older horse A showed the highest antibody titer (1:1056576). Hyperimmune plasma was purified by modified World Health Organization (WHO) protocol using pepsin and ammonium sulfate, whereas high purity and total removal of albumin was detected by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) method on cellulose . ED of the antivenom was determined via s.c route and found to be 83 LD/ml, neutralizing 1.78 mg (venom)/ml (antivenom). Protein concentration of the antivenom was 30 mg/ml, less than limited value (100 mg/ml) by WHO.

We developed an improved humanized mouse model, derived from fresh cord blood CD34 stem cells (CD34 HSC), and combined it with lung cancer cell line-derived human xenografts or patient-derived xenografts (Hu-PDX). Fresh CD34 HSCs could reconstitute detectable mature human leukocytes (hCD45) in mice at four weeks without the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Repopulated human T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) increased in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. Although cultured CD34 HSCs labeled with luciferase could be detected in mice, the cultured HSCs did not develop into mature human immune cells by four weeks, unlike fresh CD34 HSCs. , reconstituted T cells, obtained from the tumor-bearing humanized mice, secreted IFNγ upon treatment with phorbol myristate  (PMA) or exposure to human A549 lung tumor cells and mediated antigen-specific CTL responses, indicating functional activity. Growth of engrafted PDXs and tumor xenografts was not dependent on the human leukocyte antigen status of the donor. Treatment with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab inhibited tumor growth in humanized mice significantly, and correlated with an increased number of CTLs and decreased MDSCs, regardless of the donor HLA type. In conclusion, fresh CD34HSCs are more effective than their expanded counterparts in humanizing mice, and do so in a shorter time.

Eligible participants were patients with aquaporin-4-antibody-positive or aquaporin-4-antibody-negative NMOSD. Main outcome measures were HRs from Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for centre effects, important prognostic factors and repeated treatment episodes.265 treatment episodes with a mean duration of 442 days (total of 321 treatment years) in 144 patients (mean age at first attack: 40.9 years, 82.6% female, 86.1% aquaporin-4-antibody-positive) were analysed. 191 attacks occurred during any of the treatments (annual relapse rate=0.60). The most common treatments were rituximab (n=77, 111 patient-years), azathioprine (n=52, 68 patient-years), interferon-β (n=32, 61 patient-years), mitoxantrone (n=34, 32.1 patient-years) and glatiramer  (n=17, 10 patient-years). Azathioprine (HR=0.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.7, p=0.001) and rituximab (HR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.0, p=0.034) reduced the attack risk compared with interferon-β, whereas mitoxantrone and glatiramer  did not. Patients who were aquaporin-4-antibody-positive had a higher risk of attacks (HR=2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1, p=0.009). Every decade of age was associated with a lower risk for attacks (HR=0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0, p=0.039). A previous attack under the same treatment tended to be predictive for further attacks (HR=1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4, p=0.065).Age, antibody status and possibly previous attacks predict further attacks in patients treated for NMOSD. Azathioprine and rituximab are superior to interferon-β.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017. All rights reserved.

Paramount amongst the latter is that when such cells are appropriately stimulated, they are able to present antigens, including any potential tumor antigens, making them excellent choices as a candidate tumor vaccine. We show that following stimulation of CLL cells with Phorbol myristic , IL-2, the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (P2I) and ionomycin (P2Iio), markedly increased expression of CD54 and CD83 was seen, indicative of B cell activation and a transition to antigen-presenting cells. However, this occurred in the context of augmented expression of the known immunoregulatory molecule, CD200. Accordingly we explored the effect of stimulation of CLL cells with P2Iio, followed by coating of cells with a non-depleting anti-CD200mAb, on the ability of those cells to immunize PBL in vitro to become cytotoxic to CLL cells, or to protect NOD-SCIDγc (NSG) mice from subsequent CLL tumor challenge. Our data indicate that this protocol is effective in inducing CD8 CTL able to lyse CLL cells in vitro, and decrease tumor burden in vivo in spleen and marrow of mice injected with CLL cells. Pre-treatment of mice with a CD8 depleting antibody before vaccination with P2Iio/anti-CD200 coated cells abolished any protection seen. These data suggest a potential role for blockade of CD200 expression on CLL cells as a component of a tumor vaccination strategy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

New hormonal therapies such as  abiraterone or enzalutamide were the first molecules to revolutionize the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Several other treatments are on trial targeting different pathways: androgene pathway (TAK-007, ARN-509, ODM-201, TOK-001), immune system (sipuleucel, ipilimumab, PROSTVAC-V/F, tasquinimod), but also tumor cell (PARP inhibitor, cabozantinib). The treatment sequencing will therefore soon be problematic, raising the necessity to identify predictive markers of response to the new therapies.Copyright © 2015 Société Française du Cancer.

GA consists of random copolymers of four amino acids, in ratios that produce a predominantly positive charge and an amphipathic character. With the extraordinary complexity of the drug, several pharmacological modes-of-action were suggested, but so far none, which rationalizes the cationicity and amphipathicity as part of the mode-of-action. Here, we report that GA rapidly kills primary human T lymphocytes and, less actively, monocytes. LL-37 is a cleavage product of human cathelicidin with important roles in innate immunity. It shares the positive charge and amphipathic character of GA, and, as shown here, also the ability to kill human leukocyte. The cytotoxicity of both compounds depends on sialic acid in the cell membrane. The killing was associated with the generation of CD45+ debris, derived from cell membrane deformation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed the formation of such debris, even at low GA concentrations. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing measurements also recorded stable alterations in T lymphocytes following such treatment. LL-37 forms oligomers through weak hydrophobic contacts, which is critical for the lytic properties. In our study, SAXS showed that GA also forms this type of contacts. Taken together, our study offers new insight on the immunomodulatory mode-of-action of positively charged co-polymers. The comparison of LL-37 and GA highlights a consistent requirement of certain oligomeric and chemical properties to support cytotoxic effects of cationic polymers targeting human leukocytes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In preparation for systemic therapy the patient discontinued GA, and shortly thereafter experienced spontaneous and complete clinical and radiographic resolution of her disease. The development and subsequent regression of melanoma in this patient may be due to the use and subsequent discontinuation of GA, and our discussion of the case includes the potential immunologic mechanisms that may provide an explanation for our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first reported association between the immunomodulatory agent GA and malignant melanoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30258117>Regulation of the effector function of CD8 T cells by gut microbiota-derived metabolite butyrate.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota produces metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that regulate the energy homeostasis and impact on immune cell function of the host. Recently, innovative approaches based on the oral administration of SCFAs have been discussed for therapeutic modification of inflammatory immune responses in autoimmune diseases. So far, most studies have investigated the SCFA-mediated effects on CD4 T cells and antigen presenting cells. Here we show that butyrate and, to a lesser degree, propionate directly modulate the gene expression of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and Tc17 cells. Increased IFN-γ and granzyme B expression by CTLs as well as the molecular switch of Tc17 cells towards the CTL phenotype was mediated by butyrate independently of its interaction with specific SCFA-receptors GPR41 and GPR43. Our results indicate that butyrate strongly inhibited histone-deacetylases (HDACs) in CD8 T cells thereby affecting the gene expression of effector molecules. Accordingly, the pan-HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium valproate exerted similar influence on CD8 T cells. Furthermore, higher  concentrations were also able to increase IFN-γ production in CD8 T lymphocytes by modulating cellular metabolism and mTOR activity. These findings might have significant implications in adoptive  of cancers and in anti-viral immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29905984>Effect of vitamin E supplementation in milk replacer and Shiga toxoid vaccination on serum α-tocopherol, performance, haematology and blood chemistry in male Holstein calves.</a></h2><p>Vitamin E (vit E), an essential antioxidant for maintaining the stability of biological membranes and the function of the immune system, is considered to support adaptive immune responses and performance in cattle. The principal virulence factor of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), the eponymous Stx, modulates cellular immune responses in cattle, the primary STEC reservoir. Active and passive immunization of calves with Shiga toxoids (rStx ) was recently shown to reduce the STEC shedding. Here, we examined the influence of vit E on calves' serum α-tocopherol, performance, haematology, blood chemistry and its interaction with rStx immunization. Data from calves having received passive (colostrum from immunized cows) and active (intramuscularly at 5th and 8th weeks of life) vaccination with rStx (n = 24) were compared to unvaccinated controls (n = 24; fed with low anti-Stx colostrum, placebo injected). For each vaccination group, data were analysed according to the level of vit E supplementation offered by milk replacer (188 IU all-rac-α-tocopheryl  daily [VitE ] vs. 354 IU [VitE ]). An increase by 79% in daily vit E supplementation led to slightly higher serum α-tocopherol level and earlier concentrate intake at the beginning of the experiment without significant differences in live weight gain, haematology, blood chemistry parameters and peripheral CD4 and CD8 T-cell subpopulations. rStx vaccination modulated the CD4 /CD8 ratio irrespective of vit E supplementation but decreased concentrate intake in VitE in a time-dependent manner. Results of our study indicate that an increase in daily vit E supplementation vastly fails to exert effects on laboratory parameters and growth performance. However, observed interactive effects of vit E supply and vaccination on the regulation of feed intake deserves further attention.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26801591>Immune-mediated responses account for the majority of production loss for grazing meat-breed lambs during Trichostrongylus colubriformis infection.</a></h2><p>The hypothesis tested in this experiment was that Trichostrongylus colubriformis infection would reduce growth rates of grazing meat-breed lambs; however production loss would be reduced by suppression of the host immune response. The experiment had a 3×2 factorial design using 6-7 month old meat-breed lambs which remained uninfected or infected (IFY) with 2000 or 4000 T. colubriformis L3/week for 12 weeks and were immunosuppressed (SUPY) using methylprednisolone  once weekly or remained non-immunosuppressed (SUPN). Immunosuppression increased worm egg counts (WEC) of infected lambs (SUPY 2421 eggs per gram (epg), SUPN 1154 epg on day 84, p<0.05) and T. colubriformis burdens (p<0.05-0.10) and reduced circulating eosinophils (p<0.05 on days 11, 42, 56 and 84) and intestinal total antibody titres (p<0.02). There was a significant (p<0.05) interaction between the main effects of infection and immunosuppression with infection having a larger negative effect on the liveweight of non-immunosuppressed lambs. The immunological response of the host to T. colubriformis infection accounted for 75% of the overall cost of infection (3.1kg) with the majority of this cost occurring during the first 35 days of infection. In contrast, most of the cost associated with the direct effect of infection occurred after day 35. These results confirm in grazing meat-breed lambs that the host's immunological response to T. colubriformis infection is the major component of production loss.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
