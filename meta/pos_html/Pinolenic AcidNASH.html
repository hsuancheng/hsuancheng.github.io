In the present study we verified the nutritional compliance to these DHA-based multivitamin treatments; lipidomics biomarkers of the reported outcome on  indicators were also investigated. Samples were obtained from 30 biopsy-proven pediatric  patients of the DHA-CHO-VE trial randomized in multivitamin treatment group and placebo group (n = 15 each), and from 12 patients of the treatment group of the DHA-VD trial. All patients underwent 6-month therapy plus 6 months of follow-up. Plasma samples and clinical data were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study (12 months). Selected biomarkers included the free form of DHA and other ω-3 fatty  arachidonic  (AA), indices of the vitamin E status, and some hepatic metabolites of these lipids. Radiographic and histological improvements of treated patients were associated with increased concentrations of DHA, α- and α-tocopherol (i.e. VE), and with decreased AA that was also investigated in complex lipids by untargetd lipidomics. As a result a significantly lowered AA/DHA ratio was observed to represent the main indicator of the response to the DHA-based therapy. Furthermore, baseline levels of AA/DHA showed strong association with NAS and US improvement. A stable correction of DHA AA metabolism interaction is associated with the curative effect of this therapy and may represent a key nutritional endpoint in the clinical management of pediatric .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18086506>Nutritional assessment and hepatic fatty  composition in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): a cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Low hepatic n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) may contribute to steatosis and steatohepatitis and can be affected by diet and oxidative stress.Seventy-three patients referred for elevated liver enzymes and suspected NAFLD were assessed.

We evaluated the effects of supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs from flaxseed and fish oils in patients with biopsy-proven .Patients received three capsules daily, each containing 0.315 g of omega-3 PUFAs (64%  [ALA], 16% eicosapentaenoic [EPA], and 21% docosahexaenoic [DHA] acids; n-3 group, n = 27) or mineral oil (placebo group, n = 23). Liver biopsies were evaluated histopathologically by the  activity score (NAS). Plasma levels of omega-3 PUFAs were assessed as a marker of intake at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Secondary endpoints included changes in plasma biochemical markers of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and liver function at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment.At baseline, NAS was comparable between the groups (p = 0.98). After intervention with omega-3 PUFAs, plasma ALA and EPA levels increased (p ≤ 0.05). However in the placebo group, we also observed increased EPA and DHA (p ≤ 0.05), suggesting an off-protocol intake of PUFAs. NAS improvement/stabilization was correlated with increased ALA in the n-3 group (p = 0.02) and with increased EPA (p = 0.04) and DHA (p = 0.05) in the placebo group. Triglycerides were reduced after 3 months in the n-3 group compared to baseline (p = 0.01).In  patients, the supplementation of omega-3 PUFA from flaxseed and fish oils significantly impacts on plasma lipid profile of patients with .

The main goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the perilla oil rich in  (ALA) against  and gain a deep insight into its potential mechanisms. Rats were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFD) supplement with perilla oil (POH) for 16 weeks. Routine blood biochemical tests and histological staining illustrated that the perilla oil administration improved HFD-induced hyperlipidemia, reduced hepatic steatosis, and inhibited hepatic inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis. Perilla oil also increased fecal bile  and cholesterol excretion. Hepatic RNA-Seq analysis found that the long time perilla oil supplement notably modified the gene expression involved in cholesterol metabolism. Our results implicate that, after long-term high level dietary cholesterol feeding, rat liver endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and cholesterol-rich low density lipoprotein uptake was significantly inhibited, and perilla oil did not modulate expression of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis but did increase cholesterol removed from hepatocytes by conversion to bile acids and increased fecal cholesterol excretion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631112>A cross-sectional study assessing dietary intake and physical activity in Canadian patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease vs healthy controls.</a></h1><p>Poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Our aim was to compare diet and physical activity of patients with NAFLD and healthy controls with current recommendations.This was a cross-sectional study.Seventy-four patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (33 simple steatosis and 41 steatohepatitis []) and 27 healthy controls participated between 2003 and 2011.Food records and activity logs were completed for 7 days. Results were compared with Dietary Reference Intakes and Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines.

ALA is associated with beneficial changes in plasma lipids and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Present article aims to analyze the effect of Chia oil-enriched restructured pork (RP) on aged rats in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () model. Groups of six male Wistar rats (1-year old) were fed the experimental diets: control RP diet (C) noncholesterol high saturated; cholesterol-enriched high-saturated fat/high-cholesterol control RP diet (HC) with added cholesterol and cholic ; and Chia oil- or Hydroxytyrosol RP cholesterol-enriched high-saturated fat/high cholesterol (CHIA and HxT). Total cholesterol, hepatosomatic index, Nrf2, antioxidant, and inflammation markers were determined. CHIA reduced the hypercholesterolemic effect by lowering levels similar to C; also, ameliorated redox index. CHIA, despite high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content, reduced thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) and induced the lowest SOD protein synthesis but not a reduction on its activity. Chia oil activated the Nrf2 to arrest the pro-oxidative response to cholesterol and aging. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) system was lower in HxT than in CHIA, suggesting its antiatherogenic activity and related protective effect against high PUFA. Increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) was partially blocked by CHIA. Chia oil has the ability to prevent oxidative damage and modify the inflammatory response, suggesting adequate regulation of the antioxidant system.

This study investigates the impact of substitution of linoleic  with α- (ALA) or long chain (LC) n-3 PUFA and hence decreasing n-6:n-3 fatty  ratio on high fat, high fructose (HFHF) diet induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and fed control diet, HFHF diet (n-6:n-3 ratio of 200), HFHF diet with ALA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 2) or HFHF diet with LC n-3 PUFA (n-6:n-3 ratio of 5) for 24 weeks. Rats fed HFHF diet with n-6:n-3 ratio of 200 resulted in hepatic steatosis, induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and oxidative stress accompanied by increase in markers of inflammation, plasma lipids and aminotransferase levels. Histopathological examination of liver further confirmed the establishment of . ALA and LC n-3 PUFA supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia by inhibiting lipogenesis and increasing insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA supplementation attenuated hepatic oxidative stress by restoring antioxidant status, decreased inflammation and preserved hepatic architecture.

Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with .

Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven  patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased arachidonic  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis are diseases that require effective treatments in obese and non-obese patients. The aim was to evaluate the effect of chia intake on acute tyloxapol (TI)-induced dyslipidemia, on acute carbon tetrachloride (TC)-induced steatohepatitis, and on mixed damage (TC+TI) in non-obese rats. Four experimental groups were fed for 4 weeks a diet with established rodent food (DE), and four groups were fed a diet with 15% added chia (DC). Plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, biochemical liver damage markers, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Liver samples were used to quantify glycogen, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and TNF-α. A histopathological analysis was performed. DC intake partially or totally prevented steatohepatitis, and reduced lipids in the dyslipidemic groups. The hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia may be correlated to its high content of α- (omega-3) and phenolics. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Metabolic syndrome is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which are currently the most common causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for NAFLD and . Non-obese patients may have NAFLD or . Metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia are more strongly associated with NAFLD in non-obese than in obese patients. This is the first study evaluating the hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects of chia seed intake on acute dyslipidemia and/or steatohepatitis caused by the individual or combined administration of the inducers tyloxapol and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, in non-obese rats. The pharmacological effects of dietary chia are correlated to its high content of omega-3 and omega-6 (1:1), protein, dietary fiber, and phenolics. The results suggest that inclusion of chia in diets of non-obese patients with dyslipidemia and/or NAFLD/ may improve their health state and preventing cirrhosis or HCC.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17654743>A lipidomic analysis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>The spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

However, the plasma lipidome of NAFLD and whether  has a distinct plasma lipidomic signature are unknown. A comprehensive analysis of plasma lipids and eicosanoid metabolites quantified by mass spectrometry was performed in NAFL (n = 25) and  (n = 50) subjects and compared with lean normal controls (n = 50). The key findings include significantly increased total plasma monounsaturated fatty acids driven by palmitoleic (16:1 n7) and oleic (18:1 n9) acids content (P < 0.01 for both acids in both NAFL and ). The levels of palmitoleic , oleic , and palmitoleic  to palmitic  (16:0) ratio were significantly increased in NAFLD across multiple lipid classes. Linoleic  (8:2n6) was decreased (P < 0.05), with a concomitant increase in gamma- (18:3n6) and dihomo gamma- (20:3n6) acids in both NAFL and  (P < 0.001 for most lipid classes). The docosahexanoic  (22:6 n3) to docosapentenoic  (22:5n3) ratio was significantly decreased within phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) pools, which was most marked in  subjects (P < 0.01 for PC and P < 0.001 for PE).

Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of lipogenesis due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in , a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives.
