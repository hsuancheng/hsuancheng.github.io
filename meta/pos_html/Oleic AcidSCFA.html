Temperature-dependent NIR spectral profiles indicate that dynamical variances of COOH group dominate its γ → α phase transition, while the transition from active α to β phase mainly relates to the conformational transfer of acyl chain. Through operating multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares with factor analysis, instantaneous contribution of each active polymorph during the transition process was illustrated for displaying the progressive evolutions of functional groups. Calculated contributions reveal that the α phase of  initially is present at around -18 °C, but sharply grows up around -2.2 °C from the transformation of γ phase and finally disappears at the melting point. On the other hand, the β phase of  is sole self-generation after melt even it embryonically appears at -2.2 °C. Such mathematical approach based on NIR spectroscopy and factor analysis calculation provides a  strategy in quantitatively exploring the transition processes of bioactive  ; meanwhile, it maintains promising possibility for instantaneous quantifying each active polymorph of lipid materials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The   composition of the lipid membrane of L. acidophilus La-5 was significantly different upon growth in MRS (containing Tween 80, an  source), or in MRS with Tween 20 (containing C12:0 and C14:0), linoleic, or linolenic  supplemented. Bacteria grown in MRS showed the highest storage survival rates. No indications of loss of membrane integrity could be found, and membrane integrity could therefore not be connected with loss of viability. Survival of bacteria grown with linoleic or linolenic  was more negatively affected by the presence of oxygen, than bacteria grown in MRS or with Tween 20 supplemented. A small, but significant, loss of linolenic  during storage could be identified, and an increase of  secondary oxidation products during storage was found for bacteria grown in MRS, or with linoleic, or linolenic  supplemented, but not for bacteria grown with Tween 20. Overall, the results indicate that lipid oxidation and loss of membrane integrity are not the only or most important detrimental reactions which can occur during storage.

Among 43 identified odor-active compounds, four volatiles, including hexan-3-one, exhibited decreases of up to 78%, while four others including ()-non-2-enal, increased following milling. Levels of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the most distinctive popcorn-flavoring compound in scented rice, were not affected by the degree of milling (DM). Partial least squares discriminant analyses of volatiles were able to differentiate white rice according to the DM. Benzene and 2-pentylfuran showed the highest variable importance in projection scores, which could be applied in estimating the DM of rice. Milling significantly decreased tocopherols, tocotrienols, squalene, phytosterols contents and  composition, while palmitic  composition was increased. These results suggest milling-dependent variations in phytonutrient levels and lipid composition, as well as changes in aroma and subsequent market quality, in 'Cheonjihyang-1-se' rice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30991133>The roles of short and long chain   on physicochemical properties and improved cancer targeting of albumin-based fattigation-platform nanoparticles containing doxorubicin.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different chain length   on physicochemical properties and cancer targeting of fattigation-platform nanoparticles (NPs). Two different types of   (short chain, 2-hydroxybutyric , C4; long chain, , C18:1) were successfully conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA) via simple 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling reaction. These conjugates readily formed HSA-C4 and HSA-C18:1 NPs which showed good stability in serum and desirable biocompatibility with normal cell line (HEK293T).

The structure, morphology, and texture of DOX-loaded NPs were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The initial burst release of DOX-loaded NPs was controlled by the presence and chain length of  . In vitro cytotoxicity studies with three cancer cell lines (A549, HT-29, and PANC-1) suggested that fattigation-platform NPs have distinctive cytotoxic effects compared to Doxil. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry exhibited that the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded NPs was varied by the different chain lengths of  .

Biomarkers of dietary intake are unconfounded by recall and reporting bias, and using multiple dietary biomarkers could help strengthen the link between a healthy diet and the prevention of T2D. The objective of this study was to explore how diet is related to glucose tolerance status (GTS) and to future development of T2D irrespective of common T2D and cardiovascular disease risk factors by using multiple dietary biomarkers. Dietary biomarkers were measured in plasma from 64-y-old Swedish women with different GTS [normal glucose tolerance (NGT;  = 190), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT;  = 209), and diabetes ( = 230)]. The same subjects were followed up after 5 y to determine changes in glucose tolerance ( = 167 for NGT,  = 174 for IGT, and  = 159 for diabetes). ANCOVA and logistic regression were used to explore baseline data for associations between dietary biomarkers, GTS, and new T2D cases at follow-up ( = 69). Of the 10 dietary biomarkers analyzed, β-alanine (beef) (-raw < 0.001), alkylresorcinols C17 and C19 (whole-grain wheat and rye) (-raw = 0.003 and 0.011), eicosapentaenoic  (fish) (-raw = 0.041), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic  (CMPF) (fish) (-raw = 0.002), linoleic  (-raw < 0.001),  (-raw = 0.003), and α-tocopherol (margarine and vegetable oil) (-raw < 0.001) were associated with GTS, and CMPF (fish) (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.93; -raw = 0.013) and α-tocopherol (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.98; -raw = 0.041) were inversely associated with future T2D development. Several circulating dietary biomarkers were strongly associated with GTS after correction for known T2D risk factors, underlining the role of diet in the development and prevention of T2D.

The effect of oleate and palmitate on pure cultures of Methanosaeta concilii and Methanosarcina mazei was assessed by comparing methane production rates from acetate before and after LCFA addition. For both methanogens, a sharp decrease in methane production (> 50%) was observed at 0.5 mmol L(-1) oleate, and no methane was formed at concentrations higher than 2 mmol L(-1) oleate. Palmitate was less inhibitory than oleate, and M. concilii was more tolerant to palmitate than M. mazei, with 2 mmol L(-1) palmitate causing 11% and 64% methanogenic inhibition respectively. This study indicates that M. concilii and M. mazei tolerate LCFA concentrations similar to those previously described for hydrogenotrophic methanogens. In particular, the robustness of M. concilii might contribute to the observed prevalence of Methanosaeta species in anaerobic bioreactors used to treat LCFA-rich wastewater.© 2016 The Authors.

Evaluating the hazards associated with TiO2 NPs is crucial as it enables risk assessment related to human and environmental exposure. In this study the in vitro human toxicity of a set of TiO2 NPs modified with acetic,  and boric  were studied in order to assess the hazard in view of a future scale-up of the synthesis. The surface reactivity of the powders under simulated solar illumination and in the dark has been evaluated by means of EPR spectroscopy. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) have been chosen as a model for lung epithelium. Cytotoxicity has been assessed by measuring the cells membrane integrity by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and the inflammatory response evaluated as nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-α production, and oxidative stress measured as intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, and induced lipoperoxidation. Aeroxide P25 was used for comparison. The results demonstrated a low photoreactivity and toxic effects lower than Aeroxide P25 of the nano-TiO2 powders, probably as a consequence of the presence of acidic moieties at the surface.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Seed Extract Reveals Collateral Sensitivity in Multidrug-Resistant P-Glycoprotein-Expressing Tumor Cells.</a></h1><p>The frequent failure of standard cancer chemotherapy requires the development of novel drugs capable of killing otherwise drug-resistant tumors. Here, we have investigated a chloroform extract of Laurus nobilis seeds.   and 23 constituents of the  fraction were identified by gas chromotography/flame ionization detection (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), in good agreement with (1)H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrum. Multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein-expressing CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells were hypersensitive (collaterally sensitive) toward this extract compared to drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells, whereas CEM/ADR5000 cells were 2586-fold resistant to doxorubicin as control drug. Collateral sensitivity was verified by measurement of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. The log10IC50 values of 3 compounds in the extract (limonene, eucalyptol, ) did not correlate with mRNA expression of the P-glycoprotein-coding ABCB1/MDR1 gene and accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate rhodamine in the NCI panel of tumor cell lines. A microarray-based profile of 20 genes predicted resistance to doxorubicin and 7 other anticancer drugs involved in the multidrug resistance phenotype but not to limonene, eucalyptol and .

The control group (CG) was fed with a conventional complete diet, while the experimental group (ZG) received a daily zinc supplementation of 60 mg for kg of dry complete feed. During the experimental period, the milk yield was monitored and samples of milk and caciocavallo cheese were collected and analyzed for chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile.The enrichment of dairy cows diet with zinc, did not influence milk yield and composition, however a marked reduction of somatic cell count (SSC) was evidenced. Both in milk and cheese the ZG samples were characterized by a lower concentration of satured   (SFA) and an increase in , vaccenic and rumenic . The aromatic profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary zinc intake, with an increase in concentration of carboxylic , esters and lactones.The present results suggest a positive role of dietary zinc intake in improving the quality of bovine milk and related cheese, in particular for the increase in concentration of bioactive   such as rumenic .

There were significant differences between the oils from both cultivars when grown in the two different environments. At higher altitude, the oils showed a greater amount of , phenols and a higher oxidative stability, while at lower altitude, the oils had higher saturated and linoleic  contents. The aroma profiles in Chemlali and Neb Jmel cultivars were also influenced by the pedoclimatic conditions, as shown by the difference in volatiles as a function of the geographical area.

This work focuses on the physicochemical evaluation of faveleira oil, as well as it investigates the bioactive properties of faveleira seeds, faveleira oil and the press cake obtained during the oilseed processing. The seeds were cold pressed and the following tests were performed: physicochemical characteristics (acidity, peroxide values, moisture and  matter, density and viscosity) and   profile of faveleira oil; total phenolic and flavonoid content of faveleira seed and press cake; antibacterial activity of seed, oil and press cake; and antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity, reducing power assay, total antioxidant capacity, superoxide radical scavenging assay and oxygen radical absorbance capacity) of seed, oil and press cake. Our work demonstrated that the faveleira seed oil has low acidity (0.78 ± 0.03% ) and peroxide value (1.13 ± 0.12 mEq/1000g), associated with the relevant concentration of linoleic  (53.56%). It was observed that important phenolics (398.89 ± 6.34 mg EAG/100 g), especially flavonoids (29.81 ± 0.71 mg RE/g) remain in the press cake, which indicates that the by-product of the faveleira oilseed production constitutes a rich residual source of bioactive compounds. No bacterial growth inhibition was detected, but all samples including faveleira seeds, press cake, oil and its fractions have potent antioxidant activities, mainly the press cake, with oxygen radical absorbance capacity of 28.39 ± 4.36 μM TE/g. Our results also show that faveleira oil has potential to be used as edible oil and the press cake should be used to contain the most antioxidants from seed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038264>Bioconversion of  derived from waste activated sludge into lipids by Cryptococcus curvatus.</a></h1><p>Pure    (VFA) solution derived from waste activated sludge (WAS) was used to produce microbial lipids as culture medium in this study, which aimed to realize the resource recovery of WAS and provide low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production simultaneously. Cryptococcus curvatus was selected among three oleaginous yeast to produce lipids with VFAs derived from WAS. In batch cultivation, lipid contents increased from 10.2% to 16.8% when carbon to nitrogen ratio increased from about 3.5 to 165 after removal of ammonia nitrogen by struvite precipitation.

While chemical synthesis often leads to undesired racemic mixtures, microbial production allows obtaining optically pure lactones. The production of a specific lactone by biotransformation depends on the supply of the corresponding hydroxy  , which has economic and industrial value similar to γ-lactones. Hence, the identification and exploration of microorganisms with the rare natural ability for de novo biosynthesis of lactones will contribute to the long-term sustainability of microbial production. In this study, the innate ability of Ashbya gossypii for de novo production of γ-lactones from glucose was evaluated and improved.Characterization of the  organic compounds produced by nine strains of this industrial filamentous fungus in glucose-based medium revealed the noteworthy presence of seven chemically different γ-lactones. To decipher and understand the de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones from glucose, we developed metabolic engineering strategies focused on the   biosynthesis and the β-oxidation pathways. Overexpression of AgDES589, encoding a desaturase for the conversion of  (C18:1) into linoleic  (C18:2), and deletion of AgELO624, which encodes an elongase that catalyses the formation of C20:0 and C22:0  , greatly increased the production of γ-lactones (up to 6.4-fold; (7.6 ± 0.8) × 10 µg/g). Further substitution of AgPOX1, encoding the exclusive acyl-CoA oxidase in A. gossypii, by a codon-optimized POX2 gene from Yarrowia lipolytica, which encodes a specific long chain acyl-CoA oxidase, fine-tuned the biosynthesis of γ-decalactone to a relative production of more than 99%.This study demonstrates the potential of A. gossypii as a model and future platform for de novo biosynthesis of γ-lactones. By means of metabolic engineering, key enzymatic steps involved in their production were elucidated. Moreover, the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies developed resulted in improved de novo biosynthesis of γ-decalactone. In sum, these proof-of-concept data revealed yet unknown metabolic and genetic determinants important for the future exploration of the de novo production of γ-lactones as an alternative to biotransformation processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28682068>A Search for CD36 Ligands from Flavor Volatiles in Foods with an Aldehyde Moiety: Identification of Saturated Aliphatic Aldehydes with 9-16 Carbon Atoms as Potential Ligands of the Receptor.</a></h1><p> compounds with an aldehyde moiety such as (Z)-9-octadecenal are potential ligands for cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a transmembrane receptor that has recently been shown to play a role in mammalian olfaction.

Straight-chain, saturated aliphatic aldehydes with 9-16 carbons exhibited CD36 ligand activities, albeit to varying degrees. Notably, the activities of tridecanal and tetradecanal were higher than that of , the most potent ligand among the   tested.

(FA), phenolic compounds (PC) and  compounds (VC) of flesh and peel from three Prunus persica cultivars were evaluated at the Regional Centre of Agricultural Research--Experimental Farm (Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia) during two maturation stages. Palmitic,  and linoleic  are the most abundant FA in Prunus persica cultivars. A genetic effect on FA composition was observed throughout the two sampling periods. Peel was rich in  with the highest content (31.3% on total FA) in 'O'Henry' cultivar at the commercial ripening date; flesh was rich in linoleic  with the highest content (44.7% on total FA) in 'Sweet Cap' cultivar at the full ripening date. The monounsaturated/polyunsaturated   ratios were higher in the commercial ripe than in the full ripe fruits. The analysis of the composition of the VC led to the characterization of 98 different compounds, showing a very high variability among the cultivars. The full ripe fruit (peel and flesh) exhibited the highest total number of terpenoids. Commercial ripe peels were richest in the percentage of hydrocarbons. Comparing cultivars, 'Sweet Cap' cultivar showed the lowest contents of alcohols in peel and flesh of full ripe fruit but highest in peel of commercial ripe fruit, and lowest content of aldehydes in peel and flesh of commercial ripe fruit but highest in peel of ripe ones and the highest ones of lactones. Among PC, the highest contents were observed for o-diphenols and the values showed varietal influence. Total phenols contents decreased during ripening process (p < 0.05) in both peel and flesh tissues, except found for 'Sweet Cap' cultivar. In conclusion, to achieve better FA composition and greater VC and PC production of the peach fruit, P. persica cultivars should be harvested at the commercial ripening date.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

GC-MS method was used to analyze the  oils and the  , and HPLC method was used to determine the flavonoids and phenolic  in the pericarp, seed and seed oil of Z.bungeanum. There were 26, 19 and 11 kinds of  components detected in the pericarp, seed and seed oil, respectively, in which terpenoids and their oxy-derivatives were the main components, and the contents of linalool and its esters in pericarp were relatively high. The contents of total   in the pericarp, seed and seed oil were 108.42, 331.63, 966.04 mg•g⁻¹, respectively., linoleic  andα-linolenic  were abundantin all samples. The pericarp contains relatively high content of flavonoids, such as hyperoside, quercitrin, rutin, isoquercitrin, while the above components were not detected in the seed and seed oil. These results confirmed that the fruit of Z.bungeanum contains high contents of the resourceful chemical compositions, and their composition and contents were differed among organs, which provide a scientific basis for the utilization of Z.bungeanumfruit.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717212>Comparing the Effects of Different Unsaturated   on Fermentation Performance of  and Aroma Compounds during Red Wine Fermentation.</a></h1><p>To understand the individual enological function of different unsaturated   (UFAs), the separated effects of three different UFAs, linoleic  (LA),  (OA), and α-linolenic  (ALA), on yeast fermentation and aroma compounds were investigated in the alcoholic fermentation of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The results showed that, besides concentration, UFAs types could also influence fermentation process and volatiles in final wine. Low concentrations of UFAs (12 and 60 mg/L), especially LA and OA, significantly promoted fermentation activity and most volatiles when compared to the control, however, the effect became the inhibition with increasing concentrations of UFAs (120 and 240 mg/L). It was interesting to find that OA addition (12 and 60 mg/L) could generate more acetate esters (especially isoamyl acetate) in wine, while 12 mg/L LA facilitated more   formation (octanoic  and decanoic ). In comparison, 120 and 240 mg/L ALA produced more amount of C6 alcohols (1-hexanol) and higher alcohols (isobutyl alcohol and 2,3-butanediol). UFAs additions were unfavorable for ethyl esters formation, except for an increment of ethyl hexanoate in 12 mg/L OA wine. As a result, different aromatic profiles of wines were generated by variations of UFAs types and levels, as shown by PCA. The transcriptional data revealed that the expressions of aroma-related genes, such as , , , , , , , ,  and  were correlated with aroma compounds productions in different treatments. Our data suggested that the three UFAs have different enological functions and they could generate different aromatic profiles. Thus, besides concentrations, it is essential to consider the types of UFAs when applying the strategy to adjust UFAs contents to modulate the aromatic quality of wines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178837>Transcriptional Comparison Investigating the Influence of the Addition of Unsaturated   on Aroma Compounds During Alcoholic Fermentation.</a></h1><p>The levels of unsaturated   (UFAs) in grape must significantly influence yeast metabolism and the production of aroma compounds. In this work, cDNA microarray technology was applied to analyze the transcriptional discrepancies of wine yeast (commercial wine yeast Lalvin EC1118) fermenting in synthetic grape must supplemented with different concentrations of a mixture of UFAs (including linoleic , , and α-linolenic ). The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several  . Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with lipid and sterol biosynthesis, amino  metabolism, TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of  compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds. A potential way to achieve this goal could be the rational increase of the UFA contents in grape must.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26454474>Spruce Budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Oral Secretions II: Chemistry.</a></h1><p>As sessile organisms, plants have evolved different methods to defend against attacks and have adapted their defense measures to discriminate between mechanical damage and herbivory by insects. One of the ways that plant defenses are triggered is via elicitors from insect oral secretions (OS). In this study, we investigated the ability of second-instar (L2) spruce budworm [SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)] to alter the  organic compounds (VOCs) of four conifer species [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea mariana (Miller) B.S.P., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Picea rubens (Sargent)] and found that the emission profiles from all host trees were drastically changed after herbivory. We then investigated whether some of the main elicitors (  conjugates [FACs], β-glucosidase, and glucose oxidase) studied were present in SBW OS. FACs (glutamine and glutamic ) based on linolenic, linoleic, , and stearic  were all observed in varying relative quantities. Hydroxylated FACs, such as volicitin, were not observed. Enzyme activity for β-glucosidase was also measured and found present in SBW OS, whereas glucose oxidase activity was not found in the SBW labial glands. These results demonstrate that SBW L2 larvae have the ability to induce VOC emissions upon herbivory and that SBW OS contain potential elicitors to induce these defensive responses. These data will be useful to further evaluate whether these elicitors can separately induce the production of specific VOCs and to investigate whether and how these emissions benefit the plant.© Crown copyright 2015.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29087946>Electrical synapses mediate synergism between pheromone and food odors in .</a></h1><p>In , the sex pheromone produced by males, -vaccenyl acetate (cVA), evokes a stereotypic gender-specific behavior in both males and females. As  adults feed, mate, and oviposit on food, they perceive the pheromone as a blend against a background of food odors. Previous studies have reported that food odors enhance flies' behavioral response to cVA, specifically in virgin females. However, how and where the different olfactory inputs interact has so far remained unknown. In this study, we elucidated the neuronal mechanism underlying the response at an anatomical, functional, and behavioral level. Our data show that in virgin females cVA and the complex food odor vinegar evoke a synergistic response in the cVA-responsive glomerulus DA1. This synergism, however, does not appear at the input level of the glomerulus, but is restricted to the projection neuron level only. Notably, it is abolished by a mutation in gap junctions in projection neurons and is found to be mediated by electrical synapses between excitatory local interneurons and projection neurons. As a behavioral consequence, we demonstrate that virgin females in the presence of vinegar become receptive more rapidly to courting males, while male courtship is not affected. Altogether, our results suggest that lateral excitation via gap junctions modulates odor tuning in the antennal lobe and drives synergistic interactions between two ecologically relevant odors, representing food and sex.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25786485>Role of VMH ketone bodies in adjusting caloric intake to increased dietary fat content in DIO and DR rats.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine the potential role of astrocyte-derived ketone bodies in regulating the early changes in caloric intake of diet induced-obese (DIO) versus diet-resistant (DR) rats fed a 31.5% fat high-energy (HE) diet. After 3 days on chow or HE diet, DR and DIO rats were assessed for their ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) ketone bodies levels and neuronal ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) sensing using microdialysis coupled to continuous food intake monitoring and calcium imaging in dissociated neurons, respectively. DIO rats ate more than DR rats over 3 days of HE diet intake. On day 3 of HE diet intake, DR rats reduced their caloric intake while DIO rats remained hyperphagic. Local VMH astrocyte ketone bodies production was similar between DR and DIO rats during the first 6 h after dark onset feeding but inhibiting VMH ketone body production in DR rats on day 3 transiently returned their intake of HE diet to the level of DIO rats consuming HE diet. In addition, dissociated VMN neurons from DIO and DR rats were equally sensitive to the largely excitatory effects of β-hydroxybutyrate. Thus while DR rats respond to increased VMH ketone levels by decreasing their intake after 3 days of HE diet, this is not the case of DIO rats. These data suggest that DIO inherent leptin resistance prevents ketone bodies inhibitory action on food intake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28911650>Time course effects of fermentation on   and  compound profiles of Cheonggukjang using new soybean cultivars.</a></h1><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of the potential probiotic Bacillus subtilis CSY191 on the   profiles of Cheonggukjang, a fermented soybean paste, prepared using new Korean brown soybean cultivars, protein-rich cultivar (Saedanbaek), and oil-rich cultivar (Neulchan). Twelve   were identified in the sample set-myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, , vaccenic, linoleic, α-linolenic, arachidic, gondoic, behenic, and lignoceric -yet, no specific changes driven by fermentation were noted in the   profiles. To further explore the effects of fermentation of B. subtilis CSY191, complete profiles of volatiles were monitored. In total, 121, 136, and 127  compounds were detected in the Saedanbaek, Daewon (control cultivar), and Neulchan samples, respectively. Interestingly, the content of pyrazines-compounds responsible for pungent and unpleasant Cheonggukjang flavors-was significantly higher in Neulchan compared to that in Saedanbaek. Although the fermentation period was not a strong factor affecting the observed changes in   profiles, we noted that profiles of volatiles in Cheonggukjang changed significantly over time, and different cultivars represented specific  profiles. Thus, further sensory evaluation might be needed to determine if such differences influence consumers' preferences. Furthermore, additional studies to elucidate the associations between B. subtilis CSY191 fermentation and other nutritional components (e.g., amino ) and their health-promoting potential are warranted.Copyright © 2016.

Odds ratios (ORs) for a one-SD change in the metabolite level were calculated using multiple logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, and BMI to test for associations with iIGT or iIFG versus normal. Selective biomarkers of iIGT were further validated in the Botnia study.α-Hydroxybutyric  (α-HB) was most strongly associated with iIGT in RISC (OR 2.54 [95% CI 1.86-3.48], P value 5E-9) and DMVhi (2.75 [1.81-4.19], 4E-5) while having no significant association with iIFG. In Botnia, α-HB was selectively associated with iIGT (2.03 [1.65-2.49], 3E-11) and had no significant association with iIFG. Linoleoyl-glycerophosphocholine (L-GPC) and  were also found to be selective biomarkers of iIGT. In multivariate IGT prediction models, addition of α-HB, L-GPC, and  to age, sex, BMI, and fasting glucose significantly improved area under the curve in all three cohorts.α-HB, L-GPC, and  were shown to be selective biomarkers of iIGT, independent of age, sex, BMI, and fasting glucose, in 4,053 subjects without diabetes from three European cohorts. These biomarkers can be used in predictive models to identify subjects with IGT without performing an OGTT.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

In this study we characterised the human serum metabolic profiles of participants in the Singapore Chinese Health Study cohort to identify metabolic signatures associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.In this nested case-control study, baseline serum metabolite profiles were measured using LC-MS and GC-MS during a 6-year follow-up of 197 individuals with type 2 diabetes but without a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer before diabetes diagnosis, and 197 healthy controls matched by age, sex and date of blood collection.A total of 51 differential metabolites were identified between cases and controls. Of these, 35 were significantly associated with diabetes risk in the multivariate analysis after false discovery rate adjustment, such as increased branched-chain amino  (leucine, isoleucine and valine), non-esterified   (palmitic , stearic ,  and linoleic ) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) species (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, 20:3, 20:4 and 22:6). A combination of six metabolites including proline, glycerol, aminomalonic , LPI (16:1), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic  and urea showed the potential to predict type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals with high baseline HbA1c levels (≥6.5% [47.5 mmol/mol]) with an AUC of 0.935. Combined lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) (12:0) and LPI (16:1) also showed the potential to predict type 2 diabetes in individuals with normal baseline HbA1c levels (<6.5% [47.5 mmol/mol]; AUC = 0.781).Our findings show that branched-chain amino  and NEFA are potent predictors of diabetes development in Chinese adults.

An edible mushroom, Pleurotus giganteus was found to stimulate neurite outgrowth in vitro but the chemical constituents and the underlying mechanism is yet to be elucidated. The chemical constituents of P. giganteus (linoleic , , cinnamic , caffeic , p-coumaric , succinic , benzoic , and uridine) were tested for neurite outgrowth activity. Uridine (100 μM) was found to increase the percentage of neurite-bearing cells of differentiating neuroblastoma (N2a) cells by 43.1 ± 0.5%, which was 1.8-fold higher than NGF (50 ng/mL)-treated cells. Uridine which was present in P. giganteus (1.80 ± 0.03 g/100g mushroom extract) increased the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and protein kinase B (Akt). Further, phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was also increased. MEK/ERK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR further induced phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and expression of growth associated protein 43 (GAP43); all of which promoted neurite outgrowth of N2a cells. This study demonstrated that P. giganteus may enhance neurite outgrowth and one of the key bioactive molecules responsible for neurite outgrowth is uridine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729072>Recycling of food waste for fuel precursors using an integrated bio-refinery approach.</a></h1><p>The main aim was to integrate FW-recycling with cultivation of Rhodotorula glutinis and anaerobic digestion (AD) for bio-energy and -fuel recovery. Mixed FW was mechanically macerated (Pcon) and hydrolysed (at 250gL water) via chemical (Ch), thermal (Th) and TCh (combined Ch and Th) treatments. Cleared hydrolysates from individual pre-treatment processes were used as culture medium for cultivation of R. glutinis, while the residual solids (RS) were subjected to AD. Pcon cultivation yielded maximal R. glutinis dry weight biomass (5.18gL) and total   contents (1.03gg DW). Dominant   methyl esters (FAME) were Palmitic - (C-26%); Stearic - (C-17%) and   (C-38%), ideal for bio-diesel production. Highest methane yields (actual ∼0.139mkg  solids) were measured from AD of Th-derived RS.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of T. halophilus CGMCC 3792 on the physiological characterizations and transcription profiling of Z. rouxii CGMCC 3791. Salt tolerance analysis revealed that co-culture with T. halophilus enhanced the salt tolerance of Z. rouxii during salt stress. Analysis of the  compounds revealed that co-culture reduced the level of 1-butanol, improved the level of octanoic  which all were produced by T. halophilus and reduced the level of phenylethyl alcohol produced by Z. rouxii. The presence of Z. rouxii decreased the contents of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and acetic  produced by T. halophilus. In addition, co-culture improved the content of benzyl alcohol significantly. Analysis of membrane   showed that co-culture improved the content of palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0)  in cells of Z. rouxii, and reduced the contents of myristic (C14:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1). In order to further explore the interactions between the two strains, RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the effect of co-culture with T. halophilus on the transcription profiling of Z. rouxii. By comparing cells incubated in co-culture group with cells incubated in single-culture group, a total of 967 genes were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among the DEGs, 72 genes were up-regulated, while 895 genes were down-regulated. These DEGs took party in various activities in cells of Z. rouxii, and the result showed co-culture with T. halophilus had a positive effect on proteolysis, the attachment of a cell to another cell, extracellular protein accumulation, energy metabolism, and a negative effect on oxidative phosphorylation, small molecular substances metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and transcription in cells of Z. rouxii.

A transcription assay using LβT2 cells demonstrated that LCFAs, , α-linolenic , docosahexaenoic  and palmitate, repressed the expression of Cga, Lhb, and Fshb at concentrations between 50 and 100 µM. On the other hand, treatment with 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs, , α-linolenic  and docosahexaenoic , repressed only Fshb expression, while the same dose of a saturated LCFA, palmitate, had no effect on the expression of gonadotropin subunit genes. Furthermore, GW9508 did not affect promoter activity. Next, we examined deletion mutants of the upstream region of Fshb and found that the upstream regulatory region (-2824 to -2343 bp) of Fshb was responsible for the notable repression by 10 µM unsaturated LCFAs. Our results suggest that the upstream region of Fshb is susceptible to unsaturated LCFAs. In addition, unsaturated LCFAs play a role in repressing Fshb expression through the distal -2824 to -2343 bp region, which might be independent of the LCFA receptor GPR120 pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28246442>Effects of different vegetable oils on rumen fermentation and conjugated linoleic  concentration .</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different vegetable oils on rumen fermentation and concentrations of beneficial -9 -11 C18:2 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and -11 C18:1   (FA) in the rumen fluid in an  condition.Six vegetable oils including sunflower, soybean, sesame, rice bran, groundnut, and mustard oils were used at three dose levels (0%, 3% and 4% of substrate dry matter [DM] basis) in three replicates for each treatment in a completely randomized design using 6 × 3 factorial arrangement. Rumen fluid for microbial culture was collected from four goats fed on a diet of concentrate mixture and berseem hay at a ratio of 60:40 on DM basis. The  fermentation was performed in 100 ml conical flakes containing 50 ml of culture media and 0.5 g of substrates containing 0%, 3% and 4% vegetable oils.Oils supplementation did not affect (p>0.05)  DM digestibility, and concentrations of total  FAs and ammonia-N. Sunflower oil and soybean oil decreased (p<0.05) protozoal numbers with increasing levels of oils. Other oils had less pronounced effect (p>0.05) on protozoal numbers. Both -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations were increased (p<0.05) by sunflower and soybean oil supplementation at 4% level with the highest concentration observed for sunflower oil. The addition of other oils did not significantly (p>0.05) increase the -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations as compared to the control. The concentrations of stearic, , linoleic, and linolenic  were not altered (p>0.05) due to the addition of any vegetable oils.Supplementation of sunflower and soybean oils enhanced beneficial -11 C18:1 FA and -9, -11 CLA concentrations in rumen fluid, while sesame, rice bran, groundnut, and mustard oils were ineffective in this study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29292738>Activation of PPARα by Oral Clofibrate Increases Renal   Oxidation in Developing Pigs.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activation by clofibrate on both mitochondrial and peroxisomal   oxidation in the developing kidney. Ten newborn pigs from 5 litters were randomly assigned to two groups and fed either 5 mL of a control vehicle (2% Tween 80) or a vehicle containing clofibrate (75 mg/kg body weight, treatment). The pigs received oral gavage daily for three days. In vitro   oxidation was then measured in kidneys with and without mitochondria inhibitors (antimycin A and rotenone) using [1-C]-labeled  (C18:1) and erucic  (C22:1) as substrates. Clofibrate significantly stimulated C18:1 and C22:1 oxidation in mitochondria ( < 0.001) but not in peroxisomes. In addition, the oxidation rate of C18:1 was greater in mitochondria than peroxisomes, while the oxidation of C22:1 was higher in peroxisomes than mitochondria ( < 0.001). Consistent with the increase in   oxidation, the mRNA abundance and enzyme activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) in mitochondria were increased. Although mRNA of mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (mHMGCS) was increased, the β-hydroxybutyrate concentration measured in kidneys did not increase in pigs treated with clofibrate.

Recently we found that PPARα is constitutively activated in nuclei of hippocampal neurons and controls plasticity via direct transcriptional activation of CREB. Here we report the discovery of three endogenous PPARα ligands-3-hydroxy-(2,2)-dimethyl butyrate, hexadecanamide, and 9-octadecenamide-in mouse brain hippocampus. Mass spectrometric detection of these compounds in mouse hippocampal nuclear extracts, in silico interaction studies, time-resolved FRET analyses, and thermal shift assay results clearly indicated that these three compounds served as ligands of PPARα. Site-directed mutagenesis studies further revealed that PPARα Y464 and Y314 are involved in binding these hippocampal ligands. Moreover, these ligands activated PPARα and upregulated the synaptic function of hippocampal neurons. These results highlight the discovery of hippocampal ligands of PPARα capable of modulating synaptic functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28057469>Importance of sulfide interaction with iron as regulator of the microbial community in biogas reactors and its effect on methanogenesis,  turnover, and syntrophic long-chain   degradation.</a></h1><p>The inhibitory effects of sulfide on microbial processes during anaerobic digestion have been widely addressed. However, other effects of sulfide are less explored, given that sulfide is a potential sulfur source for microorganisms and its high reactivity triggers a suit of abiotic reactions. We demonstrated that sulfide interaction with Fe regulates the dynamics and activities of microbial community during anaerobic digestion. This was manifested by the S:Fe molar ratio, whose increase adversely influenced the acetoclastic methanogens, Methanosaeta, and turnover of acetate. Dynamics of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanoculleus and Methanobrevibacter, were presumably influenced by sulfide-induced changes in the partial pressure of hydrogen. Interestingly, conversion of the long-chain   (LCFA), oleate, to methane was enhanced together with the abundance of LCFA-degrading, β-oxidizing Syntrophomonas at an elevated S:Fe molar ratio. The results suggested that sulfur chemical speciation is a controlling factor for microbial community functions in anaerobic digestion processes.Copyright © 2016 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

However, several side effects, including weight gain and  liver, have been reported in patients following VPA treatment. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms of VPA-induced hepatic steatosis using FL83B cell line-based in vitro model. Using fluorescent lipid staining technique, we found that VPA enhanced - (OLA-) induced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in hepatocytes; this may be due to upregulated lipid uptake, triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and lipid droplet formation. Real-time PCR results showed that, following VPA treatment, the expression levels of genes encoding cluster of differentiation 36 (Cd36), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (Lrp1), diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2), and perilipin 2 (Plin2) were increased, that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I a (Cpt1a) was not affected, and those of acetyl-Co A carboxylase α (Acca) and   synthase (Fasn) were decreased. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analyses, we found that VPA also induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) nuclear translocation and increased levels of cell-surface CD36. Based on these results, we propose that VPA may enhance OLA-induced hepatocyte steatosis through the upregulation of PPARγ- and CD36-dependent lipid uptake, TAG synthesis, and lipid droplet formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206672>Impact of Microclimate on   and  Terpenes in "Kerman" and "Golden Hills" Pistachio (Pistacia vera) Kernels.</a></h1><p>Pistachio is an economically important nut crop in California.

Moisture content decreased from July to September for both cultivars at both locations. Kerman had a higher moisture content at both locations compared with Golden Hills. Harvest time affected fat content only for Kerman, where the values increased drastically from 21-July to 4-Aug, then remained constant. Golden Hills' fat content remained constant during the period of the study. The main   in pistachio oil is  (46% to 59%), followed by linoleic  (26% to 36%) and palmitic  (11% to 16%). C16:0, C16:1, C18:2, and C18:3 decreased with harvest time, while C18:1 increased. α-Pinene was the most concentrated  among the cultivars and locations. It decreased with harvest time for both cultivars at both locations, ranging from 105 to 2464 mg/kg. At harvest, Golden Hills and Kerman at Parlier both had higher concentrations of α-pinene than the two cultivars at Lost Hills. Our results demonstrate that microclimate affects biosynthesis of   and terpenes in pistachio kernels, the main compounds responsible for pistachio nutritional and sensory characteristics.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27719901>Free   and their esters modulate isothermal crystallization of anhydrous milk fat.</a></h1><p>The effect of free   with different chain lengths or unsaturation degree on anhydrous milk fat (AMF) crystallization was evaluated. The impact of esterification was also studied using three triglycerides. Melted blends containing the additives at concentrations lower than 12wt.% were quenched at 25°C and isothermal crystallization was monitored by pulsed low-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance. In parallel, polarized light microscopy was used to observe the microstructure. Compounds based on long chain saturated  , i.e. palmitic, stearic, eicosanoic , tripalmitin and tristearin accelerated crystallization. Conversely, propanoic, hexanoic and   slowed down the process, while triacetin had no impact. Interestingly, above a critical concentration, the addition of palmitic, stearic or eicosanoic  caused a transition from a one-step to two-step process. Gompertz model was used to fit the experimental data and to assess the influence of the molecular properties of the additives on the kinetic parameters.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ten rumen and duodenal fistulated Nellore steers (268 body weight±27 kg) were distributed in a duplicated 5×5 Latin square. Dietary treatments were as follows: without fat (WF), palm oil (PO), linseed oil (LO), protected fat (PF; Lactoplus), and whole soybeans (WS). The roughage feed was corn silage (600 g/kg on a dry matter [DM] basis) plus concentrate (400 g/kg on a DM basis). The higher intake of DM and organic matter (OM) (p<0.001) was found in animals on the diet with PF and WF (around 4.38 and 4.20 kg/d, respectively). Treatments with PO and LO decreased by around 10% the total digestibility of DM and OM (p<0.05). The addition of LO decreased by around 22.3% the neutral detergent fiber digestibility (p = 0.047) compared with other diets. The higher microbial protein synthesis was found in animals on the diet with LO and WS (33 g N/kg OM apparently digested in the rumen; p = 0.040). The highest C18:0 and linolenic  intakes occurred in animals fed LO (p<0.001), and the highest intake of  (p = 0.002) and C16  (p = 0.022) occurred with the diets with LO and PF. Diet with PF decreased biohydrogenation extent (p = 0.05) of C18:1 n9,c, C18:2 n6,c, and total unsaturated   (UFA; around 20%, 7%, and 13%, respectively). The diet with PF and WF increased the concentration of NH3-N (p<0.001); however, the diet did not change  (p>0.05), such as the molar percentage of acetate, propionate, butyrate and the acetate:propionate ratio. Treatments PO, LO and with WS decreased by around 50% the concentration of protozoa (p<0.001).

Here, we examined the effects of single and combined applications of Trichoderma strains and their bioactive metabolites (BAMs) harzianic  (HA), 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6PP), and hydrophobin1 (HYTLO1) on the growth, yield, and nutrient uptake of soybean plants. Significant promotion of plant growth (up to 39%), as well as an increase in mineral content, was achieved with BAMs, used alone or combined with T. harzianum. Interestingly, the treatments also increased the level of fatty acids (, linolenic, 11-eicosenoic, and stearic).

In order to further enhance the delivery of drugs through the skin, penetration enhancers are widely used.The objective of this work was to develop an optimized formulation of lornoxicam ethosomal gels, investigate skin permeability with the addition of penetration enhancers, and evaluate the invivo pharmacodynamics of these formulations.Lornoxicam ethosomes were prepared by the ethanol injection method and optimized using the orthogonal design method. Lornoxicam ethosomal gels with enhancers were prepared and optimized using in-vitro transdermal delivery experiments. Experiments on lornoxicam ethosomal gels containing various enhancers such as azone, menthol, lauryl alcohol, and  were conducted using vertical Franz diffusion cells to measure the percutaneous permeability of the different formulations. Furthermore, the in-vivo analgesic effects of the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels were examined using the hot-plate and acetic -induced writhing tests. Anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using the dimethylbenzene-induced mouse ear swelling method.The results showed that compared to other formulations, the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels with 5 % menthol significantly increased transdermal penetration. Meanwhile, the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels showed remarkably anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity compared with the plain lornoxicam gels.These results suggest that the optimized ethosomal gel formulated in this study is a promising lornoxicam carrier in transdermal delivery systems to enhance anti-nociceptive and antiinflammatory efficiency.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578069>Model studies on the formation of  compounds generated by a thermal treatment of steryl esters with different   moieties.</a></h1><p>The consumption of plant sterols is reported to have a beneficial effects on human health, i.e. phytosterols are known for their cholesterol-lowering properties. Whereas, they are prone to oxidation and currently there is ongoing worldwide research aimed at the biological effect of phytosterol oxides. In this study  compounds formed during thermal degradation of stigmasteryl esters were identified. The research was conducted using standards of stigmasterol,   and stigmasteryl esters as well as fat enriched with stigmasteryl esters which were thermally treated at 60°C and 180°C for 12h.  compounds were characterised by SPME-GC-MS. Among the volatiles formed during heating of stigmasteryl esters aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and hydrocarbons were found. The mechanism of the formation of  compounds from sterol esters was related to oxidation of steryl and   moieties. In particular, 2-methyl-3-pentanone and 5-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hepten-2-one were identified as unique degradation products formed from degradation of the steryl moiety specifically, and a mechanism of their formation was suggested. Both volatiles could be a good indicator of thermo-oxidative degradation of functional food products enriched in phytosterols and their esters.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This last prediction required an initial set of four PLS1 calibration models that were based on gravimetrically prepared mixtures of a specific variety of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) spiked with adulterants. The current study was undertaken after obtaining a range of EVOO varieties grown in different countries. It was found that all the different types of EVOO varieties investigated belonged to four distinct groups, and each required the development of additional sets of specific PLS1 calibration models to ensure that they can be used to predict low concentrations of vegetable oils high in linoleic, , or palmitic , and/or refined olive oil. These four distinct sets of PLS1 calibration models were required to cover the range of EVOO varieties with a linoleic  content from 1.3 to 15.5 % of total  . An FT-NIR library was established with 66 EVOO products obtained from California and Europe. The quality and/or purity of EVOO were assessed by determining the FT-NIR Index, a measure of the  content of EVOO. The use of these PLS1 calibration models made it possible to predict the authenticity of EVOO and the identity and quantity of potential adulterant oils in minutes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27792915>Identification of pork flavour precursors from enzyme-treated lard using Maillard model system assessed by GC-MS and partial least squares regression.</a></h1><p>Lipase was used to hydrolyse the lard, and four pork flavours (PFs) were prepared through Maillard reaction using different enzyme-treated lards.  compounds and free   of lard, and  compounds of PFs were analysed by GC-MS.

Delays in oil processing usually result in undesirable oxidation and hydrolysis processes leading to formation of free  . These alterations create the need to process oil immediately after olive harvest. However, phenolic content decreases drastically during olive storage resulting in lower quality oil. In the present study we propose postharvest methyl jasmonate treatment as a mean to avoid changes in   composition and losses of phenolic  during olive storage.Contents of   and phenolic  were estimated in methyl jasmonate treated olives throughout 30-day storage, as compared with those of untreated olives.

We previously found that β-oxidation mutants were defective in virulence and did not grow on acetate. Here, we demonstrate that acetate inhibits filamentation during mating and in response to . We therefore examined the influence of different carbon sources by comparing the transcriptomes of cells grown on acetate,  or glucose, with expression changes for the fungus during tumour formation in planta. Guided by the transcriptional profiling, we found that acetate negatively influenced resistance to stress, promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species, triggered cell death in stationary phase and impaired virulence on maize. We also found that acetate induced mitochondrial stress by interfering with mitochondrial functions. Notably, the disruption of oxygen perception or inhibition of the electron transport chain also influenced filamentation and mating. Finally, we made use of the connections between acetate and β-oxidation to test metabolic inhibitors for an influence on growth and virulence. These experiments identified diclofenac as a potential inhibitor of virulence. Overall, these findings support the possibility of targeting mitochondrial metabolic functions to control fungal pathogens.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26041181>Some physicochemical characteristics of pinus (Pinus halepensis Mill., Pinus pinea L., Pinus pinaster and Pinus canariensis) seeds from North Algeria, their lipid profiles and  contents.</a></h1><p>Physicochemical characteristics of seeds of some pinus species (Pinus halepensis Mill., Pinus pinea L., Pinus pinaster and Pinus canariensis) grown in North Algeria were determined.

Results showed that 2 alkyl furans and 23  aldehydes including 4 toxic OdβUAs were detected by GC-MS. The original   compositions of the oils played a key role in the type and concentration of those  compounds. 4-Hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE) and ethyl furan were only detected in PAO with a high content of linolenic , while the greatest level of pentyl furan was detected in PO with abundant linoleic . Greater amounts of 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-(E)-2-nonenal (ONE) were formed in the OVO with abundant . The close relativity of HHE and ethyl furan was also demonstrated. With principal component analysis, these vegetable oils could be discriminated based on their   and  compounds. The loading plot confirmed that HHE and ethyl furan were derived from the linolenic  oxidation and degradation. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The chemometric results showed that the formation of the  components during heating in different vegetable oils has close correlation with the original   composition of vegetable oils. Our research has also confirmed the presence of toxic OɑβUAs in oils after heating.

In the mixed sugar medium containing 6 g/L glucose and 44 g/L xylose, and supplemented with acetic , the cell growth was not:inhibited when the acetic  concentration was below 10 g/L. Compared with the control, the biomass, lipid concentration and lipid content of R. glutinis increased 21.5%, 171% and 122% respectively when acetic  concentration was 10 g/L. Furthermore, R. glutinis could accumulate lipid with acetate as the sole carbon source. Lipid concentration and lipid yield reached 3.20 g/L and 13% respectively with the initial acetic  concentration of 25 g/L. The lipid composition was analyzed by gas chromatograph. The main composition of lipid produced with acetic  was palmitic , stearic , , linoleic  and linolenic , including 40.9% saturated   and 59.1% unsaturated  . The lipid composition was similar to that of plant oil, indicating that lipid from oleaginous yeast R. glutinis had potential as the feedstock of biodiesel production.

GW7647 is a potent PPARα agonist that must reach the nucleus to activate this receptor. In cells expressing human  -binding protein 1 (FABP1), GW7647 treatment increases FABP1's nuclear localization and potentiates GW7647-mediated PPARα activation; GW7647 is less effective in cells that do not express FABP1. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, here we substituted residues in FABP1 known to dictate lipid signaling by other intracellular lipid-binding proteins. Substitutions of Lys-20 and Lys-31 to Ala in the FABP1 helical cap affected neither its nuclear localization nor PPARα activation. In contrast, Ala substitution of Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96, located in the loops adjacent to the ligand-binding portal region, abolished both FABP1 nuclear localization and GW7647-induced PPARα activation but had little effect on GW7647-FABP1 binding affinity. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we determined the WT FABP1 structure and analyzed the dynamics in the apo and GW7647-bound structures of both the WT and the K57A/E77A/K96A triple mutant. We found that GW7647 binding causes little change in the FABP1 backbone, but solvent exposes several residues in the loops around the portal region, including Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96. These residues also become more solvent-exposed upon binding of FABP1 with the endogenous PPARα agonist . Together with previous observations, our findings suggest that GW7647 binding stabilizes a FABP1 conformation that promotes its interaction with PPARα. We conclude that full PPARα agonist activity of GW7647 requires FABP1-dependent transport and nuclear localization processes.© 2019 Patil et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271150>Influence of pig rennet on   composition,  molecule profile, texture and sensory properties of Pecorino di Farindola cheese.</a></h1><p>Pig rennet is traditionally used in Pecorino di Farindola cheese.

Thus, the wild species may prove to be suitable for use in traditional medicine as cancer chemoprevention.© 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29331316>Pharmacological activities of the organic extracts and   composition of the petroleum ether extract from Haplophyllum tuberculatum leaves.</a></h1><p>Haplophyllum tuberculatum is used in traditional medicine to treat many disorders including inflammation and pain. The aim of this study is to investigate the organic extracts from H. tuberculatum leaves against inflammation, gastric ulcer and pain.Acute toxicity was studied in vivo to determine the toxic doses of the organic extracts. Anti-inflammatory activity was also evaluated in vivo using carrageenan-induced paw edema in Wistar rats. Gastroprotective activity was tested using the HCl/ethanol-induced gastric ulcer test in rats. Peripheral and central analgesic activities were assessed using the acetic -induced writhing test and the hot-plate method, respectively. The chemical composition of the   in the petroleum ether (PE) extract was determined with GC-MS.At 25, 50 and 100mg/kg PE extract was the most active against inflammation. Percentages inhibition 5h after carrageenan-injection were 51.12; 86.71% and 96.92%, respectively. The same extract at 100mg/kg showed good analgesic activities using the acetic -induced writhing test and the hot-plate method. The chloroform, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and butanolic (n-BuOH) extracts exhibited strong anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and analgesic activities at 100mg/kg. The GC-FID analysis revealed that the PE extract was rich in γ-linolenic  (45.50%) followed by palmitic  (18.48%), linoleic  (10.73%), erucic  (4.72), stearic  (3.96%) and  (2.57%).The results of the present study support the traditional use of the leaves of H. tuberculatum and may possibly serve as prospective material for further development of safe new phytochemical anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and/or analgesic agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of various reaction parameters such as the molar ratio, time, enzyme and substrate concentration, and effect of various fungal polysaccharides was estimated. The rate of catalyzed synthesis of esters largely depends on the solvent medium, and the maximum activity was found when n-hexane was used as a solvent. The maximum conversion yield of 58.2% and 59.3% was obtained for butyl caprylate and butyl oleate, respectively, under the following conditions: amount of free lipase 500 U; caprylic :butanol molar ratio 1:1; :butanol molar ratio 2:1. The addition of naturally obtained fungal polysaccharides significantly enhanced the ester synthesis. The highest conversion rate of 95.2% was observed for butyl caprylate in the presence of AbEPS after 24 h with 500 U of free R. variabilis lipase.

Certain chemical functionality such as the carboxylic  is a general liability for BBB permeability preventing significant CNS distribution of a drug from a systemic dose. Here, we report a strategy for CNS-selective distribution of the carboxylic  containing thyromimetic sobetirome using prodrugs targeted to - amide hydrolase (FAAH), which is expressed in the brain. Two amide prodrugs of sobetirome were shown to be efficient substrates of FAAH with V/K values comparable to the natural endocannabinoid FAAH substrate anandamide. In mice, a systemic dose of sobetirome prodrug leads to a substantial ∼60-fold increase in brain distribution (K) of sobetirome compared to an equimolar systemic dose of the parent drug. The increased delivery of sobetirome to the brain from the prodrug was diminished by both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of FAAH in vivo. The increased brain exposure of sobetirome arising from the prodrug corresponds to ∼30-fold increased potency in brain target engagement compared to the parent drug. These results suggest that FAAH-targeted prodrugs can considerably increase drug exposure to the CNS with a concomitant decrease in systemic drug levels generating a desirable distribution profile for CNS acting drugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29349441>Association between sn-2 fatty  profiles of breast milk and development of the infant intestinal microbiome.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence shows that host diet and gut microbes are related. Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by palmitic  (C, 54.42%),  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C, arachidonic  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. These microbes were involved in short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production and other functions, and significantly increased at 13-15 d after breastfeeding was initiated. C and DHA were relevant to most of the microbes. This study demonstrated the relatively steady profiles of sn-2 FAs in breast milk and gut  of infants, together with their correlation during the breastfeeding period. The above results provided important information for designing the configuration of FAs in next-generation formulas for Chinese infants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772019>Zinc supplementation of Friesian cows: Effect on chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile of dairy products.</a></h1><p>Zinc represents an essential microelement for several biochemical mechanisms. The body's inability to store zinc necessarily requires a constant dietary supply to avoid alteration of physiological functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary enrichment with zinc on chemical-nutritional and aromatic properties of milk and cheese. Thirty commercial dairy cows, balanced for parity, milk production, and days in milk, were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The control group was fed with a conventional complete diet (22 kg of dry matter/animal per day), whereas the experimental group received a daily zinc supplementation of 60 mg per kg of dry complete feed. During the experimental period, the milk yield was monitored and samples of milk and caciotta cheese were collected to obtain information about the chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile. Dietary zinc integration did not influence milk yield and composition, but induced a marked reduction of somatic cell count and improved the oxidative stability of ripened caciotta cheese. In both milk and cheese, the experimental group samples were characterized by a lower concentration of saturated   and an increase in , vaccenic , and rumenic . The aromatic profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary zinc intake, with an increase in concentration of carboxylic , aldehydes, and esters. The present results suggest a positive role of zinc in improving animal health and nutraceutical properties of milk and corresponding cheese. Taking into account the analysis of  compounds, zinc dietary supplementation of dairy cows should contribute to the production of cheeses with interesting organoleptic properties, although more studies are necessary to confirm the consumer acceptability of these changes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Roasting increased the oxidative stability of bitter AKO.  compounds were tentatively identified and semi-quantified. Among the 53 volatiles identified, benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol were the major components. These two aroma compounds increased significantly during roasting and contributed sweet and almond flavors. Pyrazines were also prevalent and significantly increased with roasting. Sensory evaluation showed that roasted, nutty, sweet and oily aromas increased as roasting temperature increased.Practical applications: Bitter apricot kernels cannot be consumed directly, thus it is potentially beneficial to find uses for them, especially in China where bitter apricot processing is a significant industry. Roasted bitter AKO with a pleasant aroma could be prepared and might find use as an edible oil. The roasting process gave the bitter AKO a pleasant flavor.

Pp-oil was obtained by pressing dried seeds at room temperature to give a 47.0% yield of oil. It was then subjected to   composition analysis. The principal   were linoleic  (46.5%), α-linolenic  (34.4%) and  (13.9%). Then, it was evaluated for its antinociceptive activity in mice, using the acetic -induced abdominal writhing, hot plate and formalin test models. Additionally, its toxicity was determined. The Pp-oil proved to have no toxicological effects, showing dose-dependent antinociceptive effect under chemical stimulation. At oral doses of 25-100 mg/kg, Pp-oil significantly reduced the abdominal writhes in the writhing test. A higher oral dose of 200 mg/kg did not induce alterations in the latency time of the hot plate test when compared to the control, suggesting an analgesic activity of peripheral origin. At oral doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, the Pp-oil significantly reduced the second phase of the algic stimulus in the formalin test. In addition, the antinociception of Pp-oil was reversed by naloxone in the evaluation of its mechanism of action. Therefore, the Pp-oil proved to be safe at very high doses and to show significant analgesic properties. The role of Pp-oil is still being investigated with respect the mechanism of action, but the results suggest that opiod receptors could be involved in the antinociception action observed for the oil of P. polyadenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29540984>Microbial Quality of and Biochemical Changes in Fresh Soft, -Curd Xinotyri Cheese Made from Raw or Pasteurized Goat's Milk.</a></h1><p>The microbiological quality of and changes in the main physicochemical parameters, together with the evolution of proteolysis, lipolysis and  profiles of soft Xinotyri, a traditional Greek -curd cheese (pH≈4.4, moisture 65%, salt 1%) made from raw (RMC) or pasteurized (PMC) goat's milk without starters, were evaluated during aerobic storage at 4 C for 60 days. No statistically significant differences between the total nitrogen (TN) and nitrogen fraction (% of TN) contents, the degradation of intact α- or β-caseins, total free amino  (FAA) contents, and the ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides in the water-soluble fraction of RMC and PMC were found.

In this study, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses were carried out to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of 1-MCP on peach aroma from different standpoints:   (FA) metabolism, ethylene signal transduction and lipoxygenase/β-oxidation pathway during 20 °C storage. Results indicate that 1-MCP significantly postponed the ethylene climacteric peak appearance and reduced ethylene production through down-regulation of related biosynthesis and signal transduction genes including PpaSAMS1/2, PpaACS1/2, PpaACO1 together with PpaETR1/2, PpaERS1, PpaEIN4 and PpaCTR1. Decrease in the levels of FAs and PpaFADs was observed in treated fruit, except  and PpaFAD4/5, before day 5 of storage. In addition, 1-MCP-treated fruit also possessed higher levels of C6 aldehydes and alcohols and delayed the formation of  compounds characteristic of peach-like aroma by upregulation of PpaLOX1/2/3 and PpaHPL1 expression and down-regulation of PpaLOX5 expression. Our findings suggest that inhibition of peach-like volatiles and promotion of green-note volatiles by 1-MCP were associated with ethylene production and modulation of FA levels through transcriptional regulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the studied pâtés, half of pork fat was replaced with a mixture consisting of canola and high- sunflower oil (75:25, v/v), thus improving their   profile in terms of polyunsaturated   (PUFA). In order to avoid the oxidation of PUFA in the new samples, seaweed extracts (500 ppm) were added. In addition, some samples were formulated with a synthetic antioxidant (BHT at 50 ppm) (BHT) and a control batch (CON) (without antioxidant) was also prepared, for comparison purposes. Thus, in total, five batches of liver pâté were prepared: CON, BHT, AN, FV and BB. Pâté samples were analyzed at 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 days of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. The addition of seaweed extracts did not modify significantly (P > 0.05) the chemical composition or microbial characteristics of healthy pork liver pâté, except for the protein content, which resulted in a significant increase (≈2-3%) in the batches manufactured with addition of seaweed extracts compared to control samples. At the end of storage (180 days), L* values were significantly lower in the FV and BB batches than in the other batches. Moreover, the a* and b* values were also significantly lower in CON batches than in the samples with antioxidants added. Differences in oxidative parameters (conjugated dienes, TBARs and carbonyls) among batches were observed at the end of the storage time, showing samples with seaweed extracts a similar degree of protection against oxidation compared to BHT formulated samples.

The leading compound judged by UPLC-MS/MS was tenuifoliside A, and  was the leading  from GC-MS profiles. All samples tested showed similar bioactive compound compositions, but the level of each compound varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal bioactive compounds with significant level variations between samples. These principal chemicals could be used for quality judgment of P. tenuifolia root, instead of measuring the levels of all compositional compounds.Copyright © 2014.

Particularly, P. serotina seeds, consumed in Mexico as snacks, are used for treating cough. In the present study, nutritional and  analyses of black cherry seeds were carried out to determine their nutraceutical potential. Proximate analysis indicated that P. serotina raw and toasted seeds contain mostly fat, followed by protein, fiber, carbohydrates, and ash. The potassium content in black cherry raw and toasted seeds is high, and their protein digestibility-corrected amino  scores suggest that they might represent a complementary source of proteins. Solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography/flame ionization detection/mass spectrometry analysis allowed identification of 59 and 99  compounds in the raw and toasted seeds, respectively. The major  compounds identified in raw and toasted seeds were 2,3-butanediol and benzaldehyde, which contribute to the flavor and odor of the toasted seeds. Moreover, it has been previously demonstrated that benzaldehyde possesses a significant vasodilator effect, therefore, the presence of this compound along with , linoleic, and α-eleostearic   indicate that black cherry seeds consumption might have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26286349>In vitro fermentation of nuts results in the formation of butyrate and c9,t11 conjugated linoleic  as chemopreventive metabolites.</a></h1><p>The consumption of foods rich in dietary fiber and polyunsaturated   such as nuts can contribute to a healthy diet. Therefore, the formation of fermentation end-products which might exert chemopreventive effects regarding colon cancer was investigated after an in vitro simulated digestion and fermentation of nuts using human fecal microbiota.Fermentation supernatants (FS) and pellets (FP) were obtained after an in vitro fermentation of hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios and walnuts. Short-chain   () and bile  (BA) in FS as well as   in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of  compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of vaccenic  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME;   methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA deoxycholic-/iso-deoxycholic  (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal microbiota to convert polyunsaturated   from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and lipid peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding colon cancer development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28825993>Effect of metabolic stressors on survival and growth of in vitro cultured ovine preantral follicles and enclosed oocytes.</a></h1><p>The present study was undertaken to study the effect of metabolic stressors like elevated levels of ammonia, urea, Non-esterified   (NEFA) and β-hydroxybutyric  (BHB) on preantral follicle growth, survival, growth rates of oocytes enclosed in preantral follicles (PFs), maturation rates of oocytes recovered from cultured follicles, hormone production (estrogen and progesterone), reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity.

This study identified and analyzed the functional role of the FFAR1 receptor in bovine neutrophils, the first line of host defense against infectious agents. We cloned the putative FFAR1 receptor from bovine neutrophils and analyzed the sequence to construct a homology model. Our results revealed that the sequence of bovine FFAR1 shares 84% identity with human FFAR1 and 31% with human FFAR3/GPR41. Therefore, we constructed a homology model of bovine FFAR1 using human as the template. Expression of the bovine FFAR1 receptor in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells increased the levels of intracellular calcium induced by the LCFAs,  (OA) and linoleic  (LA); no increase in calcium mobilization was observed in the presence of the short chain   propionic . Additionally, the synthetic agonist GW9508 increased intracellular calcium in CHO-K1/bFFAR1 cells. OA and LA increased intracellular calcium in bovine neutrophils. Furthermore, GW1100 (antagonist of FFAR1) and U73122 (phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor) reduced FFAR1 ligand-induced intracellular calcium in CHO-K1/bFFAR1 cells and neutrophils. Additionally, inhibition of FFAR1, PLC and PKC reduced the FFAR1 ligand-induced release of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 granules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to   in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing ), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits.

As a secondary crosslinking mechanism, glutaraldehyde unfolds some of the α-helices and turns them into β-sheets. While crosslinking resulted in stiffer and less ductile zein films, it made the surface of the films rougher, measured using AFM, and more hydrophilic, measured using WCA. In the crosslinking conditions in this study, the number of crosslinks estimated from rubber elasticity theory were not enough to change the water vapor permeability of the films significantly.

The objective of this study was to investigate the appropriate conditions for the codigestion of NaOH-pretreated 2POMW with food waste. NaOH pretreatment can increase the methane production by increasing the soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), but it may cause inhibition because of higher levels of alkalinity, sodium ion, volatile fatty acids and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Therefore, the first experimental phase of this study aimed to investigate the effect of different mixing ratios of 2POMW to food waste. A continuous stirred tank reactor experiment with different mixing ratios of 3%, 4.3%, 5.7% and 8.3% (2POMW: food waste) was conducted. NaOH pretreatment in the range of 6-20% was used. A mixing ratio up to 4.3%, when 10% NaOH pretreatment was used, caused no inhibition and increased methane production by 445.9mL/g-VS(2POMW). For this mixing ratio an additional experimental phase was conducted with the 20% NaOH pretreatment as the 20% NaOH pretreatment had the highest sCOD. The methane gas production was increased by 503.6mL/g-VS(2POMW). However, pH adjustment was required for applying this concentration of the high alkalinity 20% NaOH-pretreated 2POMW. Therefore, we consider using 10% NaOH pretreatment in a mixing ratio of 4.3% to be more applicable. The increase in methane gas production was correlated to the  concentration inside the reactors. The high  concentration of 61.8mg/L for the 8.3% mixing ratio was responsible for the strong inhibition. This study showed that adjusting the appropriate mixing ratio of the NaOH-pretreated 2POMW could increase the electricity production of a reactor that regularly receives food waste.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The rapeseeds were roasted at different temperature/time combinations (at 140-180°C, and for 5-15min); subsequently, oil was pressed from the roasted seeds. The roasting improved the flavour and contributed to a substantial increase in the amount of a potent antioxidant-canolol. The changes in  compounds related to roasting conditions were monitored using comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC×GC-ToFMS), and the key odorants for the non-roasted and roasted seeds oils were determined by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O). The most important compounds determining the flavour of oils obtained from the roasted seeds were dimethyl sulphide, dimethyltrisulfide, 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine, 2,3-butenedione, octanal, 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine and phenylacetaldehyde. For the oils obtained from the non-roasted seeds, the dominant compounds were dimethylsulfide, hexanal and octanal. Based on GC×GC-ToFMS and principal component analysis (PCA) of the data, several compounds were identified that were associated with roasting at the highest temperatures regardless of the rapeseed variety: these were, among others, methyl ketones (2-hexanone, 2-heptanone and 2-octanone).Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that nutritional state in female flies modulates cVA perception in first-order olfactory neurons. Starvation increases, and feeding reduces attraction to food odour, in both sexes. Adding cVA to food odour, however, maintains attraction in fed females, while it has no effect in males. Upregulation of sensitivity and behavioural responsiveness to cVA in fed females is paralleled by a strong increase in receptivity to male courtship. Functional imaging of the antennal lobe (AL), the olfactory centre in the insect brain, shows that olfactory input to DA1 and VM2 glomeruli is also modulated by starvation. Knocking down insulin receptors in neurons converging onto the DA1 glomerulus suggests that insulin-signalling partly controls pheromone perception in the AL, and adjusts cVA attraction according to nutritional state and sexual receptivity in Drosophila females.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28946217>Quality evaluation,   analysis and untargeted profiling of volatiles in Cambodian rice.</a></h1><p>This study provides the first investigation of the physical traits, pasting properties and  compounds of Cambodian rice cultivars, including traditional, improved, and improved traditional varieties, allowing for their differentiation as high and low quality rice. Analysis of the grain quality traits illustrates interesting features of traditional varieties and correlations between traits that assist with understanding texture.

These limitations can be removed by using cultured embryos, provided they mimic growth and lipid deposition observed for embryos in planta. Mid-maturation embryos from Camelina sativa were cultured in vitro to assess the use of sufficient acetate or glycerol concentrations and labeling periods for stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometric detection. Maximum incorporation of exogenous acetate into   occurred at 1mM and above. This provides about 5% of the total carbon flux entering  , enough for (13)C isotopomer analysis while maintaining normal biosynthetic rates for over 24h. Labeling analysis indicates that acetate reports lipid metabolism uniformly across the embryo. At higher acetate concentrations with longer incubations, the rate of   synthesis is reduced and the composition of newly synthesized   changes. While the mole fractions of oleate that undergo Δ12-desaturation or elongation are independent of biosynthetic flux, Δ15-desaturation shows a bimodal dependence. These observations are consistent with changes occurring in planta over seed development. Incorporation rates of the glyceryl moiety into lipids saturates at about 0.5mM exogenous glycerol. At saturation, the exogenous glycerol almost completely replaces the endogenous supply of glycerol-3-phosphate without affecting net lipid accumulation or   composition. It is concluded that acetate and glycerol labeling of cultured C. sativa embryos can provide an accurate representation of lipid metabolism in embryos in vivo, and that in Camelina embryos glycerol-3-phosphate levels do not co-limit triacylglycerol synthesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Both seeds contained a large amount of oil (around 20%) rich in polyunsaturated  . While Salvia officinalis seed oil can be classified as -linoleic oil, the predominant   in Salvia sclarea was α-linolenic  (around 54%). Among tocols, the main isomers in both seeds and oils were γ-tocopherol, followed by α-tocopherol. Concerning carotenoids, their concentration was around 0.75 mg/100 g of seeds and 0.16 mg/100 g of oils, with a predominance of lutein. Oil and seeds of S. officinalis exhibited higher antioxidant potential compared to S. sclarea investigated samples which could be attributed to higher content of total vitamin E and carotenoids. This study provides results that enables use of two Salvia species as new alternative sources of vegetable oils.© 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617992>Characterization of French Coriander Oil as Source of Petroselinic .</a></h1><p>Coriander vegetable oil was extracted from fruits of French origin in a 23% yield. The oil was of good quality, with a low amount of free   (1.8%) and a concurrently high amount of triacylglycerols (98%). It is a rich source of petroselinic  (C18:1n-12), an important renewable building block, making up 73% of all  , with also significant amounts of linoleic  (14%),  (6%), and palmitic  (3%). The oil was characterized by a high unsaponifiable fraction, comprising a substantial amount of phytosterols (6.70 g/kg). The main sterol markers were β-sitosterol (35% of total sterols), stigmasterol (24%), and Δ⁷-stigmastenol (18%). Squalene was detected at an amount of 0.2 g/kg. A considerable amount of tocols were identified (500 mg/kg) and consisted mainly of tocotrienols, with γ-tocotrienol as the major compound. The phospholipid content was low at 0.3%, of which the main phospholipid classes were phosphatidic  (33%), phosphatidylcholine (25%), phosphatidylinositol (17%), and phosphatidylethanolamine (17%). About 50% of all phospholipids were non-hydratable. The β-carotene content was low at 10 mg/kg, while a significant amount of chlorophyll was detected at about 11 mg/kg. An iron content of 1.4 mg/kg was determined through element analysis of the vegetable oil. The influence of fruit origin on the vegetable oil composition was shown to be very important, particularly in terms of the phospholipids, sterols, and tocols composition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28859691>Effect of oregano essential oil and benzoic  supplementation to a low-protein diet on meat quality,   composition, and lipid stability of longissimus thoracis muscle in pigs.</a></h1><p>Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in food containing appropriately high concentration of intramuscular fat (IMF) and polyunsaturated   (PUFA). The supplementation of feed with antioxidants decreases degradation of lipids in muscles thereby enhances nutritional and sensory properties of meat. Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of adding oregano essential oil (OEO) and benzoic  (BA) to low-protein, amino -supplemented diets on meat quality, sensory profile,   composition, and lipid oxidation of longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle in pigs.In Exp. 1, 21 barrows were housed in metabolism cages and randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets. The three diets were normal protein diet (NPD), medium protein diet (MPD) and low protein diet (LPD) with 1% and 2% less than NPD, respectively. In Exp. 2, 36 barrows were randomly divided into three experimental groups, namely, NPD, LPD, and identical LPD supplemented with blends of OEO (250 mg/kg feed) and BA (1000 mg/kg feed) (LPOB) groups.No significant effects of diets on meat quality were observed in Exp. 1. The b*, tenderness, and IMF content in LPD muscle were higher than those in NPD and LPOB muscle. The LT muscle in LPD group contained a higher percentage of  (C18:1n-9) and a lower percentage of linoleic  (C18:2n-6) than those in NPD group. Dietary LPOB improved oxidative stability, total superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase but decreased drip loss in LT muscle.These findings suggest that growing-finishing pigs fed with a low-protein, amino -supplemented diet show a high content of intramuscular fat in the longissimus thoracis muscle. Dietary LPOB enhances the anti-oxidative status by improving antioxidative capacity but deteriorates the sensory attributes by decreasing IMF content of meat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28597159>Metabolite analysis of endophytic fungi from cultivars of Zingiber officinale Rosc. identifies myriad of bioactive compounds including tyrosol.</a></h1><p>Endophytic fungi associated with rhizomes of four cultivars of Zingiber officinale were identified by molecular and morphological methods and evaluated for their activity against soft rot pathogen Pythium myriotylum and clinical pathogens. The  bioactive metabolites produced by these isolates were identified by GC-MS analysis of the fungal crude extracts. Understanding of the metabolites produced by endophytes is also important in the context of raw consumption of ginger as medicine and spice. A total of fifteen isolates were identified from the four varieties studied. The various genera identified were Acremonium sp., Gliocladiopsis sp., Fusarium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Aspergillus sp., Phlebia sp., Earliella sp., and Pseudolagarobasidium sp. The endophytic community was unique to each variety, which could be due to the varying host genotype. Fungi from phylum Basidiomycota were identified for the first time from ginger. Seven isolates showed activity against Pythium, while only two showed antibacterial activity. The bioactive metabolites identified in the fungal crude extracts include tyrosol, benzene acetic , ergone, dehydromevalonic lactone, N-aminopyrrolidine, and many bioactive   and their derivatives which included linoleic , , myristic , n-hexadecanoic , palmitic  methyl ester, and methyl linoleate. The presence of these varying bioactive endophytic fungi may be one of the reasons for the differences in the performance of the different ginger varieties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342087>Novel identification of the free   receptor FFAR1 that promotes contraction in airway smooth muscle.</a></h1><p>Obesity is one of the major risk factors for asthma. Previous studies have demonstrated that free   levels are elevated in the plasma of obese individuals. Medium- and long-chain free   act as endogenous ligands for the free   receptors FFAR1/GPR40 and FFAR4/GPR120, which couple to Gq proteins. We investigated whether FFAR1 and FFAR4 are expressed on airway smooth muscle and whether they activate Gq-coupled signaling and modulate airway smooth muscle tone. We detected the protein expression of FFAR1 and FFAR4 in freshly dissected native human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle and cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The long-chain free   ( and linoleic ) and GW9508 (FFAR1/FFAR4 dual agonist) dose-dependently stimulated transient intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) increases and inositol phosphate synthesis in HASM cells. Downregulation of FFAR1 or FFAR4 in HASM cells by small interfering RNA led to a significant inhibition of the long-chain free  -induced transient [Ca(2+)]i increases. , linoleic , or GW9508 stimulated stress fiber formation in HASM cells, potentiated acetylcholine-contracted guinea pig tracheal rings, and attenuated the relaxant effect of isoproterenol after an acetylcholine-induced contraction. In contrast, TUG-891 (FFAR4 agonist) did not induce the stress fiber formation or potentiate acetylcholine-induced contraction. These results suggest that FFAR1 is the functionally dominant free   receptor in both human and guinea pig airway smooth muscle. The free   sensors expressed on airway smooth muscle could be an important modulator of airway smooth muscle tone.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26525535>Microbiota-Dependent Hepatic Lipogenesis Mediated by Stearoyl CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) Promotes Metabolic Syndrome in TLR5-Deficient Mice.</a></h1><p>The gut microbiota plays a key role in host metabolism. Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Titratable acidity and pH, yogurt bacteria counts,   profile, and healthy lipid indices were evaluated during 28 d of refrigerated storage. As expected for yogurts, Streptococcus thermophilus counts decreased 1 to 3 log cycles and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus counts decreased 1 to 2 cycles from d 1 to 28. The protective effect of inulin on bacteria survival and viability in the food matrix was not verified in the prebiotic SMY during storage, regardless of inulin level. Although lower post-acidification was observed in prebiotic SMY due to inulin addition, no changes were verified in short-chain   () or polyunsaturated   (PUFA). In contrast, an increase in medium- and long-chain   (MCFA and LCFA) and monounsaturated   (MUFA) was observed during storage in all SMY. The most significant levels of   in SMY were , followed by palmitic and myristic . A high positive correlation between conjugated linoleic  (CLA) and  (r=0.978) was observed. The cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer represented approximately 78% of total PUFA and 2% of total  , whereas α-linoleic  comprised about 22% PUFA and 1% of total   in SMY. The   changes during storage were associated with the metabolic activity of the starter bacteria, especially for  and cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer. Thus, the SMY represented a great source of these compounds. We observed that inulin levels did not affect  . A nonsignificant decrease in atherogenic index was observed during storage in all SMY, and a positive correlation (r=0.973) was found between atherogenic index and thrombogenic index of SMY. High correlations were observed between lauric and myristic  and saturated   (r=0.907 and r=0.894, respectively), providing evidence of their atherogenic and thrombogenic potential. A negative correlation was observed between stearic  and atherogenic index (r=-0.612) and between  and atherogenic index. Sheep milk yogurt could be characterized as a food with low atherogenic and thrombogenic risk because of its healthy lipid composition. Therefore, addition of inulin to SMY could be a good option to improve functionality of this food matrix for dairy companies wishing to enter the functional food market.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.
