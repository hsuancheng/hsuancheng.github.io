Fiber-rich diets decrease the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease () and butyrate enemas are effective as a therapy in some patients. Crohn's disease, one form of , appears to involve an exagerated T helper-1 (Th1) lymphocyte phenotype, characterised by production of interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma, that drives the inflammation. To examine whether SCFA influence pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, rat mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of  (10 mM), butyrate (1.5 mM) or propionate (2 mM) and the production of cytokines in response to concanavalin A determined. Butyrate, but not  or propionate, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production.  and propionate were able to partly prevent the inhibitory effect of butyrate on IL-2 production.  and propionate increased IFN-gamma production, whereas butyrate inhibited it.  and propionate in combination were able to prevent the inhibitory effect of butyrate on IFN-gamma production. IL-4 was not detected in any cultures.  and propionate increased IL-10 production, which was not affected by butyrate. It is concluded that butyrate significantly inhibits Th1-type responses and that this might explain the therapeutic effect of butyrate in  patients.  and propionate have less marked modulatory actions, and in some cases have effects that oppose those of butyrate. A combination of the three SCFA causes a shift in the T helper lymphocyte phenotype towards a more anti-inflammatory phenotype and this might explain the protective effects of fiber.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942135>A medicinal plant compound, capnoidine, prevents the onset of inflammation in a mouse model of colitis.</a></h2><p>The traditional uses of Corydalis dubia, Ajania nubigena and Pleurospermum amabile in the Bhutanese traditional medicine for treating disorders related to inflammatory conditions and the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of their crude extracts inspired the isolation and the investigation of anticolitic properties of four pure compounds.Three medicinal plants were collected from Himalayan Mountains of Bhutan. Capnoidine and scoulerine were isolated from C. dubia, linalool oxide  from A. nubigena and isomyristicin from P. amabile using natural product isolation protocols. Four compounds were investigated for their anti-inflammatory activities against -colitis using chemically induced (TNBS) mice model of colitis. Capnoidine conferred the best preliminary protection against TNBS-induced colitis in mice and we have conducted in-depth pharmacological investigation of this compound including clinical symptoms, pathological signs, cytokine profiles, histological structure and inflammasomes using relevant bioassay protocols.Capnoidine-treated mice had significantly: a) improved clinical symptoms (body weight loss, mobility, piloerection and faecal consistency); b) reduced colon pathology (adhesion, oedema, ulceration, and colon length); c) altered inflammatory cytokines profiles within the colons; d) reduced levels of p-IκB-α (Ser32) and p-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) and e) reduced histological inflammation in the colon when compared with mice administered TNBS only.Capnoidine presents as a potential new anti-inflammatory drug lead candidate for diseases where current standard-of-care often fails and is associated with major side effects. It also validates the traditional uses of C. dubia against inflammatory conditions and underlines the value of pursuing bioactive compounds derived from traditionally used ethnobotanical medicines.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We planned to to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis spp. in patients who applied to the same internal medicine-gastroenterology clinic with or without gastrointestinal complaints to reveal the association of this parasite with diagnosed IBS and .A total of 2334 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms composed the study group, which included 335 patients with diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease and 877 with irritable bowel syndrome. Patients without any gastrointestinal symptoms or disease (n = 192) composed the control group. Parasite presence was investigated by applying native-Lugol and formol ethyl  concentration to stool specimens, and trichrome staining method in suspicious cases.Blastocystis spp. was detected in 134 patients (5.74%) in the study group and 6 (3.12%) in the control group (p = 0.128). In the study group, Blastocystis spp. was detected at frequencies of 8.7% in ulcerative colitis (24/276), 6.78% in Crohn's disease (4/59), 5.82% in irritable bowel syndrome (51/877), and 4.9% in the remaining patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (55/1122). Blastocystis spp. was detected at a statistically significant ratio in the inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.824; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.149-6.944; p = 0.019) and ulcerative colitis (OR = 2.952; 95% CI: 1.183-7.367; p = 0.016) patients within this group compared to controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the control group and Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome patients in terms Blastocystis spp. frequency (p = 0.251, p = 0.133).Blastocystosis was more frequent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially those with ulcerative colitis. Although symptomatic irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease patients had higher rates of Blastocystis spp. infection, the differences were not significant when compared to controls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11761021>Activated platelets in ulcerative colitis enhance the production of reactive oxygen species by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.</a></h2><p>Although the number of activated platelets increases in the peripheral blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (), the role of activated platelets in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)-mediated mucosal injury in  remains unclear. In the present study, we used luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (LCL) to examine the influence of platelets from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by circulating PMN.The proportion of P-selectin-positive activated platelets was determined using flow cytometry. PMN from patients with UC and normal controls were stimulated using phorbol 12-myristate 13- with or without autologous platelets, anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody and thrombin. Indicator PMN from a normal volunteer were stimulated using heterologous platelets from UC patients and normal controls, and LCL signals were registered every 60 sec for 240 min.The proportion of activated platelets was significantly increased in  patients. The level of ROS production by PMN did not significantly differ between UC patients and normal controls in the absence of a platelet-PMN interaction. Platelets from UC patients enhanced the amount of ROS produced by indicator PMN significantly more than those from normal controls. This effect was partly diminished by anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody.Platelet activation in UC might be responsible for the secondary activation of PMN, which could account for the increase in PMN-mediated tissue injury associated with UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089249>Treatment with Trichilia catigua ethyl- fraction improves healing and reduces oxidative stress in TNBS-induced colitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Beverages containing Trichilia catigua are commonly employed in folk medicine. T. catigua bark extracts possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bactericidal properties. These properties suggest T. catigua bark extracts as a potential treatment for inflammatory bowel diseases (). Using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced model of colitis in rats we evaluated the effect of an ethyl- fraction (EAF) of T. catigua (200 mg/kg) administered by daily oral gavage or intrarectally at different time points after TNBS challenge. TNBS treatment evoked severe colonic inflammation after 24 h that persisted for 7 days, characterized by weight loss, high levels of myeloperoxidase activity, histological and macroscopic damage, and elevated index of oxidative stress in the blood. T. catigua EAF treatment prevented the oxidative stress within 24 h and enhanced tissue recovery observed at day 7, returning histological and macroscopic damage levels to that of the control group. TNBS treatment led to loss of myenteric neurons after 28 days. T. catigua EAF was unable to prevent the neuronal loss. Oral delivery of T. catigua EAF was more effective than intrarectal administration of the extract. In conclusion, T. catigua EAF treatment normalized oxidative stress parameters in blood and reduced the degree of acute inflammation in TNBS colitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Human GUT serves as the host of the majority of different bacterial populations (GUT flora, more than 500 species), which are with us ("from the beginning") in an innate manner known as the commensal (no harm to each other) and symbiotic (mutual benefit) relationship. A homeostatic balance of host-bacteria relationship is very important and vital for a normal health process. However, this beneficial relationship and delicate homeostatic state can be disrupted by the imbalance of microbiome-composition of gut microbiota, expressing a pathogenic state. A strict homeostatic balance of microbiome-composition strongly depends on several factors; 1- lifestyle, 2- geography, 3- ethnicities, 4- "mom" as prime of the type of bacterial colonization in infant and 5- the disease. With such diversity in individuals combined with huge number of different bacterial species and their interactions, it is wise to perform an in-depth systems biology (e.g. genomics, proteomics, glycomics, and etcetera) analysis of personalized microbiome. Only in this way, we are able to generate a map of complete GUT microbiota and, in turn, to determine its interaction with host and intra-interaction with pathogenic bacteria. A specific microbiome analysis provides us the knowledge to decipher the nature of interactions between the GUT microbiota and the host and its response to the invading bacteria in a pathogenic state. The GUT-bacteria composition is independent of geography and ethnicity but lifestyle well affects GUT-bacteria composition and function. Microbiome knowledge obtained by systems biology also helps us to change the behavior of GUT microbiota in response to the pathogenic microbes as protection. Functional microbiome changes in response to environmental factors will be discussed in this review.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These models comprised primary macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells isolated from C57BL/5J and interleukin-10 gene deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice and RAW 264.7, a murine macrophage-like cell line. All four kiwifruit extracts reduced the activation of these models after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, decreasing nitric oxide and cytokine secretion by both Il10(-/-) and wild-type cells. The ethyl  extracts exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity, with almost complete suppression of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage activation.

Colonic fermentation of dietary fiber produces high concentrations of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) , propionate and butyrate, a process which is important to health. The phylogenetically related 7-transmembrane (7TM) receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2) and FFA3 are activated by these SCFAs, and several lines of evidence indicate that FFA2 and FFA3 mediate beneficial effects associated with a fiber-rich diet, and that they may be of interest as targets for treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases. FFA2 is highly expressed on immune cells, in particular neutrophils, and several studies suggest that the receptor plays a role in diseases involving a dysfunctional neutrophil response, such as inflammatory bowel disease (). Both FFA2 and FFA3 have been implicated in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and in regulation of appetite. More research is however required to clarify the potential of the receptors as drug targets and establish if activation or inhibition would be the preferred mode of action. The availability of potent and selective receptor modulators is a prerequisite for these studies. The few modulators of FFA2 or FFA3 that have been published hitherto in the peer-reviewed literature in general have properties that make them less than ideal as such tools, but published patent applications indicate that better tool compounds might soon become available which should enable studies critical to validate the receptors as new drug targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17269711>Rapid and noninvasive metabonomic characterization of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases () including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have a major impact on the health of individuals and populations. Accurate diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease () at an early stage, and correct differentiation between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is important for optimum treatment and prognosis. We present here the first characterization of fecal extracts obtained from patients with CD and UC by employing a noninvasive metabonomics approach, which combines high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate pattern recognition techniques. The fecal extracts of both CD and UC patients were characterized by reduced levels of butyrate, , methylamine, and trimethylamine in comparison with a control population, suggesting changes in the gut microbial community. Also, elevated quantities of amino acids were present in the feces from both disease groups, implying malabsorption caused by the inflammatory disease or an element of protein losing enteropathy. Metabolic differences in fecal profiles were more marked in the CD group in comparison with the control group, indicating that the inflammation caused by CD is more extensive in comparison with UC and involves the whole intestine. Furthermore, glycerol resonances were a dominant feature of fecal spectra from patients with CD but were present in much lower intensity in the control and UC groups. This work illustrates the potential of metabonomics to generate novel noninvasive diagnostics for gastrointestinal diseases and may further our understanding of disease mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8488366>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated release and metabolism of arachidonic acid in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407).</a></h2><p>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a known pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () by mediating damage to the intestinal epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates that TNF-alpha potentiates release and metabolism of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid (14C-AA) in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (INT 407). Although TNF-alpha on its own was but a weak stimulator of cellular 14C-AA turnover, it significantly potentiated the release of 14C-AA and 14C-labeled prostaglandin E2(14C-PGE2) after stimulation with three known phospholipase A2 activators: phospholipase. C from Clostridium perfringens, the calcium ionophore A23187, and the phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA). The phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine significantly reduced both AA and PGE2 release after combined stimulation with phospholipase C and TNF-alpha. In contrast to its effect on the AA turnover, TNF-alpha did not affect the phospholipase C-stimulated production of platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether). Taken together, these findings indicate that a) TNF-alpha potentiates phospholipase A2-stimulated AA release from cultured intestinal epithelial cells; b) TNF-alpha may stimulate phospholipase A2-dependent AA release without affecting the formation of PAF-acether and c) pretreatment with TNF-alpha potentiates the formation of PGE2 after stimulation with phospholipase A2 activators. In summary, the present investigation points to the possibility that TNF-alpha may stimulate intestinal epithelial cells to produce biologically active AA metabolites and that this stimulation may be modulated by components of the intestinal luminal content, like bacterial toxins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459470>Effects of Carum carvi L.

Caraway fruits are used as flavoring agent in foods and beverages, and have various traditional uses in ethnomedicine. Anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, carminative and immunomodulatory properties of caraway suggest that it might exert beneficial effects on inflammatory bowel disease (). Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of caraway hydroalcoholic extract (CHE) and its essential oil (CEO) in an immunological model of colitis in rats induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Different doses of CHE (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) and CEO (100, 200, 400 μl/kg) were administered orally (p.o.) and also doses of CHE (100, 400 mg/kg) and CEO (100, 400 μl/kg) were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the separate groups of male Wistar rats (n=6). Administration of the doses started 6 h after induction of colitis and continued daily for 5 consecutive days. Wet colon weight/length ratio was measured and tissue damage scores as well as indices of colitis were evaluated both macroscopically and histopathologically. CHE and CEO at all doses tested were effective in reducing colon tissue lesions and colitis indices and the efficacy was nearly the same when different doses of plant fractions were administered p.o. or i.p. Administration of prednisolone (p.o., 4 mg/kg), Asacol® (mesalazine microgranules, p.o., 100 mg/kg) and hydrocortisone  (i.p., 20 mg/kg) as references were effective in reducing colon tissue injures as well.

Here we investigated the effect of temperature on GM adsorption to CA beads in vitro. We incubated peripheral blood with and without CA beads at 5°C, 25°C, 37°C, and 43°C and calculated the ratios of adsorbed GMs. The ratios of adsorbed GMs increased as the temperature was raised. Additionally, we measured complement activation fragment concentrations. C3a and C5a concentrations also increased as the temperature was raised, and C5a concentrations had a positive correlation with the ratios of adsorbed GMs. These results suggest that warming the column during GMA might increase GM adsorption to CA beads, thereby enhancing the clinical efficacy of GMA.© 2017 International Society for Apheresis, Japanese Society for Apheresis, and Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9824513>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3 potentiate interferon-gamma-mediated endothelin production by human monocytes: role of protein kinase C.</a></h2><p>Monocytic cells have been shown to produce endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor molecule with immune modulating properties. The signalling mechanisms involved in this response are presently unclear. Monocytes are also believed to play an important role in inflammatory bowel disease (). The objective of this study was to characterize the role of various cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and colony-stimulating factors on the production of endothelin (ET) by freshly isolated human monocytes. Compelling circumstantial evidence exists for the conditions being investigated occurring in inflamed bowel mucosa to where monocytes migrate. Whereas LPS stimulated the release of 7 pg ET/2x106 cells in 40 hr, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulated 45 pg ET/2x106 cells in 40 hr. There was an additive response when the two stimuli were employed together. Significantly the addition of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) effected a two- to threefold, dose-dependent increase in the production of ET. Production of endothelin was reproducibly blocked by the addition of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine and H7, as well as by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Assessment of the activities of the alpha and beta isoforms of conventional protein kinase C (PKC), as determined by MonoQ column fractionated calcium and lipid activatible phosphotransferase activity towards myelin basic protein (MBP) revealed an additive effect of using LPS, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, which was even greater than that demonstrated for phorbol myristate  (PMA). Additionally the secretion of ET by monocytes from Crohn's disease patients (in remission) was analysed and compared with an age-matched control group. There was no significant difference between the two. These results: (1) demonstrate an important synergistic role for GM-CSF and IL-3 in the predominantly IFN-gamma-mediated ET production by normal human monocytes; (2) indicate a possible role for the protein kinase C signalling pathway in this response; and (3) argue against a primary abnormality of ET production in peripheral monocytes from patients with Crohn's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12918132>Prevalence of amebiasis in inflammatory bowel disease in Turkey.</a></h2><p>To explore the prevalence of amebiasis in inflammatory bowel disease () in Turkey.In this study, amoeba prevalence in 160 cases of , 130 of ulcerative colitis and 30 of Crohn's disease were investigated in fresh faeces by means of wet mount+Lugol's iodine staining, modified formol ethyl  and trichrome staining methods and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of wet mount+Lugol's iodine staining, modified formol ethyl  and trichrome staining methods in the diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica)/ Entamoeba dispar (E. dispar).E. histolytica/E. dispar cysts and trophozoites were found in 14 (8.75 %) of a total of 160 cases, 13 (10.0 %) of the 130 patients with ulcerative colitis and 1 (3.3 %) of the 30 patients with Crohn's disease.

In addition to inflammation and demyelination, widespread axonal and neuronal pathologies are central components of this disease. MS therapies aim to restrain the pathological processes, enhance protective mechanisms, and prevent disease progression. The amino acid copolymer, glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone), an approved treatment for MS, has a unique mode of action. Evidence from the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and from MS patients indicates that GA affects various levels of the innate and the adaptive immune response, inducing deviation from the pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory pathways. This includes competition for the binding of antigen presenting cells, driving dendritic cells, monocytes, and B-cells towards anti-inflammatory responses, induction of Th2/3 and T-regulatory cells, and downregulating of both Th1 and Th-17 cells. The immune cells induced by GA reach the inflamed disease organ and secrete in situ anti-inflammatory cytokines alleviating the pathological processes. Furthermore, cumulative findings have revealed that in addition to its immunomodulatory activities GA promotes neuroprotective repair processes such as neurotrophic factors secretion and remyelination. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the diverse mechanism of action of GA in EAE/MS, in particular on the in situ effect of GA and its ability to generate neuroprotection and repair in the CNS. In view of its immunomodulatory activity, the beneficial effects of GA in various models of additional autoimmune related pathologies, such as immune rejection and inflammatory bowel disease (), are also presented.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

SCFA (formate, , propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune diseases. The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related diseases and chronic inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney disease and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310817>Beneficial effect of glatiramer  treatment on syndecan-1 expression in dextran sodium sulfate colitis.</a></h2><p>Syndecan-1, the most abundant heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the gastrointestinal tract, is reduced in the regenerative epithelium in inflammatory bowel disease (). This study explored the effects of the immunomodulator glatiramer  (GA; Copaxone) treatment on syndecan-1 expression in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Acute and chronic colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 2 and 1.5% DSS in tap water, respectively. GA was applied subcutaneously, 2 mg per mouse per day, starting on the day of DSS induction until the mice were sacrificed. Syndecan-1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The effect of adoptive transfer of GA-specific T cells as an organ-specific therapy also was evaluated. Syndecan-1 expression was significantly lower in both colitis groups compared with that in naive mice (p < 0.0001). GA attenuated clinical scores and pathological manifestations of colitis and led to the reinstatement of normal levels of syndecan-1. After adoptive transfer, GA-specific cells homed to the surface epithelium of the distal colon, accompanied by the augmentation of syndecan-1 staining in their vicinity. We concluded that syndecan-1 expression is reduced in DSS-induced colitis and could be a potential prognostic factor in . Treatment with GA exerts not only an anti-inflammatory effect but also a possible beneficial effect in stabilizing the intestinal epithelium barrier and tissue repair in DSS colitis. GA may be applied as a novel drug for , shifting treatment from immunosuppression toward immunomodulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889418>METABOLIC DYSBIOSIS OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND ITS BIOMARKERS.</a></h2><p>Existing methods of clustering of gut microbiota (enterotypes, clusters, gradients), as well as the term 'phylogenetic core' do not reflect its functional activity. The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, -produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease () or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. , CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and microbiota-relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20735154>New prebiotics from rice bran ameliorate inflammation in murine colitis models through the modulation of intestinal homeostasis and the mucosal immune system.</a></h2><p>Enzyme-treated rice fiber (ERF) is a recently developed prebiotic product made from rice bran by heat-resistant amylase, protease and hemicellulase treatment. Although the detailed mechanism of inflammatory bowel disease () is still unclear, the role of the resident luminal bacteria and its interaction on the mucosal barrier seem to be an important factor in the development of  and its chronicity. With the objective of manipulating the intestinal microbiota in , this study was carried out to evaluate the effects of ERF on  with using experimental colitis models.Three colitis models were used and they were induced by the oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate in male Sprague-Dawley rats or BALB/c mice and transferring CD4+ CD45RB(high) T cells to female SCID mice, sequentially their CD4+ T cells were retransferred to new SCID mice. The evaluation included the measurement of body weight, spleen weight, colon length, histological examination, serum and mucosal cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-12 p70 (IL-12p70), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4) analysis, mucosal serotonin (5HT), and organic acid production and a microbiota analysis of the cecal contents. The characteristics of T cell surface markers including CD4, CD69, CD45RB of spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were also analyzed. In addition, the effects of ERF on the change in the induction of dendritic cells (DCs) were evaluated.The preventive effect of ERF on colitis was significantly superior to that of raw material rice bran or control group. An overexpression of inflammatory cytokine production was attenuated by ERF treatment, which was accompanied with a decrease in both the colonic mucosal damage and 5HT production. Furthermore, ERF significantly attenuated the T cell activation (CD4+CD69+) of spleen and MLN, and this characteristic was inherited by the retransferred mice. ERF significantly suppressed the growth of Clostiridium, and increased short-chain fatty acids (, propionate and butyrate) content in colitis. The relatively hydrophilic fraction of ERF (ethanol-methanol soluble fraction) is therefore considered to have a potent ability to attenuate the induction of DCs.A new prebiotic, ERF, reduced inflammation by modulating the colonic environment and regulating immune cell differentiation.

We performed a retrospective analysis with the aim of evaluating the adequacy of the prerequisites for arriving at an accurate histological diagnosis.The following parameters were considered as prerequisites for a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease: clinical and endoscopic data; proper sampling and handling of biopsies; and elementary microscopic lesions. We collected 345 cases from 13 centres.The date of onset and treatment were available for 13% and 16% of the cases, respectively. Endoscopy information was accessible for 77% of the cases. Endoscopic mapping was completed in 13% of the cases. In no cases were the biopsies oriented on  strips. The diagnosis was conclusive in 47% of the cases. Activity, epithelial disruption and crypt distortion were described in 35% of the reports with a conclusive diagnosis.Our study showed that the diagnostic prerequisites were widely unfulfilled, although approximately half of the diagnoses were conclusive for inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, in our assessment of clinical practice: (1) clinicians seldom provide suitable clinical and/or endoscopic information for a histological diagnosis and (2) histopathological diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease are often not supported by morphology.Copyright © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

However, the effect of alpinetin on inflammatory bowel disease () has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of alpinetin on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. In vivo, DSS-induced mice colitis model was established by giving mice drinking water containing 5% (w/v) DSS for 7 days. Alpinetin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) were administered once a day by intraperitoneal injection 3 days before DSS treatment. In vitro, phorbol myristate  (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 macrophages were treated with alpinetin and stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results showed that alpinetin significantly attenuated diarrhea, colonic shortening, histological injury, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β) production in mice. In vitro, alpinetin markedly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β production, as well as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that alpinetin had protective effects on DSS-induced colitis and may be a promising therapeutic reagent for colitis treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15942713>Butyrate blocks interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 release in human intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts.</a></h2><p>Interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10 is a chemoattractant for CXCR 3-expressing T lymphocytes and monocytes. IP-10 has been reported to mediate chronic inflammation such as that in inflammatory bowel disease (). However, the local secretion of IP-10 in the intestine remains unclear. In this study, we investigated IP-10 secretion in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs).IP-10 secretion was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and IP-10 mRNA expression was evaluated by Northern blotting.Interleukin (IL)-10 mRNA was not detected in unstimulated SEMFs. Interferon (IFN)-gamma strongly induced IP-10 mRNA expression. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha also stimulated IP-10 mRNA expression, but this was much weaker than that induced by IFN-gamma. The effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were detected in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These responses were also observed at the protein levels. The IFN-gamma-induced IP-10 secretion was not affected by  or propionate, but was significantly reduced by butyrate. Trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, also blocked the IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha-induced IP-10 mRNA expression, but the effects of trichostatin A were weaker than those of butyrate. The inhibitory effect of butyrate on IFN-gamma-induced IP-10 release was not associated with STAT (signaling transducer and activator of transcription)-1alpha activation.We demonstrated that human colonic SEMFs are the local site for the secretion IP-10.

The potential for release of oxygen radicals from mucosal macrophages in  was measured and whether a difference exists between newly arrived (CD14+L1+) monocyte-like cells and resident macrophages (CD14(-)L1-), without or with additional priming in vitro, was investigated. Lamina propria mononuclear cells from six patients with  and five with a normal intestine were isolated with an ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid/collagenase/dispase technique and cultured for three days. The cells were tested with or without interferon gamma (200 U/ml) priming in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) for the last 48 hours in cultures. Samples from inflamed  mucosa depleted of CD14+ cells by immunomagnetic beads were compared with their undepleted counterparts and with samples from virtually normal mucosa from the same patients. The production of oxygen radicals was measured as the amount of reduced cytochrome C 2.5 hours after triggering with phorbol 12-myristate 13-. The oxygen radical production in macrophages from moderately or severely inflamed mucosa was reduced by median 69% (range 22%-79%, p < 0.027) after depletion of CD14+ cells, reaching a level similar to that found for virtually normal samples from the same  patients. Furthermore, this production did not increase significantly in mucosal macrophages from normal reference mucosa and from virtually normal or inflamed  mucosa after priming with interferon gamma with or without addition of lipopolysaccharide. Upregulation of a respiratory burst in subepithelial resident macrophages os not a likely pathogenetic step in .

Microbicide activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis and Candida albicans was determined by means of 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction and absorbance read by ELISA. Flow cytometry analysis evaluated phagocytosis (zymosan particles and microrganisms) and oxidative burst by dihidrorhodamine oxidation before and after stimulation with phorbol myristate  (PMA). The supernatant of PBMC cultures under TLR or microbial stimuli and of neutrophil cultures under PMA, LPS or microbial stimuli were used for determination of cytokine production by ELISA.We found no significant differences between the BD patient groups and control groups with regard to oxidative burst, phagocytic activity, microbicide activity or cytokine production. However, the cells from patients with severe BD (based on clinical manifestation) exhibit significantly higher oxidative burst activity, both before and after PMA stimulation, compared to cells from patients with mild BD. Furthermore, we found significant correlations between the BD patients' scores on the simplified Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form adapted for Portuguese (BR-BDCAFs) and Streptococcus sanguinis-stimulated production of IL23 by PBMC and IL8 by neutrophils, and between BR-BDCAFs score and constitutive production of TNF-α, IFNγ, IL6 and IL23 by PBMC.Patients with severe active BD do exhibit phagocytic dysfunction and some evidence of constitutive activation regarding oxidative burst and cytokine production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23046370>Production of interleukin-10 by combining a granulocyte and monocyte adsorption carrier with ulinastatin.</a></h2><p>Interleukin (IL)-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine mainly produced by monocytes and is essential for the induction of anti-inflammatory intestinal macrophages with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Thus, IL-10- and M-CSF-rich conditions in colonic tissues seem to contribute to the improvement of pathological conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (). We have already reported that ulinastatin, a serine protease inhibitor, increases M-CSF production during granulocyte/monocyte (GM) adsorption to cellulose  (CA) beads (carriers for Adacolumn therapy). However, the effects of ulinastatin on IL-10 production have not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effects of ulinastatin on IL-10 production during GM adsorption by in vitro experiments. Peripheral blood was divided into four groups: (Control) no ulinastatin added, no contact with CA beads; (1) no ulinastatin added, contact with CA beads; (2) ulinastatin added, no contact with CA beads; and (3) ulinastatin added, contact with CA beads. After incubation, IL-10 in the plasma was measured. Compared with the level in the Control group, plasma IL-10 was significantly higher only in group 3, in which ulinastatin was added in the presence of CA beads, but did not increase in the absence of CA beads. These results suggest that ulinastatin synergistically increases IL-10 production with monocyte adsorption stimuli. By increasing not only M-CSF but also IL-10, a combination of ulinastatin and Adacolumn therapy may improve clinical efficacy for the treatment of  in terms of the induction of anti-inflammatory intestinal macrophages.© 2012 The Authors.

Here, we investigated the impact of the ethyl  (EtOAc) and ethanol (EtOH) extracts of P. oleracea on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 expression in RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition, the inhibitory effects of these extracts and fractions on 3% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis were examined using an ICR mouse model. DSS-induced colitis, including body weight loss, reduced colon length, and histological colon injury, was significantly ameliorated in mice fed the P. oleracea extracts (200 and 500mg/kg). In particular, P. oleracea extracts also inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, and 1L-1β) production in mice with DSS-induced colitis; the P. oleracea extracts displayed higher and/or similar inhibitory activity to sulfasalazine at high concentrations. Furthermore, the chemical structures of active compounds separated from the EtOAc extract of P. oleracea were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see Figure in supplementary materials), resulting in the identification of three known compounds. Among these active compounds, cis-N-feruloyl-3'-methoxytyramine (2) exhibited the strongest effects on preventing DSS-induced  in animal models.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) induces an immune response that facilitates graft acceptance, but if clinically apparent as acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), it may adversely affect transplantation outcomes. TH17 cells are involved in the inflammatory processes associated with several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease () as a prototype. In this study we investigated the presence of IL-17-producing cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients after HSCT. The 48 patients of median age 45 years (range, 1.0-64 years), experienced hematologic malignancies (n=45) or nonmalignant disorders (n=3), treated with matched unrelated (n=24) or sibling (n=24) transplants. We examined IL-17-producing cells in alloreactive reactions after HSCT. PBMC were stimulated with BD Leukocyte Activation Cocktail (Ionomycin, Brefeldin A, and phorbol myristic  (PMA)) in the presence of BD GolgiStop. After stimulation the cells were labeled with anti-CD4 and intracellular anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies. IL-17+ cell proportions were analyzed in the CD4+ lymphocyte gate. We observed that patients at the time of hematologic reconstitution had higher proportions of IL-17-producing cells than healthy control subjects (0.73±0.13 vs 0.19±0.06%; P=.019). Fourteen patients displayed the first symptoms of aGvHD at the time of hematologic reconstitution, when they showed lower proportions of IL-17+ cells among CD4+ lymphocytes than their counterparts lacking aGvHD at a similar time after transplantation (0.29±0.09 vs 0.73±0.13%; P=.024).

GA has been shown to ameliorate colitis in several experimental models when administered by daily injection. The present study aimed to explore the effect of TV-5010 in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease () and the possibility for its administration in tapered frequency. As demonstrated here, TV-5010 ameliorated the various pathological manifestations of Dextran (DSS)-induced colitis, i.e. weight loss, intestinal bleeding and diarrhea, resulting in substantial reduction of disease activity, colonic damage and mortality. In contrast to GA, which was more effective when administered daily by injection of 2.0 mg/mouse, TV-5010 was most effective when administered once a week, at dose of 0.2-1.0 mg/mouse. TV-5010 treatment abrogated the characteristic inflammation in the diseased organ as demonstrated by reduction in the colonic mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, as well as by augmentation of the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta. Injection of naive mice with TV-5010 generated lymphocyte population of the Th2/3 subtype that effectively reduced disease manifestations upon adoptive transfer to mice with DSS-colitis. Moreover, TV-5010-specific T-cells, either exogenously labeled or genetically marked, adoptively transferred to colitis-induced mice, localized in the inner layers of the injured colon and expressed TGF-beta in situ. Thus, TV-5010 is effective in the suppression of experimental colitis similarly to GA, with the advantage of less frequent administration, possibly via immunomodulation at the site of pathological damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9854080>Novel intestinal Helicobacter species isolated from cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) with chronic colitis.</a></h2><p>A disease similar to ulcerative colitis in humans has been identified in cotton-top tamarins (CTTs) in captivity.

The amino acid copolymer glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone) is an approved first-line treatment for MS that has a unique mode of action. Accumulated evidence from EAE-induced animals and from MS patients indicates that GA affects various levels of the innate and the adaptive immune response, generating deviation from the pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory pathway. This review aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the diverse mechanism of action of GA in EAE/MS, in particular on the in situ immunomodulatory effect of GA and its ability to generate neuroprotective repair consequences in the CNS. In view of its immunomodulatory activity, the beneficial effect of GA in various models of other autoimmune related pathologies, such as immune rejection and inflammatory bowel disease () is noteworthy.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that a physical interaction between transcription factor FOXP3 and the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is essential for gene co-repressive function.Human FOXP3 mutations clinically relevant to intestinal inflammation were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. T lymphocytes were isolated from mice, human blood, and lamina propria of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and non-CD controls. We performed proximity ligation or a co-immunoprecipitation assay in FOXP3-mutant, interleukin 6 (IL6)-treated or CD-CD4 T cells to assess FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction. We studied  promoter activity and chromatin state of the interferon γ locus via luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, in cells expressing FOXP3 mutants.EZH2 binding was abrogated by inflammatory bowel disease-associated FOXP3 cysteine 232 (C232) mutation. The C232 mutant showed impaired repression of  and diminished EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 on interferon γ, indicative of compromised Treg physiologic function. Generalizing this mechanism, IL6 impaired FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. IL6-induced effects were reversed by Janus kinase 1/2 inhibition. In lamina propria-derived CD4T cells from CD patients, we observed decreased FOXP3-EZH2 interaction.FOXP3-C232 mutation disrupts EZH2 recruitment and gene co-repressive function. The proinflammatory cytokine IL6 abrogates FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. Studies in lesion-derived CD4 T cells have shown that reduced FOXP3-EZH2 interaction is a molecular feature of CD patients. Destabilized FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction via diverse mechanisms and consequent Treg abnormality may drive gastrointestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796801>Biologic therapies: lessons from multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>New evidence points to a possible association of multiple sclerosis (MS) with . Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Paradoxically, administration of anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies to  patients has led to exacerbation of MS or triggered demyelination. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) mediates demyelination and TNFR2 mediates remyelination, suggesting that a more selective approach to TNF antagonism may be required for an anti-TNF strategy to be effective in MS. Conversely, interferon treatment for MS may worsen . Anti-lymphocyte trafficking strategies such as alpha4 integrin blockers are effective in both these diseases. Recent advances in small molecule development in this area may provide further effective therapies. Common inflammatory cytokine and signaling pathways may be shared between MS and , such as TNF, interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-17, CD40 and STAT3. However, in contrast to Crohn's disease, ustekinumab has not shown efficacy in MS. Vitamin D deficiency is a hot topic in both diseases. Several drugs developed for MS, e.g. glatiramer , are also being studied in IBDs. As in rheumatoid arthritis, MS also serves as an example of a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease where disease modification is the goal of treatment based on objective evidence derived from imaging, in turn providing examples of how to conduct  studies in future.Copyright © 2012 S.

Chronic intestinal inflammation predisposes to colon cancer development, but effects of female hormones on colitis-associated cancer development have not been examined.To investigate the role of female hormones in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-azoxymethane (AOM) mouse model for colitis-associated cancer.We performed ovariectomies, or sham operations, on mice, and supplemented these animals with indicated hormones. Additionally, we used oestrogen receptor α or β (Erα or Erβ) mutant mice. To study colitis or colitis-associated cancer, we used DSS only, or DSS and AOM, respectively.Ovariectomy protects female mice against colitis-associated tumour development. Hormone replacement in ovariectomised mice with either oestradiol (E2), medroxyprogesterone  or a combination of both suggests that oestrogens are the ovary-derived factor that promotes tumour development in the context of inflammatory damage. E2-treated animals showed increased clinical symptoms and Il-6 production upon DSS-induced colitis and enhanced epithelial proliferation. Treatment with E2 markedly increased the numbers of polyps in ovariectomised mice and also strongly promoted tumour progression with all E2-treated animals developing at least one invasive adenocarcinoma, whereas, placebo-treated animals developed adenomas only. Using Er mutant mice, we find that the protumorigenic effect of oestrogen depends on both Erα and Erβ.Our results suggest that oestrogens promote inflammation-associated cancer development by impairing the mucosal response to inflammatory damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22731715>Microbial butyrate and its role for barrier function in the gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Butyrate production in the large intestine and ruminant forestomach depends on bacterial butyryl-CoA/-CoA transferase activity and is highest when fermentable fiber and nonstructural carbohydrates are balanced. Gastrointestinal epithelia seem to use butyrate and butyrate-induced endocrine signals to adapt proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation to the growth of the bacterial community. Butyrate has a potential clinical application in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (; ulcerative colitis).

Aetiology is due to underlying uterine pathologies, coagulopathy, ovulation dysfunction, or iatrogenic. Up to 20% of women with HMB will have an underlying inherited bleeding disorder (). Assessment of HMB should entail a menstrual and gynaecological history and a bleeding score to distinguish those women who require additional haematological investigations. A pelvic examination and ultrasound scan help to rule out presence of any underlying pathology. Management depends on the underlying cause and the woman's preference and her fertility wishes. Medical therapies include hormonal treatments; levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and combined hormonal contraceptives are most commonly used. Ulipristal  is an approved preoperative treatment for uterine fibroids, and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing MBL. Haemostatic therapies include tranexamic acid and DDAVP (1-deamino-8-D-arginine). DDAVP is used for HMB associated with certain IBDs. These therapies can be used in isolation or in combination with hormonal treatments. HMB associated with certain severe IBDs may require factor concentrate administration during menses to alleviate symptoms. Endometrial ablation is a minor surgical procedure that is associated with low operative morbidity and can be performed as an outpatient. Hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment of choice when medical therapies have failed and endometrial ablation is not suitable.Crown Copyright © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In an attempt to down-regulate colitis, we investigated the effect of the immunomodulator glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone, copolymer 1) on two murine models of , chemically induced and spontaneous. Acute experimental colitis of different levels of severity was induced in C57BL/6 mice by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administered orally at different concentrations and frequencies. It was manifested in weight loss, intestinal bleeding, and diarrhea, as well as by macroscopic and microscopic colon damage. GA treatment led to amelioration of all of these pathological manifestations, resulting in improved long-term survival. Moreover, even when colitis was induced by three cycles of DSS in this highly susceptible mouse strain, as well as in BALB/c mice that exhibit a chronic disease pattern, a substantial reduction in disease activity and mortality was obtained. GA treatment induced a beneficial effect also in a spontaneous model of colitis developed in the C3H/HeJBir IL-10-deficient mice. The detrimental proinflammatory response manifested by proliferation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma expression was modulated by GA, whereas the regulatory anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10 cytokines response was elevated. This was demonstrated on the level of protein secretion in splenocytes and local mesenteric lymphocytes in response to syngeneic colon extract and in the overall response to anti-CD3, as well as on the level of mRNA expression in the colon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15973592>CBP-1011.

Fertility is normal in women with nonsurgically treated ulcerative colitis and similar or slightly reduced in women with Crohn's disease. Women who undergo ileal pouch anastomosis have reduced fertility. Fertility is likely worsened by disease activity but unaffected by medications used to treat . Infertile patients with  respond as well as non- patients to in vitro fertilization (IVF). Despite normal fertility, patients with  have fewer children due to concerns regarding infertility, disease inheritance, congenital abnormalities, and disease-related sexual dysfunction. Patients rarely discuss these issues with a physician. When discussion does occur, it may lead to changes in decision-making. Contraceptives are an important part of family planning, particularly during times of high disease activity. All forms of contraceptives are acceptable in patients with , although there are specific considerations. The risks of combined oral contraceptives outweigh the benefits in patients with active disease and patients with prior or high risk for thromboembolism. Oral contraceptives and  are independently associated with an increased risk for thromboembolism, although it is not known whether this effect is compounding. Depot medroxyprogesterone  injection should be avoided in patients with or at risk for osteopenia. Intrauterine devices and implants are the most effective form of contraception and should be a first-line recommendation.

Several studies have reported that  is associated with impairment in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, mainly , propionate, and butyrate. They are produced in the large bowel by anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates and fiber polysaccharides, with butyrate being considered as the major fuel source for colonocytes. These SCFAs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic approaches that increase colonic SCFA production, as it can be achieved by administration of dietary fiber to  patients. Unfortunately, there is quite limited documentation of efficacy of dietary fiber in properly designed trials.

We hypothesized that early life colonic inflammation causes susceptibility to aggravated overexpression of interleukin (IL)1β.We developed a 2-hit rat model in which neonatal inflammation (NI) and adult inflammation (AI) were induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid.Aggravated immune responses were observed in NI + AI rats, including a sustained up-regulation of IL1β and other cytokines. In parallel with exacerbated loss of inhibitor of kappa B alpha expression, NI + AI rats showed hyperacetylation of histone H4K12 and increased V-Rel Avian Reticuloendotheliosis Viral Oncogene Homolog A binding on the  promoter, accompanied by high levels of norepinephrine/epinephrine. Propranolol, a β-blocker, markedly ameliorated the inflammatory response and IL1β overexpression by mitigating against epigenetic modifications. Adrenalectomy abrogated NI-induced disease susceptibility whereas yohimbine sensitized the epithelium for exacerbated immune response. The macrophages of NI rats produced more IL1β than controls after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting hypersensitization; incubation with LPS plus Foradil (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a β2-agonist, induced a greater IL1β expression than LPS alone. Epinephrine and Foradil also exacerbated LPS-induced IL1β activation in human THP-1-derived macrophages, by increasing acetylated H4K12, and these increases were abrogated by propranolol.NI sensitizes the colon epithelium for exacerbated IL1β activation by increasing stress hormones that induce histone hyperacetylation, allowing greater access of nuclear factor-κB to the  promoter and rendering the host susceptible to aggravated immune responses. Our findings suggest that β blockers have a therapeutic potential for inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility and establish a novel paradigm whereby NI induces epigenetic susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460743>Aqueous chromatography system using pH- and temperature-responsive stationary phase with ion-exchange groups.</a></h2><p>We report on the development of a novel analytical HPLC technique of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen, with an isocratic aqueous mobile phase.

GMP is a putative prebiotic based on extensive glycosylation with sialic acid, galactose, and galactosamine. Our objective was to determine the prebiotic properties of GMP by characterizing cecal and fecal microbiota populations, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and immune responses. Weanling PKU (Pah(enu2)) and wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice were fed isoenergetic AA, GMP, or casein diets for 8 wk. The cecal content and feces were collected for microbial DNA extraction to perform 16S microbiota analysis by Ion Torrent PGM sequencing. SCFA were determined by gas chromatography, plasma cytokines via a Bio-Plex Pro assay, and splenocyte T cell populations by flow cytometry. Changes in cecal and fecal microbiota are primarily diet dependent. The GMP diet resulted in a reduction from 30-35 to 7% in Proteobacteria, genera Desulfovibrio, in both WT and PKU mice with genotype-dependent changes in Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes. Cecal concentrations of the SCFA , propionate, and butyrate were increased with GMP. The percentage of stimulated spleen cells producing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was significantly reduced in mice fed GMP compared with casein. In summary, plasma concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-2 were reduced in mice fed GMP. GMP is a prebiotic based on reduction in Desulfovibrio, increased SCFA, and lower indexes of inflammation compared with casein and AA diets in mice.

Cytokine expression from unstimulated lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) was compared by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemistry of mucosal biopsies was performed. Cell populations were quantified by morphometry.CVID/ PB T cells stimulated by anti-CD3+CD28 had trends for reduced IL-2, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α compared to controls. These differences were not apparent following stimulation by PHA/PMA. Constitutive production of inflammatory cytokines by LPLs was not detected. Histologically, CVID patients had reduced/absent plasma cells with reductions in intestinal IgM and IgA. CVID patients with and without gastrointestinal (GI) disease exhibited increased CD3+ T cells, specifically CD8+, in the colon compared to normal and  controls, suggesting immune dysregulation.Intestinal inflammation in CVID patients with -like disease may be mediated by abnormal cytokine production through a T-cell receptor-mediated pathway. However, the variability observed suggests multiple, rather than singular, mechanisms are involved. Histologic features such as reduced intestinal plasma cells and lack of intestinal immunoglobulins may be useful markers in diagnosing CVID in a patient with GI disease refractory to conventional therapies.Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28761822>Optimization of Chitosan and Cellulose  Phthalate Controlled Delivery of Methylprednisolone for Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p> Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic, relapsing and often life-long disorder.

Thus, we hypothesized that the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, is important in the maintenance and regulation of the barrier function of the colonic epithelium.Confluent monolayers of the human colon-derived T84 or HT-29 epithelial cell lines were exposed to dinitrophenol (DNP (0.1 mM), uncouples oxidative phosphorylation) + Escherichia coli (strain HB101, 10(6) cfu) +/- butyrate (3-50 mM). Transepithelial resistance (TER), and bacterial internalization and translocation were assessed over a 24-hour period. Epithelial ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy.Epithelia under metabolic stress display decreased TER and increased numbers of pseudopodia that is consistent with increased internalization and translocation of the E. coli. Butyrate (but not ) significantly reduced the bacterial translocation across DNP-treated epithelia but did not ameliorate the drop in TER in the DNP+E. coli exposed monolayers. Inhibition of bacterial transcytosis across metabolically stressed epithelia was associated with reduced I-kappaB phosphorylation and hence NF-kappaB activation.Reduced butyrate-producing bacteria could result in increased epithelial permeability particularly in the context of concomitant exposure to another stimulus that reduces mitochondria function.

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is increasingly considered to be causatively related to  and is strongly affected by components of a Western life style. Bacteria that ferment fibers and produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are typically reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with , as compared to healthy individuals. SCFAs, such as , propionate and butyrate, are important metabolites in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Several studies have indeed shown that fecal SCFAs levels are reduced in active . SCFAs are an important fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and are known to strengthen the gut barrier function. Recent findings, however, show that SCFAs, and in particular butyrate, also have important immunomodulatory functions. Absorption of SCFAs is facilitated by substrate transporters like MCT1 and SMCT1 to promote cellular metabolism. Moreover, SCFAs may signal through cell surface G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), like GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, to activate signaling cascades that control immune functions. Transgenic mouse models support the key role of these GPCRs in controlling intestinal inflammation.

There is evidence for a key role of the interleukin-12beta1/23 receptor (IL-12 Rbeta1/23 R) pathway in , and that reduction of the normal expression of the IL-23 R gene may provide a therapeutic target for this disease. The binding of interleukin-23 (IL-23) to its receptor IL-23 R regulates a newly defined effector T-cell subset, Th17 cells, characterised by the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and other cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In this study we developed an assay that measured IL-17 and TNF-alpha expression after incubation with specific dietary bioactives in the human T-cell Kit 225. It is anticipated that these changes will reflect differences in IL-23 R production, albeit indirectly. The cell line Kit 225 has similarities to Th17 cells, a subset of T cells producing IL-17 and TNF-alpha, and in initial experiments we demonstrated that the cells express both IL-23 receptor subunits, as well as IL-17 and TNF-alpha genes. Upon verification that stimulation of Kit 225 cells with 1ng/mL IL-23 significantly upregulated IL-17 and TNF-alpha gene expression, and IL-17 production, we supplemented cells with selected food bioactives, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and linoleic acid (LA), and with phorbol myristate  (PMA) and sodium salicylate, used as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory controls, respectively. In both unstimulated cells and after IL-23 stimulation, bioactives modulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in , underlining the possible role of foods in this disease. EGCG and DHA, which significantly inhibited both IL-17 and TNF-alpha expression, appeared particularly interesting.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The gut milieu represents the largest mucosal surface exposed to microorganisms with 10(10-12) colony forming bacteria/g of colonic content. Approximately, one third of fecal dry matter is made of bacteria/ bacterial components. Indeed, the normal gut microbiota is responsible for healthy digestion of dietary fibers (polysaccharides) and fermentation of short chain fatty acids such as  and butyrate that provide carbon sources (fuel) for these bacteria. Inflammatory bowel disease () results in breakage of the mucosal barrier, an altered microbiota and dysregulated gut immunity. Prodrugs that are chemically constructed to target colonic release or are degraded specifically by colonic bacteria, can be useful in the treatment of . This review describes the progress in digestive tract prodrug design and delivery in light of gut metabolic activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17719654>The therapeutic effect of glatiramer  in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease is mediated by anti-inflammatory T-cells.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex multifactorial immunological disorders characterized by dysregulated immune reactivity in the gut and imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactivity. The therapeutic effect of the immunomodulatory drug glatiramer  (GA, Copaxone, copolymer 1) has been established in several  models, including trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, as well as in a spontaneous colitis model. In the present study we investigated the mechanism of action of GA and cells specifically induced by it. Immunization of naive mice by GA, generated a lymphocyte population of the Th2/3 subtype, that drastically reduced disease manifestations upon their adoptive transfer to mice with DSS colitis. This was demonstrated by the substantial decrease in weight loss, intestinal bleeding and diarrhea, as well as by the prevention of macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage. In contrast, adoptive transfer of control lysozyme-specific cells did not induce any beneficial effect on the disease. Moreover, GA-specific short-term T-cell lines, either exogenously labeled or genetically marked, adoptively transferred by the intraperitoneal route to colitis-induced mice, localized in the inner layers of the colon and secreted in situ the regulatory cytokine TGF-beta. These results demonstrate the accumulation of GA-specific Th2/3 cells secreting regulatory cytokines in the injured colon, and thus draw a direct linkage between the therapeutic effect of GA in  and an immunomodulatory effect at the site in which the pathological process occurs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537052>Treatment with a Urokinase Receptor-derived Cyclized Peptide Improves Experimental Colitis by Preventing Monocyte Recruitment and Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte migration across the blood barrier and into tissues represents a key process in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. The urokinase receptor (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) is a master regulator of leukocyte recruitment. We recently found that cyclization of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-derived peptide Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr [SRSRY] inhibits transendothelial migration of monocytes. Now, we have explored the effects of [SRSRY] administration during experimental colitis.The effects of [SRSRY] on cytokine profile, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration were investigated using phorbol-12-myristate -differentiated THP-1 cells exposed to polarizing stimuli. In vivo, [SRSRY] was intraperitoneally administered during dextran sodium sulfate- or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis in wild-type or urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor knockout mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory monocytes in mucosal infiltrates were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, respectively.[SRSRY] prevents M0 to M1 transition and migration of M1 polarized macrophages. In vivo, [SRSRY] reduces intestinal inflammation diminishing body weight loss and disease activity index. These beneficial effects are accompanied by a reduction of interleukin 1β, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α, an increase of interleukin 10, and an abridged recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the inflamed tissue.Altogether, these findings indicate that [SRSRY] may be considered as a new drug useful for the pharmacological treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152591>Effects of kiwifruit extracts on colonic gene and protein expression levels in IL-10 gene-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a collective term for conditions characterised by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract involving an inappropriate immune response to commensal micro-organisms in a genetically susceptible host. Previously, aqueous and ethyl  extracts of gold kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) or green kiwifruit (A. deliciosa) have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro models of . The present study examined whether these kiwifruit extracts (KFE) had immune-modulating effects in vivo against inflammatory processes that are known to be increased in patients with . KFE were used as a dietary intervention in IL-10-gene-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice (an in vivo model of ) and the C57BL/6J background strain in a 3 × 2 factorial design. While all Il10(-/-) mice developed significant colonic inflammation compared with C57BL/6J mice, this was not affected by the inclusion of KFE in the diet. These findings are in direct contrast to our previous study where KFE reduced inflammatory signalling in primary cells isolated from Il10(-/-) and C57BL/6J mice. Whole-genome gene and protein expression level profiling indicated that KFE influenced immune signalling pathways and metabolic processes within the colonic tissue; however, the effects were subtle. In particular, expression levels across gene sets related to adaptive immune pathways were significantly reduced using three of the four KFE in C57BL/6J mice. The present study highlights the importance of investigating food components identified by cell-based assays with appropriate in vivo models before making dietary recommendations, as a food that looks promising in vitro may not be effective in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363687>Comparative Study of Berberis vulgaris Fruit Extract and Berberine Chloride Effects on Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects of anthocyanins are abundant in berberry fruits suggesting that they may have beneficial effects on inflammatory bowel diseases (). The present study was carried out to investigate the anti-colitic effect of Berberis vulgaris fruit extract (BFE) compared to berberine chloride (BEC) and corticosteroids using an animal model of acetic acid induced experimental colitis. BFE with three different doses (375, 750, and 1500 mg/Kg) was administered orally or rectally prior to ulcer induction. BEC (10 mg/Kg), prednisolone (5 mg/Kg), hydrocortisone  enema (20 mg/Kg) and normal saline (5 mL/Kg) were considered as respective controls. The tissue was assessed macroscopically for damage scores, area, index and weight/length ratio. They were also examined histopathologically for inflammation extent and severity, crypt damage, invasion involvement and total colitis index. Results indicated that greater doses of oral BFE (750, 1500 mg/Kg) as well as BEC (10 mg/Kg) were effective to protect against colonic damage. By rectal pretreatment, the extract was only effective to diminish the ulcer index and the efficacy was not significant for mucosal inflammation parameters. In conclusion BFE, which is nearly devoid of berberine, was effective to protect against colitis and this might be attributed to its anthocyanin constituents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26458966>Preventive rather than therapeutic treatment with high fiber diet attenuates clinical and inflammatory markers of acute and chronic DSS-induced colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory disorders with important impact on global health. Prebiotic and probiotic strategies are thought to be useful in the context of experimental . Here, we compared the effects of preventive versus therapeutic treatment with a high fiber diet (prebiotic) in combination or not with Bifidobacterium longum (probiotic) in a murine model of chronic colitis.Colitis was induced by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to drinking water for 6 days (acute colitis) or for 5 cycles of DSS (chronic colitis).Administration of the high fiber diet protected from acute colitis. Protection was optimal when diet was started 20 days prior to DSS. A 5-day pretreatment with , a short-chain fatty acid, provided partial protection against acute colitis. In chronic colitis, pretreatment with the high fiber diet attenuated clinical and inflammatory parameters of disease. However, when the treatment with the high fiber diet started after disease had been established, overall protection was minimal. Similarly, delayed treatment with  or B. longum did not provide any protection even when the probiotic was associated with the high fiber diet.Preventive use of a high fiber diet or  clearly protects mice against acute and chronic damage induced by DSS in mice. However, protection is lost when therapies are initiated after disease has been established. These results suggest that any therapy aimed at modifying the gut environment (e.g., prebiotic or probiotic strategies) should be given early in the course of disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20110898>Luteolin isolated from the flowers of Lonicera japonica suppresses inflammatory mediator release by blocking NF-kappaB and MAPKs activation pathways in HMC-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Luteolin (3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxylflavone) is a plant flavonoid and pharmacologically active agent that has been isolated from several plant species. In the present study, the effect of luteolin from the flowers of Lonicera japonica on phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) plus A23187-induced mast cell activation was examined. Luteolin significantly inhibited the induction of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by PMA plus A23187. Moreover, luteolin attenuated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and intracellular Ca2+ levels. In activated HMC-1 cells, the phosphorylation of extra-signal response kinase (ERK 1/2) and c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK 1/2), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) were decreased by treatment of the cells with luteolin. Luteolin inhibited PMA plus A23187-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, IkappaB degradation, and luciferase activity. Furthermore, luteolin suppressed the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-6, GM-CSF, and COX-2 through a decrease in the intracellular Ca2+ levels, and also showed a suppression of the ERK 1/2, JNK 1/2, and NF-kappaB activation.

Abelmoschus manihot (AM) extracted from Flos Abelmoschus manihot that has been applied for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we showed that AM significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. AM modified gut microbiota composition, increased microbial diversity, and in particularly, elevated the abundance of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing gut microbiota in colitic mice. Consequently, levels of SCFAs especially butyrate and  were increased upon AM treatment, which, primarily through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) pathway, led to the enhanced Treg generation and the suppressed Th17 development. Together, we herein provide the first evidences to support that AM, a natural plant-derived complex, can potentially reset gut microbiome and metabolism, resume immune and tissue homeostasis, and hence prevent colitis, which may provide a new perspective on  pathogenesis and suggest a novel microbiota-targeting therapy for inflammatory gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Reduction of TNF-α should improve  pathology. GM adsorptive apheresis (GMA) is an effective therapy for inflammatory disorders including . GM adsorption to cellulose  (CA) beads induces anti-inflammatory cytokine release, although these effects on TNF-α release are not clarified. We hypothesized that GMA may inhibit TNF-α release. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effects of GM adsorption to CA beads on TNF-α release in vitro. Peripheral blood was incubated with and without CA beads and TNF-α was measured. For comparison, TNF-α was measured in another lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-containing peripheral blood sample incubated similarly. The amount of TNF-α in blood samples incubated with CA beads was significantly higher than in those incubated without beads, although it was significantly lower than TNF-α incubated with LPS-containing sample without beads. The amount of TNF-α after incubation with CA beads positively correlated with GM adsorption ratio. GM adsorption to CA beads induced a small amount of TNF-α release. This is the first report on TNF-α release induced via GM adsorption stimuli. The biological effects of TNF-α release during GM adsorption need to be clarified.© 2014 The Authors.

Analysis of fecal samples from untreated amebic liver abscess (ALA) patients, Entamoeba histolytica (Eh)-negative and -positive asymptomatic individuals, and pus samples from naive ALA patients revealed a significant reduction in Lactobacillus in asymptomatic individuals (Eh +ve) and ALA patients. Two anaerobic genera, namely Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus, were detected in naive ALA pus samples. Analysis of fecal samples from amoebic colitis patients showed a significant decline in population of Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides and leptum subgroup, Lactobacillus, Campylobacter, and Eubacterium, whereas a significant increase in Bifidobacterium was observed. Mucosa-associated bacterial flora analysis from  patients and healthy controls revealed a significant difference in concentration of bacteria among predominating and subdominating genera between ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and controls. In contrast to the mucosal studies, we found a significant increase in lactobacilli population in fecal samples of active UC patients. Another study revealed a significant decrease of Clostridium coccoides and leptum clusters in fecal samples of active UC patients along with decreased concentrations of fecal SCFAs, especially of n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, and . We therefore found similar perturbations in gut microbiome in both infectious and autoimmune diseases, indicating inflammation to be the major driver for changes in gut microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15892107>Adacolumn for selective leukocytapheresis as a non-pharmacological treatment for patients with disorders of the immune system: an adjunct or an alternative to drug therapy?</a></h2><p>Inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases like ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) are debilitating chronic disorders that poorly respond to pharmacological interventions. Further, drug therapy has adverse effects that add to disease complications. The current thinking is that disorders like inflammatory bowel disease () reflect an over exuberant immune activation driven by cytokines including TNF-alpha. Major sources of cytokines include myeloid leukocytes (granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages), which in  are elevated with activation behavior and are found in vast numbers within the inflamed intestinal mucosa. Accordingly, myeloid cells should be the targets of therapy. Adacolumn is filled with cellulose  beads that selectively adsorb and deplete myeloid cells and a small fraction of lymphocytes (FcgammaR and complement receptors bearing cells). In one study, 20 steroid naive patients with moderate (n = 14) or severe (n = 6) UC according to Rachmilewitz despite 1.5-2.25 g/day of 5-aminosalicylic acid received 6 to 10 Adacolumn sessions at 2 sessions/week. Efficacy was assessed 1 week after the last session. The majority of patients responded to 6 sessions, 17 (85%) achieved remission. In 2 of the 3 non-responders, CAI was 8 and 12 in 1; all 3 had deep colonic ulcers at study initiation. Decreases were seen in total leukocytes (P = 0.003), % neutrophils (P = 0.003), % monocytes (P = 0.004), an increase in lymphocytes (P = 0.001), decreases in C-reactive protein (P = 0.0002), and rises in blood levels of soluble TNF-alpha receptors I (P = 0.0007), II (P = 0.0045). In a separate study, a case with very severe steroid refractory UC who received up to 11 sessions responded well and avoided colectomy. Further, myeloid cell purging with Adacolumn has been associated with the release of IL-1 receptor antagonist, suppression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, down-modulation of L-selectin and the chemokine receptor CXCR3. In conclusion, selective depletion of myeloid cells appears to induce anti-inflammatory effects and represents a non-pharmacological treatment for patients with active . The treatment has a clear drug-sparing role. Changes in blood levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors are thought to contribute to the efficacy of this procedure.Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9840102>Effect of short-term topical corticosteroid treatment on mucosal enzyme systems in patients with distal inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids, even when administered topically, have a known early benefit on diarrheal symptoms in inflammatory bowel diseases which may not be explained exclusively by their anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, we evaluated a possible early effect of topically administered glucocorticosteroids on the mucosal function of patients with distal inflammatory bowel disease in a prospective, controlled study, which was blinded for histological evaluation.Eleven patients with distal ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and 8 patients without intestinal inflammation were studied. A sigmoidoscopy with biopsy sampling (8-10) was performed before and 3 days after rectal administration of a hydrocortisone  foam preparation (100 mg b.i.d.). Prior to and after topical steroid treatment, basolateral (Na++K+)-ATPase activity (coupled optical assay), specific 3H ouabain binding (rapid filtration method), 5'-nucleotidase (microdetection method of phosphorus), and mucosal DNA levels (diphenylamine reaction) were determined from biopsy homogenates. Morphological and clinical characteristics were assessed according to established scores.Short-term topical GCS treatment significantly (p<0.05) stimulated (Na++K+)-ATPase activity (103%) as well as the number of active (Na++K+)-ATPase molecules (190%). In the healthy mucosa, only (Na++K+)-ATPase activity was stimulated (124%, p<0.05; specific 3H ouabain binding: 33%; p=0.09). As an unspecific GCS effect, apical 5'-nucleotidase was also stimulated (p<0.05; : 50%; controls: 200%). As assessed by endoscopic and histological scores, as well as by mucosal DNA levels, morphological signs of intestinal inflammation remained unchanged during the study, whereas the daily stool frequency decreased significantly (p<0.05).In patients with distal inflammatory bowel disease, short-term treatment with topical GCS leads to a quick recovery from diarrheal symptoms, due to the early improvement of mucosal function prior to the occurrence of the well-known anti-inflammatory GCS effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21884473>Evaluation of the effect of ulinastatin on the production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in vitro for potential combination therapy with leukocyte adsorption.</a></h2><p>Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) induces normal intestinal macrophages that have anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, M-CSF-rich conditions in colonic tissues seem to contribute to the improvement of pathological conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (). However, it has not been clarified whether current therapies for , including granulocyte/monocyte adsorptive apheresis using an Adacolumn, and ulinastatin, a serine protease inhibitor, affect the production of M-CSF. To clarify the effects of these therapies on M-CSF production, we investigated whether monocyte adsorption to cellulose  (CA) beads (carriers for Adacolumn therapy) and ulinastatin augmented M-CSF production in in vitro experiments. Peripheral blood was incubated with and without CA beads, and then M-CSF production was measured. Additionally, peripheral blood containing serial dilutions of ulinastatin was incubated with CA beads followed by measurement of M-CSF production. Monocyte adsorption to CA beads did not affect M-CSF production. A high concentration of ulinastatin augmented M-CSF production without inhibiting monocyte adsorption to CA beads, although a low concentration of ulinastatin conversely suppressed M-CSF production. The present study found that a high concentration of ulinastatin, which was administrated with CA beads, increased the production of M-CSF. Our results suggest that a combination of ulinastatin and Adacolumn therapy may provide more clinical efficacy for the treatment of  in terms of the production of M-CSF.© 2011 The Authors.

Soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) is an important mediator of inflammation in BD. Its expression and effect on neutrophil oxidative burst and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release have not been characterized. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of plasma and the CD40L pathway on NET release and the oxidative burst profile in patients with aBD and .Neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients with aBD (n = 30), patients with  (n = 31), and healthy control subjects (HCs; n = 30). sCD40L plasma concentration was determined in individual samples. A pool of plasma for each group was created. In some experiments, plasma pools were treated with recombinant CD40 (rhCD40-muIg) for sCD40L blockade. NET release and HO/O production were determined after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-, sCD40L, or plasma pool. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of (1) CD40, Mac-1, and phosphorylated NF-κB p65 on neutrophils and monocytes and (2) CD40L on activated T cells and platelets. CD40L gene expression in PBMCs was determined by qRT-PCR.sCD40L plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with  (median 17,234, range 2346-19,279 pg/ml) and patients with aBD (median 18,289, range 413-19,883 pg/ml) than in HCs (median 47.5, range 33.7-26.7 pg/ml; p < 0.001). NET release was constitutively increased in BD compared with HC. NET release and HO/O were higher after stimulation with sCD40L or BD plasma and decreased after sCD40L blockade. Mac-1 expression was constitutively increased in neutrophils of patients with aBD (88.7 ± 13.2% of cells) and patients with  (89.2 ± 20.1% of cells) compared with HC (27.1 ± 18.8% of cells; p < 0.01). CD40 expression on phagocytes and CD40L expression on platelets were similar in the three groups.

The aim was to provide a new treatment method for colitis, especially for Inflammatory Bowel Disease () patients. Since the simple oral gavage of CIN-102 was not able to reduce the pathogenic bacteria involved in colitis (rat model), the drug was incorporated into multiparticulates. The idea was to minimize undesired drug release in the upper gastrointestinal tract and to control CIN-102 release in the colon, in order to optimize the resulting antibiotic concentration at the site of action. A particular challenge was the fact that CIN-102 is a volatile hydrophobic liquid. Pellet cores were prepared by extrusion-spheronization and coated with polymer blends, which are sensitive to colonic bacterial enzymes. Mini-tablets were prepared by direct compression. The release of the main compound of CIN-102 (cinnamaldehyde, 86.7% w/w) was monitored in vitro. Optimized coated pellets and mini-tablets were also tested in vivo: in seven-week-old, male mice suffering from dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis. Importantly, both types of multiparticulates were able: (i) to significantly reduce the number of luminal and mucosal enterobacteria in the mice (the levels of which are increased in the disease state), and (ii) to improve the clinical course of the intestinal inflammation (decrease in the percentages of mice with bloody stools and diarrhea). Thus, the proposed coated pellets and matrix mini-tablets allowing for controlled CIN-102 release show a promising potential for new treatment methods of colitis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We monitored the survival during and short chain fatty acid production after incubation in conditions simulating the stomach and small intestine using in vitro batch experiments. In case of acid conditions (pH 2 and pH 3), B. pullicaecorum was viable and active but not cultivable. Cultivability was restored during subsequent small intestine conditions. Importantly, bile and pancreatic juice had no lethal effect. Milk, as a suspension medium, only had a protective effect on the cultivability during the first hour at pH 2. B. pullicaecorum was still metabolically active after upper gastrointestinal conditions and produced short chain fatty acids, but a shift from butyrate to  production was observed. Although the butyrate-producing anaerobe B. pullicaecorum showed good intrinsic acid and bile tolerance in terms of viability and metabolic activity, colonization efficiency and butyrate production under colon conditions is needed to further evaluate its probiotic potential.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

More than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. Microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. Of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to , propionate, and butyrate. However, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. Specific pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic Clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. Compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. There is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (). Current theories for the development of  favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. Recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in Boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. Differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. Similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine . Commonly observed microbial changes are increased Proteobacteria (i.e., Escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in Firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV (i.e., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Faecalibacterium spp.). This would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12011980>In vitro alterations in fecal short chain fatty acids and organic anions induced by the destruction of intestinal microflora under hypotonic and aerobic conditions.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () remains unknown. It has been suggested that luminal factors such as the microflora, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), food antigens and so on play important roles in the disease progression. Many reports have revealed alterations in the SCFA and organic acid concentration of the colon, especially increased lactate and decreased butyrate, in  patients. The mechanisms responsible for these alterations, however, remain unclear. Therefore, the effects of aerobic conditions on the alterations in the SCFA and organic anion levels in the feces was evaluated. Fecal specimens were collected from 5 healthy volunteers. Under aerobic condition, a mixture of feces and distilled water was incubated in 37 degrees C for 1 and 3 h. The pH, osmotic pressures, the concentrations of potassium, bicarbonate, SCFA and organic anion, and the activities of alpha-amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the mixture were then measured. We also examined any changes in the microscopic microflora under the hypotonic and aerobic conditions. The results showed the osmotic pressure, and the concentrations of lactate and SCFAs (formate, , propionate and n-valerate) were progressively increased with longer incubation times, and reached a statistically significant difference. In particular, the ratios of lactate, succinate and n-valerate after 1 and 3 h of incubation increased remarkably. In contrast, the electrolyte levels and both alpha-amylase and LDH activities were not altered significantly. Microscopically, the microflora in the mixture decreased with prolonged incubation times. These data suggest that under these in vitro conditions, the organic anion and SCFA levels in the feces easily increased. It is probable that the alterations in the SCFA and organic anion levels in  patients may be partly due to intracellular components derived from microflora destroyed under hypotonic and aerobic conditions in the colonic lumen, for example caused by mucosal bleeding. These alterations may influence the pathogenesis and progression of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27117102>DNA damage and apoptosis in blood neutrophils of inflammatory bowel disease patients and in Caco-2 cells in vitro exposed to betanin.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases () are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and continuing colonic inflammation is considered an important risk factor in the development of colorectal cancer. Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with inflammatory bowel disease--ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in  patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti-inflammatory and potentially cancer preventive activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23198878>Murine CD4⁺CD25⁻ cells activated in vitro with PMA/ionomycin and anti-CD3 acquire regulatory function and ameliorate experimental colitis in vivo.</a></h2><p>Induced regulatory T (iTreg) lymphocytes show promise for application in the treatment of allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. iTreg cells demonstrate advantages over natural Treg (nTreg) cells in terms of increased number of starting population and greater potential to proliferate. Different activation methods to generate iTreg cells result in iTreg cells that are heterogeneous in phenotype and mechanisms of suppression. Therefore it is of interest to explore new techniques to generate iTreg cells and to determine their physiological relevance.Using phorbol myristate  (PMA)/ionomycin and anti-CD3 activation of CD4⁺CD25⁻ cells we generated in vitro functional CD4⁺CD25⁻ iTreg (TregPMA) cells. Functionality of the generated TregPMA cells was tested in vivo in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease () - CD45RB transfer colitis model.TregPMA cells expressed regulatory markers and proved to ameliorate the disease phenotype in murine CD45RB transfer colitis model. The body weight loss and disease activity scores for TregPMA treated mice were reduced when compared to diseased control group. Histological assessment of colon sections confirmed amelioration of the disease phenotype. Additionally, cytokine analysis showed decreased levels of proinflammatory colonic and plasma IL-6, colonic IL-1 β and higher levels of colonic IL-17 when compared to diseased control group.This study identifies a new method to generate in vitro iTreg cells (TregPMA cells) which physiological efficacy has been demonstrated in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11054378>Suppression of NF-kappaB activity by sulfasalazine is mediated by direct inhibition of IkappaB kinases alpha and beta.</a></h2><p>Activation of NF-kappaB/Rel has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (). Various drugs used in the treatment of , such as glucocorticoids, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and sulfasalazine, interfere with NF-kappaB/Rel signaling. The aim of this study was to define the molecular mechanism by which sulfasalazine inhibits NF-kappaB activation.The effects of sulfasalazine and its moieties on NF-kappaB signaling were evaluated using electromobility shift, transfection, and immune complex kinase assays. The direct effect of sulfasalazine on IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity was investigated using purified recombinant IKK-alpha and -beta proteins.NF-kappaB/Rel activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-, or overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, IKK-alpha, IKK-beta, or constitutively active IKK-alpha and IKK-beta mutants was inhibited dose dependently by sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced activation of endogenous IKK in Jurkat T cells and SW620 colon cells, as well as the catalytic activity of purified IKK-alpha and IKK-beta in vitro. In contrast, the moieties of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and sulfapyridine or 4-aminosalicylic acid had no effect. Activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1, and p38 was unaffected by sulfasalazine. The decrease in substrate phosphorylation by IKK-alpha and -beta is associated with a decrease in autophosphorylation of IKKs and can be antagonized by excess adenosine triphosphate.These data identify sulfasalazine as a direct inhibitor of IKK-alpha and -beta by antagonizing adenosine triphosphate binding. The suppression of NF-kappaB activation by inhibition of the IKKs contributes to the well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of sulfasalazine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211831>Intestinal Inflammation Modulates the Epithelial Response to Butyrate in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Butyrate-producing gut bacteria are reduced in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (), supporting the hypothesis that butyrate supplementation may be beneficial in this setting. Nonetheless, earlier studies suggest that the oxidation of butyrate in  patients is altered. We propose that inflammation may decrease epithelial butyrate consumption.Non- controls and  patients were recruited for the study. Stool samples were used for short-chain fatty acid and bacterial butyryl CoA: CoA-transferase quantification. Colonic biopsies and ex vivo differentiated epithelial organoids (d-EpOCs) treated with butyrate and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were used for analyzing the expression of transporters MCT1 and ABCG2, metabolic enzyme ACADS, and butyrate receptor GPR43, and for butyrate metabolism and consumption assays.We observed that lower stool content of butyrate-producing bacteria in active  patients did not correlate with decreased butyrate concentrations. Indeed, the intestinal epithelial expression of MCT1, ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 was altered in active  patients. Nonetheless, d-EpOCs derived from  patients showed SLC16A1 (gene encoding for MCT1 protein), ABCG2, ACADS, and GPR43 expression levels comparable to controls. Moreover, - and non--derived d-EpOCs responded similarly to butyrate, as assessed by transcriptional regulation. TNFα significantly altered SLC16A1, ABCG2, and GPR43 transcription in d-EpOCs, mimicking the expression profile observed in biopsies from active  patients and resulting in reduced butyrate consumption.We provide evidence that the response to butyrate is not intrinsically altered in  patients. However, TNFα renders the epithelium less responsive to this metabolite, defeating the purpose of butyrate supplementation during active inflammation.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

A deuterated analog, d6-fexofenadine is used as the internal standard (IS). Plasma samples are prepared using 96-well solid phase extraction with plates containing Waters Oasis HLB sorbent. The analytes are chromatographed on a Restek Ultra  column (3.2 mm x 50 mm, 3 microm) using a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of 90% acetonitrile and 10% 10 mM ammonium  buffer and 0.1% formic acid. Quantitation of the analyte is based on the response from the multiple reaction monitoring of the precursor to product ion pairs for fexofenadine (m/z 502 --> 466) and d6-fexofenadine (m/z 508 --> 472). The assay has been validated over the concentration range of 1-200 ng/ml based on the analysis of 0.5 ml aliquots of plasma. Within-day assay accuracy was between 97 and 102% of nominal, while within-day precision was better than 3.5% CV at all points on the standard curve. Analyte extraction recovery was better than 70% over the range of the standard curve. The method was found to be suitable for the analysis of human plasma samples obtained 24 h following the administration of a single 60 mg dose of fexofenadine.Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094471>Markers of dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to study the taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients to identify key markers of dysbiosis in .Fecal samples obtained from 95  patients (78 UC and 17 CD) as well as 96 healthy volunteers were used for whole-genome sequencing carried out on the SOLiD 5500 W platform. Taxonomic profiling was performed by aligning the reeds, not maped on hg19, on MetaPhlAn2 reference database. Reeds were mapped using the HUNAnN2 algorithm to the ChocoPhlAn database to assess the representation of microbial metabolic pathways. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) level were measured in fecal samples by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis.Changes in  patients gut microbiota were characterized by an increase in the representation of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla bacteria and decrease in the number of Firmicutes phylum bacteria and Euryarchaeota phylum archaea; a decrease in the alpha-diversity index, relative representation of butyrate-producing, hydrogen-utilizing bacteria, and Methanobrevibacter smithii; increase in the relative representation of Ruminococcus gnavus in UC and CD patients and Akkermansia muciniphila in CD patients. Reduction of Butyryl-CoA:  CoA transferase gene relative representation in CD patients, decrease of absolute content of SCFA total number as well as particular SCFAs and main SCFAs ratio in  patients may indicate inhibition of functional activity and number of anaerobic microflora and/or an change in SCFA utilization by colonocytes.the revealed changes can be considered as typical signs of dysbiosis in  patients and can be used as potential targets for  patients personalized treatment development.</p></html>
