Although their attenuating effect on hepatic glucose output has drawn our attention for decades, the potential mechanisms remain unclear.Cytokine array kit was used to assess cytokine profiles in db/db mice and mouse primary hepatocytes treated with exenatide (exendin-4). Two diabetic mouse models (db/db and Pax6) were treated with a GLP-1 analog exenatide or liraglutide. The expression and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in the livers of diabetic mice, primary mouse and human hepatocytes, and the human hepatic cell line HepG2 treated with or without GLP-1 analog were measured. Blockage of FGF21 with neutralizing antibody or siRNA, or hepatocytes isolated from Fgf21 knockout mice were used, and the expression and activity of key enzymes in  were analyzed. Serum FGF21 level was evaluated in patients with type  diabetes (T2D) receiving exenatide treatment.Utilizing the cytokine array, we identified that FGF21 secretion was upregulated by exenatide (exendin-4). Similarly, FGF21 production in hepatocytes was stimulated by exenatide or liraglutide. FGF21 blockage attenuated the inhibitory effects of the GLP-1 analogs on hepatic glucose output. Similar results were also observed in primary hepatocytes from Fgf21 knockout mice. Furthermore, exenatide treatment increased serum FGF21 level in patients with T2D, particularly in those with better glucose control.We identify that function of GLP-1 in inhibiting hepatic glucose output is mediated via the liver hormone FGF21. Thus, we provide a new extra-pancreatic mechanism by which GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis.

In recent times, evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular. Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events. Gene polymorphism, disturbances in gene expression and regulation, enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine, decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on  are some of the projected mechanisms. Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship. In biochemical pharmacology, as fortified by pharmacogenomics, modalities have now been proposed, through drug trials, to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome, DM and associated cardiovascular pathology. A thorough understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

Two proposed mechanisms are 1) inhibition of mitochondrial Complex 1 with consequent compromised ATP and AMP homeostasis or ) inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) and thereby attenuated transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, resulting in a raised lactate/pyruvate ratio and redox-dependent inhibition of  from reduced but not oxidized substrates. Here, we show that metformin has a biphasic effect on the mitochondrial NADH/NAD redox state in mouse hepatocytes. A low cell dose of metformin (therapeutic equivalent: < nmol/mg) caused a more oxidized mitochondrial NADH/NAD state and an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio, whereas a higher metformin dose (≥5 nmol/mg) caused a more reduced mitochondrial NADH/NAD state similar to Complex 1 inhibition by rotenone. The low metformin dose inhibited  from both oxidized (dihydroxyacetone) and reduced (xylitol) substrates by preferential partitioning of substrate toward glycolysis by a redox-independent mechanism that is best explained by allosteric regulation at phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and/or fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) in association with a decrease in cell glycerol 3-phosphate, an inhibitor of PFK1, rather than by inhibition of transfer of reducing equivalents. We conclude that at a low pharmacological load, the metformin effects on the lactate/pyruvate ratio and glucose production are explained by attenuation of transmitochondrial electrogenic transport mechanisms with consequent compromised malate-aspartate shuttle and changes in allosteric effectors of PFK1 and FBP1.© 2019 Alshawi and Agius.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236111>Liraglutide Attenuates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through Adjusting Lipid Metabolism via SHP1/AMPK Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>A glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide (LR) had been experimentally and clinically shown to ameliorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effect of LR on NAFLD  and  and its underlying molecular mechanism. The effects of LR were examined on the high-fat diet-induced  model in mice and  model of NAFLD in human HepG2 cells. Liver tissues and HepG2 cells were procured for measuring lipid metabolism, histological examination, and western blot analysis. LR administration significantly lowered the serum lipid profile and lipid disposition  and  because of the altered expression of enzymes on hepatic  and lipid metabolism. Moreover, LR significantly decreased Src homology region  domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP1) and then increased the expression of phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK). However, the overexpression of SHP1 mediated by lentivirus vector reversed LR-induced improvement in lipid deposition. Moreover, SHP1 silencing could further increase the expression of p-AMPK to ameliorate lipid metabolism and relative lipogenic gene induced by LR. In addition, abrogation of AMPK by Compound C eliminated the protective effects of LR on lipid metabolism without changing the expression of SHP1.

This study investigated the involvement of MPC1 in hepatic glucagon response, in order to identify a possible pharmacological intervention.The correlation between hepatic glucagon response and MPC1 induction was investigated in fasted mice and primary hepatocytes. The effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on MPC1 function were observed.Glucagon challenge raised blood glucose with hepatic MPC1 induction, and inhibition of MPC induction coincided with a reduced rise in blood glucose. cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) knockdown blocked glucagon-induced MPC1 expression, while CREB overexpression increased MPC1 expression. Luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and promoter mutation confirmed that CREB increased MPC1 transcription through gene promoter induction. CREB regulated transcription co-activator  nuclear translocation was also required for CREB to promote MPC1 induction. Glucagon shifted mitochondrial pyruvate towards carboxylation for  via the opposite regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carboxylase with respect to MPC1 induction. MPC1 induction was necessary for glucagon to promote pyruvate-driven hepatic glucose production (HGP), but glucagon failed to influence HGP from other gluconeogenic substrates routed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, independent of MPC. Rb1 blocked cAMP signalling by inhibiting AC activity and deactivated CREB by dephosphorylation, possibly contributing to inhibiting MPC1 induction to reduce HGP.CREB transcriptionally up-regulates MPC1 to provide pyruvate for . Rb1 reduced cAMP formation which consequently reduced CREB-mediated MPC1 induction and thereby might contribute to limiting pyruvate-dependent HGP.

High doses of corticosteroids are used in diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), lymphomas, or connective tissue diseases. Post-steroid hyperglycaemia arises as a result of increased  and increased glycogen synthesis. Steroid-induced diabetes most often is asymptomatic; therefore it is important to monitor the glycaemic level in patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids. So far, no separate guidelines for steroid-induced diabetes have been developed, so the criteria for diagnosing drug-related diabetes mellitus do not differ from the criteria for diagnosing type  diabetes. Hyperglycaemia adversely affects the immune system: it impairs the function of granulocytes, immunoglobulins, and also causes T-lymphocyte apoptosis. A hyperglycaemic environment favours the development of bacterial and fungal infections. Numerous studies confirm that hyperglycaemia increases the risk of infection and severity of infection. There have also been reports of adverse effects of steroid-induced hyperglycaemia in the course of treatment for the underlying disease in the adult population. Reports related to the paediatric population are not as numerous. There are studies that have proven an increased risk of infection in paediatric patients with ALL and steroid-induced diabetes, as well as studies that proved an unfavourable effect of diabetes on survival in children with ALL and as well the studies that proved that risk of life-threatening infection and survival does not differ statistically in the group of patients with hyperglycaemia and in the group of patients who did not develop diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629173>Environmental risk assessment of triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea and their toxicity to phytoplankton at environmental concentrations.</a></h2><p>Herbicides have been increasingly used worldwide and a large amount of herbicide residue eventually enters the ocean via groundwater or surface run-off every year. However, the global coastal pollution status of herbicides and their negative impact on marine life (especially phytoplankton) in natural environmental concentrations are poorly understood except for few special environments (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Our field investigation of the distribution of ten triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea of China revealed that the concentrations of triazine herbicides exceeded the "No Observed Effect Concentrations" for phytoplankton. Their total concentrations could be as high as 6.61 nmol L. Based on the concentration addition model, the toxicity of herbicide homologues is usually cumulative, and the combined toxicity of these ten triazine herbicides could cause 13.% inhibition on the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of a representative diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1, which corresponds roughly to the toxicity of atrazine in an equivalent concentration of 14.08 nmol L. Atrazine in this equivalent-effect concentration could greatly inhibit the growth of cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and nutrient absorption of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis/, etc.) related with photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were greatly disturbed, which might ultimately influence the primary productivity of coastal waters. Moreover, with the values of its bioaccumulation factor ranging from 69.6 to 118.9, atrazine was found to be accumulated in algal cells, which indicates that herbicide pollution might eventually affect the marine food web and even threaten the seafood safety of human beings.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the metabolic explanation for reductions in tissue accretion observed in growing pigs remains poorly defined. Additionally, PRRS virus challenge is often accompanied by reduced feed intake, making it difficult to discern which effects are virus vs. feed intake driven. To account for this, a pair-fed model was employed to examine the effects of PRRS challenge and nutrient restriction on skeletal muscle and liver metabolism. Forty-eight pigs were randomly selected (13.1 ± 1.97 kg BW) and allotted to 1 of 3 treatments (n = 16 pigs/treatment): 1) PRRS naïve, ad libitum fed (Ad), ) PRRS-inoculated, ad libitum fed (PRRS+), and 3) PRRS naïve, pair-fed to the PRRS-inoculated pigs' daily feed intake (PF). At days postinoculation (dpi) 10 and 17, 8 pigs per treatment were euthanized and tissues collected. Tissues were assayed for markers of proteolysis (LM only), protein synthesis (LM only), oxidative stress (LM only),  (liver), and glycogen concentrations (LM and liver). Growth performance, feed intake, and feed efficiency were all reduced in both PRRS+ and PF pigs compared with Ad pigs (P < 0.001). Furthermore, growth performance and feed efficiency were additionally reduced in PRRS+ pigs compared with PF pigs (P < 0.05). Activity of most markers of LM proteolysis (μ-calpain, 20S proteasome, and caspase 3/7) was not increased (P > 0.10) in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs, although activity of m-calpain was increased in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs (P = 0.025) at dpi 17. Muscle reactive oxygen species production was not increased (P > 0.10) in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs. However, phosphorylation of protein synthesis markers was decreased in PRRS+ pigs compared with both Ad (P < 0.05) and PF (P < 0.05) pigs. Liver  was not increased as a result of PRRS; however, liver glycogen was decreased (P < 0.01) in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad and PF pigs at both time points. Taken together, this work demonstrates the differential impact a viral challenge and nutrient restriction have on metabolism of growing pigs. Although markers of skeletal muscle proteolysis showed limited evidence of increase, markers of skeletal muscle synthesis were reduced during PRRS viral challenge. Furthermore, liver glycogenolysis seems to provide PRRS+ pigs with glucose needed to fuel the immune response during viral challenge.© The Author(s) 2019.

The mRNA and protein expression levels of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), key regulatory factors of , lipogenesis, and fatty acid β oxidation (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α)) were determined through RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively.RYGB induced significant improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, along with weight loss and decreased food intake. RYGB also decreased serum TG, FFAs, and increased bile acids levels. The lipid droplets in the liver were significantly decreased after RYGB. The RYGB group exhibited downregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of PEPCK, G6Pase, and SREBP-1c and upregulated expression of FXR, SHP, and PPAR-α in the liver.RYGB ameliorates glucose and lipid metabolism accompanied by weight loss and calorie restriction. The liver exhibited a marked improvement in lipid accumulation after RYGB. The bile acids level, FXR, and its target transcriptional factor SHP expression were elevated. Meanwhile, our study demonstrated that the increased bile acids-FXR signaling, followed by the reduced hepatic , lipogenesis, and increased fatty acid β oxidation may contribute to improved metabolic conditions after RYGB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082009>Diabetic Perioperative Management.</a></h2><p>In both diabetic and non-diabetic population, hyperglycemia in the perioperative period is an independent marker of poor surgical outcomes (delayed wound healing, increased rate of infection, prolonged hospital stay, higher postoperative mortality).[1][][3][4] Hyperglycemia (greater than 140 mg/dl) is a frequent occurrence with a prevalence of 20 to 40% in the general surgery and 80 to 90% in the cardiac surgery population.[][4][5][6] The stress of surgery, anesthesia, and illness increases secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, catecholamines), which in turn causes decreased insulin secretion, increased insulin resistance, decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased lipolysis and proteolysis.

Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type  diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the glycolysis, , and arachidonic acid pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b).

The aim of the present study was to screen prognosis‑associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and construct a risk score system for the disease. The RNA‑sequencing data of patients with HCC (including 100 HCC samples and 26 normal samples) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, GSE55092, GSE19665 and GSE10186 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Combined with weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, the identification and functional annotation of stable modules was performed. Using the MetaDE package, the consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DE‑RNAs) were analyzed. To construct a risk score system, prognosis‑associated lncRNAs and the optimal lncRNA combination were separately analyzed by survival and penalized packages. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis for the nodes in an lncRNA‑mRNA network was conducted via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. A total of four stable modules and 3,051 consensus DE‑RNAs were identified.

It has been suggested that this might lead to hepatotoxicity, including the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. After entering hepatocytes via insulin-independent glucose transporter  transmembrane carrier proteins, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate in a reaction catalysed by fructokinase (ketohexokinase). In turn, fructose-1-phosphate is hydrolysed by aldolase B to glyceraldehydes. Glyceraldehydes may enter  via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehydes may also enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate. The last pathway involves conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate may be converted, via the action of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5, into lactate. In liver damage, the LDH-5 isoenzyme becomes elevated, predominantly in serum/plasma. We therefore hypothesised that if dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity, there should be a positive correlation between erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and plasma LDH-5. This hypothesis was tested by assaying venous blood samples taken from 39 patients at rest, three hours after eating. Quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis was used to assay erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate levels. Similarly, plasma LDH-5 concentrations were spectrophotometrically analysed, using the pyruvate-lactate reaction, following electrophoretic separation of the LDH isoenzymes. A significant positive correlation was found between the two variables (r = 0.44, p = 0.0047). This result, which supports our hypothesis, is evidence in favour of the possibility that dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition to being a marker of hepatic damage, LDH-5 may play a more direct epigenetic role in causing liver damage; acute hepatic injury is associated with nuclear translocation of LDH, causing the production of lactate from pyruvate in the nucleus; in turn, the lactate inhibits histone deacetylase and is associated with upregulation of genes associated with the damage response, leading to cell death.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Several recent studies demonstrated that ginsenosides have potential anti-type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) properties. To evaluate the anti-T2DM effect of G-Rk3 and verify its potential mechanism, a high-fat-diet/streptozocin (HFD/STZ) induced model of T2DM in C57BL/6 mice and a high glucose induced insulin resistance model of HepG2 cells were applied in this research. Our analysis indicated that G-Rk3 reduced HFD/STZ induced hyperglycemia, and serum insulin and inflammation levels, and ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, and prevented liver histological changes. Furthermore, it also significantly reduced lipid accumulation as shown by lower TG, LDL-C and TC serum concentrations and Oil Red O staining in liver tissues. The hypoglycemic effect of G-Rk3 seemed to be partially mediated via the inhibition of hepatic , which was supported by the activated p-Akt, p-FoxO1 and GLUT2 and inhibited FoxO1, PEPCK and G6pase protein expressions in the liver as well as increased glucose uptake in high glucose induced HepG2 cells. The gene expressions of hepatic  were also down-regulated by G-Rk3 in HFD/STZ induced T2DM mice. In addition, G-Rk3 suppressed HFD/STZ induced lipid accumulation by regulating related gene and protein expressions such as p-ACC, FAS and SREBP-1, which are the downstream targets of AMPK.

HK- and HepG2 cells were treated with pravastatin and cultured under either high- or normal-cholesterol conditions. In HK- cells treated with pravastatin under both high- and normal-cholesterol conditions, the protein expression of only pyruvate kinase isozymes L/R (PKLR) decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while the protein expression of other glucose metabolism related enzymes remained unchanged. Within the in vivo experiment, male C57BL/6 mice were fed either pravastatin-treated normal-fat diets for  or 4 weeks or pravastatin-treated high-fat diets for 16 weeks. Protein expression of PKLR in the kidneys from mice that consumed pravastatin-treated high-fat diets decreased significantly compared to the controls. Upon the treatments of pravastatin, only the PKLR expression decreased in lean mice. Furthermore, PKLR activity decreased significantly in the kidney after pravastatin treatments. However, there was no change in enzyme activity in the liver, suggesting that pravastatin decreased PKLR activity only in the kidney. This change may be associated with the hyperglycemic effect of statins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473204>Pancreastatin inhibitor, PSTi8 ameliorates metabolic health by modulating AKT/GSK-3β and PKCλ/ζ/SREBP1c pathways in high fat diet induced insulin resistance in peri-/post-menopausal rats.</a></h2><p>Increase in the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in peri-/post-menopause women is mainly due to hormone deficiency and lifestyle. PSTi8 (PEGKGEQEHSQQKEEEEEMAV-amide) is a pancreastatin inhibitor peptide which showed potent antidiabetic activity in genetic and lifestyle induced type  diabetic mice. In the present work, we have investigated the antidiabetic activity of PSTi8 in rat models of peri-/post-menopausal IR. 4-vinylcyclohexenediepoxide treated and ovariectomized rats were fed with high fat diet for 12 weeks to develop the peri-/post-menopausal IR. PSTi8 peptide was administered after the development of peri-/post-menopausal IR rats. PSTi8 (1 mg/kg, i.p) improved the glucose homeostasis which is characterized by elevated glycogenesis, enhanced  and reduced gluconeogenesis. PSTi8 suppressed palmitate- and PST- induced IR in HepG2 cells. PSTi8 treatment enhanced energy expenditure in peri-/post-menopausal IR rats. PSTi8 treatment increased insulin sensitivity in peri-/post-menopausal IR rats, may be mediated by modulating IRS1--phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT-GSK3β and IRS1--phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-PKCλ/ζ-SREBP1c signaling pathways in the liver. PSTi8 can act as a potential therapeutic peptide for the treatment of peri-/post-menopausal IR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We identified 5932 high-confidence proteins; 1494 were differentially abundant between the two samples, including 749 up- and 745 down-regulated proteins. The up- and down-regulated proteins that could be essential for anther development and male sterility in sterile buds were mainly involved in (1) carbohydrate and energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase, glycolysis/, TCA cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism), () pollen wall synthesis and regulation (pectinesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, beta-galactosidase, glycosyl hydrolase), (3) protein synthesis and degradation (proteasome subunits, ribosome proteins, ABC transporters, RNA transport, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum), (4) flavonoid biosynthesis, and (5) plant hormone signal transduction. We identified 10 genes/proteins that were both up-regulated and 122 that were both down-regulated in a conjoint analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring and qRT-PCR validation showed that the iTRAQ results were accurate and reliable. These findings will provide valuable information on proteins involved in anther development, and will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie male sterility in Chinese cabbage. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chinese cabbage is an allogamous plant with bisexual flowers that displays significant heterosis. The application of male sterile lines is a very efficient way to produce hybrid seeds, which can generate stronger plants that develop more rapidly and produce higher yield. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage is unknown. In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach (iTRAQ) to identify DAPs between fertile and sterile buds of the GMS line 'AB01'. Subsequently, we also performed conjoined analysis of the iTRAQ results and our previously reported transcriptomics results. The aim of this research was to obtain the key DAPs and to identify the significantly enriched pathways involved in anther development and male sterility. These results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, the commonly used anti-T2DM drugs failed to substant to treat T2DM when anti-T2DM was withdrawn. Here we put forward a superior and sustainable anti-diabetic strategy using intraperitoneal administration of amino-acid-functionalized gadofullerene nanoparticles (GFNPs) in db/db diabetic mice. Highly accumulated in the pancreas and liver, GFNPs could prominently decrease hyperglycemia, along with permanently maintaining normal blood sugar levels in T2DM mice and even stopping administration. Importantly, GFNPs reversed the pancreas islets dysfunctions by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation responses and fundamentally normalized the insulin secretory function of the pancreas islets. Mechanistically, GFNPs improved hepatic insulin resistance by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism through the activation of IRS2/PI3K/AKT signal pathways, resulting in inhibiting  and increasing glycogenesis in the liver. Additionally, GFNPs relieved hepatic steatosis in the liver, ultimately maintaining systemic glucose and lipid metabolic homeostasis without obvious toxicity. Together, GFNPs reverse the dysfunctions of the pancreas and improve hepatic insulin resistance, providing a promising approach for T2DM treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30767679>Role of ketone signaling in the hepatic response to fasting.</a></h2><p>Ketosis is a metabolic adaptation to fasting, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and prolonged exercise. β-OH butyrate acts as a transcriptional regulator and at G protein-coupled receptors to modulate cellular signaling pathways in a hormone-like manner. While physiological ketosis is often adaptive, chronic hyperketonemia may contribute to the metabolic dysfunction of NAFLD. To understand how β-OH butyrate signaling affects hepatic metabolism, we compared the hepatic fasting response in control and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase II (HMGCS2) knockdown mice that are unable to elevate β-OH butyrate production. To establish that rescue of ketone metabolic/endocrine signaling would restore the normal hepatic fasting response, we gave intraperitoneal injections of β-OH butyrate (5.7 mmol/kg) to HMGCS2 knockdown and control mice every  h for the final 9 h of a 16-h fast. In hypoketonemic, HMGCS2 knockdown mice, fasting more robustly increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein  (UCP2), a protein critical for supporting fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. In turn, exogenous β-OH butyrate administration to HMGCS2 knockdown mice decreased fasting UCP2 mRNA expression to that observed in control mice. Also supporting feedback at the transcriptional level, β-OH butyrate lowered the fasting-induced expression of HMGCS2 mRNA in control mice. β-OH butyrate also regulates the glycemic response to fasting. The fast-induced fall in serum glucose was absent in HMGCS2 knockdown mice but was restored by β-OH butyrate administration. These data propose that endogenous β-OH butyrate signaling transcriptionally regulates hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, while modulating glucose tolerance.  Ketogenesis regulates whole body glucose metabolism and β-OH butyrate produced by the liver feeds back to inhibit hepatic β-oxidation and ketogenesis during fasting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874963>Metformin: Mechanisms in Human Obesity and Weight Loss.</a></h2><p>Metformin has multiple benefits for health beyond its anti-hyperglycemic properties. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the mechanisms that underlie metformin's effects on obesity.Metformin is a first-line therapy for type  diabetes. Large cohort studies have shown weight loss benefits associated with metformin therapy. Metabolic consequences were traditionally thought to underlie this effect, including reduction in hepatic  and reduction in insulin production. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin-associated weight loss is due to modulation of hypothalamic appetite regulatory centers, alteration in the gut microbiome, and reversal of consequences of aging. Metformin is also being explored in the management of obesity's sequelae such as hepatic steatosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. Multiple mechanisms underlie the weight loss-inducing and health-promoting effects of metformin. Further exploration of these pathways may be important in identifying new pharmacologic targets for obesity and other aging-associated metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31351995>Hepatic deficiency of Poldip2 in type  diabetes dampens lipid and glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Moderate or low level hydrogen peroxides has been shown to play an important role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function, in which the polymerase DNA-directed interacting protein  (Poldip2), functioned as a key regulator of NOX4 activity. In current study, we unexpectedly found that type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) substantially suppresses the hepatic Poldip2 expression, and that the hepatic deficiency of Poldip2 may be correlated with dysregulation of hepatic cholesterol and plasma triglycerides. In cultured hepatocytes, we found that both insulin and leptin may inhibit hepatic expression of Poldip2 under high glucose concentration, but these suppressions were totally abolished under normoglycemic condition. POLDIP2 siRNA knockdown significantly impaired the HO induction by insulin or leptin under normoglycemic condition, contributing the accumulation of cholesterol in cultured liver cells. The in vivo restoration of hepatic Poldip2 expression in T2DM mice remarkably rescued the moderate HO generation in livers versus control mice, resulting in significant amelioration of hepatic cholesterol accumulation and plasma triglyceride levels. Importantly, the moderate induction of HO in livers dramatically improved the hepatic PI3K-C/AKT signaling or dampened PI3K-Cγ/AKT signaling through suppression of PTEN and PTP1B activities, thereby inhibiting the hepatic expression of HMGCR and SREBP2 for cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, the restitution of hepatic Poldip2 expression in diabetic mice significantly lowered the VLDL-cholesterol production rate, and substantially suppressed PEPCK and G6Pase expressions for , thus significantly improving the plasma insulin and glucose levels, and ITT and GTT outcomes in diabetic mice. Our findings suggest that hepatic dysregulation of Poldip2 may contribute to diabetic dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Despite being broadly distributed in global geothermal systems, only three Nanoarchaeota have been successfully co-cultivated with their hosts, and until now no nanoarchaeotal cultures or genomes have been described from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. We recovered three nanoarchaeotal metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep-sea hydrothermal vent sites at the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (M10-121), Guaymas Basin (Gua-46) and the Mid-Cayman Rise (MC-1). Based on average amino acid identity analysis, M10-121 is a novel species in the candidate genus Nanoclepta, while the other two MAGs represent novel genera in the Nanoarchaeota. Like previously sequenced Nanoarchaeota, each MAG encodes at least one split protein-coding gene. The MAGs also contain a mosaic of key nanoarchaeotal features, including CRISPR repeat regions and marker genes for  and archaeal flagella. MC-1 also encodes the pentose bisphosphate pathway, which may allow the nanoarchaeote to bypass several steps in glycolysis and produce ATP.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645487>[Effect of diethylnitrosamine on renal metabolic pathway in rats].</a></h2><p>To explore the renal metabolic markers relavant to the renal toxicity of diethylnitrosamine and the metabolic pathways involved in the renal metabolic markers.  Methods: Nineteen Sprague Dawley rats were assigned into  groups: A normal control group (n=9) and a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) administration group (n=10). The rats in the normal control group were given sterilized water for free drinking. The rats in the DEN administration group were given 0.1 mg/mL DEN solution for free drinking. After 18 weeks, the kidney tissues were collected and tested for nuclear magnetic resonance detection and pathological examination.  Results: The content of kidneys metabolites in the rats with the DEN administration was changed significantly. The levels of alanine, taurine, pyruvate, acetate, and choline were significantly reduced compared with rat in the normal control group, while the levels of creatine, glycine, TMAO, methionine, proline, lactate, valine, leucine and isoleucine were significantly increased.  Conclusion: Metabolicomics studies have revealed significant differences in five metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, glycine serine and threonine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis or , cysteine and methionine metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31230984>OLFR734 Mediates Glucose Metabolism as a Receptor of Asprosin.</a></h2><p>Asprosin is a fasting-induced hormone that promotes glucose production in the liver and stimulates appetite in the hypothalamus by activating the cAMP signaling pathway via an unknown G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). However, the bona fide receptor of Asprosin is unclear. Here, we have identified that the olfactory receptor OLFR734 acts as a receptor of Asprosin to modulate hepatic glucose production. Olfr734 knockout mice show a blunted response to Asprosin, including attenuated cAMP levels and hepatic glucose production, and improved insulin sensitivity. As Olfr734 deficiency dramatically attenuates both fasting and high-fat-diet-induced glucose production, our results demonstrate a critical role of OLFR734 as a receptor of Asprosin to maintain glucose homeostasis during fasting and in obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatic anaplerosis provides carbons for  (GNG) and triglyceride (TG) synthesis. We aimed to optimize a protocol that measures hepatic anaplerotic contribution for GNG, TG synthesis, and hepatic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity using a single dose of oral [UC]glycerol paired with an oral sugar tolerance test (OSTT) in a population with significant insulin resistance. The OSTT (75 g glucose + 25 g fructose) was administered to eight obese adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) followed by ingestion of [U-C]glycerol at  = 180 or  = 210 min. C-labeling patterns of serum glucose and TG-glycerol were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. C enrichment in plasma TG-glycerol was detectable and stable from 240 to 390 min with the [U-C]glycerol drink at  = 180 min(3.65 ± .3 to 4.47 ± 1.4%;  > 0.4), but the enrichment was undetectable at 240 min with the glycerol drink at  = 210 min. The relative contribution from anaplerosis was determined at the end of the OSTT [18.5 ±3.4% ( = 180 min) vs. 16.0 ± 3.5% ( = 210 min);  = 0.27]. [U-C]glycerol was incorporated into GNG 390 min after the OSTT with an enrichment of 7.5-12.5%. Glucose derived from TCA cycle activity was 0.3-1%, and the PPP activity was .8-4.7%. In conclusion, it is possible to obtain relative measurements of hepatic anaplerotic contribution to both GNG and TG esterification following an OSTT in a highly insulin-resistant population using a minimally invasive technique. Tracer administration should be timed to allow enough de novo TG esterification and endogenous glucose release after the sugar drink.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664210>Altered expression of genes involved in brain energy metabolism as adaptive responses in rats exposed to chronic variable stress; changes in cortical level of glucogenic and neuroactive amino acids.</a></h2><p>Brain metabolism is closely associated with neuronal activity and enables the accurate synthesis and function of neurotransmitters. Although previous studies have demonstrated that chronic stress is associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative stress and the disruption of glucose metabolism, the molecular mechanisms and cerebral  in depression have not yet been completely elucidated. In order to examine this subject, the present study evaluated changes in the expression of selected genes involved in the glycolytic pathway and the levels of glucogenic and neuroactive amino acids in the brain of rats exposed to chronic variable stress. Male Wistar rats (50‑55 days old, weighing 200‑250 g) were divided into two groups: control and stressed, and the rats in the stressed group were exposed to stress conditions for 40 days. Depressive‑like states were observed and recorded by measuring the body weight and forced swim test (FST). The mRNA levels of Slc2a3 (coding GLUT3) and Tfam (activator of mitochondrial transcription and a participant in mitochondrial genome replication) were markedly increased, while a decrease in the expression of Ldhb and GAPDH was also observed. These modifications were associated with the redirection of glucose metabolism to appropriate defensive pathways under chronic stress conditions, and an increased ability to maintain mitochondrial function as potential adaptive responses. A marked reduction of glucogenic and neuroactive amino acids levels indicate the support of energy metabolism by stimulation of the  pathway. The findings of the present study provide a novel insight into the molecular and biochemical events that impact the development of depression under chronic stress conditions, and they may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383551>The imprinted gene Delta like non-canonical notch ligand 1 (Dlk1) associates with obesity and triggers insulin resistance through inhibition of skeletal muscle glucose uptake.</a></h2><p>The imprinted gene Delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (Dlk1) is considered an inhibitor of adipogenesis, but its in vivo impact on fat mass indeed remains elusive and controversial.Fat deposits were assessed by MRI and DXA scanning in two cohorts of non-diabetic men, whereas glucose disposal rate (GDR) was determined during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Blood analyte measurements were used for correlation and mediation analysis to investigate how age, BMI, and fat percentage affect the relation between DLK1 and GDR. Confirmatory animal studies performed in normal (NC) and high fat diet (HFD) fed Dlk1 and Dlk1 mice included DXA scanning, glucose tolerance tests (GTTs), blood measurements, and skeletal muscle glucose uptake studies by positron emission tomography (PET), histology, qRT-PCR, and in vitro cell studies.Overall, DLK1 is positively correlated with fat amounts, which is consistent with a negative linear relationship between DLK1 and GDR. This relationship is not mediated by age, BMI, or fat percentage. In support, DLK1 also correlates positively with HOMA-IR and ADIPO-IR in these humans, but has no linear relationship with the early diabetic inflammation marker MCP-1. In Dlk1 mice, the increase in fat percentage and adipocyte size induced by HFD is attenuated, and these animals are protected against insulin resistance. These Dlk1 effects seem independent of , but at least partly relies on increased in vivo glucose uptake in skeletal muscles by Dlk1 regulating the major glucose transporter Glut4 in vivo as well as in two independent cell lines.Thus, instead of an adipogenic inhibitor, Dlk1 should be regarded as a factor causally linked to obesity and insulin resistance, and may be used to predict development of type  diabetes.

Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21± years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysis/ pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c)  (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703066>Metformin improves the glucose homeostasis of Wuchang bream fed high-carbohydrate diets: a dynamic study.</a></h2><p>After a 12-week feeding trial, the glucose tolerance test was performed in Megalobrama amblycephala to evaluate the effects of metformin on the metabolic responses of glycolipids. Plasma insulin peaked at  h, then decreased to the basal value at 8-12 h post-injection. Plasma triglyceride levels and liver glycogen contents of the control group was decreased significantly during the first  and 1 h, respectively. Then, they returned to basal values at 12 h. During the whole sampling period, the high-carbohydrate groups had significantly higher levels of plasma metabolites and liver glycogen than those of the control group, and metformin supplementation enhanced these changes (except insulin levels). Glucose administration lowered the transcriptions of ampk α1, ampk α, pepck, g6pase, fbpase, cpt IA and aco, the phosphorylation of Ampk α and the activities of the gluconeogenic enzymes during the first -4 h, while the opposite was true of glut , gs, gk, pk, accα and fas. High-carbohydrate diets significantly increased the transcriptions of ampk α1, ampk α, glut , gs, gk, pk, accα and fas, the phosphorylation of Ampk α and the activities of the glycolytic enzymes during the whole sampling period, while the opposite was true for the remaining indicators. Furthermore, metformin significantly upregulated the aforementioned indicators (except accα and fas) and the transcriptions of cpt IA and aco.

An inhibitor, camostat (CS), reduced weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rats; however, the mechanisms for these are largely unknown. We reasoned that CS creates an apparent dietary protein restriction, which is known to increase hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Therefore, metabolic responses to CS and a gut-restricted CS metabolite, FOY-251, were measured in mice. Food intake, body weight, blood glucose, branched-chain amino acids (LC/MS), hormone levels (ELISA), liver pathology (histology), and transcriptional changes (qRT-PCR) were measured in , lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice. In  mice, CS in chow (9-69 mg/kg) or FOY-251 (46 mg/kg) reduced food intake and body weight gain to a similar extent as pair-fed mice. CS decreased blood glucose, liver weight, and lipidosis and increased FGF21 gene transcription and plasma levels. In lean mice, CS increased liver FGF21 mRNA and plasma levels. Relative to pair feeding, FOY-251 also increased plasma FGF21 and induced liver FGF21 and integrated stress response (ISR) transcription. In DIO mice, FOY-251 (100 mg/kg po) did not alter peak glucose levels but reduced the AUC of the glucose excursion in response to an oral glucose challenge. FOY-251 increased plasma FGF21 levels. In addition to previously reported satiety-dependent (cholecystokinin-mediated) actions, intestinal trypsin inhibition engages non-satiety-related pathways in both leptin-deficient and DIO mice. This novel mechanism improves metabolism by a liver-integrated stress response and increased FGF21 expression levels in mice.  Trypsin inhibitors, including plant-based consumer products, have long been associated with metabolic improvements. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested this was due to satiety hormones and caloric wasting by loss of protein and fatty acids in feces. This work suggests an entirely new mechanism based on the lower amounts of digested protein available in the gut. This apparent protein reduction may cause beneficial metabolic adaptation by the intestinal-liver axis to perceived nutrient stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460269>Rubrofusarin as a Dual Protein Tyrosine Phosphate 1B and Human Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitor: An in Vitro and in Silico Study.</a></h2><p>A number of nature-derived biologically active compounds comprise glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters. The patterns of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin 6--β-d-glucopyranoside (), rubrofusarin 6--β-d-gentiobioside (), rubrofusarin triglucoside (), and cassiaside B2 () were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin, isolated from  seeds. Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC; .29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of gluconeogenesis. Our overall results show that glycosylation retards activity; however, it reduces toxicity. Thus,  seed as functional food and rubrofusarin as a base can be used for the development of therapeutic agents against comorbid diabetes and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823619>Feed Restriction Reveals Distinct Serum Metabolome Profiles in Chickens Divergent in Feed Efficiency Traits.</a></h2><p>Restrictive feeding influences systemic metabolism of nutrients; however, this impact has not been evaluated in chickens of diverging feed efficiency. This study investigated the effect of ad libitum versus restrictive feeding (85% of ad libitum) on the serum metabolome and white blood cell composition in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; metric for feed efficiency). Blood samples were collected between days 33 and 37 post-hatch. While serum glucose was similar, serum uric acid and cholesterol were indicative of the nutritional status and chicken's RFI, respectively. Feed restriction and RFI rank caused distinct serum metabolome profiles, whereby restrictive feeding also increased the blood lymphocyte proportion. Most importantly, 10 amino acids were associated with RFI rank in birds, whereas restrictive feeding affected almost all detected lysophosphatidylcholines, with 3 being higher and 6 being lower in restrictively compared to ad libitum fed chickens. As indicated by relevance networking, isoleucine, lysine, valine, histidine, and ornithine were the most discriminant for high RFI, whereas 3 biogenic amines (carnosine, putrescine, and spermidine) and 3 diacyl-glycerophospholipids (38:4, 38:5, and 40:5) positively correlated with feed intake and body weight gain, respectively. Only for taurine, feed intake mostly explained the RFI-associated variation, whereas for most metabolites, other host physiological factors played a greater role for the RFI-associated differences, and was potentially related to insulin-signaling, phospholipase A2, and arachidonic acid metabolism.

A total of 48 male mice (5 weeks old, 18-22 g) were divided randomly into 6 groups ( = 8), including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, vitamin C group (positive drug, 17 mg/kg), and 3-dosage groups of SHXXD (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg). The stress model was induced by restraining mice in a polypropylene centrifuge tube for 6 h every day. The rotarod test was performed, and several biochemical indicators were measured. Moreover, other 24 animals were divided into 3 groups ( = 8) including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, and SHXXD group (800 mg/kg) for H NMR-based metabolomics analysis. Our results showed that SHXXD significantly increased the rotarod time, thymus index, spleen index, and the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and interleukin- (IL-) , but decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) , corticosterone (CORT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in restraint-stressed mice. Moreover, the contents of eight endogenous metabolites that were changed by restraint stress were significantly reversed by SHXXD. The results of both metabolomics and biochemical analysis indicated that SHXXD (800 mg/kg, p.o.) could improve the biochemical changes and metabolic disorders in restraint-stressed mice by antioxidation and anti-inflammation, enhancing the body's immune function and restoring several disturbed metabolic pathways (i.e., lipid metabolism, glycolysis and , inflammatory injury, and energy metabolism). Taken together, these results indicated that SHXXD has a potential antistress effect in restraint-stressed mice and could be considered as a candidate drug for stress-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977302>High-quality draft genome sequence of Gaiella occulta isolated from a 150 meter deep mineral water borehole and comparison with the genome sequences of other deep-branching lineages of the phylum Actinobacteria.</a></h2><p>Gaiella occulta strain F2-233 (=CECT 7815 = LMG 26412), isolated from a 150 meter deep mineral water aquifer, was deemed a candidate for high-quality draft genome sequencing because of the rare environment from which it was isolated. The draft genome sequence (QQZY00000000) of strain F2-233 is composed of approximately 3 Mb, predicted 3,119 protein-coding genes of which ,545 were assigned putative functions. Genome analysis was done by comparison with the other deep-branching Actinobacteria neighbors Rubrobacter radiotolerans, Solirubrobacter soli and Thermoleophilum album. The genes for the tricarboxylic acid cycle,  and pentose phosphate pathway, were identified in G. occulta, R. radiotolerans, S. soli and T. album genomes. Genes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and nitrate reduction were identified in G. occulta, R. radiotolerans and S. soli, but not in the T. album genome. Alkane degradation is precluded by genome analysis in G. occulta. Genes involved in myo-inositol metabolism were found in both S. soli and G. occulta genomes. A Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle with a type I RuBisCO was identified in G. occulta genome, as well. However, experimental growth under several conditions was negative and CO fixation could not be proven in G. occulta.© 2019 The Authors.

SCFAs are known to improve host metabolism but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL,  mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol--phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty acid synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated  and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883863>A novel berberine-metformin hybrid compound exerts therapeutic effects on obese type  diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the biological activities of a novel berberine-metformin hybrid compound (BMH473) as an anti-diabetic agent. BMH473 exhibited significant anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-hyperlipidaemic effects on T2DM rats. In white adipose tissue, BMH473 reduced the perirenal and epididymal adipose tissue mass and modulated the lesions in perirenal adipose tissue, by inhibiting the protein expressions of PPAR-Ɣ, C/EBP-α and SREBP-1c as well as the mRNA expressions of lipogenic genes. Moreover, BMH473 downregulated the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in perirenal adipose tissue through the suppression of p-NF-κB. In liver, BMH473 reduced liver ectopic fat accumulation, by regulating the protein expression levels of SREBP-1c and PPAR-α as well as the mRNA expression levels of lipogenic genes. In addition, BMH473 inhibited hepatic  by promoting the phosphorylation levels of AMPK α and ACC, and down-regulating the mRNA expression levels of FBPase, G6Pase and PEPCK. Furthermore, BMH473 exhibited significant inhibitory effects on lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by modulating the protein expression levels of PPAR-Ɣ, C/EBP-α and SREBP-1 c as well as the mRNA expression levels of lipogenic genes. In conclusion, our results suggest that the newly synthesized BMH473 is beneficial for maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis in type  diabetic rats, and exhibits better anti-hyperlipidaemic effects compared to metformin and berberine.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344838>The Administration of Chitosan-Tripolyphosphate-DNA Nanoparticles to Express Exogenous SREBP1a Enhances Conversion of Dietary Carbohydrates into Lipids in the Liver of .</a></h2><p>In addition to being essential for the transcription of genes involved in cellular lipogenesis, increasing evidence associates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) with the transcriptional control of carbohydrate metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overexpression SREBP1a, a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, on the intermediary metabolism of , a glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish. Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid driving expression of the N-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP1a significantly increased SREBP1a mRNA and protein in the liver of . Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in glycolysis- (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo--kinase/fructose-,6-bisphosphatase), fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase ), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) and desaturation (fatty acid desaturase ) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Beyond reporting the first study addressing in vivo effects of exogenous SREBP1a in a glucose-intolerant model, our findings support that SREBP1a overexpression caused multigenic effects that favoured hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis and thus enabled protein sparing by improving dietary carbohydrate conversion into fatty acids and cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549821>Whole Grain Brown Rice Extrudate Ameliorates the Symptoms of Diabetes by Activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT Insulin Pathway in db/db Mice.</a></h2><p>The therapeutic benefits of whole grains on diabetes mellitus have been continuously confirmed by in-depth research. To date, limited studies have investigated the effect of extruded products of whole grains on the insulin signaling pathway in vivo. This study investigated the effects of oral consumption of whole grain extrudate, including 97% brown rice and 3% defatted rice bran (w/w, BRD), on glucose metabolism and the hepatic insulin signaling pathway in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. BRD treatment induced a remarkable reduction in blood glucose. Moreover, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were ameliorated in the BRD-treated group compared with those in the db/db control group. BRD also increased the hepatic glycogen content by reducing the expression and increasing the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and their respective mRNA expression levels in the liver were simultaneously decreased in the BRD-treated group. BRD also significantly upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and increased the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and protein kinase B (AKT). These results indicate that BRD exhibits antidiabetic potential by activating the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, further regulating the expression of the  gene and p-GSK3β protein, thus inhibiting hepatic , increasing hepatic glycogen storage, and improving insulin resistance. Therefore, BRD could be used as a functional ingredient to alleviate the symptoms of hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202663>Short communication: Effect of manipulating fatty acid profile on gluconeogenic gene expression in bovine primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>During the peripartum period, dairy cows experience both an increase in circulating fatty acid (FA) profile and a change in circulating FA profile, which have been shown to alter regulation of gluconeogenic genes. The objective was to quantify gene expression of key enzymes involved in  and FA transport into the mitochondria in primary hepatocytes in response to exposure to an FA mixture mimicking what is circulating in a transition dairy cow with or without enrichment of C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 4 Holstein bull calves 3 d of age (± standard deviation  d) and cultured. Twenty-four hours after plating, treatments were applied to the cells for 24-h incubation. Treatments consisted of (1) control (1% BSA), () 0.75 mM FA cocktail (3% C14:0, 27% C16:0, 23% C18:0, 31% C18:1, 8% C18:, and 8% C18:3 to mimic the FA profile of dairy cattle at calving), (3) 0.90 mM FA cocktail, (4) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C16:0, (5) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:0, and (6) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:1. After harvest in Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction, purification, and reverse transcription. Abundance of mRNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of genes of interest [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, pyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase] was calculated relative to the average abundance of  reference genes (ribosomal protein L32 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which were the most stable out of 3 tested. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with the fixed effect of treatment and calf in the random statement. The addition of FA compared with the 1% BSA treatment increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and cytosolic PCK1. Enrichment with individual FA did not further regulate pyruvate carboxylase or PCK1 beyond that achieved by the basal profile. These results suggest that shifts in circulating FA profile within a biological range, without a difference in the total FA concentration, have minimal effects on transcriptional regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes in primary bovine hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

SCFAs may exert multiple beneficial effects on human lipid and glucose metabolism. However, their actions and underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the direct effects of propionate on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that propionate at a physiologically-relevant concentration effectively suppresses palmitate-enhanced glucose production in HepG2 cells but does not affect intracellular neutral lipid levels. Our results indicated that propionate can decline in  by down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a major regulator of the hepatic glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the -inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of .

Progressive axonal degeneration can lead to both Charcot-Marie-Tooth type  (CMT2) and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) depending on the affected neurons: peripheral motor and sensory nerves or central nervous system axons of the corticospinal tract and dorsal columns, respectively. Inherited axonopathies display an extreme degree of genetic heterogeneity of Mendelian high-penetrance genes. High locus heterogeneity is potentially advantageous to deciphering disease etiology by providing avenues to explore biological pathways in an unbiased fashion. Here, we investigate 'gene modules' in inherited axonopathies through a network-based analysis of the Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference (HIPPIE) database. We demonstrate that CMT2 and HSP disease proteins are significantly more connected than randomly expected. We define these connected disease proteins as 'proto-modules' and show the topological relationship of these proto-modules by evaluating their overlap through a shortest-path based measurement. In particular, we observe that the CMT2 and HSP proto-modules significantly overlapped, demonstrating a shared genetic etiology. Comparison of both modules with other diseases revealed an overlapping relationship between HSP and hereditary ataxia and between CMT2 + HSP and hereditary ataxia. We then use the DIseAse Module Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm to expand the proto-modules into comprehensive disease modules. Analysis of disease modules thus obtained reveals an enrichment of ribosomal proteins and pathways likely central to inherited axonopathy pathogenesis, including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, spliceosome, and mRNA processing. Furthermore, we determine pathways specific to each axonopathy by analyzing the difference of the axonopathy modules. CMT2-specific pathways include glycolysis and -related processes, while HSP-specific pathways include processes involved in viral infection response. Unbiased characterization of inherited axonopathy disease modules will provide novel candidate disease genes, improve interpretation of candidate genes identified through patient data, and guide therapy development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30721776>Proteomic and metabolomic responses in hepatopancreas of whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei infected by microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei.</a></h2><p>Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) causes hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis (HPM) in shrimp. HPM is not normally associated with shrimp mortality, but is associated with significant growth retardation. In this study, the responses induced by EHP were investigated in hepatopancreas of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei using proteomics and metabolomics. Among differential proteins identified, several (e.g., peritrophin-44-like protein, alpha2 macroglobulin isoform , prophenoloxidase-activating enzymes, ferritin, Rab11A and cathepsin C) were related to pathogen infection and host immunity. Other proteomic biomarkers (i.e., farnesoic acid o-methyltransferase, juvenile hormone esterase-like carboxylesterase 1 and ecdysteroid-regulated protein) resulted in a growth hormone disorder that prevented the shrimp from molting. Both proteomic KEGG pathway (e.g., "Glycolysis/" and "Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism") and metabolomic KEGG pathway (e.g., "Galactose metabolism" and "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids") data indicated that energy metabolism pathway was down-regulated in the hepatopancreas when infected by EHP. More importantly, the changes of hormone regulation and energy metabolism could provide much-needed insight into the underlying mechanisms of stunted growth in shrimp after EHP infection. Altogether, this study demonstrated that proteomics and metabolomics could provide an insightful view into the effects of microsporidial infection in the shrimp L. vannamei.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse palmitic acid (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty acid analogue. Thus, our data provides a possible mechanistic explanation for reversal of PA-mediated IR in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777782>Development of prediction model for fructose- 1,6- bisphosphatase inhibitors using the Monte Carlo method.</a></h2><p>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is an enzyme important for regulation of , which is a major process in the liver responsible for glucose production. Inhibition of FBPase enzyme causing blockage of the  process represents a newer scheme in the progress of anti-diabetic drugs. The current research describes the development of hybrid optimal descriptors-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models intended for a set of 62 FBPase inhibitors with the Monte Carlo method. The molecular structures were expressed by the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) notation. Three splits were prepared by random division of the molecules into training set, calibration set and validation set. Statistical parameters obtained from QSAR modelling were good for various designed splits. The best QSAR model showed the following parameters: the values of r for calibration set and validation set of the best model were 0.6837 and 0.8623 and of Q were 0.6114 and 0.8036, respectively. Based on the results obtained for correlation weights, different structural attributes were described as promoter of the endpoint. Further, these structural attributes were used in designing of new FBPase inhibitors and a molecular docking study was completed for the determination of interactions of the designed molecules with the enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31243102>Inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 by the S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 partly contributes to its glucose metabolic effects in muscle and liver cells.</a></h2><p>mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) are both involved in the development of obesity-linked insulin resistance. Recently, we showed that the S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 (PF) increases insulin sensitivity. However, we also reported that PF can increase glucose metabolism even in the absence of insulin in muscle and hepatic cells. Here we further explored the potential mechanisms by which PF increases glucose metabolism in muscle and liver cells independent of insulin. Time course experiments revealed that PF induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation before inhibiting S6K1. However, PF-induced glucose uptake was not prevented in primary muscle cells from AMPK α1/ double KO (dKO) mice. Moreover, PF-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production was maintained in hepatocytes derived from AMPK α1/-dKO mice. Remarkably, PF could still reduce glucose production and activate AMPK in hepatocytes from S6K1/ dKO mice. Mechanistically, bioenergetics experiments revealed that PF reduces mitochondrial complex I activity in both muscle and hepatic cells. The stimulatory effect of PF on glucose uptake was partially reduced by expression of the  NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in L6 cells. These results indicate that PF-mediated S6K1 inhibition is not required for its effect on insulin-independent glucose metabolism and AMPK activation. We conclude that, although PF rapidly activates AMPK, its ability to acutely increase glucose uptake and suppress glucose production does not require AMPK activation. Unexpectedly, PF rapidly inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, a mechanism that partially underlies PF's effect on glucose metabolism.© 2019 Shum et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30720195>RNA-seq analysis of diet-driven obesity and anti-obesity effects of quercetin glucoside or epigallocatechin gallate in Drosophila adults.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD) feeding stimulates fat accumulation in mammals and Drosophila. In the present study, we examined whether simultaneous feeding of familiar anti-obesity drugs, quercetin glycosides (QG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), to Drosophila has the same suppressive effect on fat accumulation as previously reported in rats and mice. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of HFD diet-induced obesity and the suppression effect of the drugs, we performed transcriptome analyses.We induced extra fat accumulation by feeding Drosophila fly food containing 20% coconut oil and quantified the triglyceride accumulated in flies. The effects of anti-obesity drugs were also evaluated. We isolated total RNA from each sample and performed RNA-seq analyses and quantitive Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate altered gene expression.The mRNA levels of several genes involved in lipid metabolism, glycolysis/, and anti-oxidative stress changed in HFD-fed adults. Moreover, the levels altered in those fed an HFD with QG or EGCG. The qRT-PCR further confirmed the RNA-seq data, suggesting that the expression of five essential genes for lipid metabolism changed in HFD-fed flies and altered in the flies treated with anti-obesity drugs. The most remarkable alteration was observed in the dHSL gene encoding a lipase involved in lipid-storage after HFD feeding and HFD with QG or EGCG. These alterations are consistent with HFD-induced fat accumulation as well as the anti-obesity effects of the drugs in mammals, suggesting that the genes play an important role in anti-obesity effects.These are the first reports to date of entire profiles of altered gene expression under the conditions of diet-induced obesity and its suppression by anti-obesity drugs in Drosophila.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299021>Use of the microbiome in the management of children with type  diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this review is to present recent data that defines our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in the development of T2DM.Recent studies focus on the physiology and molecular pathways of the gut microbiome-host interaction. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal  gene expression that controls glucose regulation. "Metabolic endotexemia" reflects a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that results from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release from the gut into the systemic circulation in response to a high-fat diet. Inflammatory pathways induced by LPS, activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and other inflammatory signaling pathways are mediators of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus.Recent scientific data support that derangements in the composition of the microbiota, termed "microbiome dysbiosis" is a factor in the development of "metabolic endotoxemia" and T2DM.

To clarify the defense mechanism in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), we observed phenotypic changes in resistant Huate (HT) and susceptible Hongyang (HY) kiwifruit varieties at 0, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 144 hour after inoculation (hai) with Psa. Brown lesions appeared in the inoculation areas 12 hai in HY shoots, and the lesion length gradually increased from 24 to 144 h. In contrast, no lesions were found in HT shoots at any time points. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis showed significantly more differentially expressed genes between HT and HY at 12 hai than at any other time point. According to weighted gene co-expression network analysis, five modules were notably differentially expressed between HT and HY; pathway mapping using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes database was performed for the five modules. In MEgreenyellow and MEyellow modules, pathways related to"plant-pathogen interaction", "Endocytosis", "Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism", and "Carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms" were enriched, whereas in the MEblack module, pathways related to "protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum", "plant-pathogen interaction", and "Glycolysis / " were enriched. In particular, the Pti1 and RPS2 encoding effector receptors, and the NPR1, TGA, and PR1 genes involved in the salicylic acid signaling pathway were significantly up-regulated in HT compared with HY. This indicates that the effector-triggered immunity response was stronger and that the salicylic acid signaling pathway played a pivotal role in the Psa defense response of HT. In addition, we identified other important genes, involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and Ca2+ internal flow, which were highly expressed in HT. Taken together, these results provide important information to elucidate the defense mechanisms of kiwifruit during Psa infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31203889>Photosynthesis and yield response to elevated CO, C plant foxtail millet behaves similarly to C species.</a></h2><p>Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is a nutrient-rich food source traditionally grown in arid and semi-arid areas, as it is well adapted to drought climate. Yet there is limited information as how the crop responses to the changing climate. In order to investigate the response of foxtail millet to elevated [CO] and the underlying mechanism, the crop was grown at ambient [CO] (400 μmol mol) and elevated [CO] (600 μmol mol) in an open-top chamber (OTC) experimental facility in North China. The changes in leaf photosynthesis, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, biomass, yield and global gene expression in response to elevated [CO] were determined. Despite foxtail millet being a C photosynthetic crop, photosynthetic rates (P) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi), were increased under elevated [CO]. Similarly, grain yield and above-ground biomass also significantly increased (P <  0.05) for the two years of experimentation under elevated [CO]. Increases in seeds and tiller number, spike and stem weight were the main contributors to the increased grain yield and biomass. Using transcriptomic analyses, this study further identified some genes which play a role in cell wall reinforcement, shoot initiation, stomatal conductance, carbon fixation, glycolysis /  responsive to elevated [CO]. Changes in these genes reduced plant height, increased stem diameters, and promote CO fixation. Higher photosynthetic rates at elevated [CO] demonstrated that foxtail millet was not photosynthetically saturated at elevated [CO] and its photosynthesis response to elevated [CO] were analogous to C plants.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Before modeling, EA (10 Hz/50 Hz, 1 mA) was applied to bilateral "Neiguan"(PC6) and "Hegu"(LI4) for 30 min, once daily for 7 successive days. After the treatment, serum samples were collected to be analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectroscopy. The orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to distinguish the serum differential metabolic profile of rats in different groups and identify potential biomarkers.After modeling, the ECG of model group and electroacupuncture groups showed T wave towering, and there was no obvious ST segment between R wave and T wave. The T wave decreased more than 0. mV after reperfusion, and there was no obvious ST segment. Compared with the control group, MIRI induced significant changes of metabolites in the serum including increase of acetoacetate acid, lectic acid, creatine, glycerol and glucose, and decrease of alanine, glutamine, glycerophosphoryl choline and phosphorylcholine. In comparison with the model group, PC6-EA preconditioning induced significant changes, including an increase of glucose, and a decrease of leucine，isoleucine, valine，3-hydroxybutyric acid，lactate，acetate，acetone，acetoacetate acid，pyruvic acid，glutamine，creatine and glycerol. There is no significant difference in metabolic patterns between "Hegu" group and model group. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the protective effect of PC6-EA pretreatment was realized mainly by regulating pathways of glycolysis, , citric acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, ketone body metabolism, etc.PC6-EA pretreatment has a role in regulating , pyruvate metabolism, amino metabolism, ketone body metabolism and energy metabolism in rats with MIRI, which maybe contribute to its protective effect on ischemic myocardium, but the specific metabolic pathways and mechanisms need being studied further.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271774>A concerted systems biology analysis of phenol metabolism in Rhodococcus opacus PD630.</a></h2><p>Rhodococcus opacus PD630 metabolizes aromatic substrates and naturally produces branched-chain lipids, which are advantageous traits for lignin valorization. To provide insights into its lignocellulose hydrolysate utilization, we performed C-pathway tracing, C-pulse-tracing, transcriptional profiling, biomass composition analysis, and metabolite profiling in conjunction with C-metabolic flux analysis (C-MFA) of phenol metabolism. We found that 1) phenol is metabolized mainly through the ortho-cleavage pathway; ) phenol utilization requires a highly active TCA cycle; 3) NADPH is generated mainly via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 4) active cataplerotic fluxes increase plasticity in the TCA cycle; and 5)  occurs partially through the reversed Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP). We also found that phenol-fed R. opacus PD630 generally has lower sugar phosphate concentrations (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) compared to metabolite pools in C-glucose-fed Escherichia coli (set as internal standards), while its TCA metabolites (e.g., malate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate) accumulate intracellularly with measurable succinate secretion. In addition, we found that phenol utilization was inhibited by benzoate, while catabolite repressions by other tested carbon substrates (e.g., glucose and acetate) were absent in R. opacus PD630. Three adaptively-evolved strains display very different growth rates when fed with phenol as a sole carbon source, but they maintain a conserved flux network. These findings improve our understanding of R. opacus' metabolism for future lignin valorization.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

We evaluated the effects of egg white hydrolysate (EWH), previously shown to modulate the protein abundance of RAS component in vivo, on glucose homeostasis in diet-induced insulin-resistant rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks to induce insulin resistance. They were then randomly divided into four groups receiving HFD or HFD supplemented with different concentrations of EWH (1,  and 4 %) for another 6 weeks in the first trial. In the second trial, insulin-resistant rats were divided into two groups receiving only HFD or HFD+4 % EWH for 6 weeks. Glucose homeostasis was assessed by oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests. Insulin signalling and protein abundance of RAS components,  enzymes and PPARγ were evaluated in muscle, fat and liver. Adipocyte morphology and inflammatory markers were evaluated. In vivo administration of EWH increased insulin sensitivity, improved oral glucose tolerance (P < 0·0001) and reduced systemic inflammation (P < 0·05). EWH potentiated insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation in muscle (P = 0·0341) and adipose tissue (P = 0·0276), but minimal differences in the protein abundance of tissue RAS components between the EWH and control groups were observed. EWH treatment also reduced adipocyte size (P = 0·0383) and increased PPARγ protein abundance (P = 0·0237). EWH treatment yielded positive effects on the inflammatory profile, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and adipocyte differentiation in HFD-induced insulin resistance rats.

Results showed that (-)-HCA decreased triglyceride content and lipid droplet counts, while these effects induced by (-)-HCA were reversed in chicken embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. (-)-HCA decreased malic enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c mRNA level, while increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPARα) mRNA level; and the action of (-)-HCA on lipid metabolism factors had completely eliminated in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. Chicken embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2 had eliminated the increasing of serum glucose and hepatic glycogen content induced by (-)-HCA. (-)-HCA decreased phosphofructokinase-1 and increased G6P, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase mRNA level in chicken embryos. Similarly, the effect of (-)-HCA on these key enzyme mRNA level was reversed in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2. Furthermore, (-)-HCA increased PPAR-γ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), PPARα, hepatic nuclear factor-4A, PEPCK, and CPT1A protein level, and these actions of (-)-HCA disappeared in embryos pre-transfected with sh4-ALDH3A2.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.Type  diabetic db/db mice are fed a chow diet with or without CAP treatment for 8 weeks. CAP administration markedly improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity through decreasing  and increasing glycogen synthesis in the liver. Furthermore, CAP inhibits the increase in abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and its bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity compared with levels in chow-fed mice, thereby leading to the accumulation of tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA), a natural antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) that is involved in the regulation of BA and glucose metabolism. CAP-induced suppression of enterohepatic FXR-fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signaling contributes to the increased BA pool size, followed by increases in the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and hepatic BA synthesis. Additionally, depleting gut microbiota by antibiotics administration abolishes the beneficial effects of CAP on BA metabolism and glucose homeostasis.CAP-induced improvements in BA and glucose metabolism are partially mediated by the gut microbiota-BA-enterohepatic FXR axis in db/db mice.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Since nuclear factor E2-related factor  (Nrf2) controls the expression of antioxidant- and detoxification genes, it is hypothesized that targeted activation of Nrf2 using phytochemicals is likely to protect pancreatic β-cells, from oxidative damage, thereby mitigates the complications of diabetes. Naringenin is one such activator of Nrf2. However, it is currently not known whether the protective effect of naringenin against streptozotocin (STZ) induced damage is mediated by Nrf2 activation. Hence, the potential of naringenin to activate Nrf2 and protect pancreatic β-cells from STZ-induced damage in MIN6 cells is studied. In MIN6 cells, naringenin could activate Nrf2 and its target genes GST and NQO1, thereby inhibit cellular apoptosis. In animals, administration of 50 mg/kg body weight naringenin, for 45 days, significantly decreased STZ-induced blood glucose levels, normalized the lipid profile, and augmented the levels of antioxidants in pancreatic tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis measuring the number of insulin-positive cells in pancreas showed restoration of insulin expression similar to control animals. Furthermore, naringenin promoted glycolysis while inhibiting . In conclusion, naringenin could be a good anti-diabetic agent, which works by promoting Nrf2 levels and by decreasing cellular oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970232>Baicalein improves glucose metabolism in insulin resistant HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) is the primary pathogenesis of Type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, often used in the clinical treatment of T2DM. Baicalein which is considered to have anti-IR effects is one of its active ingredients. IR-induced HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of baicalein on glucose metabolism and insulin-signaling pathway, using metformin as a positive control. We found that the use of both baicalein and metformin increased the glucose consumption of IR cells, as well as increasing the pyruvate kinase (PK) and glucokinase (GCK) activity. Also increased was the expression levels of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) pathway and glucose transporter  (GLUT2). Reduced expression levels were found in that of glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA. The results confirmed that baicalein (10 and 10 mol/L) promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis, inhibits  of hepatocytes to improve glucose metabolism, and may be as a result from regulation of InsR/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, baicalein has large concentration range on inhibiting IR, and at lower concentrations has strong anti-IR hepatocyte activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Treatments to reduce hyperglycemia and reestablish normal insulin signaling are much sought after. Any agent which could be orally administered to restore INSR function, in an insulin-independent manner, would have major implications for the management of this global disease. We have discovered a non-peptidyl small molecule, adenosine, 5'-Se-methyl-5'-seleno-, ',3'-diacetate [referred to as non-peptidyl compound #43 (NPC43)], which restores INSR signaling in the complete absence of insulin. Initial screening of numerous compounds in human HepG2 liver cells revealed that NPC43 significantly inhibited glucose production. The compound was potently anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperinsulinemic in vivo, in insulin-resistant T2D Lepr mice, following either acute or chronic treatment by oral gavage and intraperitoneal injection, respectively. The compound acted at the level of INSR and activated it in both liver and skeletal muscle of Lepr mice. In cell culture, the compound activated INSR in both liver and skeletal muscle cells; furthermore, it cooperated with insulin to depress glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) expression and stimulate glucose uptake, respectively. Our results indicated that the compound directly interacted with INSRα, triggering appropriate phosphorylation and activation of the receptor and its downstream targets. Unlike insulin, NPC43 did not activate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in either liver or skeletal muscle. We believe this compound represents a potential oral and/or injectable insulin replacement therapy for diabetes and diseases associated with insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853170>Comparative transcriptome analysis of skeletal muscle in ADSSL1 myopathy.</a></h2><p>ADSSL1 myopathy was recently identified as the cause of muscular disorders in Korean patients with distal myopathy. We generated transcriptome profiles of muscles from control subjects and patients with ADSSL1 myopathy. In the present study, RNA sequencing was conducted with seven vastus lateralis muscle samples from four patients with ADSSL1 myopathy and three control subjects. The hierarchical clustering result revealed a separation between myopathy and control groups. A total of 1,260 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed (|fold change| ≥ , p < 0.05), with 740 upregulated transcripts and 520 downregulated transcripts in myopathy group. Eighteen transcripts that mapped to purine metabolism pathway were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups, with ten downregulated transcripts and eight upregulated transcripts in myopathy group. In particular, three genes involved in purine nucleotide cycle (ADSSL1, ADSL, and AMPD1) were significantly downregulated in myopathy group. Ten transcripts in glycolysis/ pathway were also significantly differentially expressed. This is the first study on the altered expression of transcripts in muscle tissues from patients with ADSSL1 myopathy.

Its acute toxic effects on zebrafish and freshwater algae have been reported in our previous studies. To further investigate its chronic toxic effects to aquatic organisms, adult zebrafish were exposed for 28 days to a series of environmentally relevant boscalid concentrations in this study. Growth indicators and histopathology were determined in this study. Results indicated that boscalid inhibited the growth of zebrafish and induced damage in the kidneys and liver. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as the key pathways of energy metabolism in growth of zebrafish were also investigated. Results showed boscalid caused an increase in the activity of hexokinase (HK), the content of glycogen, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and insulin (INS) in liver and a decrease in blood glucose content and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Boscalid reduced the total content of triacylglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (TC) and the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) in the liver. Correspondingly, expression of the genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in liver and intestine was affected by boscalid, especially in the significant upregulation of G6Pase and pparα and downregulation of SGLT-1 and AMY. Results suggested that boscalid could affect carbohydrate metabolism of adult zebrafish via regulation of  and glycolysis at 0.1 mg/L. Moreover, boscalid might induce an increase in β-oxidation and a decrease in lipid synthesis at 0.01 mg/L. In conclusion, our study identified that carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are the possible biological pathways that mediate boscalid-induced developmental effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Asprosin stimulates hepatic  under fasting conditions. However, the roles of asprosin in inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle has not been studied. In the currents study, elevated levels of asprosin expression were observed in adipocytes under hyperlipidemic conditions. Treatment of C2C12 myocytes with asprosin-induced ER stress markers (phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 and eukaryotic initiation factor , and CHOP expression) as well as inflammation markers (interleukin-6 expression, phosphorylated IκB, and nuclear translocated nuclear factor-κβ). Finally, asprosin treatment promoted exacerbation of insulin sensitivity as determined by levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 and Akt phosphorylation as well as glucose uptake. Moreover, treatment of asprosin augmented protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, but suppressed messenger RNA expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ATPase 2b in both C2C12 myocytes and in mouse soleus skeletal muscle. These asprosin-induced effects were markedly decreased in small interfering (si) RNA-mediated PKCδ-knockdown in C2C12 myocytes.

Gid4, a subunit of the GID ubiquitin ligase in the yeast , is the recognition component (N-recognin) of the GID-mediated Pro/N-degron pathway. Gid4 targets proteins by recognizing their N-terminal Pro residues or a Pro at position , in the presence of distinct adjoining sequence motifs. Under conditions of low or absent glucose, cells make it through . When  grows on a nonfermentable carbon source, its gluconeogenic enzymes Fbp1, Icl1, Mdh2, and Pck1 are expressed and long-lived. Transition to a medium containing glucose inhibits the synthesis of these enzymes and induces their degradation by the Gid4-dependent Pro/N-degron pathway. While studying yeast Gid4, we identified a similar but uncharacterized yeast protein (YGR066C), which we named Gid10. A screen for N-terminal peptide sequences that can bind to Gid10 showed that substrate specificities of Gid10 and Gid4 overlap but are not identical. Gid10 is not expressed under usual (unstressful) growth conditions, but is induced upon starvation or osmotic stresses. Using protein binding analyses and degradation assays with substrates of GID, we show that Gid10 can function as a specific N-recognin of the Pro/N-degron pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096578>Dietary Supplementation of Vine Tea Ameliorates Glucose and Lipid Metabolic Disorder via Akt Signaling Pathway in Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>A traditional Chinese tea with many pharmacological effects, vine tea (VT) is considered a potential dietary supplement to improve type  diabetes (T2D). To investigate the effect and mechanism of VT on glucose and lipid metabolic disorders in T2D rats, Wistar rats fed a normal diet served as the normal control, while rats fed a high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D were divided into three groups: The model group (MOD); the positive control group (MET, metformin at 200 mg/kg/d); and the VT-treated group (VT500, allowed to freely drink 500 mg/L VT). After four weeks of intervention, biochemical metrics indicated that VT significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia in T2D rats. Metabolomics research indicated that VT regulated the levels of metabolites closely related to glucose and lipid metabolism and promoted glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, VT had a significant influence on the expression of key genes involved in the Akt signaling pathway, inhibited  through the Akt/Foxo1/Pck2 signaling pathway, and reduced fatty acid synthesis via the SREBP1c/Fasn signaling pathways.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic fatty acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased , lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30985866>Adipose tissue proteomic analysis in ketotic or healthy Holstein cows in early lactation.</a></h2><p>Ketosis is a major metabolic disorder of high-yielding dairy cows during the transition period. Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P-values < 0.05 and fold changes >1.5 or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by Western blot and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α (PDE1α), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK), were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 (PLIN1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and Regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits  and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty acid formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic acid (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl--chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin--ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin.

We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter  expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free fatty acid uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the liver were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550253>A mitochondria-targeted fatty acid analogue influences hepatic glucose metabolism and reduces the plasma insulin/glucose ratio in male Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>A fatty acid analogue, -(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA), was previously shown to have hypolipidemic effects in rats by targeting mitochondrial activity predominantly in liver. This study aimed to determine if 1-triple TTA could influence carbohydrate metabolism. Male Wistar rats were treated for three weeks with oral supplementation of 100 mg/kg body weight 1-triple TTA. Blood glucose and insulin levels, and liver carbohydrate metabolism gene expression and enzyme activities were determined. In addition, human myotubes and Huh7 liver cells were treated with 1-triple TTA, and glucose and fatty acid oxidation were determined. The level of plasma insulin was significantly reduced in 1-triple TTA-treated rats, resulting in a 32% reduction in the insulin/glucose ratio. The hepatic glucose and glycogen levels were lowered by 22% and 49%, respectively, compared to control. This was accompanied by lower hepatic gene expression of phosphenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in , and Hnf4A, a regulator of . Gene expression of pyruvate kinase, catalysing the final step of glycolysis, was also reduced by 1-triple TTA. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced, accompanied by 10-15-fold increased gene expression of its regulator pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 compared to control, suggesting reduced entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Indeed, the NADPH-generating enzyme malic enzyme 1 (ME1) catalysing production of pyruvate from malate, was increased 13-fold at the gene expression level. Despite the decreased glycogen level, genes involved in glycogen synthesis were not affected in livers of 1-triple TTA treated rats. In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway seemed to be increased as the hepatic gene expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was higher in 1-triple TTA treated rats compared to controls. In human Huh7 liver cells, but not in myotubes, 1-triple-TTA reduced glucose oxidation and induced fatty acid oxidation, in line with previous observations of increased hepatic mitochondrial palmitoyl-CoA oxidation in rats. Importantly, this work recognizes the liver as an important organ in glucose homeostasis. The mitochondrially targeted fatty acid analogue 1-triple TTA seemed to lower hepatic glucose and glycogen levels by inhibition of . This was also linked to a reduction in glucose oxidation accompanied by reduced PHD activity and stimulation of ME1 and G6PD, favouring a shift from glucose- to fatty acid oxidation.

In a previous study, we reported that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when glucose is available, the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex targets citrate synthase  (Cit2) for proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing the glyoxylate cycle, an anabolic pathway that replenishes the TCA cycle with succinate for the activation of . However, the roles of Ucc1 in other yeast species remain unclear. Here, we cloned orthologs of the F-box protein Ucc1 from Zygosaccharomyces bailii, an aggressive food spoilage microorganism that is the most acetic acid-tolerant yeast species, and Candida glabrata, an emerging fungal pathogen. These orthologs were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and their activities were tested genetically and biochemically. The results showed that Z. bailii Ucc1 rescued the ucc1Δ phenotype, suggesting the existence of a similar mechanism regulating the glyoxylate cycle in Z. bailii. By contrast, C. glabrata Ucc1 did not complement the ucc1Δ phenotype or exhibit a dominant negative effect on Ucc1. These results suggest the importance of analysing the regulatory mechanisms of glyoxylate cycle in a broad range of yeast species.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The proglucagon gene encodes it, and the proglucagon peptide is processed by prohormone convertase- (PC2) to produce the 29-amino acid mature peptide. Enhancement of glucagon transcription is by amino acids and cyclic AMP in the pancreas and intestinal cells, and Wnt signaling in the intestine.[3] Elevated plasma concentrations of glucagon and hyperglucagonemia contribute to the hyperglycemia of diabetes. Hyperglucagonemia also occurs in other clinical conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, glucagon-producing tumors and after gastric bypass surgery.[4] In this brief review, we cover the relevant biochemistry, physiology, measurement and clinical relevance of glucagon.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31449538>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a risk factor for large-for-gestational-age birthweight.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a well-recognized hepatic manifestation of metabolic disease in adults and has been associated with the development of gestational diabetes (GDM). Hepatic insulin resistance can result in increased release of glucose (from gluconeogenesis) and free fatty acids (due to enhanced lipolysis), which can lead in turn to fetal overgrowth. However, the relationship between maternal metabolic factors (such as circulating levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids [FFA], or adipokines) and excessive fetal birthweight in NAFLD has not been carefully examined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and the subsequent risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birthweight.Singleton nondiabetic pregnant women were evaluated for the presence of fatty liver at 10-14 weeks of gestation by abdominal ultrasound. The degree of fatty liver was classified as Grade 0-3 steatosis. At the time of liver ultrasound, maternal blood was taken after fasting and measured for adiponectin and FFA. LGA was defined as birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age.A total of 623 women were included in the analysis. The frequency of LGA was 10.9% (68/623), and the frequency of NAFLD was 18.9%. The risk of LGA increased significantly in patients with Grade -3 steatosis in the first trimester. The relationship between Grade -3 steatosis and LGA remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, and maternal serum triglyceride levels. The concentration of maternal blood adiponectin at 10-14 weeks was significantly lower in cases with LGA than non-LGA, but the maternal blood FFA concentrations were not different between the groups.The presence of Grade -3 steatosis on ultrasound in early pregnancy was associated with the increased risk of delivering an LGA infant, even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors including GDM. Adiponectin may be the linking biomarker between NAFLD and LGA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31287224>MicroRNA-351 eases insulin resistance and liver  via the PI3K/AKT pathway by inhibiting FLOT2 in mice of gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is known as different degree glucose intolerance that is initially identified during pregnancy. MicroRNAs (miRs) may be a potential candidate for treatment of GDM. Herein, we suggested that miR-351 could be an inhibitor in the progression of GDM via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes and predict miRs regulating flotillin  (FLOT2). Target relationship between miR-351 and FLOT2 was verified. Gestational diabetes mellitus mice were treated with a series of mimic, inhibitor and small interfering RNA to explore the effect of miR-351 on insulin resistance (IR), cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and liver  through evaluating GDM-related biochemical indexes, as well as expression of miR-351, FLOT2, PI3K/AKT pathway-, IR- and liver -related genes. MiR-351 and FLOT2 were reported to be involved in GDM. FLOT2 was the target gene of miR-351. Gestational diabetes mellitus mice exhibited IR and liver , up-regulated FLOT2, activated PI3K/AKT pathway and down-regulated miR-351 in liver tissues. Additionally, miR-351 overexpression and FLOT2 silencing decreased the levels of FLOT2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, glyeosylated haemoglobin and homeostasis model of assessment for IR index (HOMA-IR), extent of PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, yet increased the levels of HOMA for islet β-cell function, HOMA for insulin sensitivity index and glucose transporter  expression, indicating reduced cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissues and alleviated IR and liver . Our results reveal that up-regulation of miR-351 protects against IR and liver  by repressing the PI3K/AKT pathway through regulating FLOT2 in GDM mice, which identifies miR-351 as a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management of GDM.© 2018 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698225>Pros and cons of insulin administration on liver glucose metabolism in strength-trained healthy mice.</a></h2><p>Non-diabetic individuals use hormones like insulin to improve muscle strength and performance. However, as insulin also leads the liver and the adipose tissue to an anabolic state, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of insulin on liver metabolism in trained non-diabetic Swiss mice. The mice were divided into four groups: sedentary treated with saline (SS) or insulin (SI) and trained treated with saline (TS) or insulin (TI). Training was made in a vertical stair, at 90% of the maximum load, three times per week. Insulin (0.3 U/kg body weight) or saline were given intraperitoneally five times per week. After eight weeks, tissue and blood were collected and in situ liver perfusion with glycerol+lactate or alanine+glutamine (4 mM each) was carried out. The trained animals increased their muscle strength (+100%) and decreased body weight gain (-11%), subcutaneous fat (-42%), mesenteric fat (-45%), and peritoneal adipocyte size (-33%) compared with the sedentary groups. Insulin prevented the adipose effects of training (TI). The gastrocnemius muscle had greater density of muscle fibers (+60%) and less connective tissue in the trained groups. Liver glycogen was increased by insulin (SI +40% and TI +117%), as well as liver basal glucose release (TI +40%). Lactate and pyruvate release were reduced to a half by training. The greater  from alanine+glutamine induced by training (TS +50%) was reversed by insulin (TI). Insulin administration had no additional effect on muscle strength and reversed some of the lipolytic and gluconeogenic effects of the resistance training. Therefore, insulin administration does not complement training in improving liver glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31195667>Metabolomic Investigation of β-Thalassemia in Chorionic Villi Samples.</a></h2><p>Beta-thalassemias are blood disorders characterized by poorly understood clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to severe anemia. Metabolic composition of the human placenta could be affected by the presence of pathological states such as β-thalassemia. The aim of our study was to describe metabolic changes in chorionic villi samples of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia compared to a control group by applying a metabolomics approach.Chorionic villi samples were differentiated according to the genetic diagnosis of β-thalassemia: control (Group 1,  = 27); heterozygous (Group ,  = 7); homozygous (Group 3,  = 7). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect the metabolic composition of the samples. Subsequently, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis was performed. The discriminant metabolites were used to identify the altered pathways.Supervised multivariate models were devised to compare the groups. The model resulting from the comparison between Group 1 and Group 3 was the most significant. Discriminant metabolites were identified, and the most altered pathways were as follows: pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), arachidonic acid metabolism, glycolysis, and , suggesting the presence of an energetic shift toward the PPP and the presence of oxidative stress in β-thalassemia chorionic villi samples.The metabolomics approach identified a specific metabolic fingerprint in chorionic villi of fetuses affected by β-thalassemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30637773>Gene therapy prevents hepatic tumor initiation in murine glycogen storage disease type Ia at the tumor-developing stage.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (HCA/HCC) is a long-term complication of glycogen storage disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia), which is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC), a key enzyme in . Currently, there is no therapy to address HCA/HCC in GSD-Ia. We have previously shown that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated G6PC gene transfer to -week-old G6pc-/- mice prevents HCA development. However, it remains unclear whether G6PC gene transfer at the tumor developing stage of GSD-Ia can prevent tumor initiation or abrogate the pre-existing tumors. Using liver-specific G6pc-knockout (L-G6pc-/-) mice that develop HCA/HCC, we now show that treating the mice at the tumor-developing stage with rAAV-G6PC restores hepatic G6Pase-α expression, normalizes glucose homeostasis, and prevents de novo HCA/HCC development. The rAAV-G6PC treatment also normalizes defective hepatic autophagy and corrects metabolic abnormalities in the nontumor liver tissues of both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice. However, gene therapy cannot restore G6Pase-α expression in the HCA/HCC lesions and fails to abrogate any pre-existing tumors. We show that the expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 that mediates local glucocorticoid activation is downregulated in HCA/HCC lesions, leading to impairment in glucocorticoid signaling critical for  activation. This suggests that local glucocorticoid action downregulation in the HCA/HCC lesions may suppress gene therapy mediated G6Pase-α restoration. Collectively, our data show that rAAV-mediated gene therapy can prevent de novo HCA/HCC development in L-G6pc-/- mice at the tumor developing stage, but it cannot reduce any pre-existing tumor burden.© 2019 SSIEM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804987>Identification of Candidate Genes for the Plateau Adaptation of a Tibetan Amphipod, , Through Integration of Genome and Transcriptome Sequencing.</a></h2><p>The amphipod  has been distributing in the Tibetan region with well-known uplifts of the Tibetan plateau.

The insulin-signaling pathway requires insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2, which are found to be dysregulated in diabetes and obesity. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1A) is a fasting-induced transcriptional coactivator. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in patients with type  diabetes, low hepatic PGC1A levels are associated with insulin resistance. However, how PGC1A activity impacts the hepatic insulin-signaling pathway is still unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function models in mouse primary hepatocytes and measured hepatocyte insulin response by gene and protein expression and ex vivo glucose production. We found that the PGC1A level determines the relative ratio of IRS1 and IRS2 in hepatocytes, impacting insulin receptor signaling via protein kinase B/AKT (AKT). PGC1A drove the expression of IRS2 downstream of glucagon signaling while simultaneously reducing IRS1 expression. We illustrate that glucagon- or PGC1A-induced IRS2 expression was dependent on cAMP Response Element Binding Protein activity and that this was essential for suppression of hepatocyte  in response to insulin in vitro. We also show that increased hepatic PGC1A improves glucose homeostasis in vivo, revealing a counterregulatory role for PGC1A in repressing uncontrolled glucose production in response to insulin signaling. These data highlight a mechanism by which PGC1A plays dual roles in the control of  during the fasting-to-fed transition through regulated balance between IRS1 and IRS2 expression.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

To promote a comprehensive insight into the molecular basis of EHEC O157:H7 physiology and pathogenesis, the combined proteome of EHEC O157:H7 strains, Clade 8 and Clade 6 isolated from cattle in Argentina, and the standard EDL933 (clade 3) strain has been analyzed. From shotgun proteomic analysis a total of ,644 non-redundant proteins of EHEC O157:H7 were identified, which correspond approximately 47% of the predicted proteome of this pathogen. Normalized spectrum abundance factor analysis was performed to estimate the protein abundance. According this analysis, 50 proteins were detected as the most abundant of EHEC O157:H7 proteome. COG analysis showed that the majority of the most abundant proteins are associated with translation processes. A KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that Glycolysis /  was the most significant pathway.

N-methyladenosine affects mRNA stability and translation efficiency, and impacts cell differentiation and stress response. To determine if there is a role for mA in β-cells, we investigated the effect of Mettl14, a key component of the mA methyltransferase complex, on β-cell survival and function using rat insulin- promoter-Cre-mediated deletion of Mettl14 mouse line (βKO). We found that βKO mice with normal chow exhibited glucose intolerance, lower levels of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased β-cell death and decreased β-cell mass. In addition, HFD-fed βKO mice developed glucose intolerance, decreased β-cell mass and proliferation, exhibited lower body weight, increased adipose tissue mass, and enhanced insulin sensitivity due to enhanced AKT signaling and decreased  in the liver. HFD-fed βKO mice also showed a decrease in de novo lipogenesis, and an increase in lipolysis in the liver. RNA sequencing in islets revealed that Mettl14 deficiency in β-cells altered mRNA expression levels of some genes related to cell death and inflammation. Together, we showed that Mettl14 in β-cells plays a key role in β-cell survival, insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The molecular mechanisms accounting for increased glucose production remain controversial. Our aims were to review recent literature concerning molecular mechanisms regulating glucose production and to discuss these mechanisms in the context of physiological experiments and observations in humans and large animal models.Genetic intervention studies in rodents demonstrate that insulin can control hepatic glucose production through both direct effects on the liver, and through indirect effects to inhibit adipose tissue lipolysis and limit gluconeogenic substrate delivery. However, recent experiments in canine models indicate that the direct effects of insulin on the liver are dominant over the indirect effects to regulate glucose production. Recent molecular studies have also identified insulin-independent mechanisms by which hepatocytes sense intrahepatic carbohydrate levels to regulate carbohydrate disposal. Dysregulation of hepatic carbohydrate sensing systems may participate in increased glucose production in the development of diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451389>Screen for fitness and virulence factors of Francisella sp. strain W12-1067 using amoebae.</a></h2><p>Francisella tularensis is the causative agent of the human disease referred to as tularemia. Other Francisella species are known but less is understood about their virulence factors. The role of environmental amoebae in the life-cycle of Francisella is still under discussion. Francisella sp. strain W12-1067 (F-W12) is an environmental Francisella isolate recently identified in Germany which is negative for the Francisella pathogenicity island, but exhibits a putative alternative type VI secretion system. Putative virulence factors have been identified in silico in the genome of F-W12. In this work, we established a "scatter screen", used earlier for pathogenic Legionella, to verify experimentally and identify candidate fitness factors using a transposon mutant bank of F-W12 and Acanthamoeba lenticulata as host organism. In these experiments, we identified 79 scatter clones (amoeba sensitive), which were further analyzed by an infection assay identifying 9 known virulence factors, but also candidate fitness factors of F-W12 not yet described as fitness factors in Francisella. The majority of the identified genes encoded proteins involved in the synthesis or maintenance of the cell envelope (LPS, outer membrane, capsule) or in the metabolism (, gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway). Further C-flux analysis of the Tn5 glucokinase mutant strain revealed that the identified gene indeed encodes the sole active glucokinase in F-W12. In conclusion, candidate fitness factors of the new Francisella species F-W12 were identified using the scatter screen method which might also be usable for other Francisella species.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Yet, it is unknown whether sFRP4 action contributes to the development of these pathologies. Here, we determined whether sFRP4 expression in visceral fat associates with NAFLD and whether it directly interferes with insulin action and lipid and glucose metabolism in primary hepatocytes and myotubes. The association of sFRP4 with clinical measures was investigated in obese men with or without type  diabetes and with or without biopsy-proven NAFLD. To determine the impact of sFRP4 on metabolic parameters, primary human myotubes (hSkMC), or primary hepatocytes from metabolic healthy C57Bl6 and from systemic insulin-resistant mice, i.e. aP2-SREBP-1c, were used. Gene expression of sFRP4 in visceral fat from obese men associated with insulin sensitivity, triglycerides and NAFLD. In C57Bl6 hepatocytes, sFRP4 disturbed insulin action. Specifically, sFRP4 decreased the abundance of IRS1 and FoxO1 together with impaired insulin-mediated activation of Akt-signalling and glycogen synthesis and a reduced suppression of  by insulin. Moreover, sFRP4 enhanced insulin-stimulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL). In hSkMC, sFRP4 induced glycolysis rather than inhibiting insulin signalling. Finally, in hepatocytes from aP2-SREBP-1c mice, sFRP4 potentiates existing insulin resistance. Collectively, we show that sFRP4 interferes with hepatocyte insulin action. Physiologically, sFRP4 promotes DNL in hepatocytes and glycolysis in myotubes. These sFRP4-mediated responses may result in a vicious cycle, in which enhanced rates of DNL and glycolysis aggravate hepatic lipid accumulation and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cocoa has anti-diabetic effects by lowering glucose levels. However, whether cocoa exerts beneficial effects on the renal cortex glucose homeostasis and the molecular mechanisms responsible for this possible protective activity remain largely unknown. Thus, the potential anti-diabetic properties of cocoa on insulin signalling, glucose transporters and gluconeogenic enzymes were evaluated in the renal cortex of Zucker Diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Male ZDF rats were fed a control or cocoa-rich diet (10%), and Zucker Lean animals received the control diet. ZDF rats supplemented with cocoa (ZDF-Co) showed decreased body weight gain, glucose and insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and structural alterations in renal cortex. Moreover, cocoa-rich diet ameliorated insulin resistance by reverting decreased tyrosine-phosphorylated-insulin receptor levels and by preventing the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3/glycogen synthase pathway (GSK-3/GS) in the renal cortex of ZDF-Co rats. Cocoa antihyperglycaemic effect also appeared to be mediated through the diminution of phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), sodium-glucose-co-transporter- (SGLT-), and glucose-transporter- (GLUT-) levels in ZDF-Co rat's renal cortex. These findings demonstrate that cocoa alleviates renal injury by contributing to maintain the glucose homeostasis in type  diabetic ZDF rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Adenovirus-mediated hepatic knockdown of Bhmt-AS improved pyruvate tolerance, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, overexpression of Bhmt restored the decreased glucose production caused by knockdown of Bhmt-AS in primary hepatocytes.

It has been well established that long-term treatment with metformin improves glucose tolerance in mice by inhibiting hepatic . Interestingly, a single dose of orally administered metformin acutely lowers blood glucose levels, however, little is known about the mechanism involved in this effect. Glucose tolerance, as assessed by the glucose tolerance test, was improved in response to prior oral metformin administration when compared to vehicle-treated mice, irrespective of whether the animals were fed either the standard or high-fat diet. Blood glucose-lowering effects of acutely administered metformin were also observed in mice lacking functional AMP-activated protein kinase, and were independent of glucagon-like-peptide-1 or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors signaling. [F]-FDG/PET revealed a slower intestinal transit of labeled glucose after metformin as compared to vehicle administration. Finally, metformin in a dose-dependent but indirect manner decreased glucose transport from the intestinal lumen into the blood, which was observed ex vivo as well as in vivo.

Fish were fed six practical diets with graded leucine levels ranging from 0.90 to .94% of dry basis for 8 weeks. The trial results showed that, compared to the control group (0.90%), optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) resulted in the up-regulation of mRNA expression related to insulin signaling pathway, including target of rapamycin (TOR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt). However, an excessive leucine level (.94%) led to protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) overexpression and inhibited TOR, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt mRNA expressions. The protein level of TOR, S6K1, IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt showed a similar result with mRNA level of these genes. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) significantly improved plasma insulin content, while high level of leucine showed an inhibiting phenomenon. Optimal dietary leucine level (1.72%) could reduce plasma glucose by enhancing the ability of glycometabolism including improving glucose transporter  (GLUT2), glucokinase (GK) expressions and down-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression. While an excessive leucine level (.94%) resulted in high plasma glucose by inhibiting the ability of glycometabolism including lowering GLUT2 and GK expressions, and improving glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and PEPCK expressions. The relative expressions of pyruvate kinase (PK) and glycogen synthase (GS) were not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. Dietary leucine level of 1.33% could improve plasma triglyceride content (TG) by enhancing lipogenesis including improving sterol-response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) expressions compared to the control group (0.90%). Total cholesterol (TC) was not significantly affected by dietary leucine levels. The present results indicate that optimal leucine level could improve glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis through improving insulin sensitivity in juvenile blunt snout bream.

We further revealed that QVO suppressed hepatic  involving calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β- and liver kinase B1-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways as well as AMPK-independent mitochondrial function-related signaling pathway. To evaluate QVO's anti-T2DM activity in vivo, which was impeded by the complicated synthesis route of QVO with a low yield, we designed and synthesized 4-[-(1H-indol-3-yl)vinyl]quinoline (IVQ) as a prodrug with easier synthesis route and higher yield. IVQ did not inhibit the HGP in primary hepatocytes in vitro. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that IVQ was quickly converted to QVO in mice and rats following administration. In both db/db and ob/ob mice, oral administration of IVQ hydrochloride (IVQ-HCl) (23 and 46 mg/kg every day, for 5 weeks) ameliorated hyperglycemia, and suppressed hepatic  and activated AMPK signaling pathway in the liver tissues. Furthermore, IVQ caused neither cardiovascular system dysfunction nor genotoxicity. The good druggability of IVQ has highlighted its potential in the treatment of T2DM and the prodrug design for anti-T2DM drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597092>The RNA-Binding Protein A1CF Regulates Hepatic Fructose and Glycerol Metabolism via Alternative RNA Splicing.</a></h2><p>The regulation of hepatic gene expression has been extensively studied at the transcriptional level; however, the control of metabolism through posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA-binding proteins in physiological and disease states is less understood. Here, we report a major role for the hormone-sensitive RNA-binding protein (RBP) APOBEC1 complementation factor (A1CF) in the generation of hepatocyte-specific and alternatively spliced transcripts. Among these transcripts are isoforms for the dominant and high-affinity fructose-metabolizing ketohexokinase C and glycerol kinase, two key metabolic enzymes that are linked to hepatic  and found to be markedly reduced upon hepatic ablation of A1cf. Consequently, mice lacking A1CF exhibit improved glucose tolerance and are protected from fructose-induced hyperglycemia, hepatic steatosis, and development of obesity. Our results identify a previously unreported function of A1CF as a regulator of alternative splicing of a subset of genes influencing hepatic glucose production through fructose and glycerol metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The present investigation was aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), metabolic gene networks and metabolic pathways in bovine liver transcriptome of young bulls. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the bovine liver transcriptome of dairy (Polish Holstein Friesian (HF);  = 6), beef (Hereford;  = 6), and dual purpose (Polish-Red;  = 6) cattle breeds. This study identified 895, 338, and 571 significant ( < 0.01) differentially expressed (DE) gene-transcripts represented as 745, 265, and 498 hepatic DE genes through the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red breeds comparisons, respectively. By combining all breeds comparisons, 75 hepatic DE genes ( < 0.01) were identified as commonly shared among all the three breed comparisons; 70, 160, and 38 hepatic DE genes were commonly shared between the following comparisons: (i) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Hereford; (ii) Polish-Red versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red; and (iii) Polish-HF versus Hereford and Polish-HF versus Polish-Red, respectively. A total of 440, 82, and 225 hepatic DE genes were uniquely observed for the Polish-Red versus Hereford, Polish-HF versus Hereford, and Polish-Red versus Polish-HF comparisons, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified top-ranked enriched GO terms ( < 0.01) including 17, 16, and 31 functional groups and 151, 61, and 140 gene functions that were DE in all three breed liver transcriptome comparisons. Gene network analysis identified several potential metabolic pathways involved in glutamine family amino-acid, triglyceride synthesis, , p38MAPK cascade regulation, cholesterol biosynthesis (Polish-Red versus Hereford); IGF-receptor signaling, catecholamine transport, lipoprotein lipase, tyrosine kinase binding receptor (Polish-HF versus Hereford), and PGF-receptor binding, (Polish-HF versus Polish-Red). Validation results showed that the relative expression values were consistent to those obtained by RNA-seq, and significantly correlated between the quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and RNA-seq (Pearson's r  > 0.90). Our results provide new insights on bovine liver gene expressions among dairy versus dual versus beef breeds by identifying the large numbers of DEGs markers submitted to NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE114233, which can serve as useful genetic tools to develop the gene assays for trait-associated studies as well as, to effectively implement in genomics selection (GS) cattle breeding programs in Poland.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221621>Multi-omics insights into functional alterations of the liver in insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The liver regulates the availability of insulin to other tissues and is the first line insulin response organ physiologically exposed to higher insulin concentrations than the periphery. Basal insulin during fasting inhibits hepatic  and glycogenolysis, whereas postprandial insulin peaks stimulate glycogen synthesis. The molecular consequences of chronic insulin deficiency for the liver have not been studied systematically.We analyzed liver samples of a genetically diabetic pig model (MIDY) and of wild-type (WT) littermate controls by RNA sequencing, proteomics, and targeted metabolomics/lipidomics.Cross-omics analyses revealed increased activities in amino acid metabolism, oxidation of fatty acids, ketogenesis, and  in the MIDY samples. In particular, the concentrations of the ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase  (HMGCS2) and of retinol dehydrogenase 16 (RDH16), which catalyzes the first step in retinoic acid biogenesis, were highly increased. Accordingly, elevated levels of retinoic acid, which stimulates the expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), were measured in the MIDY samples. In contrast, pathways related to extracellular matrix and inflammation/pathogen defense response were less active than in the WT samples.The first multi-omics study of a clinically relevant diabetic large animal model revealed molecular signatures and key drivers of functional alterations of the liver in insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus.

To determine its role in the diabetic kidney, type 1 diabetic Akita mice with tubular NHE3 knockdown [Pax8-Cre; NHE3-knockout (KO) mice] were generated. NHE3-KO mice had higher urine pH, more bicarbonaturia, and compensating increases in renal mRNA expression for genes associated with generation of ammonium, bicarbonate, and glucose (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) in proximal tubules and H and ammonia secretion and glycolysis in distal tubules. This left blood pH and bicarbonate unaffected in nondiabetic and diabetic NHE3-KO versus wild-type mice but was associated with renal upregulation of proinflammatory markers. Higher renal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression in NHE3-KO mice was associated with lower Na-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) and higher SGLT1 expression, indicating a downward tubular shift in Na and glucose reabsorption. NHE3-KO was associated with lesser kidney weight and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) independent of diabetes and prevented diabetes-associated albuminuria. NHE3-KO, however, did not attenuate hyperglycemia or prevent diabetes from increasing kidney weight and GFR. Higher renal  may explain similar hyperglycemia despite lower SGLT2 expression and higher glucosuria in diabetic NHE3-KO versus wild-type mice; stronger SGLT1 engagement could have affected kidney weight and GFR responses. Chronic kidney disease in humans is associated with reduced urinary excretion of metabolites of branched-chain amino acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a pattern mimicked in diabetic wild-type mice. This pattern was reversed in nondiabetic NHE3-KO mice, possibly reflecting branched-chain amino acids use for ammoniagenesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle upregulation to support formation of ammonia, bicarbonate, and glucose in proximal tubule. NHE3-KO, however, did not prevent the diabetes-induced urinary downregulation in these metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590832>Cold Acclimation of the Thermoacidophilic Red Alga Galdieria sulphuraria: Changes in Gene Expression and Involvement of Horizontally Acquired Genes.</a></h2><p>Galdieria sulphuraria is a unicellular red alga that lives in hot, acidic, toxic metal-rich, volcanic environments, where few other organisms survive. Its genome harbors up to 5% of genes that were most likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These genes probably contributed to G.sulphuraria's adaptation to its extreme habitats, resulting in today's polyextremophilic traits. Here, we applied RNA-sequencing to obtain insights into the acclimation of a thermophilic organism towards temperatures below its growth optimum and to study how horizontally acquired genes contribute to cold acclimation. A decrease in growth temperature from 42ï¿½C/46ï¿½C to 28ï¿½C resulted in an upregulation of ribosome biosynthesis, while excreted proteins, probably components of the cell wall, were downregulated. Photosynthesis was suppressed at cold temperatures, and transcript abundances indicated that C-metabolism switched from  to glycogen degradation. Folate cycle and S-adenosylmethionine cycle (one-carbon metabolism) were transcriptionally upregulated, probably to drive the biosynthesis of betaine. All these cold-induced changes in gene expression were reversible upon return to optimal growth temperature. Numerous genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer displayed temperature-dependent expression changes, indicating that these genes contributed to adaptive evolution in G.sulphuraria.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2018.

This study aims to investigate how microRNA-122-5p (miR-122) regulates the hepatic IR in vitro. We first found that the miR-122 level was upregulated in the liver of rats fed with a high-fat diet and injected with streptozotocin (T2D rats), while the expression level of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), a potential target of miR-122, was downregulated in the diabetic liver. In vitro, glucosamine-induced IR was introduced in HepG2 hepatic cells, and the levels of miR-122 and IGF-1R were further assessed. An increase of miR-122 level and a decrease of IGF-IR level were observed in IR hepatic cells, which was the same as that in the diabetic liver. Results of the luciferase reporter assay validated IGF-1R as a direct target of miR-122. Moreover, in IR HepG2 cells, antagonizing miR-122 with its specific inhibitor enhanced glucose uptake and suppressed the expression of glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two key enzymes in regulating . Such alterations induced by the miR-122 inhibitor in IR hepatic cells were impaired when IGF-1R was simultaneously knocked down. In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway was deactivated in IR cells, and then reactivated with miR-122 inhibitor transfection.

However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely clear. Here, we aimed to explore the role of PPP1R3C in metformin-mediated inhibition of hepatic .The differentially expressed genes in primary mouse hepatocytes incubated with 8-Br-cAMP and metformin were analyzed by microarrays. Hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expressions were detected after adenovirus-mediated overexpression or silence of PPP1R3C in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation level and location of transducer of regulated CREB activity  (TORC2) were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence.Metformin and adenovirus-mediated activation of AMPK suppressed 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated Ppp1r3c mRNA expression in primary mouse hepatocytes. Overexpression of PPP1R3C in primary mouse hepatocytes or the livers of wild-type mice promoted hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expressions. On the contrary, adenovirus-mediated knockdown of PPP1R3C in primary mouse hepatocytes decreased hepatic , with the suppression of cAMP-stimulated gluconeogenic gene expressions and TORC2 dephosphorylation. Notably, Ppp1r3c expression was increased in the liver of db/db mice. After PPP1R3C silence in the livers of wild-type and db/db mice, blood glucose levels and hepatic glucose production were markedly lowered, with decreased expressions of key gluconeogenic enzymes and transcript factors as well as liver glycogen content.Metformin-activated AMPK decreases hepatic PPP1R3C expression, leading to the suppression of hepatic  through blocking cAMP-stimulated TORC2 dephosphorylation.

Previous work showed endogenous glucose production is reduced in GNMT-null mice with gluconeogenic precursors being used in alternative biosynthetic pathways that utilize methyl donors and are linked to tumorigenesis. This metabolic programming occurs before the appearance of HCC in GNMT-null mice. The metabolic physiology that sustains liver tumor formation in GNMT-null mice is unknown. The studies presented here tested the hypothesis that nutrient flux pivots from glucose production to pathways that incorporate and metabolize methyl groups in GNMT-null mice with HCC.H/C metabolic flux analysis was performed in conscious, unrestrained mice lacking GNMT to quantify glucose formation and associated nutrient fluxes. Molecular analyses of livers from mice lacking GNMT including metabolomic, immunoblotting, and immunochemistry were completed to fully interpret the nutrient fluxes.GNMT knockout (KO) mice showed lower blood glucose that was accompanied by a reduction in liver glycogenolysis and . NAD was lower and the NAD(P)H-to-NAD(P) ratio was higher in livers of KO mice. Indices of NAD synthesis and catabolism, pentose phosphate pathway flux, and glutathione synthesis were dysregulated in KO mice.Glucose precursor flux away from glucose formation towards pathways that regulate redox status increase in the liver. Moreover, synthesis and scavenging of NAD are both impaired resulting in reduced concentrations.

Metabolic parameters, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were measured. Histopathologic analysis and the levels of serum or hepatic biochemicals were assessed to evaluate diabetic liver injury and steatosis.

Its widespread use resulted in constant human exposure including fetal development and postnatal life. Epidemiological and experimental data have shown that DEHP has a negative influence on glucose homeostasis. However, the evidence regarding the effect of maternal DEHP exposure on hepatic glucose homeostasis is scarce. Hence, we investigated whether DEHP exposure during gestation and lactation disrupts glucose homeostasis in the rat F male offspring at adulthood. Pregnant rats were divided into three groups and administered with DEHP (10 and 100 mg/kg/day) or olive oil from gestational day 9 to postnatal day 21 (lactation period) through oral gavage. DEHP-exposed offspring exhibited hyperglycemia, impaired glucose and insulin tolerances along with hyperinsulinemia at postnatal day 80. DEHP exposure significantly reduced the levels of insulin signaling molecules such as insulin receptors, IRS1, Akt and its phosphorylated forms. GSK3β and FoxO1 proteins increased in DEHP-exposed groups whereas its phosphorylated forms decreased. Treated groups showed decreased glycogen synthase activity and glycogen concentration. Glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA level and enzyme activity increased in DEHP-treated groups. The interaction between FoxO1-glucose-6-phosphatase and FoxO1-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was also increased. This study suggests that DEHP exposure impairs insulin signal transduction and alters glucoregulatory events leading to the development of type  diabetes in F male offspring.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30824102>Dendrobium huoshanense polysaccharide regulates hepatic glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β-cell function in type  diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the hypoglycemic mechanism of a homogeneous Dendrobium huoshanense polysaccharide (GXG) was investigated using type  diabetic (T2D) mouse model.

Goats were fasted for 24 h followed by a 9-h intravenous infusion of an AA mixture plus glucose. Milk yield was recorded and samples were taken in h  to 8 of the infusion period, and mammary biopsy was performed in the last hour. Treatments were graded removal of Met from the infused AA mixture to achieve Met content in the infusate of 100 (complete), 60, 30, or 0% of that in casein. Graded Met removal decreased yield of milk, milk protein, and lactose linearly and tended to decrease yield of milk fat linearly. Milk protein yield decreased to 82, 78, and 69% that of complete mixture infusion, respectively, when the 60, 30, and 0% Met infusate was infused. Circulating Met decreased linearly with graded Met removal. Arterial and venous Met decreased to 36 and 23% that of complete mixture infusion, respectively, when all Met was removed out of the mixture. Concomitant with the decreased circulating concentration was a similar increase in mammary Met affinity as reflected by the linearly increased mammary Met clearance rate. The increased affinity plus the linearly increased mammary blood flow totally offset the negative effect of decreased circulating Met concentration on mammary Met uptake. The overall result was similar mammary Met uptakes across treatments ranging from 285.9 to 339.5 μmol/h. Mammary uptakes of the other AA measured were generally not affected by treatments except for a linearly decreased Thr uptake and a trend of linearly increased Glu uptake. Consistent with the behavior of an AA mainly catabolized in the liver and mainly used for protein synthesis in peripheral tissues, mammary uptake to milk output ratios of Met measured in the present study ranged from 1.25 to 1.49 and was not affected by treatments. For the other AA measured, the ratio of Thr was linearly decreased and that of Glu was linearly increased by graded Met removal. Graded Met removal linearly elevated circulating urea N and glucose concentrations, indicating enhanced whole-body catabolism of AA and hepatic . Treatments had no significant effects on circulating insulin, growth hormone, and the other hormones and metabolites measured. Phosphorylation status of eIF4E binding protein 1 tended to decrease linearly and that of p70S6k was linearly decreased by graded Met removal, indicating depressed signal in the intracellular mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. In conclusion, results of the present study indicated that the mTORC1 pathway and whole-body AA catabolism rather than mammary uptake appeared the drivers for changes in milk protein synthesis in response to varying Met supply.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, OXT's short half-life in circulation and lack of receptor selectivity limit its application and efficacy. In this study, we report an OXT peptide analog (OXT) that is potent and selective for the OXT receptor (OXTR). OXT, but not OXT, activated vasopressin receptors  and acutely increased blood pressure  when administered IP. OXT suppressed food intake in mice, whereas OXT had a moderate effect on food intake when administered IP or intracerebroventricularly. Both OXT (IP) and OXT (IP) improved glycemic control in glucose tolerance tests. Additionally, both OXT (IP) and OXT (IP) stimulated insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and glucagon secretion in mice. We generated lipid-conjugated OXT (acylated-OXT) and OXT (acylated-OXT) and demonstrated that these molecules have significantly extended half-lives . Compared with OXT, -week treatment of diet-induced obese mice with acylated-OXT [subcutaneous(ly) (SC)] resulted in enhanced body weight reduction, an improved lipid profile, and gene expression changes consistent with increased lipolysis and decreased . Treatment with acylated-OXT (SC) also resulted in a statistically significant weight loss, albeit to a lesser degree compared with acylated-OXT treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that selective activation of the OXTR pathway results in both acute and chronic metabolic benefits, whereas potential activation of vasopressin receptors by nonselective OXT analogs causes physiological stress that contributes to additional weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30770755>Identification of differentially expressed proteins in the injured lung from zinc chloride smoke inhalation based on proteomics analysis.</a></h2><p>Lung injury due to zinc chloride smoke inhalation is very common in military personnel and leads to a high incidence of pulmonary complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to uncover the underlying mechanisms of lung injury due to zinc chloride smoke inhalation using a rat model.Histopathology analysis of rat lungs after zinc chloride smoke inhalation was performed by using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Mallory staining. A lung injury rat model of zinc chloride smoke inhalation (smoke inhalation for 1, , 7 and 14 days) was developed. First, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantization (iTRAQ) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify important differentially expressed proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were used to study the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins. Then, analysis of lung injury repair-related differentially expressed proteins in the early (day 1 and day ) and middle-late stages (day 7 and day 14) of lung injury after smoke inhalation was performed, followed by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of these differentially expressed proteins. Finally, the injury repair-related proteins PARK7 and FABP5 were validated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.Morphological changes were observed in the lung tissues after zinc chloride smoke inhalation. A total of 27 common differentially expressed proteins were obtained on days 1, , 7 and 14 after smoke inhalation. WGCNA showed that the turquoise module (which involved 909 proteins) was most associated with smoke inhalation time. Myl3, Ckm, Adrm1 and Igfbp7 were identified in the early stages of lung injury repair. Gapdh, Acly, Tnni2, Acta1, Actn3, Pygm, Eno3 and Tpi1 (hub proteins in the PPI network) were identified in the middle-late stages of lung injury repair. Eno3 and Tpi1 were both involved in the glycolysis/ signalling pathway. The expression of PARK7 and FABP5 was validated and was consistent with the proteomics analysis.The identified hub proteins and their related signalling pathways may play crucial roles in lung injury repair due to zinc chloride smoke inhalation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30697723>Hexose monophosphate shunt, the role of its metabolites and associated disorders: A review.</a></h2><p>The hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt acts as an essential component of cellular metabolism in maintaining carbon homeostasis. The HMP shunt comprises two phases viz. oxidative and nonoxidative, which provide different intermediates for the synthesis of biomolecules like nucleotides, DNA, RNA, amino acids, and so forth; reducing molecules for anabolism and detoxifying the reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress. The HMP shunt is significantly important in the liver, adipose tissue, erythrocytes, adrenal glands, lactating mammary glands and testes. We have researched the articles related to the HMP pathway, its metabolites and disorders related to its metabolic abnormalities. The literature for this paper was taken typically from a personal database, the Cochrane database of systemic reviews, PubMed publications, biochemistry textbooks, and electronic journals uptil date on the hexose monophosphate shunt. The HMP shunt is a tightly controlled metabolic pathway, which is also interconnected with other metabolic pathways in the body like glycolysis, , and glucuronic acid depending upon the metabolic needs of the body and depending upon the biochemical demand. The HMP shunt plays a significant role in NADPH formation and in pentose sugars that are biosynthetic precursors of nucleic acids and amino acids. Cells can be protected from highly reactive oxygen species by NADPH  . Deficiency in the hexose monophosphate pathway is linked to numerous disorders. Furthermore, it was also reported that this metabolic pathway could act as a therapeutic target to treat different types of cancers, so treatments at the molecular level could be planned by limiting the synthesis of biomolecules required for proliferating cells provided by the HMP shunt, hence, more experiments still could be carried out to find additional discoveries.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526292>MicroRNA-27a/b Negatively Regulates Hepatic  by Targeting FOXO1.</a></h2><p>In the context of hepatic insulin resistance, hepatic  is abnormally increased, which results in increased hepatic glucose production and hyperglycemia but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

In previous work, administration of sodium salicylate (SS) for 7 d led to hypoglycemia in mature dairy cows in early lactation. The purpose of this study was to identify the mode of action underlying this response to SS. Twenty mature (parity 3) cows were assigned alternately at time of calving to either control or SS treatments; the control received a molasses placebo in drinking water, whereas SS received .3 g/L of SS with the molasses carrier in drinking water for 7 d after parturition. Blood samples were collected daily. A glucose turnover assay was performed on d 7, followed by liver, muscle, and adipose tissue biopsies. There were no treatment effects on intake of dry matter or water. Tumor necrosis factor α mRNA abundance tended to be decreased by SS in adipose tissue but not in muscle or liver, and plasma haptoglobin and adiponectin concentrations were not altered by treatment. Treatment did not significantly alter plasma glucose or insulin concentrations, but plasma glucagon concentration tended to be increased by SS and the insulin:glucagon molar ratio was significantly decreased. Cows on SS had a tendency for a 25% decrease in glucose turnover rate compared with control cows. However, there were no differences in transcript abundance of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) or glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) in liver or of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in any of the tissues. Finally, SS did not alter insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation in muscle or adipose, but tended to increase phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and decrease protein kinase B phosphorylation in adipose tissue. These findings may be explained by enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity leading to posttranscriptional suppression of  and adaptive responses to decreased glucose supply in the pancreas and adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leads to rapid resolution of type  diabetes (T2D). Decreased hepatic insulin resistance is key, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that changes in intestinal function and subsequent changes in portal venous milieu drive some of these postoperative benefits. We therefore aimed to evaluate postoperative changes in portal milieu. Two rat strains, healthy [Sprague-Dawley (SD)] and obese diabetic [Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)] rats, underwent RYGB or control surgery. After 4 wk, portal and systemic blood was sampled before and during an intestinal glucose bolus to investigate changes in intestinal glucose absorption (G) and utilization (G), and intestinal secretion of incretins and glucagon-like peptide- (GLP-). Hepatic activity of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), which degrades incretins, was also measured. RYGB decreased G in both rat strains. G increased in SD rats and decreased in ZDF rats. In both strains, there was increased expression of intestinal hexokinase and  enzymes. Systemic incretin and GLP- levels also increased after RYGB. This occurred without an increase in secretion. Hepatic DPP4 activity and expression were unchanged. RYGB perturbs multiple intestinal pathways, leading to decreased intestinal glucose absorption and increased incretin levels in both healthy and diabetic animals. In diabetic rats, intestinal glucose balance shifts toward glucose release. The portal vein as the gut-liver axis may integrate these intestinal changes to contribute to rapid changes in hepatic glucose and hormone handling. This fresh insight into the surgical physiology of RYGB raises the hope of less invasive alternatives.  Portal milieu after gastric bypass surgery is an underinvestigated area. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass perturbs multiple intestinal pathways, reducing intestinal glucose absorption and increasing incretin levels. In diabetic rats, the intestine becomes a net releaser of glucose, increasing portal glucose levels. The portal vein as the gut-liver axis may integrate these intestinal changes to contribute to changes in hepatic glucose handling. This fresh insight raises the hope of less invasive alternatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307210>Ileal interposition surgery targets the hepatic TGF-β pathway, influencing  and mitochondrial bioenergetics in the UCD-T2DM rat model of diabetes.</a></h2><p>Ileal interposition (IT) is a surgical procedure that increases the delivery of incompletely digested nutrients and biliary and pancreatic secretions to the distal intestinal mucosa. Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in -mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type  diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1.5 mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], lipogenesis, and . Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (,  and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles. This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of metabolic pathways that complement the effects of IT surgery to maximize its benefits and potentially identify similarly effective, durable, and less invasive therapeutic options for metabolic disease, including inhibitors of TGF-β signaling.-Hung, C., Napoli, E., Ross-Inta, C., Graham, J., Flores-Torres, A.

However, whether these two different pathogeny induced same pathological outcomes contain common genetic targets or signaling pathway, the current research has not paid great attention. GSE121190 and GSE35257 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. While GSE121190 represents a differential expression profile in kidney of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model, GSE35257 represents cisplatin nephrotoxicity model. By using GEO2R, 965 differential expression genes (DEGs) in GSE121190 and 930 DEGs in GSE35257 were identified. 43 co-DEGs were shared and were extracted for protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Subsequently, three shared pathways including glycolysis/, fatty acid degradation and pathways in cancer were involved in two models with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. We reconfirmed that these three pathways have relatively high scores by using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. Additionally, further bioinformatic analysis showed that Aldehyde dehydrogenase- (Aldh2) involved in the progression of renal fibrosis by mediating glycolysis pathway Then real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to validate the expression of Aldh2 in kidney tissue after three different etiologies that caused renal fibrosis. Basically consistent with our bioinformatics results, our experiment showed that the expression of Aldh2 is the most significantly decreased in the UUO model, followed by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model and finally the cisplatin-induced model. Thus, Aldh2 can act as a common potential genetic target for different renal fibrosis diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In patients with T2D, reduced blood Mg levels are associated with an increased decline in renal function, independent of glycemic control and hypertension. To study the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon, we investigated the renal effects of hypomagnesemia in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice. In mice fed a low dietary Mg, the HFD resulted in severe hypomagnesemia within 4 wk. Renal or intestinal Mg wasting was not observed after 16 wk on the diets. Despite the absence of urinary or fecal Mg loss, the HFD induced a reduction in the mRNA expression transient receptor potential melastatin type 6 in both the kidney and colon. mRNA expression of distal convoluted tubule (DCT)-specific genes was down-regulated by the LowMg-HFD, indicating atrophy of the DCT. The low dietary Mg resulted in severe HFD-induced proximal tubule phospholipidosis, which was absent in mice on a NormalMg-HFD. This was accompanied by albuminuria, moderate renal damage, and alterations in renal energy metabolism, including enhanced  and cholesterol synthesis. In conclusion, this study shows that hypomagnesemia is a consequence of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, hypomagnesemia induces major structural changes in the diabetic kidney, including proximal tubular phospholipidosis, providing a novel mechanism for the increased renal decline in patients with hypomagnesemic T2D.-Kurstjens, S., Smeets, B., Overmars-Bos, C., Dijkman, H.

Following 3 d of acclimation, cows were enrolled in  experimental periods (P). During P1 (3 d), cows were fed ad libitum and baseline data were collected. In P2 (8 d), cows were assigned to 1 of  treatments: (1) saline-infused and pair-fed (CON-PF; i.v. sterile saline at 40 mL/h; n = 5) or () LPS-infused and fed ad libitum (LPS-AL; Escherichia coli O55:B5 at 0.017, 0.020, 0.026, 0.036, 0.055, 0.088, 0.148, and 0.148 µg/kg of body weight per hour for d 1 through 8, respectively; n = 6). During P2, CON-PF cows were pair-fed to LPS-AL cows to eliminate confounding effects of dissimilar nutrient intake. Blood samples were collected on d 1 and  of P1 and d 1, 3, 5, and 7 of P2. Following the P2 d 7 a.m. milking, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver biopsies were collected for reverse transcription quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. To assess whole-body nutrient trafficking, an i.v. glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed following the a.m. milking on P2 d 8; 4 h after the GTT, cows received an epinephrine challenge. During P2, there were no treatment differences in circulating glucose. Relative to P1, CON-PF cows had or tended to have decreased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and insulin (29 and 47%, respectively) during P2, whereas neither variable changed in LPS-AL cows, leading to an overall increase in β-hydroxybutyrate and insulin (41 and 140%, respectively) relative to CON-PF cows. Circulating nonesterified fatty acids were increased from d 1 to 3 and subsequently decreased from d 3 to 7 in cows from both treatments. Blood urea nitrogen gradually decreased in CON-PF cows and increased in LPS-AL cows from d 1 to 5 of P2, resulting in an overall 25% increase in LPS-AL versus CON-PF cows. In response to the GTT, the glucose and insulin area under the curve were increased 33 and 56%, respectively, in LPS-AL compared with CON-PF cows; changes reflective of whole-body insulin resistance. However, protein abundance of insulin signaling markers within muscle, liver, and adipose tissue were similar between treatments. There were no observable treatment differences in the glucose or nonesterified fatty acids response to the epinephrine challenge. No treatment differences were observed in hepatic mRNA abundance of key gluconeogenic or lipid export enzymes. In conclusion, chronic LPS exposure altered multiple parameters of basal and stimulated metabolism, but did not appear to affect the molecular machinery evaluated herein.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, drought stress reduces forage production through plant damage. Here, we studied the transcriptional profiles of common vetch exposed to drought in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in this species. The genome of the common vetch has not been sequenced, therefore we used Illumina sequencing to generate de novo transcriptomes. Nearly 500 million clean reads were used to generate 174,636 transcripts, including 122,299 unigenes. In addition, 5313 transcription factors were identified and these transcription factors were classified into 79 different gene families. We also identified 11,181 SSR loci from di- to hexa-nucleotides whose repeat number was greater than five. On the basis of differentially expressed genes, Gene Ontology analysis identified many drought-relevant categories, including "oxidation-reduction process", "lipid metabolic process" and "oxidoreductase activity". In addition to these, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified pathways, such as "Plant hormone signal transduction", "Glycolysis/" and "Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis", as differentially expressed in the plants exposed to drought.

In this study, Notothenia rossii survived 90 days at 8 °C, and their condition factor level was maintained. However, their hepatosomatic (0.29×) index decreased, indicating a decrease in nutrient storage as a result of changes in the energy demands to support survival. At 8 °C, the plasma calcium, magnesium, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations decreased, whereas the glucose (1.91×) and albumin (1.26×) concentrations increased. The main energy substrate of the fish changed from lipids to glucose due to a marked increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, as demonstrated by an increase in anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, malate dehydrogenase activity increased in all tissues, suggesting that fish acclimated at 8 °C exhibit enhanced . The aerobic demand increased only in the liver due to an increase (.23×) in citrate synthase activity. Decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase to levels that are most likely sufficient at 8 °C were observed, establishing a new physiological activity range for antioxidant defense. Our findings indicate that N. rossii has some compensatory mechanisms that enabled its long-term survival at 8 °C.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278438>Exon  deletion represents a common mutation in Turkish patients with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency.</a></h2><p>Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency is an autosomal recessive inborn error of .

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino acids. The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids.

The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino acid carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino acids during normal metabolism.

We identified a total of 7723 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 1243 were significantly differentially expressed in Chang 7- following drought stress, 572 of which were up-regulated and 671 were down-regulated; 419 DEPs were identified in TS141, 172 of which were up-regulated and 247 were down-regulated. In Chang 7-, the DEPs were associated with ribosome pathway, glycolysis/ pathway, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In TS141, the DEPs were associated with metabolic pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, and starch and sucrose metabolism. Compared with TS141, the higher drought tolerance of Chang 7- root system was attributed to a stronger water retention capacity; the synergistic effect of antioxidant enzymes; the strengthen cell wall; the osmotic stabilization of plasma membrane proteins; the effectiveness of recycling amino acid; and an improvement in the degree of lignification.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which DEHP or MEHP perturbs hepatic glucose homeostasis, we compared the effect of DEHP (0-200 μM) and MEHP (0-200 μM) on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells. In this study, we found that MEHP can induce more severe impairments in glucose homeostasis than DEHP can; these include increased hepatic  via receptor substrate-1/protein kinase B/fork-head box protein O1 (IRS-1/AKT/FOXO1)-mediated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) up-regulation, as well as decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis via glucokinase (GCK) inhibition and IRS-1/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-mediated glycogen synthase (GYS) inactivation. Additionally, our results demonstrated that retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), an insulin resistance-inducing factor, plays a critical role in the MEHP-induced disorder of glucose homeostasis and the dysfunction of insulin signaling transduction, whereas the deletion of RBP4 by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) significantly reversed these toxic effects. Although these should be interpreted with caution in view of limited in vivo evidence, the present study provides the first in vitro evidence for potential involvements of RBP4 in disturbance of glucose homeostasis in the MEHP-treated HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In response to Western diet feeding, an increase in adipocyte clusterin expression was associated with a progressive increase in liver fat, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis in aged LDLR mice.Adipocyte-derived clusterin is a novel ECM-related protein linking cardiometabolic disease and obesity through its actions in the liver.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672442>Active pyruvate dehydrogenase and impaired  in orthotopic hepatomas of rats.</a></h2><p>Therapies targeting altered activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) have been proposed for hepatomas. However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both  and energy production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) /4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and  were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition to a teleost-specific whole genome duplication approximately 320-350 million years ago, rainbow trout and salmonids in general underwent an additional salmonid lineage-specific genome duplication event approximately 80 million years ago. Through the recent sequencing of salmonid genome sequences, including the rainbow trout, the identification and study of duplicated genes has become available. A particular focus of interest has been the evolution and regulation of rainbow trout gluconeogenic genes, as recent molecular and gene expression evidence points to a possible contribution of previously uncharacterized gluconeogenic gene paralogues to the rainbow trout long-studied glucose intolerant phenotype. Since the publication of the initial rainbow trout genome draft, resequencing and annotation have further improved genome coverage. Taking advantage of these recent improvements, we here identify a salmonid-specific genome duplication of ancestral mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  isoenzyme, we termed pck2a and pck2b. Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and, more recently mitochondrial Pck2, are considered to be the rate-limiting enzymes in de novo . Following in silico confirmation of salmonid pck2a and pck2b evolutionary history, we simultaneously profiled cytosolic pck1 and mitochondrial pck2a and pck2b expression in rainbow trout liver under several experimental conditions known to regulate hepatic . Cytosolic pck1 abundance was increased by nutritional (diets with a high protein to carbohydrate ratio compared to diets with a low carbohydrate to protein ratio) and glucoregulatory endocrine factors (glucagon and cortisol), revealing that the well-described transcriptional regulation of pck1 in mammals is present in rainbow trout. Conversely, and in contrast to mammals, we here describe endocrine regulation of pck2a (decrease in abundance in response to glucagon infusion), and nutritional, social-status-dependent and hypoxia-dependent regulation of pck2b. Specifically, pck2b transcript abundance increased in trout fed a diet with a low protein to carbohydrate ratio compared to a diet with a high protein to carbohydrate ratio, in dominant fish compared to subordinate fish as well as hypoxia. This specific and differential expression of rainbow trout pck2 ohnologues is indicative of functional diversification, and possible functional consequences are discussed in light of the recently highlighted gluconeogenic roles of mitochondrial pck2 in mammalian models.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The encoding gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product was characterized. The recombinant protein was produced in soluble and active form. Phosphofructokinase activity of TK0376 was metal-ion dependent and the highest activity (5090 μmol min mg) was found in the presence of Co followed by Mg (3280 μmol min mg) at 90°C and pH 7.5. TK0376 preferred ADP as phosphoryl donor, however, it could be replaced by ATP but with a 5-fold lower activity. It catalyzed the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate and dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In addition, it was able to phosphorylate glucose and nucleosides but with a much lower rate compared to that of fructose 6-phosphate. The apparent k and K values against fructose 6-phosphate were 4238 s and 0.74 mM, respectively. The rate of dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 3-times lower at 50°C than the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate. Similarly, the rate of phosphorylation of glucose was 450-fold lower than that of fructose 6-phosphate. Phosphofructokinase activity was not allosterically regulated, but it was slightly enhanced by phosphoenol pyruvate, and inhibited by ATP and AMP in a competitive manner.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

It also contributes to the maintenance of cellular functions, such as Ca storage, lipogenesis, , and organelle biogenesis. Cellular stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia and disturbance of Ca homeostasis, may increase the risk of protein misfolding and perturb proteostasis. This activates ER stress and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to either the restoration of homeostasis or cell death. ER stress and UPR have been shown to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis, progression and treatment response of various cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), one of the most aggressive cancer types, critical functions of ER stress signaling have also started to emerge. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge linking ER stress and UPR to GC; we also discuss the possible nodes of therapeutic intervention and propose directions of future research.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

The median survival time for patients with GBM is 15 months. GBM resistance to treatment is associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). CD133 membrane glycoprotein is the best‑known marker of GBM CSCs. The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the proliferation of all stem cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to examine the expression levels of proteins associated with the Wnt signaling pathway in СD133+ CSCs of human GBM. Furthermore, potential targets that may regulate СD133+ CSCs in human GBM were investigated. The human GBM U‑87MG cell line was cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor and no serum. Immunohistochemical characteristics of glioma spheres were investigated based on the expression of key markers of CSCs. CD133+ cells were extracted from glioma spheres by cell sorting and then lysed. High‑performance liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry was used for proteome analysis. Lysates of CD133‑ cells in GBM were used for comparison. The present study was the first to describe the conceptual proteome differences between GBM and CD133+ CSCs of the common pool. Major differences were identified in the glycolysis/, focal adhesion, tight junction and Wnt signaling pathways. This study aimed to analyze the crucial role that proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway play in stem cell proliferation. The identified proteins were analyzed for their association with the Wnt signaling pathway using the international open databases PubMed, Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. An increased expression of 12 proteins associated with the Wnt signaling pathway were identified in GBM CD133+ CSCs, which included catenin β‑1, disheveled associated activator of morphogenesis 1, RAC family small GTPase  and RAS homolog gene family member A, a number of which are also associated with adherens junctions. The Wnt signaling pathway is not upregulated in CSCs; however, the high expression levels of adenomatous polyposis coli, β‑catenin, C‑terminal binding protein (CtBP) and RuvB‑like AAA ATPase 1 (RUVBL1 or Pontin52) proteins suggest the possibility of alternative activation of specific genes in the nuclei of these cells. Calcyclin‑binding protein, casein kinase II α, casein kinase II β, CtBP1, CtBP2, CUL1 and RUVBL1 proteins may be used as targets for the pharmaceutical regulation of CSCs in complex GBM treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602139>Metabolic response of longitudinal muscles to acute hypoxia in sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka): A metabolome integrated analysis.</a></h2><p>Hypoxia is a severe problem in aquatic environments worldwide and has caused mass mortality of sea cucumbers (& other species) for decades, seriously affecting the sustainable development of aquaculture. Investigations of the metabolic disruptions and biochemical responses associated with acute hypoxia stress in sea cucumbers can provide a theoretical basis and guidance for improving aquaculture. A metabolomics approach to characterize changes in the profiles of endogenous small molecules in response to acute hypoxia can help to identify the main underlying causes of metabolic damage and potentially suggest solutions to alleviate to improve viability. The current study uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and multivariate analysis methods to evaluate the metabolic profile of longitudinal muscles from A. japonicus exposed to acute hypoxia stress (by bubbling the aquaria water with nitrogen aeration to decrease dissolved oxygen to  mg/L in  min) for 6 or 24 h (experimental groups EG6 or EG24) and control group (CG, n = 10, respectively). The results showed that 29 and 62 metabolites were influenced significantly in EG6 and EG24, respectively, mainly including lipids, glycosides and their derivatives. Levels of most lipids (fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and sterols) were elevated in both experimental groups, and increased with elongation of hypoxia, implying that the homeostasis of synthesis and degradation of lipids and their derivatives was strongly affected by hypoxia stress. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to further assess the importance of differential metabolite expression to the development of the A. japonicus response to hypoxia, showing that 4 (fatty acid biosynthesis, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, glycolysis/, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism) and  (steroid biosynthesis, longevity regulating pathway) pathways were markedly enriched in EG6 and EG24, respectively. These results suggested that fatty acid synthesis was strengthened significantly in both treatment groups, and the degree was higher in EG24 than in EG6, providing valuable information towards understanding the special adaptive mechanism of A. japonicus to hypoxia stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluated the effects of water-soluble proteins of Korean pine nut obtained from a dilute alkali extract on carbohydrate metabolism of type  diabetic mice on a model of diabetes induced using a high fat diet combined with streptozotocin. The results showed that the hypoglycemic effect of PNP at a middle dose was the most significant, which was 38.7% lower than that of control. The extract significantly improved the oral glucose tolerance and liver indexes, increased the activity of the carbohydrate metabolism enzymes, and regulated the expression of the function of key genes for carbohydrate metabolism. It had a positive effect on both insulin resistance and glycolytic/ signaling. In conclusion, PNP can regulate fasting blood glucose, improve insulin resistance, correct the glucose metabolism disorder in diabetic mice, and have a positive regulatory role.

Metformin functions in part by activating 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, reducing hepatic  and blood glucose. Metformin also upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Several population studies have shown levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) positively correlate with insulin resistance. Because BCAA catabolic enzyme content is regulated by PGC-1α, we hypothesized metformin may alter BCAA catabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of metformin at varying concentrations on myotube metabolism and related gene and protein expression. C2C12 myotubes were treated with metformin at 30 uM (physiological) or  mM (supraphysiological) for up to 24 hours. Metabolic gene expression was measured via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, protein expression was measured using Western blot, and mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism were measured via oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate, respectively. Supraphysiological metformin upregulated PGC-1α mRNA expression along with related downstream targets, yet the reduced expression of electron transport chain components as well as basal and peak cell metabolism. Supraphysiological metformin also suppressed branched-chain aminotransferase  (BCAT2) and branched-chain-alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase E1a (BCKDHa) mRNA expression as well as BCAT2 protein expression and BCKDHa activity, which was accompanied by decreased Kruppel-like factor 15 protein expression. Physiological levels of metformin suppressed BCKDHa and cytochrome c oxidase mRNA expression at early time points (4-12 hours) but had no effect on any other outcomes. Together these data suggest metformin may suppress BCAA catabolic enzyme expression or activity, possibly reducing levels of circulating gluconeogenic substrates.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609623>Gymnemic Acid Ameliorate Hyperglycemia Through PI3K/AKT and AMPK Mediated Signaling Pathway in T2DM Rats.</a></h2><p>Gymnemic acid (GA) isolated from gymnema sylvestre (Retz.)

In this study, GA (40, 80 mg/kg/day) was evaluated by type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats to explore its hypoglycemic activity and underlying mechanisms of action. The results indicated that GA decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations by 26.7 %, and lowered insulin concentrations by 16.1 % after oral administration of GA at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks in T2DM rats. Our data showed that RT-PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that GA up-regulated the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthesis (GS), promoted the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), while down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in T2DM rats. In addition, key proteins involved in AMPK-mediated  (such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)) were down-regulated in GA-treated T2DM rats. In summary, the hypoglycemic mechanisms of GA may be related to promoting insulin signal transduction and activating PI3K/Akt and AMPK-mediated signaling pathway in T2DM rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744350>Effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on metabolites, lipolysis and  in Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on metabolites, lipolysis and  in cows during the transition period.Thirty-nine Holstein dry cows were blocked and assigned randomly to three groups, fed a high energy density diet (HD, 1.62 Mcal of net energy for lactation [NEL]/kg dry matter [DM]), a medium energy density diet (MD, 1.47 Mcal NEL/kg DM), or a low energy density diet (LD, 1.30 Mcal NEL/kg DM) prepartum; they were fed the same lactation diet to 28 days in milk (DIM). All the cows were housed in a free-stall barn and fed ad libitum.The reduced energy density diets decreased the blood insulin concentration and increased nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration in the prepartum period (p<0.05). They also increased the concentrations of glucose, insulin and glucagon, and decreased the concentrations of NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate during the first  weeks of lactation (p<0.05). The plasma urea nitrogen concentration of both prepartum and postpartum was not affected by dietary energy density (p>0.05). The dietary energy density had no effect on mRNA abundance of insulin receptors, leptin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in adipose tissue, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α in liver during the transition period (p>0.05). The HD cows had higher mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase at 3 DIM compared with the MD cows and LD cows (p = 0.001).

We assessed if increased MG glycation induced proteotoxic stress, identifying related metabolic drivers and protein targets. Human aortal endothelial cells (HAECs) were incubated in high glucose concentration (20 mM versus 5 mM control) in vitro for 3-6 days. Flux of glucose metabolism, MG formation and glycation and changes in cytosolic protein abundances, MG modification and proteotoxic responses were assessed. Similar studies were performed with human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells where similar outcomes were observed. HAECs exposed to high glucose concentration showed increased cellular concentration of MG (.27 ± 0.21 versus 1.28 ± 0.03 pmol/10 cells, P < 0.01) and formation of MG-modified proteins (24.0 ± 3.7 versus 14.1 ± 3. pmol/10 cells/day; P < 0.001). In proteomics analysis, high glucose concentration increased proteins of the heat shock response - indicating activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) with downstream inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses. Proteins susceptible to MG modification were enriched in protein folding, protein synthesis, serine/threonine kinase signalling, glycolysis and . MG was increased in high glucose by increased flux of MG formation linked to increased glucose metabolism mediated by proteolytic stabilisation and increase of hexokinase- (HK-); later potentiated by proteolytic down regulation of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) - the major enzyme of MG metabolism. Silencing of Glo1, selectively increasing MG, activated the UPR similarly. Silencing of HK- prevented increased glucose metabolism and MG formation. trans-Resveratrol and hesperetin combination (tRES-HESP) corrected increased MG and glucose metabolism by increasing expression of Glo1 and decreasing expression of HK-. Increased MG glycation activates the UPR in endothelial cells and thereby may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetic vascular disease where tRES-HESP may provide effective therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081787>Review: Therapeutic potential of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Enzymes are biological catalyst involve in different biochemical reactions.

It is a potential drug target in the treatment of type II diabetes. The protein is also associated with a rare inherited metabolic disease and some cancer cells lack FBPase activity which promotes glycolysis facilitating the Warburg effect. Thus, there is interest in both inhibiting the enzyme (for diabetes treatment) and restoring its activity (in relevant cancers). The mammalian enzyme is tetrameric, competitively inhibited by Fructose ,6-phosphate and negatively allosterically regulated by AMP. This allosteric regulation requires information transmission between the AMP binding site and the active site of the enzyme. A recent paper by Topaz et al. ( (2019) , pii:BSR20180960) has added additional detail to our understanding of this information transmission process. Two residues in the AMP binding site (Lys and Tyr) were shown to be involved in initiating the message between the two sites. This tyrosine residue has recently be shown to be important with protein's interaction with the antidiabetic drug metformin. A variant designed to increase metal ion affinity (M248D) resulted in a five-fold increase in enzymatic activity. Interestingly alterations of two residues at the subunit interfaces (Tyr and Met) resulted in increased responsiveness to AMP.

The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm  on mice with type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied . The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote glycolysis.

A variety of antidiabetic drugs are available with different mechanisms of action, and multiple drugs are often used concomitantly to improve glycemic control. One of the newest classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents is the sodium glucose cotransporter- (SGLT2) inhibitors or "flozins". Recent clinical guidelines have suggested the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy in patients for whom metformin alone does not achieve glycemic targets, or as initial dual therapy with metformin in patients who present with higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The FDA has approved fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets with each of the three available SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) and metformin. Both drug classes are associated with the rare but serious life-threatening complications that result from metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis (with metformin) and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (with SGLT2 inhibitors). This review summarizes the current literature on the pharmacokinetics and the molecular targets of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors. It also addresses the common adverse effects and highlights the molecular mechanisms by which this dual antihyperglycemic therapy contributes to high anion gap metabolic acidosis. In conclusion, while the combination of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors would be a better option in improving glycemic control with a low risk of hypoglycemia, an increase in the risk of metabolic acidosis during combination therapy may be borne in mind.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the effects of AhR activation on hepatic transcriptome and metabolome rhythmicity in male C57BL/6 mice orally gavaged with ,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) every 4 days for 28 days. TCDD diminished the rhythmicity of several core clock regulators (e.g. Arntl, Clock, Nr1d1, Per1, Cry1, Nfil3) in a dose-dependent manner, involving either a ≥ 3.3-fold suppression in amplitude or complete loss of oscillation. Accordingly, protein levels (ARNTL, REV-ERBα, NFIL3) and genomic binding (ARNTL) of select regulators were reduced and arrhythmic following treatment. As a result, the oscillating expression of 99.6% of 5,636 clock-controlled hepatic genes was abolished including genes associated with the metabolism of lipids, glucose/glycogen, and heme. For example, TCDD flattened expression of the rate-limiting enzymes in both  (Pck1) and glycogenesis (Gys2), consistent with the depletion and loss of rhythmicity in hepatic glycogen levels. Examination of polar hepatic extracts by untargeted mass spectrometry revealed that virtually all oscillating metabolites lost rhythmicity following treatment.

The ability of Antarctic sea-ice diatoms to survive this prolonged darkness relies on their metabolic capability. This study is the first to examine the proteome of a prominent sea-ice diatom in response to extended darkness, focusing on the protein-level mechanisms of dark survival. The Antarctic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus was grown under continuous light or darkness for 120 d. The whole cell proteome was quantitatively analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS to investigate metabolic changes that occur during sustained darkness and during recovery under illumination. Enzymes of metabolic pathways, particularly those involved in respiratory processes, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the urea cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain became more abundant in the dark. Within the plastid, carbon fixation halted while the upper sections of the glycolysis,  and pentose phosphate pathways became less active.

During fasting, endogenous glucose is released either through glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis involves the formation of glucose-6-phosphate from a variety of precursors followed by its subsequent hydrolysis to glucose. Gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and the kidney. In order to compare gluconeogenesis in canine liver and kidney, the activity and expression of the rate limiting enzymes that catalyze the fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate steps, namely, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) () and fructose bisphosphatase-1 (FBP-1) (gluconeogenesis), were examined. Healthy male and female beagle dogs aged 1- years were euthanized humanely, and samples of their liver and kidney were obtained for analysis. The levels of PFK-1 and FBP-1 in canine liver and kidney were assessed by enzymatic assays, Western blotting, and RT-qPCR. Enzyme assays showed that, in dogs, the kidney had higher specific activity of PFK-1 and FBP-1 than the liver. Western blotting and RT-qPCR data demonstrated that of the three different subunits (PFK-M, PFK-L, and PFK-P) the PFK-1 in canine liver mainly comprised PFK-L, whereas the PFK-1 in the canine kidney comprised all three subunits. As a result of these differences in the subunit composition of PFK-1, glucose metabolism might be regulated differently in the liver and kidney.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619718>Metabolic effects of glucagon in humans.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder that involves glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. Either insulin deficiency or insulin resistance may cause diabetes. Insulin deficiency causes type 1 diabetes and diabetes associated with total pancreatectomy. Glucagon produces insulin resistance. Glucagon-induced insulin resistance promotes type  diabetes and diabetes associated with glucagonoma. Further, glucagon-induced insulin resistance aggravates the metabolic consequences of the insulin-deficient state. A major metabolic effect of insulin is the accumulation of glucose as glycogen in the liver. Glucagon opposes hepatic insulin action and enhances the rate of , increasing hepatic glucose output. In order to support , glucagon promotes skeletal muscle wasting to supply amino acids as gluconeogenic precursors. Glucagon promotes hepatic fatty acid oxidation to supply energy required to sustain . Hepatic fatty acid oxidation generates β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate (ketogenesis). Prospective studies reveal that elevated glucagon secretion at baseline occurs in healthy subjects who develop impaired glucose tolerance at follow-up compared with subjects who maintain normal glucose tolerance, suggesting a relationship between elevated glucagon secretion and development of impaired glucose tolerance. Prospective studies have identified animal protein consumption as an independent risk factor for type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Animal protein intake activates glucagon secretion inducing sustained elevations in plasma glucagon. Glucagon is a major hormone that causes insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is an established cardiovascular risk factor additionally to its pathogenic role in diabetes. Glucagon may be a potential link between animal protein intake and the risk of developing type  diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30837771>Effects of Telfairia Occidentalis Leaf Extract on Plasma Lactate and Liver Glycogen in Rats.</a></h2><p>Telfairia occidentalis is a green vegetable popularly consumed among the native of Africa and it is generallybelieved to be of medicinal and nutritional value. Studies have reported its hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic effects inrats. In addition to these conflicting reports, the mechanisms for its effects on blood glucose remain inconclusive. Theobjective of this study was to investigate the mechanism involved in the increased blood glucose following treatment withT. occidentalis. Twenty five (25) male albino rats (200-250g) were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=5/group). Rats in thecontrol group received normal saline while rats in other groups were orally treated with 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight ofthe extract for either 1 or  weeks. At the end of the treatment, the rats were anaesthetized and blood samples were collectedfor the estimation of some biochemical parameters. The results showed significant decreases in plasma glucose after 1 weekof treatment with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. However, after  weeks of treatment with both doses, plasma glucose levelsincreased significantly and were higher than those of the control and the rats treated for 1 week with both doses. There werealso dose- and duration-dependent decreases in glycogen concentration in the treated rats, especially those treated for twoweeks. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity and liver glycogen concentration were lower in rats treated for  weeks whencompared with those treated for 1 week with both doses. Moreover, plasma lactate concentration was lower in the treatedgroups when compared with control. The results suggest that Telfairia occidentalis-induced lowering of plasma glucose afterone week of treatment probably favoured lactate oxidation/ and elicited breakdown of liver glycogen whichresulted in increased plasma glucose after two weeks of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267132>Adipose tissue proteomic analysis in ketotic or healthy Holstein cows in early lactation1.</a></h2><p>Ketosis is a major metabolic disorder of high-yielding dairy cows during the transition period. Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on 5 healthy and 5 ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1.5 or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase , pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

CAR activators, including phenobarbital, are considered rodent non-genotoxic carcinogens. Recently, trans-3,4,5,4´-tetramethoxystilbene(TMS), a potential anticancer drug (DMU-212), have been shown to alleviate N-nitrosodiethylamine/phenobarbital-induced liver carcinogenesis. We studied whether TMS inhibits mouse Car to protect from the PB-induced tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified TMS as a murine CAR agonist in reporter gene experiments, in mouse hepatocytes, and in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. TMS up-regulated Car target genes Cyp2b10, Cyp2c29 and Cyp2c55 mRNAs, but down-regulated expression of genes involved in  and lipogenesis. TMS did not change or down-regulate genes involved in liver proliferation or apoptosis such as Mki67, Foxm1, Myc, Mcl1, Pcna, Bcl2, or Mdm2, which were up-regulated by another Car ligand TCPOBOP. TMS did not increase liver weight and had no significant effect on Ki67 and Pcna labeling indices in mouse liver in vivo. In murine hepatic AML12 cells, we confirmed a Car-independent proapoptotic effect of TMS. We conclude that TMS is a Car ligand with limited effects on hepatocyte proliferation, likely due to promoting apoptosis in mouse hepatic cells, while controlling Car target genes involved in xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Three isonitrogenous (46% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) experimental diets were designed, with 100% fish oil (FO), 50% fish oil and 50% soybean oil (FS) and 100% soybean oil (SO), respectively. After a 12-week growth trial, the results showed that compared with FO group, contents n-6 PUFAs increased while the n-3 PUFAs decreased significantly both in liver and muscle in FS and SO groups. Concentrations of blood glucose, leptin, free fatty acid and total triglyceride reached the highest values in SO group, while blood insulin showed no significant difference among all groups. The gene expressions of insulin receptor substrate-, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid synthetase, and lipoprotein lipase increased, and the insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphotidylinsositol-3-kinase (PI3K), hexokinase, glycogen synthetase and glucose transporter  in liver decreased significantly in SO group. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) also decreased significantly in this group. These results suggested that high level of dietary soybean oil depressed PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and then affected glucose and lipid metabolism by glycolysis, , glucose transportation, glycogenesis and lipogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted a prospective observational study of hypoglycemia among 105 individuals with type  diabetes treated with insulin or a sulfonylurea using continuous glucose monitors.We enrolled 81 participants with CKD, defined as eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m, and 24 control participants with eGFR≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m frequency-matched on age, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, and glucose-lowering medications. Each participant wore a continuous glucose monitor for two 6-day periods. We examined rates of sustained level 1 hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) and level  hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dl) among participants with CKD. We then tested differences compared with control participants as well as a second control population (=73) using Poisson and linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and race.Over 890 total days of continuous glucose monitoring, participants with CKD were observed to have 255 episodes of level 1 hypoglycemia, of which 68 episodes reached level  hypoglycemia. Median rate of hypoglycemic episodes was 5.3 (interquartile range, 0.0-11.7) per 30 days and mean time spent in hypoglycemia was 28 (SD 37) minutes per day. Hemoglobin A1c and the glucose management indicator were the main clinical correlates of time in hypoglycemia (adjusted differences 6 [95% confidence interval,  to 10] and 13 [95% confidence interval, 7 to 20] fewer minutes per day per 1% higher hemoglobin A1c or glucose management indicator, respectively). Compared with control populations, participants with CKD were not observed to have significant differences in time in hypoglycemia (adjusted differences 4 [95% confidence interval, -12 to 20] and -12 [95% confidence interval, -29 to 5] minutes per day).Among people with type  diabetes and moderate to severe CKD, hypoglycemia was common, particularly with tighter glycemic control, but not significantly different from groups with similar clinical characteristics and preserved eGFR.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615494>Increment of plasma glucose by exogenous glucagon is associated with present and future renal function in type  diabetes:a retrospective study from glucagon stimulation test.</a></h2><p>Glucagon stimulation test (GST) is often employed to assess the insulin reserve of the pancreatic beta cells in diabetic subjects. The clinical significance of the increment of plasma glucose (Δglucose) by exogenous glucagon during GST has not been elucidated. We investigated the relationship between Δglucose and clinical parameters including the liver and renal function in type  diabetic subjects, since we hypothesized that Δglucose is associated with the liver and renal function reflecting the capacity for  in the organs.A total of 209 subjects with type  diabetes who underwent GST during admission were included in this cross-sectional study. We defined the difference between plasma glucose at fasting and 6 min after intravenous injection of 1 mg glucagon as Δglucose. We assessed correlations between Δglucose and clinical parameters such as diabetic duration, BMI, HbA1c, beta cell function, serum free fatty acids (FFA) which is known to stimulate , liver function, the indices of liver function, renal function, and urinary albumin excretion (UAE).In correlation analysis, Δglucose positively correlated to FFA and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but inversely to serum creatinine and cystatin C, although Δglucose showed no correlation with both liver function and the indices of residual liver function. Multiple regression analysis revealed that Δglucose was an independent determinant for the eGFR after 1 year, equally BMI, HbA1c, serum lipids, and UAE, which are known as the predictors for the development of chronic kidney disease.Our results suggest that Δglucose during GST might be related to  in the kidney and could be the determinant of future renal function in type  diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450038>Effect of gradual temperature increase on the carbohydrate energy metabolism responses of the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii.</a></h2><p>The warming of the Southern Ocean waters may affect the biological processes and the performance of the fish inhabiting it. The notothenioid group is metabolically specialized to low-temperature environments and may be vulnerable to the climatic changes imposed on the Antarctic continent. However, gradual temperature changes potentially allow an opportunity for plasticity adjustments. The present study evaluated the effect of gradual increase of temperature on the enzymatic and nonenzymatic parameters of energy metabolism in renal, branchial, hepatic, and encephalic tissue of Notothenia rossii subjected to a gradual temperature change of 0.5 °C/day until reaching  °C, 4 °C, 6 °C, and 8 °C. Under the effect of an acclimation rate of 0.5 °C/day, the gill tissue showed increased phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme activity. In the kidney, there was increased activity of the malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PDH), and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) enzymes. There was an increase in lactate concentration in the liver and an increase in GP enzyme activity in the brain. The specific tissue responses indicate the presence of thermal plasticity and an attempt to regulate energy metabolism to mitigate thermal stress in this species under these experimental conditions, possibly through the activation of , gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects on hepatic glucogenetic and lipogenic gene expression, systemic metabolism and pathological changes were then determined.In T2DM rats, SIK1 expression was reduced in the liver. Overexpression of SIK1 improved hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and fatty liver, reduced the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription co-activator  (CRTC2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), pS577 SIK1, sterol regulatory element binding-protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), and increased the expression of SIK1, pT182 SIK1 and pS171 CRTC2 in diabetic rat livers with the suppression of  and lipid deposition.SIK1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in the livers of HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats, where it suppresses hepatic  and lipogenesis by regulating the SIK1/CRTC2 and SIK1/SREBP-1c signalling pathways.

Here, we fed breeder cocks five different diets containing 0, 0.25, 1.25, .50 and 5.00 mg kg folate throughout life. Paternal folate supplementation (FS) was beneficial to the growth and organ development of broiler offspring. Most importantly, the lipid and glucose metabolism of breeder cocks and broiler offspring were affected by paternal FS, according to biochemical and metabolomic analyses. We further employed global analyses of hepatic and spermatozoal messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA). Some key genes involved in the glycolysis or  pathway and the PPAR signalling pathway, including ,  and , were regulated by differentially expressed hepatic and spermatozoal miRNAs and lncRNAs in breeder cocks and broiler offspring. Moreover, the expression of  could also be regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in spermatozoa via competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms.

The aerobic training is an important tool in combating NAFLD. However, no studies have demonstrated the molecular effects of short-term strength training on the accumulation of hepatic fat in obese mice. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term strength training on the mechanisms of oxidation and lipid synthesis in the liver of obese mice. The short duration protocol was used to avoid changing the amount of adipose tissue. Swiss mice were separated into three groups: lean control (CTL), sedentary obese (OB) and strength training obese (STO). The obese groups were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and the STO group performed the strength training protocol 1 session/day for 15 days. The short-term strength training reduced hepatic fat accumulation, increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and controlling hepatic glucose production. The obese animals increased the mRNA of lipogenic genes Fasn and Scd1 and reduced the oxidative genes Cpt1a and Ppara. On the other hand, the STO group presented the opposite results. Finally, the obese animals presented higher levels of lipogenic proteins (ACC and FAS) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), but the short-term strength training was efficient in reducing this condition, regardless of body weight loss. In conclusion, there was a reduction of obesity-related hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation after short-term strength training, independent of weight loss, leading to improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity and glycemic homeostasis in obese mice. Key points: (1) Short-term strength training (STST) reduced fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver; () Hepatic insulin sensitivity and HPG control were increased with STST; (3) The content and activity of ACC and content of FAS were reduced with STST; (4) STST improved hepatic fat accumulation and glycemic homeostasis; (5) STST effects were observed independently of body weight change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30704063>Hypoglycemic and Hypolipidemic Effects of  Mycelial Extract from Solid-State Culture in A Rat Model of Type  Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of  have been observed in numerous studies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear.

PLE treatment effectively reduced blood glucose levels, and improved insulin resistance and lipid and lipoprotein profiles. The hypoglycemic effect of PLE was based on inhibition of key hepatic  enzymes (FBPase, G6Pase) expression and hepatic glycogen degradation, and consequent reduction of hepatic glucose production. PLE also: (i) enhanced expression of CPT1A and ACOX1 (key proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in liver, thus promoting clearance of triglycerides and LDL-C; (ii) inhibited expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in liver, thus reducing cholesterol production; (iii) displayed strong hepatoprotective and renal protective effects.

We sought the molecular basis for this sensitivity by utilizing a panel of mice possessing specific deletions of GHR signaling pathways. Metabolic clamps and glucose homeostasis tests were undertaken in these obese adult C57BL/6 male mice, which indicated impaired hepatic . Insulin sensitivity and glucose disappearance rate were enhanced in muscle and adipose of mice lacking the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5  the GHR (-391) as for GHR-null () mice. These changes were associated with a striking inhibition of hepatic glucose output associated with altered glycogen metabolism and elevated hepatic glycogen content during unfed state. The enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with increased insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 activation along with activated downstream protein kinase B signaling cascades. Although phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ()- expression was unchanged, its inhibitory acetylation was elevated because of decreased sirtuin- expression, thereby promoting loss of PCK1. Loss of STAT5 signaling to defined chromatin immunoprecipitation targets would further increase lipogenesis, supporting hepatosteatosis while lowering glucose output.

The challenge is to identify the metabolic pathways affected by the excessive consumption of these dietary components when they are consumed in excess, to unravel the molecular mechanisms leading to metabolic pathologies and identify novel therapeutic targets to manage them.

In particular, CIMP-low colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), predominantly corresponded to consensus molecular subtype 3 (CMS3, "Metabolic") subgroup according to COAD molecular classification, is associated with elevated expression of genes participating in metabolic pathways.We performed bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project for CIMP-high and non-CIMP COAD samples with DESeq2, clusterProfiler, and topGO R packages. Obtained results were validated on a set of fourteen COAD samples with matched morphologically normal tissues using quantitative PCR (qPCR).Upregulation of multiple genes involved in glycolysis and related processes (ENO2, PFKP, HK3, PKM, ENO1, HK2, PGAM1, GAPDH, ALDOA, GPI, TPI1, and HK1) was revealed in CIMP-high tumors compared to non-CIMP ones. Most remarkably, the expression of the PKLR gene, encoding for pyruvate kinase participating in , was decreased approximately 20-fold. Up to 8-fold decrease in the expression of OGDHL gene involved in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was observed in CIMP-high tumors. Using qPCR, we confirmed the increase (4-fold) in the ENO2 expression and decrease (-fold) in the OGDHL mRNA level on a set of COAD samples.We demonstrated the association between CIMP-high status and the energy metabolism changes at the transcriptomic level in colorectal adenocarcinoma against the background of immune pathway activation. Differential methylation of at least nine CpG sites in OGDHL promoter region as well as decreased OGDHL mRNA level can potentially serve as an additional biomarker of the CIMP-high status in COAD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668392>Yangonin protects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through farnesoid X receptor.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently evolving as the most common liver disease worldwide. Dyslipidemia, pathoglycemia and insulin resistance are the major risk factors for the development of NAFLD. To date, no effective drug therapies for this condition have been approved.The present study was to investigate the protective effects of yangonin, a kavalactone isolated from Kava, against NAFLD and further elucidate the mechanisms in vivo and in vitro.A high-fat diet (HFD) induced mouse NAFLD model was used with or without yangonin treatment.The body weight, relative liver weight and serum biochemical indicators were measured. H&E and Oil Red O staining were used to identify the amelioration of the liver histopathological changes. Serum and hepatic triglyceride, free fatty acids and total cholesterol were analyzed. siRNA, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to clarify the mechanisms underlying yangonin protection.Yangonin had obvious protective effects against NAFLD via farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation. Through FXR activation, yangonin attenuated lipid accumulation in the liver via inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis-related protein including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthetase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Besides, yangonin promoted lipid metabolism through an induction in genes required for lipoprotein lipolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Furthermore, yangonin modulated blood glucose homeostasis through regulation of -related gene phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and glycogen synthesis-related gene glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDase). Also, yangonin increased insulin sensitivity through upregulating phosphorylation of insulin responsive substrate 1,  (IRS-1 and IRS-). Then, in vivo and in vitro evidence further demonstrated the involvement of FXR activation in yangonin hepatoprotection.Yangonin protects against NAFLD due to its activation of FXR signalling to inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and , and to promote lipid metabolism and glycogen synthesis, as well as insulin sensitivity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the progressive failure of β-cells to respond to glucose in type- diabetes remain unresolved. Using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, we find significant dysregulation of major metabolic pathways in islets of diabetic βV59M mice, a non-obese, eulipidaemic diabetes model. Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/ are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in NADH and ATP are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. INS-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism. These data indicate hyperglycaemia induces metabolic changes in β-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis. We propose this underlies the progressive failure of β-cells in diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389908>Response of Liver Metabolic Pathways to Ketogenic Diet and Exercise Are Not Additive.</a></h2><p>Studies suggest ketogenic diets (KDs) produce favorable outcomes (health and exercise performance); however, most rodent studies have used a low protein KD, which does not reflect the normal-to-high protein KDs used by humans. Liver has an important role in ketoadaptation due to its involvement in  and ketogenesis. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that exercise training (ExTr) while consuming a normal protein KD (NPKD) would induce additive/synergistic responses in liver metabolic pathways.Lean, healthy male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat control diet (15.9% kcal protein, 11.9% kcal fat, 72.% kcal carbohydrate) or carbohydrate-deficient NPKD (16.1% protein, 83.9% kcal fat) for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks on the diet, half were subjected to 3-week treadmill ExTr (5day/week, 60min/day, moderate-vigorous intensity). Upon conclusion, metabolic and endocrine outcomes related to substrate metabolism were tested in liver and pancreas.NPKD-fed mice had higher circulating β-hydroxybutyrate and maintained glucose at rest and during exercise. Liver of NPKD-fed mice had lower pyruvate utilization and greater ketogenic potential as evidenced by higher oxidative rates to catabolize lipids (mitochondrial and peroxisomal) and ketogenic amino acids (leucine). ExTr had higher expression of the gluconeogenic gene, Pck1, but lower hepatic glycogen, pyruvate oxidation, incomplete fat oxidation, and total pancreas area. Interaction effects between the NPKD and ExTr were observed for intrahepatic triglycerides, as well as genes involved in , ketogenesis, mitochondrial fat oxidation, and peroxisomal markers; however, none were additive/synergistic. Rather, in each instance the interaction effects showed the NPKD and ExTr opposed each other.A NPKD and ExTr independently induce shifts in hepatic metabolic pathways, but changes do not seem to be additive/synergistic in healthy mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594368>Liver transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of preweaning lambs are modified by milk replacer restriction.</a></h2><p>Prenatal and early postnatal nutrition may promote long-term effects on both feed efficiency and health of animals. Therefore, moderated milk replacer restriction during the artificial rearing period might negatively affect feed efficiency during the postweaning phases in dairy ewes. The aim of this work was to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes by RNA sequencing and differentially accumulated proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the liver of artificially reared Assaf lambs to identify modified metabolic pathways as a consequence of milk replacer restriction in order to find possible solutions to correct any detrimental effect caused by this factor. Forty female Assaf lambs were used in this experiment. The animals were penned individually and assigned randomly to 1 of  treatments groups (n = 20 per treatment). The first group of lambs was fed ad libitum (AL), whereas the second (restricted, RES) only received approximately 62.5% of the level of intake measured in the AL group. Eight 35-d-old lambs from each group (16 lambs in total) were harvested and a piece of liver of 8 lambs (4 AL and 4 RES lambs) was excised for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Differential gene expression analysis identified 386 DE genes [198 of them being annotated genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway], with 176 downregulated and 210 upregulated in the early feed-restricted group relative to the AL group. A total of 26 spots were also differentially accumulated proteins in the liver of the  groups of lambs, 10 of them being down-accumulated whereas the other 16 evolved in the opposite way in the liver of RES relative to AL lambs. Collectively, both the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches revealed an upregulation of genes participating in oxidation of fatty acids in the early feed-restricted lambs. The expression of many genes involved in the degradation of several AA (e.g. alanine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine) was also modified in the RES lambs, probably to render substrates for . Moreover, other genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, or hepatic oxidative pathways were upregulated in these lambs. Finally, the expression of genes implicated in oxidative phosphorylation was modified in RES animals. Altogether all these modifications suggest that the partitioning and utilization of nutrients in the early feed-restricted lambs might have been modified, being partially responsible for changes during the replacement phase later in life.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The causes of these differences are unknown. We investigated the influence of circulating concentrations of lactate (NADH generator) and NADH on GN in perfused livers of TB rats. Lactate, at concentrations similar to those found on days 5 (3.0 mM), 8 (5.5 mM), and 12 (8.0 mM) of the tumor, prevented the reduction of GN from .0 mM lactate (lactatemia of healthy rat) in TB rats. NADH, 50 or 75 μM, but not 25 μM, increased GN from .0 mM lactate in TB rats to higher values than healthy rats. High concentrations of pyruvate (no NADH generator, 5.0 and 8.0 mM) did not prevent the reduction of GN from .0 mM pyruvate in TB rats. However, 50 or 75 μM NADH, but not 25 μM, increased GN from .0 mM pyruvate in TB rats to similar or higher values than healthy rats. High concentration of glutamine (NADH generator, .5 mM) or 50 μM NADH prevented the reduction of GN from 1 mM glutamine in TB rats. Intraperitoneal administration of pyruvate (1.0 mg/kg) or glutamine (0.5 mg/kg) similarly increased the glycemia of healthy and TB rats. In conclusion, high lactate concentration, similar to hyperlactatemia, prevented the reduction of GN in perfused livers of TB rats, an effect probably caused by the increased redox potential (NADH/NAD ). Thus, the decreased GN in livers from TB rats is due, at least in part, to the absence of simulation of in vivo hyperlactatemia in liver perfusion studies.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619751>PCK1 Downregulation Promotes TXNRD1 Expression and Hepatoma Cell Growth via the Nrf2/Keap1 Pathway.</a></h2><p>, generates glucose from small carbohydrate substrates, and drives the metabolic flux in parallel but opposite to glycolysis.

In the current study, we found that PCK1 expression was decreased in HCC as compared to adjacent normal liver tissues, and low PCK1 expression correlated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, overexpression of PCK1 suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatoma cells. In addition, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), an antioxidant enzyme regulated by the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, was downregulated upon overexpression of PCK1 in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, we verified this axis using nude mouse xenograft model. Finally, we found that auranofin, a TXNRD1 inhibitor, enhanced the sensitivity of PCK1-knockout hepatoma cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCK1 deficiency promotes hepatoma cell proliferation via the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of transcription factor Nrf2, and that targeting the TXNRD1 antioxidant pathway sensitizes PCK1-knockout hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314546>Increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in skeletal muscle of growth-restricted ovine fetuses.</a></h2><p>Fetal sheep with placental insufficiency-induced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have lower fractional rates of glucose oxidation and greater , indicating lactate shuttling between skeletal muscle and liver. Suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase () activity was proposed because of greater pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4 and PDK1 mRNA concentrations in IUGR muscle. Although PDK1 and PDK4 inhibit PDH activity to reduce pyruvate metabolism, PDH protein concentrations and activity have not been examined in skeletal muscle from IUGR fetuses. Therefore, we evaluated the protein concentrations and activity of PDH and the kinases and phosphatases that regulate PDH phosphorylation status in the semitendinosus muscle from placenta insufficiency-induced IUGR sheep fetuses and control fetuses. Immunoblots were performed for PDH, phosphorylated PDH (E1α), PDK1, PDK4, and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 and  (PDP1 and PDP2, respectively). Additionally, the PDH, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and citrate synthase (CS) enzymatic activities were measured. Phosphorylated PDH concentrations were 28% lower (P < 0.01) and PDH activity was 67% greater (P < 0.01) in IUGR fetal muscle compared with control. PDK1, PDK4, PDP1, PDP2, and PDH concentrations were not different between groups. CS and LDH activities were also unaffected. Contrary to the previous speculation, PDH activity was greater in skeletal muscle from IUGR fetuses, which parallels lower phosphorylated PDH. Therefore, greater expression of PDK1 and PDK4 mRNA did not translate to greater PDK1 or PDK4 protein concentrations or inhibition of PDH as proposed. Instead, these findings show greater PDH activity in IUGR fetal muscle, which indicates that alternative regulatory mechanisms are responsible for lower pyruvate catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285263> stabilization of OPA1 in hepatocytes potentiates mitochondrial respiration and  in a prohibitin-dependent way.</a></h2><p>Patients with fatty liver diseases present altered mitochondrial morphology and impaired metabolic function. Mitochondrial dynamics and related cell function require the uncleaved form of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Stabilization of OPA1 might then confer a protective mechanism against stress-induced tissue damages. To study the putative role of hepatic mitochondrial morphology in a sick liver, we expressed a cleavage-resistant long form of OPA1 (L-OPA1Δ) in the liver of a mouse model with mitochondrial liver dysfunction ( the hepatocyte-specific prohibitin- knockout (Hep-Phb2) mice). Liver prohibitin- deficiency caused excessive proteolytic cleavage of L-OPA1, mitochondrial fragmentation, and increased apoptosis. These molecular alterations were associated with lipid accumulation, abolished , and extensive liver damage. Such liver dysfunction was associated with severe hypoglycemia. In prohibitin- knockout mice, expression of L-OPA1Δ by  adenovirus delivery restored the morphology but not the function of mitochondria in hepatocytes. In prohibitin-competent mice, elongation of liver mitochondria by expression of L-OPA1Δ resulted in excessive glucose production associated with increased mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, mitochondrial dynamics participates in the control of hepatic glucose production.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836234>Synthesis of 5-methyl-,4-dihydro-3H-1,,4-triazole-3-one's aryl Schiff base derivatives and investigation of carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterase (AChE, BuChE) inhibitory properties.</a></h2><p>Carbonic anhydrase enzymes (EC 4..1.1, CAs) are metalloenzyme families that catalyze the rapid conversion of HO and CO to HCO and H.

A recent study demonstrated that ZNF692 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues and that ZNF692 knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of ZNF692 in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains unclear. The present study revealed that ZNF692 was upregulated in COAD tissues and cells and that high ZNF692 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and tumor stage in COAD patients. Gain‑ and loss‑of‑function experiments were employed to identify the function of ZNF692 in COAD progression. In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that ZNF692 promoted COAD cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that the effects of ZNF692 were mediated by upregulating cyclin D1, cyclin‑dependent kinase  (CDK2) and matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9) and by downregulating p27Kip1 through the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/AKT signaling pathway.

The latter  diets are clinically useful with important impacts on both aspects of the energy balance equation with increased satiety and less hunger on the intake side and probably increased energy expenditure on the output side; both may have important implications for the successful long-term management of obesity. Consideration of older research regarding the hormonal response to carbohydrate-free dieting and recent findings on hepatic glycogen status that occurs with sustained ketonemia support the likelihood that there are profound differences in 24-hour  rates between ketogenic diets and balanced diets containing substantial carbohydrate.

Delayed CO excretion and a low area under the curve through 150 min (AUC) were obtained in diabetic patients. The group with severe diabetes had a significantly lower C and AUC in the [1-C]glucose breath test.The [1-C]glucose breath test, which has been used to evaluate glucose metabolism, is suitable for patients with late-stage diabetes, whereas the [-C]glucose breath test is ideal in the early stages.

Besides muscle, the liver has an essential role in regulating glucose homeostasis. Previous studies have reported that treatment of diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice with adropin (the putative secreted domain) reduces fasting blood glucose independently of body weight changes, suggesting that adropin suppresses glucose production in the liver. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying adropin's effects on hepatic glucose metabolism in DIO mice. Male DIO B6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet received five intraperitoneal injections of adropin (450 nmol/kg/injection) over a 48-h period. We found that adropin enhances major intracellular signaling activities in the liver that are involved in insulin-mediated regulation of glucose homeostasis. Moreover, treatment with adropin alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress responses and reduced activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the liver, explaining the enhanced activities of hepatic insulin signaling pathways observed with adropin treatment. Furthermore, adropin suppressed cAMP activated protein kinase A (PKA) activities, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of inositol trisphosphate receptor, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum calcium efflux, and of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, a key transcription factor in hepatic regulation of glucose metabolism. Adropin directly affected liver metabolism, decreasing glucose production and reducing PKA-mediated phosphorylation in primary mouse hepatocytes  Our findings indicate that major hepatic signaling pathways contribute to the improved glycemic control achieved with adropin treatment in situations of obesity.© 2019 Gao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608010>Mechanisms Underlying Type  Diabetes Remission After Metabolic Surgery.</a></h2><p>Type  diabetes prevalence is increasing dramatically worldwide.

Type  DM (T2DM) is the most common type of DM and is characterized by insulin resistance and defective β-cell secretory function. Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are favorable seed cells for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy due to their higher proliferation rates and easier access to retrieval. Currently, no study has revealed the therapeutic efficiency of MSCs for T2DM in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Hence, we aimed to explore the effect of SHED on T2DM in GK rats.We investigated the effects of SHED on the progression of T2DM in GK rats. SHED and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were injected via the tail vein. Body weight, fasting blood glucose and non-fasting blood glucose were measured before and after administration. At 8 weeks after injection, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (IPITTs) and insulin release tests (IRTs) were performed. Additionally, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and double-label immunofluorescence staining were used to explore the pathological changes in pancreatic islets and the liver. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to detect SHED engraftment in the liver. Additionally, real-time PCR and western blotting were used to explore glycogen synthesis, glycolysis and  in the liver.At 8 weeks after SHED injection, T2DM was dramatically attenuated, including hyperglycemia, IPGTT and IRT. Additionally, histological analysis showed that SHED injection improved pancreatic islet and liver damage. Real-time PCR analysis showed that SHED significantly reversed the diabetic-induced increase of G-6-Pase, Pck1 and PK; and significantly reversed the diabetic-induced decrease of GSK3β, GLUT2, and PFKL. In addition, western blotting demonstrated that SHED significantly reversed the diabetic-induced increase of G-6-Pase and reversed the diabetic-induced decrease of GLUT2, GSK3β and PFKM.Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth offers a potentially effective therapeutic modality for ameliorating T2DM, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, pancreatic islets and liver damage, and decreased glycogen synthesis, inhibited glycolysis and increased  in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447783>Sex Dependent Dysregulation of Hepatic Glucose Production in Lean Type  Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>We have characterized a lean type  diabetic rat model by gestational low protein programming.

Blood samples were drawn during steady states after 4 h of fasting and following a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. HGP and the fraction of glucose derived from gluconeogenesis under fasting and euglycemic states were measured from steady state glucose enrichments after the infusion of [6,6-H]glucose and HO tracers. Glycogenolysis was determined by calculating the difference between total HGP and gluconeogenesis rates. Hepatic gene expression of enzymes involved in HGP were quantified using qPCR. HGP rates was similar during fasting in both groups and sexes. However, under simulated fed condition, HGP rate was suppressed in controls but not in type  diabetic rats. They also showed inefficient HGP suppression in a simulated fed state. Differential analysis showed that suppression of both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis under simulated fed state was affected in these low protein programmed type  diabetic rats. These effects were greater in females when compared to males. Further, key genes involved in these processes like G6Pase, Pepck, pyruvate carboxylase, and glycogen phosphorylase in liver were dysregulated. Our data shows impaired suppression of HGP via gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in type  diabetic rats with greater effects on females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133988>Role of Mitochondria in the Mechanism(s) of Action of Metformin.</a></h2><p>Metformin is a drug from the biguanide family that is used for decades as the first-line therapeutic choice for the treatment of type  diabetes. Despite its worldwide democratization, owing to its clinical efficacy, high safety profile and cheap cost, the exact mechanism(s) of action of this anti-hyperglycemic molecule with pleiotropic properties still remains to be fully elucidated. The concept that metformin would exert some of its actions though modulation of the mitochondrial bioenergetics was initially forged in the 50s but undeniably revived at the beginning of the twenty-first century when it was shown to induce a weak but specific inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1. Furthermore, metformin has been reported to reduce generation of reactive oxygen species at the complex 1 and to prevent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that it can protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death. Nevertheless, despite some recent progress and the demonstration of its key role in the inhibition of hepatic , the exact nature of the mitochondrial interaction between the drug and the complex 1 is still poorly characterized. Recent studies reported that metformin may also have anti-neoplastic properties by inhibiting cancer cell growth and proliferation, at least partly through its mitochondrial action. As such, many trials are currently conducted for exploring the repositioning of metformin as a potential drug for cancer therapy. In this mini-review, we discuss both historical and more recent findings on the central role played by the interaction between metformin and the mitochondria in its cellular mechanism of action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31439934>Understanding the glucoregulatory mechanisms of metformin in type  diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Despite its position as the first-line drug for treatment of type  diabetes mellitus, the mechanisms underlying the plasma glucose level-lowering effects of metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide) still remain incompletely understood. Metformin is thought to exert its primary antidiabetic action through the suppression of hepatic glucose production. In addition, the discovery that metformin inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1 has placed energy metabolism and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) at the centre of its proposed mechanism of action. However, the role of AMPK has been challenged and might only account for indirect changes in hepatic insulin sensitivity. Various mechanisms involving alterations in cellular energy charge, AMP-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 and modulation of the cellular redox state through direct inhibition of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been proposed for the acute inhibition of  by metformin. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin could improve obesity-induced meta-inflammation via direct and indirect effects on tissue-resident immune cells in metabolic organs (that is, adipose tissue, the gastrointestinal tract and the liver). Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract also has a major role in metformin action through modulation of glucose-lowering hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 and the intestinal bile acid pool and alterations in gut microbiota composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541119>-Aminoadipic acid (-AAA) as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in childhood obesity.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is an important clinical feature of metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and type  diabetes. Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other metabolic adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between -aminoadipic acid (-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory -AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after  years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher -AAA levels, and the baseline -AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after  years. To validate the relationship between -AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in -AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in -AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the -AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess -AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal . Our results demonstrate that -AAA is associated with adipogenesis and insulin resistance. In this regard, -AAA could be a potential biomarker of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779918>Vaccarin ameliorates insulin resistance and steatosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Destructive glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver is a crucial characteristic of type  diabetes mellitus (T2DM), eventually leading to insulin resistance and subsequent hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Vaccarin is an active flavonoid glycoside associated with various biological functions, but its effects on glucose and lipid metabolic disorder in T2DM are still unclear. In this study, glucosamine (GlcN) and free fatty acids (FFAs, oleate/palmitate, :1 ratio) were applied to mimic insulin resistance and lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, respectively. Type  diabetic mice were induced using a high-fat diet (HFD) together with streptozotocin (STZ). GlcN stimulation was found to upregulate glucose production and  but downregulate glycogen synthesis and phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in HepG2 cells, abnormal changes that were reversed by vaccarin. Furthermore, lipid accumulation was enhanced, but AMPK was inactivated in FFAs-exposed HepG2 cells, issues that were rectified by vaccarin treatment. These ameliorative effects of vaccarin on insulin resistance and steatosis were eliminated by AMPK inhibitor Compound C. In type  diabetic mice, chronic vaccarin administration decreased fasting blood glucose and lipid levels in both serum and the liver, and improved insulin sensitivity and steatosis in the liver. Taken together, these results suggest that vaccarin attenuates insulin resistance and steatosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

Both compounds affect energy transduction in isolated mitochondria and the present study aimed at characterizing the actions of these two compounds on liver metabolism and their cellular distribution in the isolated perfused rat liver. ,4-D, but not picloram, increased glycolysis in the range from 10 to 400 μM. The redox potential of the cytosolic NAD-NADH couple was also increased by ,4-D. Both compounds inhibited lactate . Inhibitions by ,4-D and picloram were incomplete, reaching maximally 46% and 23%, respectively. Both compounds diminished the cellular ATP levels. No synergism between the actions of ,4-D and picloram was detected. Biotransformations of ,4-D and picloram were slow, but their distributions occurred at high rates and were concentrative. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that ,4-D presented low affinity for the hydrophobic lipid bilayers, the opposite occurring with picloram. Inhibition of energy metabolism is possibly a relevant component of the toxicity of ,4-D and of the commercial product Tordon. Furthermore, the interactions of ,4-D with the membrane lipid bilayer can be highly destructive and might equally be related to its cellular toxicity at high concentrations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, abnormal dysregulation of hepatic glucose production is commonly observed in type  diabetes. However, the signaling components controlling hepatic glucose production to maintain normal glucose levels are not fully understood. Here, we examined the physiological role of Down syndrome critical region 1-4 (DSCR1-4), an endogenous calcineurin signaling inhibitor in the liver that mediates metabolic adaptation to fasting.We assessed the effect of cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of calcineurin signaling on gluconeogenic gene expression in primary hepatocytes. DSCR1-4 expression was examined in diet- and genetically-induced mouse models of obesity. We also investigated the metabolic phenotype of a single extra copy of DSCR1-4 in transgenic mice and how DSCR1-4 regulates glucose homeostasis in the liver.Treatment with cyclosporin A increased hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression. The expression of DSCR1-4 was induced by refeeding and overexpressed in obese mouse livers. Moreover, transgenic mice with a single extra copy of DSCR1-4 exhibited pyruvate intolerance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, DSCR1-4 overexpression increased phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein, which led to elevated expression levels of gluconeogenic genes and, thus, enhanced hepatic glucose production during fasting.A single extra copy of DSCR1-4 results in dysregulated hepatic glucose homeostasis and pyruvate intolerance. Our findings suggest that nutrient-sensitive DSCR1-4 is a novel target for controlling hepatic  in diabetes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Although existing drugs have been proven to improve , achieving this objective with functional food is of interest, especially using conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) found in dairy products. Both cis-9, trans-11 (c9,t11) and trans-10, cis-12 (t10,c12) isomers of CLA were tested in human (HepG2) and rat (H4IIE) hepatocytes for their potential effects on . The hepatocytes exposed for 24 h with 20 μM of c9,t11-CLA had attenuated the  in both HepG2 and H4IIE by 62.5% and 80.1%, respectively. In contrast, t10,c12-CLA had no effect. Of note, in HepG2 cells, the exposure of c9,t11-CLA decreased the transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) by 87.7%, and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) by 38.0%, while t10,c12-CLA increased the expression of G6PC, suggesting the isomer-specific effects of CLA on hepatic glucose production. In HepG2, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, rosiglitazone, reduced the glucose production by 72.9%. However, co-administration of c9,t11-CLA and rosiglitazone neither exacerbated nor attenuated the efficacy of rosiglitazone to inhibit glucose production; meanwhile, t10,c12-CLA abrogated the efficacy of rosiglitazone. Paradoxically, PPARγ antagonist GW 9662 also led to 70.% reduction of glucose production and near undetectable PCK1 expression by abrogating CLA actions. Together, while the precise mechanisms by which CLA isomers modulate hepatic  directly or via PPAR warrant further investigation, our findings establish that c9,t11-CLA suppresses  by decreasing PEPCK on hepatocytes.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30604460>Angiotensin-converting enzyme  inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathway to preserve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Previous works indicated that the stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress by angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE2) on the prevention of NAFLD.HepG2 cells were treated with thapsigargin (Tg) or palmitic acid (PA). We analysed ACE2 expression using Western-blotting analyses. ER stress-related proteins were detected in ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice by immunofluorescence or Western-blotting analyses. In ACE2-overexpression HepG2 cells, the triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and glycogen content were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins (ACCα, SREBP-1c, FAS, and LXRα), enzymes for  (PEPCK, G6Pase, and IRS2), and IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway were analysed by Western-blotting analyses.ACE2 was significantly increased in Tg/PA-induced cultured hepatocytes. Additionally, ACE2 knockout mice displayed elevated levels of ER stress, while Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice showed reduced ER stress in liver. Furthermore, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress, accompanied by decreased TG content, increased intracellular glycogen, and downregulated expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for  in Tg/PA-induced hepatocytes. As a consequence of anti-ER stress, the activation of ACE2 led to improved glucose and lipid metabolism through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway.This is the first time documented that ACE2 had a notable alleviating role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism via the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt-mediated pathway.

To unravel the mitochondrial contribution to tissue-specific physiology, we performed a systematic comparison of the mitochondrial proteome and lipidome of mice and assessed the consequences hereof for respiration. Liver and skeletal muscle mitochondrial protein composition was studied by data-independent ultra-high-performance (UHP)LC-MS/MS-proteomics, and lipid profiles were compared by UHPLC-MS/MS lipidomics. Mitochondrial function was investigated by high-resolution respirometry in samples from mice and humans. Enzymes of pyruvate oxidation as well as several subunits of complex I, III, and ATP synthase were more abundant in muscle mitochondria. Muscle mitochondria were enriched in cardiolipins associated with higher oxidative phosphorylation capacity and flexibility, in particular CL(18:) and 22:6-containing cardiolipins. In contrast, protein equipment of liver mitochondria indicated a shuttling of complex I substrates toward  and ketogenesis and a higher preference for electron transfer via the flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase pathway. Concordantly, muscle and liver mitochondria showed distinct respiratory substrate preferences. Muscle respired significantly more on the complex I substrates pyruvate and glutamate, whereas in liver maximal respiration was supported by complex II substrate succinate. This was a consistent finding in mouse liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria and human samples. Muscle mitochondria are tailored to produce ATP with a high capacity for complex I-linked substrates. Liver mitochondria are more connected to biosynthetic pathways, preferring fatty acids and succinate for oxidation. The physiologic diversity of mitochondria may help to understand tissue-specific disease pathologies and to develop therapies targeting mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione metabolism, pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase- (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase- (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017036>Metabolomics Profiling of Visceral Adipose Tissue: Results From MESA and the NEO Study.</a></h2><p>Background Identifying associations between serum metabolites and visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) could provide novel biomarkers of VAT and insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. We aimed to discover and replicate metabolites reflecting pathways related to VAT . Methods and Results Associations between fasting serum metabolites and VAT area (by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed with cross-sectional linear regression of individual-level data from participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; discovery, N=1103) and the NEO (Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity) study (replication, N=2537). Untargeted H nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics profiling of serum was performed in MESA, and metabolites were replicated in the NEO study using targeted H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A total of 30 590 metabolomic spectral variables were evaluated. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, glucose/lipid-lowering medication, and body mass index, 2104 variables representing 24 nonlipid and 49 lipid/lipoprotein subclass metabolites remained significantly associated with VAT ( P=4.88×10-1.16×10). These included conventional metabolites, amino acids, acetylglycoproteins, intermediates of glucose and hepatic metabolism, organic acids, and subclasses of apolipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Metabolites mapped to 31 biochemical pathways, including amino acid substrate use/metabolism and glycolysis/. In the replication cohort, acetylglycoproteins, branched-chain amino acids, lactate, glutamine (inversely), and atherogenic lipids remained associated with VAT ( P=1.90×10-8.46×10), with most associations remaining after additional adjustment for surrogates of VAT (glucose level, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides), reflecting novel independent associations. Conclusions We identified and replicated a metabolite panel associated with VAT in  community-based cohorts. These findings persisted after adjustment for body mass index and appear to define a metabolic signature of visceral adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589893> using glycerol as a substrate in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei.</a></h2><p>Bloodstream form African trypanosomes are thought to rely exclusively upon glycolysis, using glucose as a substrate, for ATP production. Indeed, the pathway has long been considered a potential therapeutic target to tackle the devastating and neglected tropical diseases caused by these parasites. However, plasma membrane glucose and glycerol transporters are both expressed by trypanosomes and these parasites can infiltrate tissues that contain glycerol. Here, we show that bloodstream form trypanosomes can use glycerol for  and for ATP production, particularly when deprived of glucose following hexose transporter depletion. We demonstrate that Trypanosoma brucei hexose transporters 1 and  (THT1 and THT2) are localized to the plasma membrane and that knockdown of THT1 expression leads to a growth defect that is more severe when THT2 is also knocked down. These data are consistent with THT1 and THT2 being the primary routes of glucose supply for the production of ATP by glycolysis. However, supplementation of the growth medium with glycerol substantially rescued the growth defect caused by THT1 and THT2 knockdown. Metabolomic analyses with heavy-isotope labelled glycerol demonstrated that trypanosomes take up glycerol and use it to synthesize intermediates of , including fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and hexose 6-phosphates, which feed the pentose phosphate pathway and variant surface glycoprotein biosynthesis. We used Cas9-mediated gene knockout to demonstrate a -specific, but fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Tb927.9.8720)-independent activity, converting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into fructose 6-phosphate. In addition, we observed increased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the succinate shunt. Thus, contrary to prior thinking,  can operate in bloodstream form T. brucei.

The aim of this study was to explore the potential of hyperpolarized MR spectroscopy for quantification of liver pyruvate metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp in mice. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism in mice. Mice were divided into two groups: (i) non-stimulated 5-h fasted mice and (ii) hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamped mice. During clamp conditions, insulin and donor blood were administered at a constant rate, whereas glucose was infused to maintain isoglycemia. When steady state was reached, insulin-stimulated mice were rapidly infused with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate for real-time tracking of the dynamic distribution of metabolic derivatives from pyruvate, such as [1-13C]lactate, [1-13C]alanine and [13C]bicarbonate. Isotopomer analysis of plasma glucose confirmed 13C-incorporation from [1-13C]pyruvate into glucose was increased in fasted mice compared with insulin-stimulated mice, demonstrating an increased  in fasted mice. The AUC ratios for [1-13C]alanine/[1-13C]pyruvate (38.%), [1-13C]lactate/[1-13C]pyruvate (41.8%) and [13C]bicarbonate/[1-13C]pyruvate (169%) all increased significantly during insulin stimulation. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate can be used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism during hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp conditions. Under these conditions, insulin decreased  and increased [1-13C]alanine, [1-13C]lactate and [13C]bicarbonate after a [1-13C]pyruvate bolus. This application of in vivo spectroscopy has the potential to identify impairments in specific metabolic pathways in the liver associated with obesity, insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p></html>
