The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of N-Oleoyl glycine (OLGly), a lipoamino , on 3T3-L1  and to explore the likely mechanisms underlying this process. Lipid accumulation were evaluated using Oil Red O staining and triglyceride content assay. The mRNA expressions of cannabinoid receptors and the protein expressions of adipogenic genes and intracellular signaling pathway were determined by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. The results indicated that OLGly itself, but not its degradation products, stimulated lipid accumulation and significantly increased adipogenic genes (PPARγ and aP2), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, OLGly markedly increased the mRNA expression of CB1 receptor (CB1R) and the inhibition of CB1R by its antagonist SR141716 abolished the promotive effects of OLGly on lipid accumulation and the protein expression of PPARγ and aP2. Furthermore, OLGly increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and p-FoxO1/FoxO1, which could be reversed by SR141716. Moreover, OLGly-induced enhancement of , activation of insulin-mediated Akt signaling pathway and inactivation of FoxO1 were effectively blocked by Wortmannin, a specific PI3K/Akt inhibitor, indicating the essential role of Akt signaling pathway in the process of OLGly-stimulated 3T3-L1 . In conclusion, OLGly, a lipoamino , was able to promote 3T3-L1  through the activation of CB1 receptor and the enhancement of insulin-mediated Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggested the potential role of OLGly in increasing insulin sensitivity and suppressing obesity and diabetes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined.

The identification of noninvasive biomarkers for NAFLD is of recent interest. Because primary de novo  occurs in chicken liver as in human liver, adult chickens with age-associated steatosis resembling human NAFLD is an appealing animal model. The objective of this study was to screen potential biomarkers in the chicken model for NAFLD by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Hy-Line W-36 laying hens were fed standard feed from 25 to 45 wk of age to induce fatty liver. They were killed every 4 wk, and liver and plasma were collected at each time point to assess fatty liver development and for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Next, selected biomarkers were confirmed in additional experiments by providing supplements of the hepatoprotective nutrients betaine [300, 600, or 900 parts per million (ppm) in vivo; 2 mM in vitro] or docosahexaenoic  (DHA; 1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) to 30-wk-old Hy-Line W-36 laying hens for 4 mo and to Hy-Line W-36 chicken primary hepatocytes with -induced steatosis. Liver or hepatocyte lipid contents and the expression of biomarkers were then examined. Plasma acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), glutamine synthetase (GLUL), and glutathione -transferase (GST) concentrations are well-established biomarkers for NAFLD. Selected biomarkers had significant positive associations with hepatic lipid deposition ( < 0.001). Betaine (900 ppm in vivo; 2 mM in vitro) and DHA (1% in vivo; 100 μM in vitro) supplementation both resulted in lower steatosis accompanied by the reduced expression of selected biomarkers in vivo and in vitro ( < 0.05). This study used adult laying hens to identify biomarkers for NAFLD and indicated that AACS, DPP4, GLUL, and GST could be considered to be potential diagnostic indicators for NAFLD in the future.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25458530>Ellagic  modulates lipid accumulation in primary human adipocytes and human hepatoma Huh7 cells via discrete mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Previously, we have reported that consumption of a muscadine grape phytochemical powder (MGP) decreased lipid accumulation in high-fat fed mice. The aim of this study was to identify the responsible polyphenolic constituents and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In mice, MGP supplementation significantly reduced visceral fat mass as well as adipocyte size. To determine whether MGP affects  or hypertrophic lipid accumulation, we used a human adipogenic stem cell (hASCs) model. Among the MGP, ellagic  (EA) was identified as a potent negative regulator of  of hASCs. In addition, EA substantially decreased the conversion of [(3)H]-acetyl CoA into fatty acids (FAs), suggesting that EA inhibits de novo synthesis of FA in mature adipocytes. Similarly, MGP supplementation significantly decreased hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels. The TG-lowering effects of EA were confirmed in human hepatoma Huh7 cells. EA reduced [(3)H]- esterification into [(3)H]-TG as well as the de novo synthesis of FA from [(3)H]-acetyl CoA in Huh7 cells. Intriguingly, EA also increased oxygen consumption rate and β-oxidation-related gene expression. Taken together, EA attenuated new fat cell formation and FA biosynthesis in adipose tissue, while it reduced the synthesis of TG and FA and increased FA oxidation in the liver. These results suggest that EA exerts unique lipid-lowering effects both in adipose tissue and liver via discrete mechanisms.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although compelling evidence indicates that the majority of triacylglycerol in very low-density lipoprotein is derived from re-esterification of lipolytic products released by endoplasmic reticulum-associated lipases, little is known about roles of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) in this process. We aimed to investigate the contribution of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein secretion in primary mouse and human hepatocytes.We used highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of DGAT1 and DGAT2, and we tracked storage and secretion of lipids synthesized de novo from [(3)H]acetic  and from exogenously supplied [(3)H]. Inactivation of individual DGAT activity did not affect incorporation of either radiolabeled precursor into intracellular triacylglycerol, whereas combined inactivation of both DGATs severely attenuated triacylglycerol synthesis. However, inhibition of DGAT2 augmented fatty  oxidation, whereas inhibition of DGAT1 increased triacylglycerol secretion, suggesting preferential channeling of separate DGAT-derived triacylglycerol pools to distinct metabolic pathways. Inactivation of DGAT2 impaired cytosolic lipid droplet expansion, whereas DGAT1 inactivation promoted large lipid droplet formation. Moreover, inactivation of DGAT2 attenuated expression of lipogenic genes. Finally, triacylglycerol secretion was significantly reduced on DGAT2 inhibition without altering extracellular apolipoprotein B levels.Our data suggest that DGAT1 and DGAT2 can compensate for each other to synthesize triacylglycerol, but triacylglycerol synthesized by DGAT1 is preferentially channeled to oxidation, whereas DGAT2 synthesizes triacylglycerol destined for very low-density lipoprotein assembly.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925967>[6]-gingerol dampens hepatic steatosis and inflammation in experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of [6]-gingerol ((S)-5-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-decanone) in experimental models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. HepG2 cells were exposed to 500 µmol/l  (OA) for 24 h and preincubated for an additional 24 h with [6]-gingerol (25, 50 or 100 µmol/l). [6]-Gingerol (100 µmol/l) inhibited OA-induced triglyceride and inflammatory marker accumulation in HepG2 cells. After being fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks, male golden hamsters were dosed orally with [6]-gingerol (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day) once daily for 8 weeks while maintained on HFD. [6]-Gingerol (100 mg/kg/day) alleviated liver steatosis, inflammation, and reversed plasma markers of metabolic syndrome in HFD-fed hamsters. The expression of inflammatory cytokine genes and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) were increased in the HFD group; these effects were attenuated by [6]-gingerol. The hepatic mRNA expression of lipogenic genes such as liver X receptor-α, sterol regulating element binding protein-1c and its target genes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in HFD-fed hamsters was also blocked by [6]-gingerol. [6]-Gingerol may attenuate HFD-induced steatohepatitis by downregulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses and reducing hepatic lipogenic gene expression.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "metabolic" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of palmitic  (C16:0) or  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with palmitic  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic palmitic and  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo  fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

It also inhibits the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This study aimed to evaluate the osthole suppressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease effects in  (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis and if it can modulate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. FL83B cells were pretreated with OA (250μΜ) for 24h, and then added different concentrations of osthole (3-100μM) for 24h. Subsequently, lipolysis and transcription factors of  and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase proteins were measured. In addition, cells with OA-induced steatosis were HO-stimulated, and then incubated with osthole to evaluated if it could suppress its progression to steatohepatitis. Osthole significantly enhanced glycerol release and lipolysis protein expression. Osthole also promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinases and increased the activity of triglyceride lipase and hormone- sensitive lipase. Osthole suppressed the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and decreased the malondialdehyde concentration in FL83B cells with OA-induced steatosis that were treated with HO. These results suggest that osthole might suppress nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by decreasing lipid accumulation, and through its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects via blocked NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

For the purpose of exploring molecular pathways in NAFLD development and testing potential drug candidates, well-characterised experimental models of ectopic TAG storage in hepatocytes are needed.Using an optimised Oil Red O assay, immunoblotting and real-time qRT-PCR, we compared the capability of dietary monosaccharides and fatty acids to promote lipid accumulation in HepG2 human hepatoma cells.Both high glucose and high fructose resulted in intracellular lipid accumulation after 48 h, and this was further augmented (up to twofold, as compared to basal levels) by co-treatment with the -stimulating hormone insulin and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), respectively. The fatty acids palmitic and  were even more effective than these carbohydrates, inducing significantly elevated TAG storage already after 24 h of treatment. Highest (about threefold) increases in lipid accumulation were observed upon treatment with , alone as well as in combinations with palmitic  or with high glucose and insulin. Increases in protein levels of a major lipid droplet coat protein, perilipin-2 (PLIN2), mirrored intracellular lipid accumulation following different treatment regimens.Several treatment regimens of excessive fat and sugar supply promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, albeit with differences in the extent and rapidity of steatogenesis. PLIN2 is a candidate molecular marker of sustained lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29356901>Glycine enhances expression of adiponectin and IL-10 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without affecting  and lipolysis.</a></h1><p>Glycine supplementation has been reported to enhance white-fat loss and improve sensitivity to insulin in animals with obesity or type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of glycine remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that glycine regulates adipocyte differentiation, , and lipolysis, therefore, contributing to white-fat reduction. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were induced to differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of glycine (0, 0.25, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L) or resveratrol (50 or 100 μmol/L, served as a positive control) during the differentiation process. Hela and HepG2 cells cultured with  to induce lipid accumulation in the presence of glycine (0, 1.0, and 2.0 mmol/L) or 10 μmol/L isoproterenol (served as a positive control) for 24 h. Intracellular lipid accumulation, intracellular triglycerides, lipid droplets' diameters of mature adipocytes, mRNA, and protein levels of genes involved in the  and lipolysis were analyzed. Isobutylxanthine-dexamethasone-insulin (MDI)-induced  in 3T3-L1 cells were blocked by resveratrol, but not by glycine, as shown by decreased lipid contents, reduced diameters of lipid droplets, decreased protein abundances for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), as well as increased protein abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), critical transcriptional factors that regulates . However, the mRNA levels of adiponectin and interleukin-10 (IL-10), two adipose-derived adipocytokines with anti-inflammatory effects, were greatly enhanced (P < 0.05) by 2 mmol/L glycine. Compared with non-treated controls, 10 μmol/L isoproterenol significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the intracellular lipid and triglyceride contents induced by  in Hela and HepG2 cells. mRNA level of fatty  synthase (FASN), a gene involved in fatty  synthesis, was significantly reduced (P < 0.05), while that for ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), genes involved in lipolysis were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) by isoproterenol. However,  induced the accumulation of intracellular triglyceride and lipid contents were not affected by glycine. In conclusion, glycine exposure enhanced the mRNA levels of adipose-derived adiponectin and IL-10 without affecting  and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings provide a possible explanation for the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of glycine that were previously reported in animal models. More studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for this regulatory effect of glycine on anti-inflammatory adipocytokines expression in both in vitro and in vivo models.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470518>Beyond the Scavenging of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS): Direct Effect of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles in Reducing Fatty Acids Content in an In Vitro Model of Hepatocellular Steatosis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic accumulation of lipids. Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to  and palmitic . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with  and palmitic  increased  and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced palmitic and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29254285>Picroside II attenuates fatty  accumulation in HepG2 cells via modulation of fatty  uptake and synthesis.</a></h1><p>Hepatic steatosis is caused by an imbalance between free fatty acids (FFAs) uptake, utilization, storage, and disposal. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in FFAs accumulation and its modulation could drive the development of potential therapies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of picroside II, a phytoactive found in , on fatty  accumulation vis-à-vis silibinin, a known hepatoprotective phytoactive from .HepG2 cells were loaded with FFAs (:palmitic /2:1) for 20 hours to mimic hepatic steatosis. The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of fatty  transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated fatty  accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis.

It showed anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with acute lung injuries and regulated lipid metabolism through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes. However, the effects of licochalcone A on reducing weight gain and improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated weight loss and lipid metabolism in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a fatty liver cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with  and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased body weight as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue weights compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue weight and lipid droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of  and fatty  synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty  chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes.

The hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects of MS and AK indicate that they have potential on preventing or curing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  (OA) and high-fat diet were used to induce steatosis in FL83B hepatocytes and NAFLD in mice, respectively. We found that both MS and AK prevented fatty  accumulation in hepatocytes by inhibiting fatty  uptake, , and promoting fatty  beta-oxidation mediated by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). Furthermore, MS and AK significantly attenuated high-fat diet-induced elevation of total cholesterol (TC), triaceylglycerol (TG), free fatty  (FFA), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in plasma. MS and AK promoted AMPK phosphorylation, suppressed the steatosis-related mRNA expression and inflammatory cytokines secretion, as well as upregulated farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator (PGC)-1α, and PPARα expression to induce fatty  oxidation in the liver of mice. We provided evidence that MS and AK act as PPARα agonists to upregulate AMPK activity and attenuate NAFLD.

Blood samples were analyzed at fasting (0 and 24 h) and postprandial (2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after breakfast) time points. FA was isolated from VLDL to estimate hepatic FA synthesis, whereas free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE) was isolated from plasma and VLDL to estimate whole-body and hepatic cholesterol synthesis, respectively. Lipid synthesis was measured using deuterium incorporation and isotope ratio mass spectrometry.Fasting total hepatic  (3.91 ± 0.90% vs. 5.30 ± 1.22%; P = 0.41) was not significantly different between diabetic and control groups, respectively, nor was synthesis of myristic (28.60 ± 4.90% vs. 26.66 ± 4.57%; P = 0.76), palmitic (12.52 ± 2.75% vs. 13.71 ± 2.64%; P = 0.65), palmitoleic (3.86 ± 0.91% vs. 4.80 ± 1.22%; P = 0.65), stearic (5.55 ± 1.04% vs. 6.96 ± 0.97%; P = 0.29), and  (1.45 ± 0.28% vs. 2.10 ± 0.51%; P = 0.21).

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy metabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet fed mice and P/O (palmitic  and  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress . In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27762456>Hovenia Dulcis Extract Reduces Lipid Accumulation in -Induced Steatosis of Hep G2 Cells via Activation of AMPK and PPARα/CPT-1 Pathway and in Acute Hyperlipidemia Mouse Model.</a></h1><p>Hovenia dulcis Thunb.

In the present study, the anti-fatty liver mechanism of HDT was elucidated in  (OA)-treated Hep G2 cells and acute hyperlipidemia mouse model using Triton WR-1339. Here, HDT activated p-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), proliferator activated receptor-α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase and also inhibited the expression of  and cholesterol synthesis proteins, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, SREBP-2, and fatty  synthase in OA-treated Hep G2 cells. Conversely, AMPK inhibitor compound C blocked the anti-fatty liver effect of HDT to induce AMPK phosphorylation and decrease 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and lipid accumulation by oil red O staining in OA-treated Hep G2 cells. Additionally, HDT pretreatment protected against the increase of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in an acute hyperlipidemia mouse model with enhancement of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities. Taken together, HDT inhibits OA-induced hepatic lipid accumulation via activation of AMPK and proliferator activated receptor-α/carnitine palmitoyltransferase signaling and enhancement of antioxidant activity as a potent candidate for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23594856>Effects of trans-fatty acids on liver lipid metabolism in mice fed on diets showing different fatty  composition.</a></h1><p>Our aim was to investigate the effects of trans-fatty acids (TFA) on liver lipid metabolism in mice fed on experimental diets rich in either  or linoleic .Twenty-two male CF1 mice (22.0 ± 0.1 g) were fed with diets rich in corn oil or olive oil, supplemented or not with TFA (0.75 g TFA/100 g diet), for 4 weeks. Changes in triacylglycerol content, the activity and expression of enzymes involved in  and fatty  oxidation were measured.Supplementation of an olive oil-rich diet with TFA increased liver triacylglycerols, the activity and expression of lipogenic enzymes and sterol regulatory element-binding protein SREBP-1a expression. By contrast, when TFA were added to a corn oil-rich diet, they did not modify these parameters. No significant differences were observed among the experimental groups in the activity and expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-Ia, body and liver weights or serum triacylglycerol concentrations.The effect of TFA on liver fat accumulation depends on the dietary fatty  composition. Steatosis induced by TFA when included in an olive oil diet (but not in a corn oil diet) was associated with an increased  but not with a decreased fatty  oxidation in animals fed on the olive oil diet. This metabolic change is mediated by SREBP-1a but not by SREBP-1c, and seems to be independent of insulin.Copyright © 2013 S.

The involvement of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a molecular target for scopolin was also explored. Scopolin decreased the Km of SIRT1 for p53 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide without altering Vmax in a cell-free system. Scopolin alleviated -induced lipid accumulation and downregulation of SIRT1 activity in HepG2 cells, and these beneficial effects of scopolin were abolished in the presence of SIRT1 inhibitor. Mice administered 0.02% scopolin for 8 weeks exhibited improved phenotypes of HFD-induced hepatic steatosis along with increased hepatic SIRT1 activity and protein expression. Scopolin resulted in increased deacetylation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c with subsequent downregulation of lipogenic genes, and enhanced deacetylation of protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α with upregulation of fatty  oxidation genes in livers. Scopolin also enhanced deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa enhancer binding protein and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), facilitating LKB1/AMP-activated protein kinase signaling cascades. Scopolin attenuated hepatic steatosis through activation of SIRT1-mediated signaling cascades, a potent regulator of lipid homeostasis. Increased hepatic SIRT1 activity and protein expression appeared to be associated with these beneficial effects of scopolin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373507>Alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation leads to the accumulation of large, immobile lipid droplets.</a></h1><p>Although steatosis (fatty liver) is a clinically well-described early stage of alcoholic liver disease, surprisingly little is known about how it promotes hepatotoxicity. We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the lipid droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes , we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF-B cells treated with ethanol and/or  (a fatty  associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased lipid droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol metabolism, and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic liver disease. Chronic alcohol consumption with the "Western diet" enhances the development of fatty liver and leads to impaired droplet motility, which may have serious deletrious effects on hepatocyte function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113798>Fucoxanthin attenuates fatty -induced lipid accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes through regulated Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>The fucoxanthin, isolated from brown algae, was reported to have multiple biological functions to anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and ameliorated obesity in mice. In this study we investigated whether fucoxanthin could inhibit lipids accumulation in FL83B hepatocytes. FL83B cells were induced as fatty liver cell model by 0.5 mM  for 48 h, and treated with various concentration of fucoxanthin for 24 h. The results demonstrated that fucoxanthin significantly suppressed lipid accumulation and decreased lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes. Fucoxanthin could decrease lipogenesis-related transcription factor expression, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. It also reduced fatty  synthase expression and increased adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase production for lipolysis. Furthermore, fucoxanthin significantly increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for regulating fatty  synthesis. The results suggest that fucoxanthin is an effective marine nature compound for increasing lipolysis and inhibiting lipogenesis in  induced fatty liver cells through promoted Sirt1/AMPK pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Palmitoleic  as a possible marker of endogenous  or its functions as a lipokine are under debate. Objective was to assess the predictive role of adipose triglycerides fatty acids in weight maintenance in participants of the DIOGENES dietary intervention study. After an 8-week low calorie diet (LCD) subjects with > 8 % weight loss were randomized to 5 ad libitum weight maintenance diets for 6 months: low protein (P)/low glycemic index (GI) (LP/LGI), low P/high GI (LP/HGI), high P/low GI (HP/LGI), high P/high GI (HP/HGI), and a control diet. Fatty  composition in adipose tissue triglycerides was determined by gas chromatography in 195 subjects before the LCD (baseline), after LCD and weight maintenance. Weight change after the maintenance phase was positively correlated with baseline adipose palmitoleic (16:1n-7), myristoleic (14:1n-5) and trans-palmitoleic  (16:1n-7t). Negative correlation was found with baseline  (18:1n-9). Lower baseline monounsaturated fatty acids (14:1n-5, 16:1n-7 and trans 16:1n-7) in adipose tissue triglycerides predict better weight maintenance. Lower  predicts lower weight decrease. These findings suggest a specific role of monounsaturated fatty acids in weight management and as weight change predictors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912298>Sechium edule Shoot Extracts and Active Components Improve Obesity and a Fatty Liver That Involved Reducing Hepatic  and  in High-Fat-Diet-Fed Rats.</a></h1><p>Excess fat accumulation in the liver increases the risk of developing progressive liver injuries ranging from a fatty liver to hepatocarcinoma. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the polyphenol components of Sechium edule shoots attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro. Therefore, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of the extract of S. edule shoots (SWE) to modulate fat accumulation in a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced animal model. In this study, we found that the SWE can reduce the body weight, adipose tissue fat, and regulate hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triglyceride and cholesterol). Additionally, treatment of caffeic  (CA) and hesperetin (HPT), the main ingredients of SWE, also inhibited  (OA)-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. SWE enhanced the activation of AMP-activating protein kinase (AMPK) and decreased numerous lipogenic-related enzymes, such as sterol regulator element-binding proteins (SREBPs), e.g., SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCoR) proteins, which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism. Taken together, the results demonstrated that SWE can prevent a fatty liver and attenuate adipose tissue fat by inhibiting lipogenic enzymes and stimulating lipolysis via upregulating AMPK. It was also demonstrated that the main activation components of SWE are both CA and HPT.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23855275>Fatty  ethanolamides modulate CD36-mRNA through dietary fatty  manipulation in Syrian Golden hamsters.</a></h1><p>Fatty acids convert to fatty  ethanolamides which associate with lipid signalling, fat oxidation, and energy balance; however, the extent to which dietary fatty acids manipulation can impact such control processes through fatty  ethanolamides-related mechanisms remains understudied. The objective was to examine the impact of diets containing 6% corn oil, high  canola oil, docosahexaenoic  + high  canola oil, and fish oil on plasma and organ levels of fatty  ethanolamides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α regulatory targets, and lipid metabolism in Syrian Golden hamsters. After 29 days, in plasma, animals that were fed fish oil showed greater (p < 0.05) oleoylethanolamide and lower (p < 0.05) arachidonoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide levels compared with other groups, while animals fed canola oil showed higher (p < 0.05) oleoylethanolamide levels in proximal intestine and liver than groups that were fed coin oil and fish oil. The canola oil group showed elevated (p < 0.01) fat oxidation (%) and over 3.0-fold higher (p < 0.05) hepatic-CD36 expression compared with the corn oil group. Hepatic- was lower (p < 0.05) in hamsters that were fed DHA-canola oil compared with the corn oil group. To conclude, dietary fatty acids produced shifts in plasma and organ levels of arachidonoylethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide, and palmitoylethanolamid, which were accompanied by changes in gene expression, , and energy expenditure, suggesting mechanisms through which dietary fatty acids influence disease risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058170>PAM, OLA, and LNA are Differentially Taken Up and Trafficked Via Different Metabolic Pathways in Porcine Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Dietary fatty acids have different effects on fat deposition in pigs. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of this difference, we compared the metabolism of palmitic (PAM, saturated),  (OLA, monounsaturated) and linoleic  (LNA, polyunsaturated) in porcine adipocytes treated with 100 μM PAM, OLA or LNA. We observed that the adipocytes incubated with LNA accumulated more lipids compared with those treated with PAM and OLA. We then probed the metabolism of these fatty acids in porcine adipocytes by using isotope-labelled fatty acids. The results showed that 42% of the [1-C] LNA, 34% of the [1-C] PAM and 28% of the [1-C] OLA were recovered in the cellular lipids. The gene expression analyses showed that LNA significantly increased the expression of adipogenesis- and oxidation-related genes including PPARγ, C/EBPα, ap2 and NRF1. In addition, the cells incubated with LNA showed a decreased Ser phosphorylation in PPARγ compared to those incubated with PAM and OLA. Furthermore, when PPARγ Ser phosphorylation was inhibited, no significant difference in the triacylglycerol contents in the adipocytes was observed. These results showed the dietary fatty acids had different metabolism pathways in porcine adipocytes, and LNA significantly promoted lipid accumulation, probably by regulating PPARγ phosphorylation in adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931237>Adipogenic/lipogenic gene expression and fatty  composition in chuck, loin, and round muscles in response to grain feeding of Yanbian Yellow cattle.</a></h1><p>We hypothesized that gene expression and fatty  composition would differ among different muscle depots and over time on a grain-based finishing diet. Additionally, we hypothesized that the concentration of SFA would decrease and the concentration of MUFA would increase proportionately with increases in percent intramuscular lipid (%IML). Ten Yanbian Yellow cattle steers (approximately 8 mo of age) were fed a corn-based diet in which the proportion of corn in the ration was increased at 4-mo intervals. Muscle samples were taken by biopsy from the chuck (trapezius), loin (longissimus dorsi), and round (biceps femoris) muscles at 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 mo of age. The %IML increased from 12 to 28 mo of age, especially between 24 and 28 mo of age, with loin > round > chuck (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001). The percentage (g/100 g total fatty acids) of  (18:1n-9), linoleic  (18:2n-6), and α-linolenic  (18:3n-3), and the MUFA:SFA ratio increased with age, whereas palmitic (16:0) and stearic  (18:0) decreased with age in all muscles (age effect P < 0.001). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1), adipose tissue fatty - binding protein (FABP4), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased, whereas the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and fatty  synthase (FASN) decreased with age. Expression of PPARγ, FABP4, SREBP1, SCD, FASN, ACC1, and LPL was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round (age × muscle interaction P < 0.001), although the MUFA:SFA ratio was greater in the chuck than in the loin or round (muscle effect P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipogenic gene expression was greater in the loin than in the chuck or round muscles, consistent with the greater %IML of the loin. However, the greater SCD gene expression in the loin did not result in a greater amount of MUFA in the loin, relative to the chuck and round.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602867>Effect of Gangjihwan on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in high fat diet-fed mice.</a></h1><p>Gangjihwan (DF), a polyherbal drug composed of Ephedra intermedia Schrenk et C. A. Mayer (Ephedraceae), Lithospermum erythrorhizon Siebold et Zuccarini (Borraginaceae), and Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), is used to treat obesity in local Korean clinics. The constituents of DF have traditionally been reported to exert anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of DF on obesity and NAFLD and the underlying mechanisms.DF was extracted with water (DF-FW), 30% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA30), or 70% ethyl alcohol (DF-GA70). The chemical profile of DF was monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet analysis. The effects of DF on indices of obesity and NAFLD in high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Oil red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, toluidine blue staining, and immunohistochemistry.The presence of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, aloe-emodin, and emodin in DF was determined by 3D chromatography using HPLC. Administration of DF-GA70 to HFD-fed obese mice decreased body weight, epididymal adipose tissue mass, and epididymal adipocyte size. DF-GA70 reduced serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All three DF extracts lowered serum alanine transaminase levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and infiltration of macrophages, with the largest effects observed for DF-GA70. DF-GA70 increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation genes and decreased mRNA levels of genes for  and inflammation in the liver of obese mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, whereas all three DF extracts inhibited lipid accumulation. DF-GA70 also altered the expression of lipolytic and lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells.These results indicate that DF inhibits obesity and obesity-induced severe hepatic steatosis and inflammation without any adverse effects and that these effects may be mediated by regulation of the hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and inflammatory genes. These findings suggest that DF is a safe and efficient anti-obesity and anti-nonalcoholic steatohepatosis drug.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is well known that, in beef, the main FAs associated with these biological processes are  (C18:1 cis9, OA) and conjugated linoleic  (CLA-c9t11), which may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we performed differential expression and co-expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and partial correlation with information theory (PCIT), to uncover the complex interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle associated with FA content. miRNA and mRNA expression data were obtained from skeletal muscle of Nelore cattle that had extreme genomic breeding values for OA and CLA. Insulin and MAPK signaling pathways were identified by WGCNA as central pathways associated with both of these fatty acids.

These adverse effects have been attributed to epigenetic changes in utero, but little is known about the role of placental metabolism and its contribution to fetal development.We examined the impact of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on the expression of genes involved in placental lipid metabolism in lean and obese women.Seventy-three lean and obese women with healthy pregnancy were recruited at term elective cesarean delivery. Metabolic parameters were measured on maternal venous blood samples. Expression of 88 genes involved in lipid metabolism was measured in whole placenta tissue. Proteins of genes differently expressed in response to maternal obesity were quantified, correlated with maternal parameters and immunolocalized in placenta sections. Isolated primary trophoblasts were used for in vitro assays.Triglyceride (TG) content was increased in placental tissue of obese (1.10, CI 1.04-1.24 mg g, P<0.05) vs lean (0.84, CI 0.72-1.02 mg g) women. Among target genes examined, six showed positive correlation (P<0.05) with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, namely ATGL (PNPLA2), FATP1 (SLC27A1), FATP3 (SLC27A3), PLIN2, PPARG and CGI-58 (ABHD5). CGI-58 protein abundance was twofold higher (P<0.001) in placentas of obese vs lean women. CGI-58 protein levels correlated positively with maternal insulin levels and pre-pregnancy body mass index (R=0.63, P<0.001 and R=0.64, P<0.001, respectively). CGI-58 and PLIN2 were primarily located in the syncytiotrophoblast and, were upregulated (1.38- and 500-fold, respectively) upon  and insulin treatment of cultured trophoblast cells.Pre-gravid obesity significantly modifies the expression of placental genes related to transport and storage of neutral lipids. We propose that the upregulation of CGI-58, a master regulator of TG hydrolysis, contributes to the turnover of intracellular lipids in placenta of obese women, and is tightly regulated by metabolic factors of the mother.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31491871>Transcriptional Regulation of the Bovine Fatty  Transport Protein 1 Gene by Krüppel-Like Factors 15.</a></h1><p> is a major monounsaturated fatty , which accounts for about 33% of the fatty  content in beef and is considered to have the least negative effect on serum cholesterol levels.

However, the role of GRIM-19 in the pathogenesis of hepatitis virus infections remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the restrictive effects of GRIM-19 on the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). We found that GRIM-19 protein levels were reduced in HCV-infected Huh7 cells and Huh7 cells harboring HCV replicons. Moreover, ectopically expressed GRIM-19 caused a reduction in both intracellular viral RNA levels and secreted viruses in HCVcc-infected cell cultures. The restrictive effect on HCV replication was restored by treatment with siRNA against GRIM-19. Interestingly, GRIM-19 overexpression did not alter the level of phosphorylated STAT3 or its subcellular distribution. Strikingly, forced expression of GRIM-19 attenuated an increase in intracellular lipid droplets after  (OA) treatment or HCVcc infection. GRIM-19 overexpression abrogated fatty -induced upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1c), resulting in attenuated expression of its target genes such as fatty  synthase (FAS) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Treatment with OA or overexpression of SREBP-1c in GRIM-19-expressing, HCVcc-infected cells restored HCV replication. Our results suggest that GRIM-19 interferes with HCV replication by attenuating intracellular lipid accumulation and therefore is an anti-viral host factor that could be a promising target for HCV treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454838>In vitro and in vivo enhancement of  by Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in 3T3-L1 cells and mice.</a></h1><p> is very much important in improving the quality of meat in animals.

At 6 weeks old, no differences in fat mass were found between SAT and VAT in WT mice, while O-SAT showed significantly higher weight than that of O-VAT. The average adipocyte size of SAT (~ 4133.47 μm2) was smaller than that of VAT (~ 7438.91 μm2) in OB mice. O-SAT preadipocytes gained higher triglyceride contents and higher levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα than did O-VAT preadipocytes upon in vitro differentiation. W-SAT and W-VAT displayed no significant differences in fatty  uptake, while 1.36 fold significantly higher fatty  uptake was found in O-SAT compared to O-VAT. Approximately 52% of the radioactivity recovered in cellular lipids was found in TAG in O-SAT, which was significantly higher than the other three adipocyte types. Significantly more radiolabelled  was β-oxidized to CO2 in adipocytes from O-VAT than that from O-SAT. ATP production was significantly lower in W-SAT compared with W-VAT, whereas no significantly ATP level was observed between O-SAT and O-VAT. Expression of UCP-1 in SAT from either WT or OB mice was significantly higher than the counterpart of VAT, which demonstrated higher uncoupled respiration and lower oxidative phosphorylation in SAT. Together, a combined increase in  and FA uptake, and decreases in β-oxidation and ATP production, contributed to greater expansion of SAT compared to VAT in obese mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324559>Melatonin Modulates lipid Metabolism in HepG2 Cells Cultured in High Concentrations of : AMPK Pathway Activation may Play an Important Role.</a></h1><p>Melatonin exists as an active ingredient in several foods and has been reported to inhibit fatty liver disease in animals; however, its molecular mechanisms are not well elucidated. Herein, we explored effects of melatonin on lipid accumulation induced by  in HepG2 cells and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pretreatment with melatonin (0.1-0.3 mM) significantly inhibited accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol induced by incubating HepG2 cells with high concentrations of  ( overload) (p < 0.05). Melatonin pretreatment induced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), causing their activation and inactivation, respectively. Expression levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα) and its target gene carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1 (CPT1), which are associated with lipolysis, were upregulated by melatonin, whereas expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty  synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which are associated with , were downregulated. Melatonin did not change expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and SREBP-2. Melatonin inhibits lipid accumulation induced by  overload in HepG2 cells. The phosphorylation and activation of AMPK may have important roles in inactivating lipid anabolic pathways and activating triglyceride catabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727953>Fatty  Composition of Plasma Phosphatidylcholine Determines Body Fat Parameters in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome-Related Traits.</a></h1><p>This study examines the associations of fatty acids (FAs) in plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC) with the anthropometrical and biochemical characteristic of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related traits.We analyzed the FA profiles of PC in 300 persons with MetS-related traits (152 M/148F, mean age 46.9 ± 9.0 years) and in 70 healthy controls of the same age using a balanced men/women ratio and gas-liquid chromatography. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the coefficients of determination (R) using FA proportions of the mentioned proband characteristics.The FA composition of PC in patients with MetS traits was only associated with waist circumference (R = 0.27), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; R = 0.41), body fat percentage (R = 0.62), and fat mass (R = 0.29).

Palm oil had no effect (P > 0.05) on ADG, food intake, or G:F, whereas soybean oil depressed ADG (P = 0.02), food intake (P = 0.04), and G:F (P = 0.05). Marbling scores tended (P = 0.09) to be greater in palm oil-fed steers (Modest(09)) than in soybean oil-fed steers (Small(55)). Subcutaneous adipocyte mean volume was greater in palm oil-fed steers (515.9 pL) than in soybean-supplemented cattle (395.6 pL; P = 0.01). Similarly, glucose and acetate incorporation into total lipids in vitro was greater in subcutaneous adipose tissue of palm oil-fed steers (119.9 and 242.8 nmol·3h(-1)·10(5) cells, respectively) than adipose tissue of soybean oil-fed steers in (48.9 and 95.8 nmol·3h(-1)·10(5) cells, respectively). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADP-malate dehydrogenase activities were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in subcutaneous adipose tissue of palm oil-fed steers than in adipose tissue of control steers. Palm oil did not increase palmitic  or decrease  in subcutaneous adipose tissue or LM, but decreased (P ≤ 0.05) myristoleic, palmitoleic, and cis-vaccenic  in adipose tissue, indicating a depression in stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase activity. Soybean oil increased the proportion of α-linolenic  in adipose tissue and muscle and increased linoleic  and 18:1trans-10 in muscle. We conclude that palm oil supplementation promoted lipid synthesis in adipose tissue without depressing feed efficiency or increasing the palmitic  content of beef.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365116>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep. II. Supplementation of eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  during late gestation alters the fatty  profile of plasma, colostrum, milk and adipose tissue, and increases lipogenic gene expression of adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this study were as follows: 1) to establish whether feeding a source of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) to ewes during late gestation changes the fatty  profile of colostrum, milk, ewe adipose tissue, and plasma and subsequently lamb plasma and red blood cells (RBC), and 2) to investigate the effects of EPA and DHA on mRNA expression in ewe adipose tissue. Eighty-four gestating ewes (28 pens, three per pen) were blocked by lambing day and assigned to a diet with an addition of fat at 0.39% of the DM during the last 50 d of gestation using Ca salts of a palm fatty  distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  acids or EPA + DHA. Blood samples were taken from ewes on days 20, 1 (parturition), and 30 and from lambs on days 1 and 30 for plasma fatty  analysis. Fatty analysis of lamb RBC was performed on day 1. Colostrum samples were taken at lambing and milk samples on day 30 for fatty  analysis. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were taken from one ewe per pen on day 20 for fatty  analysis and gene expression analysis of 27 genes. Treatment × day interactions (P < 0.10) were observed for several isomers of C18:1, with concentrations that were greater in plasma of EPA + DHA ewes on day 20, but were not different on day 1 or 30. Plasma concentrations of EPA tended to be greater (P = 0.07), whereas DHA was greater (P < 0.001) in EPA + DHA ewes compared with PFAD ewes. There was no difference in EPA or DHA in adipose tissue with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation (P > 0.10). Concentrations of fatty acids with 6 to 10 carbons were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in colostrum and milk of EPA + DHA ewes. There was a treatment × day interaction with EPA + DHA ewes yielding greater EPA (P = 0.03) and DHA (P = 0.04) concentrations than PFAD in colostrum, but not in milk. Treatment × day interactions (P < 0.05) were observed for several C18:1 isomers with concentrations that were greater in EPA + DHA ewe colostrum, but were not different between treatments in milk. In lamb plasma and RBC, EPA and DHA were not different between treatments (P > 0.10). The expression of fatty  synthase and leptin was significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 tended to be increased (P = 0.08) by supplementation of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD. These results suggest that supplementation with EPA and DHA to ewes during late gestation alters the fatty  profile of plasma, colostrum, and milk and may increase .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646799>Effects of ferulic  and γ-oryzanol on high-fat and high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome in rats.</a></h1><p>The high morbidity of metabolic dysfunction diseases has heightened interest in seeking natural and safe compounds to maintain optimal health. γ-Oryzanol (OZ), the ferulic  (FA) ester with phytosterols, mainly present in rice bran has been shown to improve markers of metabolic syndrome. This study investigates the effects of FA and OZ on alleviating high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFFD)-induced metabolic syndrome parameters.Male SD rats were fed with a regular rodent diet, HFFD, or HFFD supplemented with 0.05% FA or 0.16% OZ (equimolar concentrations) for 13 weeks. Food intake, organ indices, serum lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) index and cytokine levels were analyzed. The mechanisms were further investigated in -stimulated HepG2 cells by analyzing triglyceride (TG) content and -related gene expressions.In the in vivo study, FA and OZ exhibited similar effects in alleviating HFFD-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and IR. However, only OZ treatment significantly decreased liver index and hepatic TG content, lowered serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and increased serum concentration of adiponectin. In the in vitro assay, only OZ administration significantly inhibited intracellular TG accumulation and down-regulated expression of stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase-1, which might facilitate OZ to enhance its hepatoprotective effect.OZ is more effective than FA in inhibiting hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Thus, FA and OZ could be used as dietary supplements to alleviate the deleterious effects of HFFD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30159640>Insight into Arthrospira platensis Δ9 desaturase: a key enzyme in poly-unsaturated fatty  synthesis.</a></h1><p>Membrane-bound Δ9 desaturase perform oxygenated desaturation reactions to insert the first double bonds within fatty acyl chains between C9 and C10 positions of most saturated substrates. Arthrospira platensis, a blue green microalga, is an important source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as , linoleic and linolenic acids lending benefits and functions in dietetics and therapeutic uses. In this paper, we report homology modeling and docking studies of a Δ9 desaturase from Arthrospira platensis strain. The protein model showed high topology resemblance compared to membrane-bound desaturases with a cytoplasmic core displaying the catalytic site and a transmembrane domain created by four α-helices. The cytoplasmic cap contained the three conserved-histidine boxes typical for all membrane bound desaturases. The protein model was used to perform protein-protein docking and the dimer structure was generated. The two monomers are tightly related with hydrophobic interactions between the transmembrane domain helices. The study highlighted also the potent role of a particular 53 residues sequence located at the N terminal end of the enzyme.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27464460>The effects of trans-fatty acids on TAG regulation in mice depend on dietary unsaturated fatty acids.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of trans-fatty acids (TFA) on liver and serum TAG regulation in mice fed diets containing different proportions of n-3, n-6 and n-9 unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) from olive (O), maize (C) or rapeseed (R) oils partially substituted or not with TFA (Ot, Ct and Rt, respectively). Male CF1 mice were fed (30 d) one of these diets. The effects of the partial substitution (1 %, w/w) of different UFA with TFA on the activity and expression of hepatic enzymes involved in  and fatty acids oxidation were evaluated, as well as their transcription factor expressions. Some of the mechanisms involved in the serum TAG regulation, hepatic VLDL rich in TAG (VLDL-TAG) secretion rate and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity were assessed. In liver, TFA induced an increase in TAG content in the Ot and Rt groups, and this effect was associated with an imbalance between  and β-oxidation. In the Ot group, exacerbated  may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the liver steatosis induced by TFA, whereas in Rt it has been related to a decreased β-oxidation, compared with their respective controls. The enhanced hepatic VLDL-TAG secretion in the Ot and Rt groups was compensated with a differential removal of TAG by LPL enzyme in extrahepatic tissues, leading to unchanged serum TAG levels. In brief, the effects of low levels of TFA on liver and serum TAG regulation in mice depend on the dietary proportions of n-3, n-6 and n-9 UFA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27617178>Dropping in on the lipid droplet- tumor protein D52 (TPD52) as a new regulator and resident protein.</a></h1><p>Lipid droplets are essential for both the storage and retrieval of excess cellular nutrients, and their biology is regulated by a diverse range of cellular proteins, some of which function at the lipid droplet. Numerous studies have characterized lipid droplet proteomes in different organisms and cell types, and RNAi whole genome screening studies have examined the genetic regulation of lipid storage in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. While tumor protein D52 (TPD52) did not emerge from earlier studies as a strong candidate, exogenous expression of human TPD52 in cultured cells resulted in significantly increased numbers of lipid droplets, and  supplementation increased TPD52 detection at both lipid droplets and the Golgi apparatus. These results suggest that direct testing of proteins that are infrequently but recurrently identified in proteomic and RNAi screening studies may identify novel lipid droplet regulators. While the analysis of these possibly lower-abundance or itinerant lipid droplet proteins may be more technically challenging, such proteins could facilitate a more detailed interrogation of emerging aspects of lipid droplet biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772307>Nitro-fatty acids protect against steatosis and fibrosis during development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of  and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent  gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

Here we aimed to explore the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in modulating the cross-talk between liver and visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) regarding BA and cholesterol metabolism and fatty /lipid partitioning in morbidly obese NAFLD patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study, we analyzed serum, liver and vWAT samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese patients receiving UDCA (20 mg/kg/day) or no treatment three weeks prior to bariatric surgery.Short term UDCA administration stimulated BA synthesis by reducing circulating fibroblast growth factor 19 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation, resulting in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase induction mirrored by elevated C4 and 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Enhanced BA formation depleted hepatic and LDL-cholesterol with subsequent activation of the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Blunted FXR anti-lipogenic effects induced lipogenic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in the liver, thereby increasing hepatic triglyceride content. In addition, induced SCD activity in vWAT shifted vWAT lipid metabolism towards generation of less toxic and more lipogenic monounsaturated fatty acids such as .These data demonstrate that by exerting FXR-antagonistic effects, UDCA treatment in NAFLD patients strongly impacts on cholesterol and BA synthesis and induces neutral lipid accumulation in both liver and vWAT.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

This study aimed to investigate the activities of MB salt in modulating lipid and glucose metabolisms in HepG2 cells. After 24 h treatment of the studying compounds, cellular AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) protein levels and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1 activities, intracellular lipid contents, mRNA expression levels of target genes, glucose consumption, and glucose production amounts were determined. Compound C (CC) was used in the blocking experiments. Our results showed that MB salt increased p-AMPKα (Thr172)/p-ACC (Ser79) levels and CPT1 activity and suppressed - (OA-) induced lipid accumulation and upregulation of lipogenic genes potently in HepG2 cells. The above activities of MB salt were AMPK dependent and were superior to those of M or B when administered at an equal molar concentration. MB salt enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and suppressed gluconeogenesis more potently than M or B alone. The inhibiting activity of MB salt on cellular gluconeogenesis was AMPK dependent. Our results may support MB salt as a new kind of agent for the development of novel lipid or glucose-lowering drugs in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26497211>Identification of cytochrome CYP2E1 as critical mediator of synergistic effects of alcohol and cellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in vitro.</a></h1><p>Clinical studies propose a causative link between the consumption of alcohol and the development and progression of liver disease in obese individuals. However, it is incompletely understood how alcohol and obesity interact and whether the combined effects are additive or synergistic. In this study, we developed an in vitro model to address this question. Lipid accumulation in primary human hepatocytes was induced by incubation with . Subsequently, steatotic and control hepatocytes were incubated with up to 50 mM alcohol. This alcohol concentration on its own revealed only minimal effects but significantly enhanced oleate-induced  and cellular triglyceride content compared to control cells. Similarly, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory gene expression as well as CYP2E1 levels and activity were synergistically induced by alcohol and steatosis. CYP2E1 inhibition blunted these synergistic pathological effects. Notably, alcohol and cellular steatosis also induced autophagy in a synergistic manner, and also this was mediated via CYP2E1. Further induction of autophagy ameliorated the joint effects of alcohol and  on hepatocellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory gene expression while inhibition of autophagy further enhanced the dual pathological effects. Further analyses revealed that the joint synergistic effect of alcohol and steatosis on autophagy was mediated via activation of the JNK-pathway. In summary, our data indicate that alcohol induces not only pathological but also protective mechanisms in steatotic hepatocytes via CYP2E1. These findings may have important implications on the prognosis and treatment of alcoholic liver disease particularly in obese individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30532639>Ginkgolide C reduced -induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Ginkgolide C, isolated from , is a diterpene lactone that has multiple biological functions and can improve Alzheimer disease and platelet aggregation. Ginkgolide C also inhibits  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The present study evaluated whether ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and regulated the molecular mechanism of  in -induced HepG2 hepatocytes. HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 mM  for 48 h to induce a fatty liver cell model. Then, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of ginkgolide C for 24 h. Staining with Oil Red O and the fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 revealed that ginkgolide C significantly reduced excessive lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Ginkgolide C decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c to block the expression of fatty  synthase. Ginkgolide C treatment also promoted the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase and the phosphorylation level of hormone-sensitive lipase to enhance the decomposition of triglycerides. In addition, ginkgolide C stimulated CPT-1 to activate fatty  β-oxidation, significantly increased sirt1 and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for suppressed fatty  synthesis in hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that ginkgolide C reduced lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis through the sirt1/AMPK pathway in -induced fatty liver cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794005>Pu-erh tea extract ameliorates high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and insulin resistance by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling in mice.</a></h1><p>Pu-erh tea, made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, possesses activities beneficial for human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-obesity properties.We investigated the effects of a pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects.Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks, during which PTE was simultaneously administered in drinking water. Body weight, hepatic inflammation, steatosis, insulin sensitivity, expression of - and gluconeogenesis-associated genes, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation were examined. The anti-steatotic effects of PTE and/or interleukin (IL)-6 were evaluated in HepG2 cells. The lipid accumulation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were analyzed.PTE inhibited HFD-induced obesity and significantly attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and liver inflammation, and prevented against liver injury. PTE treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, PTE treatment maintained the intact insulin signal and significantly decreased expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in the livers of HFD-fed mice. PTE treatment strikingly enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in the livers of HFD-fed mice. Consistent with this increase in STAT3 phosphorylation, pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with PTE enhanced IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and attenuated -induced steatosis in a STAT3-dependent manner. In contrast, PTE inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in macrophages.PTE ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance in mice with HFD-induced NASH, presumably by modulating hepatic IL-6/STAT3 signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27460177>Phenamil enhances the adipogenic differentiation of hen preadipocytes.</a></h1><p>A study was conducted to examine the effect of phenamil on adipogenic differentiation and expression of key adipogenic transcripts in hen preadipocytes.

Non-treated control (C) cells, cells treated with dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, insulin, and  (DMIOA) (T1), DMIOA + 15 μM phenamil (T2), DMIOA + 30 μM phenamil (T3), 15 μM phenamil alone (T4), and 30 μM phenamil alone (T5). Neutral lipid accumulation and the mRNA expression of key adipogenic transcripts were measured in all treatments and compared. Lipid accumulation was detected in T1, T2, and T3 only. Expression of peroxisome proliferator receptor-activator gamma 2 (PPARγ2), the core enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), C/EBPβ, fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) as well as ETS variant 4 (ETV4) and 5 was higher (P < 0.05) in T2, T3, T4, and T5 compared to C. Expression of these transcripts was higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3 compared to T4 and T5. The core enhancer binding protein α, C/EBPβ, and FABP4 were highly expressed (P < 0.05) in T1 compared to C. However, the expression of PPARγ2, LPL, and ETV4 and ETV5 was not significantly different. Expression of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and FABP4 was higher (P < 0.05) in T2 and T3 compared to T1. Expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and leptin receptor (LEPR) was not significantly different among the treatments.

The effects of GSO against diet-induced hepatic steatosis were further examined in C57BL/6J mice fed a HFD for 12 wk.Oil Red O staining and intracellular triglyceride levels showed marked accumulation of lipid droplets in both HepG2 cells and rat hepatocytes, and these were attenuated by GSO treatment. In HFD-fed mice, GSO improved HFD-induced dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin resistance. Increased hepatic lipid contents were observed in HFD-fed mice and it was lowered in GSO (500 mg/kg)-treated mice by 26.4% which was evident in histological analysis. Pathway analysis of hepatic global gene expression indicated that GSO increased the expression of genes associated with β-oxidation (, , , and ) and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes ( and ), and these were confirmed with reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase-chain reaction.These findings suggest that GSO has a beneficial effect on NAFLD through the suppression of  and stimulation of fatty  degradation pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535092>Plasma fatty acids in de novo  pathway are associated with diabetogenic indicators among adults: NHANES 2003-2004.</a></h1><p>Insulin regulates fatty acids (FAs) in the blood; conversely, FAs may mediate insulin sensitivity and are potentially modifiable risk factors of the diabetogenic state.The objective of our study was to examine the associations between plasma concentrations of FAs, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) among individuals (n = 1433) in the NHANES (2003-2004).Plasma concentrations of 24 individual FAs were considered individually and in subgroups, per chemical structure. Study participants were categorized in diabetogenic groups: Group 1 (HbA1c ≥6.5% or FPG ≥126 mg/dL), Group 2 (HbA1c 5.7% to <6.5% or FPG 100 to <126 mg/dL), and Group 3 (HbA1c <5.7% and FPG <100 mg/dL). We assessed associations between diabetogenic groups and plasma FAs in multivariate multinomial regressions (with Group 3 as the reference).Overall, 7.0% of study participants were in Group 1; 33.3% were in Group 2. Plasma concentrations of several individual FAs, including even-chain saturated FAs (SFAs; myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs; cis-vaccenic,  acids), were respectively associated with greater odds of Groups 1 and 2 status, adjusting for covariates. Higher concentrations of SFA and MUFA subgroups (highest compared with lowest quartile) were associated with increased odds of Group 2 status [SFAs adjusted OR (aOR): 1.51 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.18); MUFAs aOR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.85)].

The current study presents proof of feasibility of creating a 3-D spheroid model using human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and their subsequent adipogenic differentiation. hASC spheroids were formed atop an elastin-like polypeptide-polyethyleneimine (ELP-PEI) surface and differentiated using an adipogenic cocktail. Spheroids were matured in the presence of dietary fatty acids (linoleic or ) and evaluated based on functional markers including intracellular protein, CD36 expression, triglyceride accumulation, and PPAR-γ gene expression. Spheroid size was found to increase as the hASCs matured in the adipocyte maintenance medium, though the fatty  treatment generally resulted in smaller spheroids compared to control. A stable protein content over the 10-day maturation period indicated contact-inhibited proliferation as well as minimal loss of spheroids during culture. Spheroids treated with fatty acids showed greater amounts of intracellular triglyceride content and greater expression of the key adipogenic gene, PPAR-γ. We also demonstrated that 3-D spheroids outperformed 2-D monolayer cultures in . We then compared the  of hASC spheroids to that in 3T3-L1 spheroids and found that the triglyceride accumulation was less profound in hASC spheroids than that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, correlated with smaller average spheroids, suggesting a relatively slower differentiation process.

Alisma orientale (AO) is recognized as a promising candidate with therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). HepG2 hepatocyte cell line is commonly used for liver disease cell model.The HepG2 cells were cultured with the NEFAs mixture ( and palmitic acids, 2:1 ratio) for 24 h to induce hepatic steatosis.

Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mRNA expression level were decreased as well as p-JNK (activated form of JNK), Bax, cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 protein expression level. Anti-apopototic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein level increased after AOE treatment. In addition, inflammatory protein expression including p-p65, p65, COX-2 and iNOS were inhibited by AOE treatment.The results suggest that AOE has anti-steatosis effects that involve , anti-lipoapoptosis, and anti-inflammation in the NEFA-induced NAFLD pathological cell model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523479>Fatty Acids Have Different Adipogenic Differentiation Potentials in Stromal Vascular Cells Isolated from Abdominal Fat in Laying Hens.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to examine the effects of fatty acids (FA) with/without chicken serum (CS) on the expression of adipogenic transcripts and  in chicken stromal vascular cells (SVC).

In experimental steatohepatitis induced by feeding mice a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, the degree of liver damage is related to dietary sugar content, which drives de novo  and promotes the hepatic accumulation of saturated fatty acids. The objective of this study was to determine whether dietary palmitate exerts the same toxicity as carbohydrate-derived palmitate in the MCD model of fatty liver disease.We fed mice custom MCS and MCD formulas containing 4 different carbohydrate-fat combinations: starch-oleate, starch-palmitate, sucrose-oleate and sucrose-palmitate.  After 3 wk, we compared their metabolic and disease outcomes.Mice fed the custom MCD formulas developed varying degrees of hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis, in the order starch-oleate < starch-palmitate < sucrose-oleate < sucrose-palmitate. Liver injury correlated positively with the degree of hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver injury also correlated positively with the amount of palmitate in the liver, but the relationship was weak. Importantly, mice fed MCD starch-palmitate accumulated as much hepatic palmitate as mice fed MCD sucrose-oleate, yet their degree of liver injury was much lower. By contrast, mice fed MCD sucrose-palmitate developed severe liver injury, worse than that predicted by an additive influence of the two nutrients.In the MCD model of steatohepatitis, carbohydrate-derived palmitate in the liver is more hepatotoxic than dietary palmitate. Dietary palmitate becomes toxic when combined with dietary sugar in the MCD model, presumably by enhancing hepatic de novo .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23620084>Effects of  and chicken serum on the expression of adipogenic transcription factors and adipogenic differentiation in hen preadipocytes.</a></h1><p>We have examined the effect of  (OA) concentrations and incubation time, along with chicken serum (CS), on adipogenic differentiation and expression of adipogenic transcripts in hen preadipocytes. Preadipocytes were treated with (i) an adipogenic cocktail (DMI) containing 500 nM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 20 µg/mL insulin alone and DMI + 75, 150, 300 or 600 µM OA for 48 h; (ii) DMI + 300 µM OA (DMIOA) for 6, 12, 24 or 48 h; and (iii) foetal bovine serum (FBS), CS, DMI + FBS, DMI + CS, DMIOA + FBS and DMIOA + CS. While FABP4 was significantly expressed with increasing concentrations of OA, the expression of C/EBPβ, LEPR and FAS were unchanged compared with the control. PPARγ2 expression was unchanged across all time-points. A significantly higher level of C/EBPα was measured at 48 h, but the levels of C/EBPβ increased after 12 h. Levels of FABP4 significantly increased with the time of incubation after 12 h, but that of LPL was reduced (P < 0.05) at 6, 24 and 48 h. FABP4 was highly expressed in cells treated with CS, DMI + CS and DMIOA + CS compared to cells treated with FBS, DMI + FBS and DMIOA + FBS. In conclusion, increased concentrations of OA and incubation time increases lipid accumulation; FABP4 and C/EBPβ are potential transcription factors regulating OA induced  of fat cells obtained from laying hen.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this action remain unknown. Here, we evaluate the effect of DMY on an in vitro model of NAFLD and investigate the signal transduction pathways underlying DMY treatment. (OA) induced hepatic steatosis was established in L02 and HepG2 cells as in vitro model of NAFLD. Cell apoptosis, lipid accumulation and oxide stress were evaluated by flow cytometry, oil red O staining, and cellular biochemical assays, respectively. Signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism including PPARγ, AMPK, and AKT were investigated by Western blot and RT-qPCR.DMY protected cells against apoptosis and lipid accumulation induced by . DMY decreased the levels of cellular triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (TC) and malondialdehyde (MDA), while at the same time increasing the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD). DMY suppressed the expression of PPARγ and the phosphorylation of AKT, and promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK.Our study suggests that DMY ameliorates OA-induced hepatic steatosis by inhibiting cell apoptosis, lipid accumulation and oxide stress. Furthermore, the effect of DMY is likely associated with its role in the regulating of PPARγ, AMPK and AKT signaling pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, it is important to explore its underlying mechanisms.Total RNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples from 50 NAFLD patients and 50 healthy controls. In addition, human liver specimens were obtained through liver biopsies from NAFLD patients and healthy controls. The level of miRNA was studied using real-time PCR. The expression of lipogenic genes was analyzed using western blot, and a dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to identify the possible target gene. Adenovirus vectors were injected into the tail vein of the high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice to study the role of miR-155 on lipid accumulation in vivo.The level of miR-155 was markedly reduced in the livers and peripheral blood of NAFLD patients compared with healthy controls. Upregulation of miR-155 decreased intracellular lipid content and the SREBP1 and FAS protein levels, while inhibition of miR-155 enhanced the intracellular lipid content. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that Liver X receptor (LXR)α was the target gene of miR-155, and silencing miR-155 reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS. An in vivo study showed that upregulation of miR-155 decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation mainly by suppressing the LXRα-dependent lipogenic signaling pathway.In summary, decreased expression of miR-155 in the peripheral blood may be utilized as a potential novel biomarker for NAFLD screening mainly by targeting LXRα.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

However, transcriptional dynamic regulation of adipose differentiation driven by complex signal cascades remains largely unexplored in this model. This study aimed to explore adipogenic transcriptional dynamics before (proliferation) and after (differentiation) initial preadipocyte differentiation in ducks.Exogenous  alone successfully induced duck subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation. We explored 36 mRNA-seq libraries in order to study transcriptome dynamics during proliferation and differentiation processes at 6 time points. Using robust statistical analysis, we identified 845, 652, 359, 2401 and 1933 genes differentially expressed between -48 h and 0 h, 0 h and 12 h, 12 h and 24 h, 24 h and 48 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively (FDR < 0.05, FC > 1.5). At the proliferation stage, proliferation related pathways and basic cellular and metabolic processes were inhibited, while regulatory factors that initiate differentiation enter the ready-to-activate state, which provides a precondition for initiating adipose differentiation. According to weighted gene co-expression network analysis, pathways positively related to adipogenic differentiation are significantly activated at the differentiation stage, while WNT, FOXO and other pathways that inhibit preadipocyte differentiation are negatively regulated. Moreover, we identified and classified more than 100 transcription factors that showed significant changes during differentiation, and found novel transcription factors that were not reported to be related to preadipoctye differentiation. Finally, we manually assembled a proposed regulation network model of subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation base on the expression data, and suggested that E2F1 may serve as an important link between the processes of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.For the first time we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. The current study provides a solid basis for understanding the synthesis and deposition of subcutaneous fat in ducks.

Hepassocin (HPS) is a hepatokine that has been reported to be involved in liver regeneration. In addition to the mitogenic activity of HPS, HPS expression is decreased in patients with hepatoma. However, the role of HPS in NAFLD is still unknown.A total of 393 subjects with (n=194) or without (n=199) NAFLD were enrolled to evaluate the serum HPS concentration. In order to clarify the causal inference between HPS and NAFLD, we used experimental animal and cell models. Hepatic overexpression or silencing of HPS was achieved by lentiviral vector delivery in mice and lipofectamine transfection in HepG2 cells.  related proteins were detected by Western blots. The expression of inflammatory factors was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.Subjects with NAFLD had a higher serum HPS concentration than those without it. Overexpression of HPS increased hepatic lipid accumulation and NAFLD activity scores (NAS), whereas deletion of HPS improved high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and decreased NAS in mice. Additionally, , a steatogenic reagent, increased HPS expression in hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of HPS in HepG2 cells induced lipid accumulation through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent pathway, whereas deletion of HPS decreased -induced lipid accumulation.The present study provides evidence that HPS plays an important role in NAFLD and induces hepatic lipid accumulation through an ERK1/2-dependent pathway.Crown Copyright © 2013.

Therefore, the study was designed to explore the antioxidant and hypolipidemic activity of swertiamarin in ameliorating NAFLD caused due to hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and insulin resistance. Steatosis was induced in HepG2 cells by supplementing 1mM  (OA) for 24h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipid droplets. This was determined by Oil Red O (ORO) staining and triglyceride accumulation. Swertiamarin (25μg/ml) decreased triglyceride content by 2 folds and effectively reduced LDH release (50%) activity by protecting membrane integrity thus, preventing apoptosis evidenced by reduced cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP1. We observed that swertiamarin significantly increased the expressions of major insulin signaling proteins like Insulin receptor (IR), PI(3)K, pAkt with concomitant reduction in p307 IRS-1. AMPK was activated by swertiamarin action, thus restoring insulin sensitivity in hepatocytes. In addition, qPCR results confirmed OA up-regulated Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)-1c and fatty  synthase (FAS), resulting in increased fatty  synthesis. Swertiamarin effectively modulated PPAR-α, a major potential regulator of carbohydrate metabolism which, in turn, decreased the levels of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK, further restricting hepatic glucose production and fatty  synthesis. Cumulatively, swertiamarin targets potential metabolic regulators AMPK and PPAR-α, through which it regulates hepatic glycemic burden, fat accumulation, insulin resistance and ROS in hepatic steatosis which emphasizes clinical significance of swertiamarin in regulating metabolism and as a suitable candidate for treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We examined the anti-CSC effects of the antifungal polyketide soraphen A, a specific inhibitor of the first committed step of lipid biosynthesis catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA). The mammosphere formation capability of MCF-7 cells was reduced following treatment with soraphen A in a dose-dependent manner. MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress the oncogene HER2 (MCF-7/HER2 cells) were 5-fold more sensitive than MCF-7 parental cells to soraphen A-induced reductions in mammosphere-forming efficiency. Soraphen A treatment notably decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like cells and impeded the HER2's ability to increase the ALDH+-stem cell population. The following results confirmed that soraphen A-induced suppression of CSC populations occurred throughACACA-driven : a.) exogenous supplementation with supraphysiological concentrations of  fully rescued mammosphere formation in the presence of soraphen A and b.) mammosphere cultures of MCF-7 cells with stably silenced expression of the cytosolic isoform ACACA1, which specifically participates in de novo , were mostly refractory to soraphen A treatment.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of FAs and natural waxes on the  in 3T3-L1 cells. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated and treated with FAs and waxes. These FAs [Palmitic  (PA), Stearic  (SA),  (OA), Linoleic  (LA), and Alpha-linolenic  (ALA)] and waxes [beeswax (BW) and carnauba wax (CW)] were prepared at varying concentrations, and cell toxicity, triglyceride accumulation, lipid droplets size, and distribution inside of cells were determined. Adipogenic gene expression including , , , , and  was determined. Results showed that increasing the concentration of FAs and waxes led to a decrease in the adipocyte cells viability and metabolic performance. SA showed the highest level of triglyceride accumulation (p<0.05), whereas ALA showed the lowest (p<0.05). Both BW and CW at 3.0 ppm showed significantly higher lipid accumulation than in the control and other groups (p<0.05). ALA had significantly downregulated adipogenic gene expression levels, excluding those of , compared to the other treatment groups (p<0.05).

In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, exposure of the cells to 1.5 mM  (OA) for 24 h caused steatosis and distorted cell morphology, induced the expression of mRNA for enzymes that are involved in  and fatty  oxidation ( and ), and impaired indices of aerobic energy metabolism ( mRNA expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and galactose-supported ATP production). Co-treatment with 10 µM of selected polyphenols all strongly protected against the steatosis and changes in cell morphology. All polyphenols, except cyanidin, inhibited the effects on  and  and further increased  expression, suggesting a shift toward increased β-oxidation. Resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, and cyanidin, however not kuromanin or berberine, ameliorated the decreases in MMP and galactose-derived ATP. Berberine was unique in worsening the decrease in galactose-derived ATP. In further investigations of the mechanisms involved, resveratrol, catechin, and berberine increased SIRT1 enzyme activity and p-AMPKα protein, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, selected polyphenols all protected against steatosis with similar effectiveness, however through different mechanisms that increased aerobic lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696190>Isolation, culture and differentiation of duck (Anas platyrhynchos) preadipocytes.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we isolated preadipocytes from the adipose tissue of Peking duck and subsequently cultured them in vitro. Cell counting kit-8 assay was employed to establish the growth curve of duck primary preadipocytes. Meanwhile, after the cells reaching full confluency, they were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes by the addition of a cocktail containing dexamethasone, insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and  for 8 days. Successful differentiation was demonstrated by the development of lipid droplets and the expression of key marker genes including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEBP/α) and adipocyte fatty -binding protein (FABP4). Our results showed that duck primary preadipocytes began to adhere 12 h after seeding as short spindle shapes or litter triangles, which grew quickly 3 days post attachment and maintained stable after day 7. After 8 days the preadipocytes were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes, which were stained red by oil red O. Additionally, it showed that during preadipocyte differentiation PPARγ mRNA was highly expressed at day 3, while CEBP/α and FABP4 mRNA peaked at day 5 and 8, respectively.

Parameters related to glucose and lipid metabolism were then assessed. The results suggest that when both nutrients were administered at the same time, an increased potential for  occurred concomitantly with a lower level of glycaemia. In a second experiment we administered intraperitoneally a single FA present in the FO mixture such as  (60 or 300μg.kg(-1)) whereas octanoic  (60 or 300μg.kg(-1)) was used as negative control (absent from the FO). However, the effects of both FA were similar in reducing the potential of lipid synthesis and oxidation, and in enhancing the potential of glucose synthesis and glycogenesis. Differences found between FO and single FA administration show that response to FA was dependent on the treatment (mixture vs. single FA) but also comply with the idea that an interaction between FA and glucose rather than FA alone are in the origin of the results reported. The administration of individual FA such as  and octanoic  failed in enhancing  and reducing plasma glucose levels and thus in explaining results obtained with FO. However, results provide evidence that FA even provided at a low dose play a key role in the regulation of several putative components of a FA sensing system present in rainbow trout liver.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A plethora of distinct and differently sized LDs was detected by a brief application of adipocyte differentiation medium and additional short treatment with . Using these cells and highly specific antibodies for LD-binding proteins of the perilipin (PLIN) family, we could distinguish between endogenously derived LDs (endogenous LDs) positive for perilipin from exogenously induced LDs (exogenous LDs) positive for adipophilin, TIP47 and S3-12. Having optimized these stimulation conditions, we used early adipogenic differentiation stages to investigate small-sized LDs and concentrated on LD-protein associations with the intermediate-sized filament (IF) vimentin. This IF protein was described earlier to surround lipid globules, showing spherical, cage-like structures. Consequently - by biochemical methods, by immunofluorescence microscopy and by electron- and immunoelectron microscopy - various stages of emerging lipid globules were revealed with perilipin as linking protein between LDs and vimentin. For this LD-PLIN-Vimentin connection, a model is now proposed, suggesting an interaction of proteins via opposed charged amino  domains respectively. In addition, multiple sheaths of smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisternae surrounding concentrically nascent LDs are shown.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high-fat diet (HFD)-induced and high-fat high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic metabolism. DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit  under high-fat conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Curcumin is a polyphenol derived from the herbal remedy and dietary spice turmeric, was found to prevent obesity and diabetes in mouse models. However, a hypolipidemic effect of curcumin in - induced hepatocarcinoma cells has not been reported. In this study, we examined the effect of curcumin on reducing lipid accumulation in hepatic cells.Hepatocytes were treated with  (OA) containing with or without curcumin to observe the lipid accumulation by Oil Red O stain. We also tested the effects of curcumin on triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in HepG2 cells. Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1), fatty  synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression.Curcumin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation and TG and TC levels. Also, curcumin decreased hepatic  such as SREBP-1, and FAS. Besides, we also found out the antioxidative effect of curcumin by increasing the expression of PPARα. Curcumin increased AMPK phosphorylation in hepatocytes.These results indicated that curcumin has the same ability to activate AMPK and then reduce SREBP-1, and FAS expression, finally leading to inhibit hepatic  and hepatic antioxidative ability. In this report, we found curcumin exerted a regulatory effect on lipid accumulation by decreasing  in hepatocyte. Therefore, curcumin extract may be active in the prevention of fatty liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26183179>TPD52 expression increases neutral lipid storage within cultured cells.</a></h1><p>Tumor protein D52 (TPD52) is amplified and/or overexpressed in cancers of diverse cellular origins. Altered cellular metabolism (including ) is a hallmark of cancer development, and protein-protein associations between TPD52 and known regulators of lipid storage, and differential TPD52 expression in obese versus non-obese adipose tissue, suggest that TPD52 might regulate cellular lipid metabolism. We found increased lipid droplet numbers in BALB/c 3T3 cell lines stably expressing TPD52, compared with control and TPD52L1-expressing cell lines. TPD52-expressing 3T3 cells showed increased fatty  storage in triglyceride (from both de novo synthesis and uptake) and formed greater numbers of lipid droplets upon  supplementation than control cells. TPD52 colocalised with Golgi, but not endoplasmic reticulum (ER), markers and also showed partial colocalisation with lipid droplets coated with ADRP (also known as PLIN2), with a proportion of TPD52 being detected in the lipid droplet fraction. Direct interactions between ADRP and TPD52, but not TPD52L1, were demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system, with ADRP-TPD52 interactions confirmed using GST pulldown assays. Our findings uncover a new isoform-specific role for TPD52 in promoting intracellular lipid storage, which might be relevant to TPD52 overexpression in cancer.© 2015.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of feeding low (LO) or high  (HO) diets to AL pigs reared in individual pens (IND) or outdoors (OUT) with access to pasture. Biceps femoris and dorsal subcutaneous fat (DSF) samples were collected to analyse chemical composition and lipids fatty  (FA) profile. The expression of seven genes involved in , lipolysis and FA transport, as well as two transcription factors were also evaluated in the muscle. B. femoris and DSF presented lower lipid content in OUT-reared than in IND-reared pigs. Two genes involved in , ACACA and FASN, were under-expressed in B. femoris from OUT-reared pigs, while two involved in lipolysis, LPL and HSL were over-expressed. HO diet also significantly reduced FASN expression. Both rearing system and diet affected the FA profile of tissues, particularly DSF. Overall, OUT-reared pigs presented lower n6 to n3 FA ratios in all tissues, and lower monounsaturated (MUFA) and higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content in DSF. When compared to LO-fed ones, HO-fed pigs presented higher  proportions in all tissues, and lower SFA, higher MUFA and PUFA levels, as well as lower saturation, atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes in DSF. This study shows that rearing system and  supplementation have complementary effects and influence the nutritional quality of pork and DSF.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341288>Nutritional factors in transdifferentiation of scheletal muscles to adipocytes.</a></h1><p>A current area of interest is the determination of factors able to promote the transition from muscle to adipose tissue. The current review has highlighted that treatment of myoblasts with fatty acids (especially ) and thiazolidindiones causes conversion to adipocytes. The molecular mechanisms mediating the adipogenic action of thiazolidinediones and fatty acids in myoblasts could involve peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein C/EBP. The role of 1,25-D3 in  is mediated at the molecular level through VDR-dependent inhibition of C/EBP and PPARgamma expression and a decrease in PPARgamma transactivation activity. Vitamin D supplementation increases muscle strength and ultimately reduces the incidence of falls.

Since it can be made through de novo synthesis in animals, it is not an essential fatty . While it has become clear that dietary  regulates many biological processes, the signaling pathway involved in these regulations remains poorly defined. In this work we tested the impact of an -rich diet on hepatic gene expression. We were particularly interested in addressing the contribution of Liver X Receptors (LXR) in the control of genes involved in hepatic , an essential process in whole body energy homeostasis. We used wild-type mice and transgenic mice deficient for both α and β Liver X Receptor isoforms (LXR-/-) fed a control or an oleate enriched diet. We observed that hepatic-lipid accumulation was enhanced as well as the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of wild-type mice fed the oleate enriched diet. In contrast, none of these changes occurred in the liver of LXR-/- mice. Strikingly, oleate-rich diet reduced cholesterolemia in wild-type mice and induced signs of liver inflammation and damage in LXR-/- mice but not in wild-type mice. This work suggests that dietary  reduces cholesterolemia while promoting LXR-dependent hepatic  without detrimental effects to the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27166182>Reduced miR-200b and miR-200c expression contributes to abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation by stimulating JUN expression and activating the transcription of srebp1.</a></h1><p>Previous studies indicated that miR-200s participated in IL-6-induced hepatic insulin resistance. However, the role of miR-200s in hepatic lipid accumulation has not been elucidated. Here we found that miR-200b and miR-200c were reduced in the steatotic livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This down-regulation was accompanied by an increase in the expression of lipogenic proteins such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FAS). The suppression of miR-200b and miR-200c in Hep1-6 and NCTC1469 hepatocytes enhanced intracellular triglyceride levels, which were associated with increased SREBP-1 and FAS protein levels. In contrast, the over-expression of miR-200b and miR-200c suppressed lipid accumulation and reduced the expression of SREBP1 and FAS in Hep1-6 and NCTC1469 cells transfected with miR-200b or miR-200c mimics. Importantly, the up-regulation of miR-200b and miR-200c could reverse /palmitic -induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. A luciferase reporter assay identified that miR-200b and miR-200c could directly bind the 3'UTR of jun. JUN activated the transcription of srebp1 to increase lipid accumulation. The data also demonstrated that increased miR-200b and miR-200c expression might be associated with sitagliptin-reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in mice fed a HFD. These findings suggest, for the first time, that reduced miR-200b and miR-200c expression contributes to abnormal hepatic lipid accumulation by stimulating JUN expression and activating the transcription of srebp1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27565442>Calcium sensing receptor effects in adipocytes and liver cells: Implications for an adipose-hepatic crosstalk.</a></h1><p>The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is expressed in human adipose cells, and its activation may associate with adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction. We evaluated whether CaSR stimulation influences adipocyte triglyceride (TG) and fatty  binding protein 4 (aP2) content, and hepatocyte TGs and proinflammatory cytokine expression. The effect of the calcimimetic cinacalcet on TGs (fluorimetry), lipogenic genes (qPCR) and aP2 (immunoblot) was evaluated in LS14 adipocytes or AT. In the human HepG2 hepatic cell line, we assessed CaSR expression and cinacalcet effect on TGs and lipogenic and proinflammatory genes. CaSR activation decreased adipocyte TG content by 20% and the expression of GPD and LPL by 34% and 20%, respectively. Cinacalcet increased aP2 protein expression by 60%. CaSR expression was shown in HepG2 cells and human liver samples. Cinacalcet-treated HepG2 cells in the presence of  exhibited a19% increased TG content. No changes were observed in the expression of lipogenic genes in HepG2 cells, however there was a 50%-300% elevation in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. CaSR activation in adipocytes may associate with decreased TG storage ability and increased aP2. Hepatic CaSR stimulation may elevate steatosis and proinflammatory factors. We propose that CaSR may contribute to obesity-associated hepatic metabolic consequences.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Effect of calcium salts with eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  in the maternal and finishing diet on lamb liver and adipose tissue during the lamb finishing period1.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation to ewes during late gestation on finishing lamb liver and adipose tissue fatty  (FA) profile and gene expression. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that  decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that  decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

A previous study of ours revealed drastic increases in the mass of palmitic (16:0),  (18:1n-9), palmitoleic (16:1n-7), cis-vaccenic (18:1n-7) and 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acids in the liver of SHR/NDcp. However, detailed information on the class of lipid accumulated and the mechanism responsible for the overproduction of the accumulated lipid in the liver was not obtained. This study aimed to characterize the class of lipid accumulated and to explore the mechanism underlying the lipid accumulation in the liver of SHR/NDcp, in comparison with SHR/NDmcr-cp (+/+) (lean hypertensive littermates of SHR/NDcp) and Wistar Kyoto rats. In the liver of SHR/NDcp, de novo synthesis of fatty acids (16:0, 18:1n-9 and 16:1n-7) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis were up-regulated and fatty  β-oxidation was down-regulated. These perturbations of lipid metabolism caused fat accumulation in hepatocytes and accumulation of TAG, which were enriched with 16:0, 18:1n-9 and 16:1n-7, in the liver of SHR/NDcp. On the other hand, no changes were found in hepatic contents of diacylglycerol and unesterified fatty  (FFA); among FFA, there were no differences in the hepatic concentrations of unesterified 16:0 and stearic  between SHR/NDcp and two other groups of rats. Moreover, little change was brought about in the expression of genes responsive to endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of SHR/NDcp. These results may reinforce the pathophysiological role of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and fatty  elongase 6 in the liver of SHR/NDcp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26476931>Double Bond Position Plays an Important Role in Delta-9 Desaturation and Lipogenic Properties of Trans 18:1 Isomers in Mouse Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>The objective of this research was to study the delta-9 desaturation of individual trans (t) fatty acids that can be found in ruminant fat or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVO) and determine their effects on lipogenic gene expression in adipocytes. It was hypothesized that delta-9 desaturation and lipogenic properties of t-18:1 isomers depend on the position of double bond. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 200 µM of t6-18:1, t9-18:1, t11-18:1, t13-18:1 or t16-18:1, cis (c)-9 18:1 or bovine serum albumin (BSA) vehicle control for 48 h. Cells were then harvested for fatty  and gene expression analyses using gas chromatography and quantitative PCR respectively. Among t-18:1 isomers, t13-18:1 and t11-8:1 had the greatest percent delta-9 desaturation (44 and 41 % respectively) followed by t16-18:1 and t6-18:1 (32 and 17 % respectively), while c9-18:1 and t9-18:1 did not undergo delta-9 desaturation. Trans9-18:1 up-regulated (P < 0.05) the expression of lipogenic genes including fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of these genes were not affected with other t-18:1 isomers (P > 0.05). Consistent with gene expression results, t9-18:1 increased the de novo lipogenic index (16:0/18:2n-6) compared with control cells and increased delta-9 desaturation index (c9-16:1/18:0) compared to other t-18:1 isomers (P < 0.05). The current study provides further evidence that the predominant trans fatty  in PHVO (t9-18:1) has isomer specific lipogenic properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583582>Chronic sucrose intake decreases concentrations of n6 fatty acids, but not docosahexaenoic  in the rat brain phospholipids.</a></h1><p>We investigated the influence of high sucrose intake, administered in drinking water, on the lipid profile of the brain and on the expression of SREBP1c and Δ-desaturase genes. Adult male rats received 30% sucrose solution for 20 weeks (Sucrose group), or plain water (Control group). After the 20th week of sucrose treatment, the Sucrose group showed permanent hyperglycemia. Sucrose treatment also increased the amount of total lipids and fatty acids in the brain. The brain fatty  profile of total lipids as well as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin of the Sucrose group was extensively changed. The most interesting change was a significant decrease in n6 fatty acids, including the important arachidonic , whereas the content of  and docosahexaenoic  remained unchanged. RT-qPCR revealed an increase in Δ-5-desaturase and SREBP1c gene expression. In conclusion, high sucrose intake via drinking water extensively changes rat brain fatty  profile by decreasing n6 fatty acids, including arachidonic . In contrast, the content of docosahexaenoic  remains constant in the brain total lipids as well as in phospholipids. Changes in the brain fatty  profile reflect changes in the lipid metabolism of the rat lipogenic tissues and concentrations in the circulation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the cellular mechanisms linking OC compound exposure and metabolic dysfunction remain elusive. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if direct exposure to three highly implicated OC compounds promoted hepatic steatosis, the hepatic ramification of the metabolic syndrome. First, the steatotic effect of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), oxychlordane, and trans-nonachlor was determined in freshly isolated rat primary hepatocytes. Exposure to trans-nonachlor significantly increased neutral lipid accumulation as opposed to DDE and oxychlordane. To determine possible mechanisms governing increased fatty  availability, the effects of trans-nonachlor exposure on fatty  uptake, de novo lipogenesis, triglyceride secretion, and fatty  oxidation were explored. Trans-nonachlor did not significantly alter fatty  uptake. However, insulin-stimulated de novo lipogenesis as well as basal expression of fatty  synthase, a major regulator of lipogenesis were significantly increased following trans-nonachlor exposure. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in fatty  oxidation following trans-nonachlor exposure. This decrease in fatty  oxidation was accompanied by a slight, but significant increase in -induced cellular triglyceride secretion. Therefore, taken together, the present data indicate direct exposure to trans-nonachlor has a more potent pro-steatotic effect than exposure to DDE or oxychlordane. This pro-steatotic effect of trans-nonachlor appears to be predominately mediated via increased de novo lipogenesis and decreased fatty  oxidation.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481861>Elaidic  increases hepatic  by mediating sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c activity in HuH-7 cells.</a></h1><p>The liver is the major organ responsible for lipid biosynthesis.

The aim of this study was to establish the preadipocyte in vitro culture system and understand the biological characteristics of expansion of duck adipocyte tissue at the cellular and molecular level. We isolated pre-adipocytes from the subcutaneous fat of three breeds of duck and differentiated them into mature adipocytes using a mixture of insulin, rosiglitazone, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and  over 0,2, 4, 6, and 8 days. Successful differentiation was confirmed from the development of lipid droplets and their response to Oil Red O, and increasing numbers of lipid droplets were stained red over time. The expression of key marker genes, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4), and fatty  synthetase (FAS), gradually increased during pre-adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, it was verified by interference experiments that the knockdown of PPARγ directly reduced lipid production. Meanwhile we analyzed the role of unsaturated fatty acids in the production of poultry fat using different concentrations of  and found that lipid droplet deposition was highest when the concentration of  was 300 μM. We also compared the level of differentiated pre-adipocytes that were isolated from Jianchang ducks (fatty-meat duck), Cherry Valley ducks (lean-meat duck) and White-crested ducks (egg-producing duck). The proliferation and differentiation rate of pre-adipocytes derived from Jianchang ducks was higher than that of White-crested ducks.

Fresh i.m. and s.c. adipose tissues were collected from the longissimus thoracis muscle of Angus steers at 12, 14, and 16 months of age (n = 4 per time point). Adipose tissue explants were incubated in duplicate for 48 h with 40 μM α-linolenic (ALA), , stearic, trans-vaccenic, or CLA. Adipocyte size, acetate and glucose incorporation into fatty acids in vitro and mRNA levels for C/EBPβ, CPT1β, GPR43, PPARγ, PRKAA1 (AMPKα) and SCD1 were measured following the incubations. PRKAA1 and SCD1gene expression were greater (P < 0.001) in s.c. adipose tissue than in i.m. adipose tissue and acetate incorporation into lipids and C/EBPβ, PPARγ, and SCD1gene expression were greater at 16 months of age than at 12 months of age in i.m. adipose (P < 0.01). C/EBPβ gene expression increased by 16 months of age and PRKAA1 gene expression decreased by 16 months of age in s.c. adipose tissue. All fatty acids increased s.c. adipocyte volumes whereas CLA decreased acetate incorporation into lipids in s.c. adipose tissue (P < 0.05), but none of the fatty acids affected gene expression in i.m. or s.c. adipose tissue (P > 0.10).

The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill resulted in a massive environmental release of crude oil and remediation efforts applied large quantities of Corexit dispersants to the oil spill. The Corexit-enhanced Water Accommodated Fraction (CWAF) of DWH crude oil contains PPARγ transactivation activity, which is attributed to dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a probable obesogen. In addition to its use in oil dispersants, DOSS is commonly used as a stool softener and food additive. Because PPARγ functions as a heterodimer with RXRα to transcriptionally regulate  we investigated the potential of CWAF to transactivate RXRα and herein demonstrated that the Corexit component Span 80 has RXRα transactivation activity. Span 80 bound to RXRα in the low micromolar range and promoted adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Further, the combination of DOSS and Span 80 increased 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation substantially more than treatment with either chemical individually, likely increasing the obesogenic potential of Corexit dispersants. From a public health standpoint, the use of DOSS and Span 80 as food additives heightens concerns regarding their use and mandates further investigations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For this, both differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic  (16:1n7, 200 μM) or palmitic  (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from wild-type or PPARα-deficient mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) or  (18:1n9, 300 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for lipolysis, TAG, and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis and gene and protein expression profile. Treatment of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with 16:1n7, but not 16:0, increased basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis, mRNA levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and protein content of ATGL and pSer(660)-HSL. Such increase in lipolysis induced by 16:1n7, which can be prevented by pharmacological inhibition of PPARα, was associated with higher rates of PPARα binding to DNA. In contrast to lipolysis, both 16:1n7 and 16:0 increased fatty  incorporation into TAG and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis from glucose without affecting glyceroneogenesis and glycerokinase expression. Corroborating in vitro findings, treatment of wild-type but not PPARα-deficient mice with 16:1n7 increased primary adipocyte basal and stimulated lipolysis and ATGL and HSL mRNA levels. In contrast to lipolysis, however, 16:1n7 treatment increased fatty  incorporation into TAG and glycerol 3-phosphate synthesis from glucose in both wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice. In conclusion, palmitoleic  increases adipocyte lipolysis and lipases by a mechanism that requires a functional PPARα.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27176782>Treatment with estrogen protects against ovariectomy-induced hepatic steatosis by increasing AQP7 expression.</a></h1><p>Recent evidence has suggested that the marked decrease in ovarian secretion of estrogens in postmenopausal women may be associated with the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which low levels of estrogen induce fatty liver disease using an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model and an in vitro cell model. A total of 24 female C57/BL6 mice were divided into four groups: Sham operation, sham operation plus subcutaneous implantation of tamoxifen (TAM), bilateral OVX, and OVX plus subcutaneous implantation of 17β-estradiol (E2). Marked hepatic steatosis and increased expression of lipogenic genes (acetyl‑CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) was observed in the estrogen‑depleted mice (TAM and OVX groups), as compared with in the sham operation group. Treatment with E2 significantly improved hepatic steatosis by decreasing the expression of the aforementioned lipogenic genes. Furthermore, hepatic aquaporin 7 (AQP7) expression was decreased in the estrogen‑depleted mice, but was increased in the OVX + E2 treatment group, as compared with in the sham operation group. These results suggested an association between AQP7 and low estrogen‑induced hepatic steatosis. Subsequently, the functions of AQP7 in hepatic steatosis were investigated using an ‑induced HepG2 cell model of steatosis. Treatment with E2 alleviated lipid accumulation and decreased the expression of lipogenic genes in vitro; however, such effects were attenuated following transfection with AQP7 small interfering RNA. The present study suggested a mechanism by which low levels of estrogen induce fatty liver disease, and may provide useful information regarding the prevention and treatment of fatty liver disease in postmenopausal women.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631376>Modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by olive oil and its phenols in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common chronic liver disease in western countries, being considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Cumulative lines of evidence suggest that olive oil, used as primary source of fat by Mediterranean populations, may play a key role in the observed health benefits on NAFLD. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of the knowledge on the protective role of both major and minor components of olive oil on lipid metabolism during NAFLD. In particular, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the increase or decrease in hepatic lipid content are critically analyzed, taking into account that several studies have often provided different and/or conflicting results in animal models fed on olive oil-enriched diet. In addition, new findings that highlight the hypolipidemic and the antisteatotic actions of olive oil phenols are presented. As mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the targeting of these organelles with olive oil phenols as a powerful therapeutic approach is also discussed.© 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108268>A Mixture of Atropisomers Enhances Neutral Lipid Degradation in Mammalian Cells with Autophagy Induction.</a></h1><p>Atropisomers with a biaryl dihydronaphthopyranone structure, dinapinones A1 (DPA1) (M position) and A2 (DPA2) (P position), were isolated from the fungus culture broth of Talaromyces pinophilus FKI-3864 as inhibitors of [C]neutral lipid ([C]triacylglycerol (TG) and [C]cholesteryl ester (CE)) synthesis from [C] in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells. DPA2 inhibited [C]TG and [C]CE synthesis (ICs 0.65 and 5.6 μM, respectively), but DPA1 had no inhibitory activity on [C]TG and [C]CE synthesis even at 12 μM. However, a 1:1 mixture of DPA1 and DPA2 (DPA) had the most potent inhibitory activity on [C]TG and [C]CE synthesis (ICs, 0.054 and 0.18 μM, respectively). The mechanism of action of DPA was investigated. DPA had no effects on the enzymes involved in neutral lipid synthesis, while DPA enhanced the degradation of [C]neutral lipids with concomitant decrease in cytosolic lipid droplets accumulated in CHO-K1 cells. From analysis of autophagy marker proteins, DPA caused dose-dependent induction of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and degradation of p62. In the autophagic flux assay using bafilomycin A, DPA upregulated autophagosome turnover. These results reveal that DPA enhances neutral lipid degradation together with induction of autophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24492573>Dietary energy source largely affects tissue fatty  composition but has minor influence on gene transcription in Iberian pigs.</a></h1><p>A trial was performed to compare the effects of different dietary sources of MUFA on the fatty  (FA) composition, lipid metabolism, and gene transcription in different tissues of Iberian pigs. Twenty-seven Iberian male pigs of 28 kg live weight (LW) were divided in 2 groups and fed with 1 of 2 isocaloric diets: a standard diet with carbohydrates as energy source (CH) and a diet enriched with high- sunflower oil (HO). Ham adipose tissue was sampled by biopsy at 44 and 70 kg LW. At 110 kg LW pigs were slaughtered and backfat, loin, and liver tissues were sampled. Animals of the HO group showed higher MUFA content and lower SFA in all the analyzed tissues (P < 0.001). These main effects were established early during the treatment and increased only slightly along time. Small diet effects were also detected on PUFA, which showed differences according to sampling time, tissue, and lipid fraction. Effects of diet on gene expression were explored with a combined approach analyzing adipose tissue transcriptome and quantifying the expression of a panel of key genes implicated in  and lipid metabolism processes in backfat, muscle, and liver. Backfat transcriptome showed small effects of diet on gene expression, in number and magnitude. According to the posterior probabilities (PP) of the probe-specific expression differences between dietary groups (PP < 0.01), 37 genes were considered differentially expressed (DE). Gene ontology allowed relating them with several biological functions including lipid metabolic processes. Quantitative PCR confirmed several DE genes in adipose tissue (RXRG, LEP, and ME1; P < 0.0001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.0001, respectively), but no DE gene was found in loin or liver tissues. Joint results agree with a metabolic adjustment of adipose tissue FA levels by the subtle effect of the diet on the regulation of several lipid metabolism pathways, mainly FA oxidation and prostanoid synthesis, with LEP, RXRG, and PTGS2 genes playing mayor roles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633463>Protective effect of resveratrol derivatives on high-fat diet induced fatty liver by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with inhibited AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1). AMPK phosphorylation inhibits SREBP-1, a major transcription factor of de novo , by inhibiting the liver X receptor (LXR) or by direct phosphorylation. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, has regulatory effects on hepatic lipid metabolism as a potent AMPK activator. In this study, we evaluated the anti-steatogenic effects of resveratrol and its derivatives and identified the molecular mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Resveratrol and its derivatives decreased lipid accumulation by free fatty acids (FFA mixture; 0.5 mM, :palmitic  = 2: 1) in H4IIEC3 cells. Synthesized derivatives of resveratrol had lower cytotoxicity than the parental molecule with similar potency. SY-102 suppressed SREBP-1 maturation by T0901317, an LXR agonist, and decreased SRE luciferase activity and the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes. Inhibition of AMPK by pre-treatment with compound C completely blocked the effects of SY-102. To evaluate their efficacy in vivo, mice were fed a high-fat diet for 5 days, and resveratrol or SY-102 was administered orally for the last 2 days. Oral administration of the SY-102 increased AMPK phosphorylation, followed by reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation to a similar extent as resveratrol. These data demonstrate that SY-102, a synthesized derivative of resveratrol, might provide a promising therapeutic effect against fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24027117>The inhibition of  induced hepatic  and the promotion of lipolysis by caffeic  via up-regulation of AMP-activated kinase.</a></h1><p>Caffeic  (CA) can inhibit toxin-induced liver injury.

The rapid proliferation of cancer cells requires de novo synthesis of fatty acids. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key enzyme for , is overexpressed in various types of cancer and plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, it has been studied as a candidate target for cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrate the pharmacological properties of T-3764518, a novel and orally available small molecule inhibitor of SCD1. T-3764518 inhibited stearoyl-CoA desaturase-catalyzed conversion of stearoyl-CoA to oleoyl-CoA in colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells and their growth. Further, it slowed tumor growth in an HCT-116 and a mesothelioma MSTO-211H mouse xenograft model. Comprehensive lipidomic analyses revealed that T-3764518 increases the membrane ratio of saturated: unsaturated fatty acids in various lipid species such as phosphatidylcholines and diacylglycerols in both cultured cells and HCT-116 xenografts. Treatment-associated lipidomic changes were followed by activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses such as increased immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein expression in HCT-116 cells. These T-3764518-induced changes led to an increase in cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a marker of apoptosis. Additionally, bovine serum albumin conjugated with , an SCD1 product, prevented cell growth inhibition and ER stress responses by T-3764518, indicating that these outcomes were not attributable to off-target effects. These results indicate that T-3764518 is a promising new anticancer drug candidate.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) on inhibiting  (OA)-induced apoptosis and inflammation in grass carp hepatocytes. Firstly, the hepatocyte of grass carp were treated with OA (800 μM) and different concentration (0, 50, 100 and 200 μM) of DHA for 24 h, the apoptotic ratio, gene expression levels of apoptosis such as caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9, protein levels of Caspase3, and mRNA levels of inflammation genes such as nf-kb, tnf-α, and il-8 were detected. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of  genes srebp1c, fas, acc, and scd and a key enzyme of lipolysis Atgl were also detected. These results showed that the cell apoptosis and the inflammation increased by OA were significantly attenuated by DHA (P < 0.05). Furthermore, DHA could significantly decrease fatty  synthesis gene expression levels which were induced by OA (P < 0.05). However, the hepatocytes exposed with DHA had no significant influence on the expression of Atgl. Taken together, the study indicated that DHA protects the hepatocytes against apoptosis and inflammation induced by OA might via inhibiting fatty  synthesis, instead of promoting lipolysis. These results call for further studies to assess the effectiveness of DHA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28765876>Exogenous lipids promote the growth of breast cancer cells via CD36.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells present sustained de novo fatty  (FA) synthesis with increased production of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). This change in FA metabolism is associated with overexpression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which catalyses the transformation of SFAs into MUFAs (e.g., ). In this study, we provide new evidence that SCD1 inhibition leads to the anti-proliferation effect of breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and migration prevention. However, the antitumor effect of the SCD1 inhibitor can be reversed by exogenous . We hypothesize that, in addition to de novo synthesis, cancer cells may uptake exogenous FAs actively. CD36, also known as FA translocase (FAT), that functions as a transmembrane protein and mediates the uptake of FAs, is observed to be highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, the anti-proliferation effect caused by the SCD1 inhibitor can not be reversed by exogenous  supplementation in CD36 knockdown breast cancer cells. Our study revealed that the lipid metabolism of breast cancer is regulated not only by de novo  but also by the availability of lipids outside cancer cells. Consistent with FA synthesis, FA uptake and transport will be another important target pathway for anticancer therapy, and the FA channel protein CD36 may provide a promising therapeutic target.  combined with FA transport will be a new orientation for antitumor therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268360>Changes in fatty  composition in tissue and serum of obese cats fed a high fat diet.</a></h1><p>Obesity and overweight have been frequently observed in dogs and cats in recent years as in humans. The compositions of fatty acids (FAs) in the accumulated lipids in tissues of obese animals may have important roles in the process and mechanisms related to the onset of metabolic disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a high fat (HF) diet, which contained a higher proportion of saturated FAs, on FA metabolism and distribution in obese cats. Cats (N = 12) were divided into control diet group (crude fat; 16.0 %) (n = 4) or a high fat (HF) diet group (crude fat; 23.9 %) (n = 8). The HF diet contained up to 60 % of calories from fat and was rich in stearic . Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the feeding. Adipose and liver tissues were collected at the 6(th) week after feeding. We performed analysis of histological findings and fatty  composition in serum and tissues.Body weights of the cats significantly increased in the HF group. The increased activities of hepatic enzymes and the accumulation of lipid droplets were found in hepatocytes in the HF group at the 6(th) week after feeding. In this study, the stearic  (C18:0)-rich HF diet contained less  (C18:1n-9) and more linoleic  (C18:2n-6) than the control. However, the composition of  in the liver was higher, and those of stearic  and linoleic  were lower in the HF group at the 6(th) week after feeding. The higher :stearic  ratio suggests an increase in the conversion from saturated FA to mono-unsaturated FAs, which may reflect the hepatic storage of FAs as a relatively harmless form.The stearic -rich HF diet increased hepatic lipid accumulation accompanied by the increased of hepatic , increased serum  and activation of hepatic enzymes. These findings could be an important sign of early stages of dyslipidemia and hepatic damage. Also, the higher :stearic  ratio might be related to the increased activity of SCD-1, which suggests that the stearic -rich HF diet evoked hepatic  in the feline liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363221>AMPK-dependent modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by nesfatin-1.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism by which peripheral nesfatin-1 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism. Continuous peripheral infusion of nesfatin-1 reduced adiposity and plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol. In mice fed high fat diet, peripheral nesfatin-1 significantly decreased hepatic steatosis measured by triglyceride content and oil red staining area and diameter. These alterations were associated with a significant reduction in -related transcriptional factors PPARγ and SREBP1, as well as rate-limited enzyme genes such as acaca, fasn, gpam, dgat1 and dgat2. In primary hepatocytes, nesfatin-1 inhibited both basal and  stimulated triglyceride accumulation, which was accompanied by a decrement in -related genes and an increase in β-oxidation-related genes. In cultured hepatocytes, nesfatin-1 increased levels of AMPK phosphorylation. Inhibition of AMPK by compound C blocked the reduction of triglyceride content elicited by nesfatin-1. Our studies demonstrate that nesfatin-1 attenuates lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by an AMPK-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Accordingly, we observed after ICV treatment with oleate or octanoate decreased food intake accompanied in hypothalamus by reduced potential of  and FA oxidation, and decreased potential of ATP-dependent inward rectifier potassium channel (K(+)ATP). Those changes support direct FA sensing through mechanisms related to FA metabolism and mitochondrial activity. The FA sensing through binding to FAT/CD36 and subsequent expression of transcription factors appears to be also direct but an interaction with peripheral hormones cannot be rejected. Moreover, decreased expression of NPY and increased expression of POMC were observed in parallel with the activation of FA sensing systems and decreased food intake. These results allow us to suggest the involvement of at least these peptides in controlling the decreased food intake noted after oleate and octanoate treatment in rainbow trout.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the pathogenesis of NASH is still unclear. Accumulation of lipid droplets and insulin resistance is the hallmark of NASH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role in glucose metabolism via regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we demonstrated a novel of PDK4 in NASH by regulating hepatic steatosis and insulin signaling pathway in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with . The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4 mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in NASH mice. Pdk4-MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels. And Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced the expression of genes related to fatty  uptake, synthesis and . In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK and diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. In conclusion, our data indicated that PDK4 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis in NASH via regulating several signaling pathway and PDK4 may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

As the most abundant FFA in the bloodstream,  (OA) has the ability to induce adipogenic differentiation in human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs). Recently, p62, an autophagy mediator, has been shown to play a role in obesity and adipose tissue metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the roles of autophagy and mitochondrial function at different stages of OA (in combination with insulin and dexamethasone)-induced  in hADSCs.The hADSCs were incubated with OA, insulin, and dexamethasone after pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors or knockdown of p62 with shRNA. The adiposeness level was then analyzed by oil red O staining in the cells. The related proteins or mRNA levels were detected by western blot analysis or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Treatment with 80 μM OA (substituted for isobutylmethylxantine; IBMX) for 10 days successfully induced hADSCs to adipocytes. During OA-induced , autophagy was induced, with an increased LC3II/I ratio on day 3 and a decreased protein level of p62 on and after day 3. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3MA) at the early stage (day 0 to day 3) of differentiation, but not at the middle or late stage, significantly decreased OA-induced ; while knockdown of p62 with shRNA significantly promoted  in hADSCs. Moreover, the copy number of mtDNA (the ND1 gene) and the protein level of TOM20, a mitochondrial membrane protein, were increased following OA treatment, which was related to the stability of mitochondria. Interestingly, knockdown of p62 increased the mito-LC3II/I and cyto-LC3II/I ratios by 110.1% and 73.3%, respectively. The increase in the ratio of mito-LC3II/I was higher than that of cyto-LC3II/I. Furthermore, p62 knockdown-enhanced  in hADSCs was abolished by inhibiting mitophagy with cyclosporine A.These results suggested that p62 plays a protective role in  of hADSCs through regulating mitophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340105>Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis alleviates non-alcoholic fatty liver by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid metabolism.</a></h1><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is induced by accumulation of misfolded proteins, playing a pivotal role during the processes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study was to investigate the effect of Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis (AAPC) on liver cell lipid metabolism, exploring the underlying mechanism of AAPC against NAFLD. In vivo, the animal NAFLD model was induced by feeding rats with high fat diet (HFD) for 18 weeks, and meanwhile the rats were treated with AAPC from weeks 8 to 18; In vitro experiment, the effect of AAPC on dyslipidemia induced by  (OA) in hepatic cells (HepG2) was evaluated. The results showed that AAPC significantly decreased lipidosis in rats and in HepG2 cells; it notably alleviated hepatocyte damage and lipid disturbance in rats. Moreover, the cell experiments showed that AAPC strongly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation. It markedly decreased hepatocyte  by regulating the key lipid metabolism-related factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), encoding carboxylase, liver X Receptor Rα (LXRα), fatty  synthase (FAS), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The further study elucidated that AAPC treatment significantly alleviated inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, AAPC significantly alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis and lipid metabolism disorder through reducing the extent of ERS. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that AAPC significantly ameliorates NAFLD by inhibiting the ERS pathway and lipid deposition, which may be a potential natural medicine for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with 5% (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, -rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic lipid/lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose metabolism (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of lipid and glucose metabolism and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in  and inflammation.

These risk factors include but are not limited to obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Since the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome has multiple metabolic origins, there is no single treatment for it. Pharmacological approaches consist of separate drugs which target at individual risk factors which pose various side effects. Functional foods or nutraceuticals which have potentially important anti-obesity properties have thus attracted great attention. Schisandrae Fructus is a Chinese herb traditionally used as a liver tonic. Silymarin, an extract of the milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is a dietary supplement that is widely used in western society for the prevention and treatment of liver problems. Crataegus Fructus (hawthorn) is traditionally used to promote digestion and dissipate food stagnation. Momordica charantia (bitter melon) is traditionally used for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic Medicine.We aimed to develop a multi-targeted herbal formula to target on the multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome using individual herbs. This proposed herbal formula include sylimarin and Schisandrae Fructus, for NAFLD; Crataegus Fructus for obesity and hyperlipidemia; and Momordica charantia for hyperglycemia.For in vitro study, we carried out insulin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiation and fluorescent tagged cholesterol-treated Caco-2 cell assay to study for  and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells, respectively. -induced HepG2 cell assay was used to study for -induced fatty liver, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) assay was used to study for glucose uptake from the gut. For in vivo study, we performed an 8-week and a 12-week treatment studies, with each study comprising of 4 groups of C57Bl/6 male mice given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii)-(iv) High-fat diet (contains 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol). After the initial 8 weeks of normal chow or high-fat diet feeding to induce obesity, animals were given: (i) Normal-chow diet; (ii) High-fat diet; (iii) High-fat diet + 2% herbal formula; or (iv) High-fat diet + 4% herbal formula as treatment for another 8 weeks or 12 weeks.Our in vitro results suggested Crataegus Fructus aqueous extract exerted potent inhibitory effects on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Schisandrae Fructus aqueous extract and milk thistle exerted inhibitory effects on -induced fatty liver in HepG2 cells. Momordica charantia extract on the other hand, exerted significant inhibitory effect on glucose uptake into BBMV. Our in vivo results showed that our herbal formula exhibited a trend to reduce diet-induced increase in body weight and fat pad mass (epididymal, perirenal and inguinal fat); and significantly reduced diet-induced increase in liver weight, liver lipid, and plasma lipid dose-dependently. Besides, high-fat diet induced a significant reduction in adiponectin level which was significantly improved by herbal formula supplementation at 4%. There was however no significant effect of the herbal formula on diet-induced increase in plasma glucose or insulin levels at either dose. Herbal formula also significantly reduced diet-induced inflammation in the liver at both doses.Taken together, these data suggested the potential of our novel multi-targeted herbal formula to be used as a therapeutic agent for diet-induced metabolic syndrome, with special emphasis on NAFLD.Copyright © 2018.

They are synthesized via de novo  and are the main saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Levels of these fatty acids have been linked to diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS- Genome-wide association studies were conducted in 5 population-based cohorts comprising 8961 participants of European ancestry to investigate the association of common genetic variation with plasma levels of these 4 fatty acids. We identified polymorphisms in 7 novel loci associated with circulating levels of ≥1 of these fatty acids. ALG14 (asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 homolog) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:0 (P=2.7×10(-11)) and lower 18:0 (P=2.2×10(-18)). FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7 (P=6.6×10(-13)) and 18:1n-9 (P=2.2×10(-32)) and lower 18:0 (P=1.3×10(-20)). LPGAT1 (lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase) polymorphisms were associated with lower 18:0 (P=2.8×10(-9)). GCKR (glucokinase regulator; P=9.8×10(-10)) and HIF1AN (factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1; P=5.7×10(-9)) polymorphisms were associated with higher 16:1n-7, whereas PKD2L1 (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1; P=5.7×10(-15)) and a locus on chromosome 2 (not near known genes) were associated with lower 16:1n-7 (P=4.1×10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS- Our findings provide novel evidence that common variations in genes with diverse functions, including protein-glycosylation, polyunsaturated fatty  metabolism, phospholipid modeling, and glucose- and oxygen-sensing pathways, are associated with circulating levels of 4 fatty acids in the de novo  pathway.

Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as lipid sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study  induction of  and  and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal lipid absorption. This model was validated using  (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers. Metabolism including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM).

Although various natural dietary compounds have anti-lipogenic effects, their effects on the acetylation status and lipid metabolism in the liver have not been thoroughly investigated.Following -palmitic  (OPA)-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells, the acetylation status of histone and non-histone proteins, HAT activity, and mRNA expression of representative lipogenic genes, including γ, , , and , were evaluated. Furthermore, correlations between lipid accumulation and HAT activity for 22 representative natural food extracts (NExs) were evaluated.Non-histone protein acetylation increased following OPA treatment and the acetylation of histones H3K9, H4K8, and H4K16 was accelerated, accompanied by an increase in HAT activity. OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between HAT activity and lipid accumulation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.604) using 22 NExs.Our results suggest that NExs have novel applications as nutraceutical agents with HAT inhibitor activity for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24159189>Oleoylethanolamide enhances β-adrenergic-mediated thermogenesis and white-to-brown adipocyte phenotype in epididymal white adipose tissue in rat.</a></h1><p>β-adrenergic receptor activation promotes brown adipose tissue (BAT) β-oxidation and thermogenesis by burning fatty acids during uncoupling respiration. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) can inhibit feeding and stimulate lipolysis by activating peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α (PPARα) in white adipose tissue (WAT). Here we explore whether PPARα activation potentiates the effect of β3-adrenergic stimulation on energy balance mediated by the respective agonists OEA and CL316243. The effect of this pharmacological association on feeding, thermogenesis, β-oxidation, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism in epididymal (e)WAT was monitored. CL316243 (1 mg/kg) and OEA (5 mg/kg) co-administration over 6 days enhanced the reduction of both food intake and body weight gain, increased the energy expenditure and reduced the respiratory quotient (VCO2/VO2). This negative energy balance agreed with decreased fat mass and increased BAT weight and temperature, as well as with lowered plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, nonessential fatty acids (NEFAs), and the adipokines leptin and TNF-α. Regarding eWAT, CL316243 and OEA treatment elevated levels of the thermogenic factors PPARα and UCP1, reduced p38-MAPK phosphorylation, and promoted brown-like features in the white adipocytes: the mitochondrial (Cox4i1, Cox4i2) and BAT (Fgf21, Prdm16) genes were overexpressed in eWAT. The enhancement of the fatty- β-oxidation factors Cpt1b and Acox1 in eWAT was accompanied by an upregulation of de novo  and reduced expression of the unsaturated-fatty--synthesis enzyme gene, Scd1. We propose that the combination of β-adrenergic and PPARα receptor agonists promotes therapeutic adipocyte remodelling in eWAT, and therefore has a potential clinical utility in the treatment of obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987128>Capsaicin Targets  in HepG2 Cells Through AMPK Activation, AKT Inhibition and PPARs Regulation.</a></h1><p>Obesity, a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), represents a serious primary health problem worldwide. Dietary habits are of special interest to prevent and counteract the obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including lipid steatosis. Capsaicin, a pungent compound of chili peppers, has been found to ameliorate diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of capsaicin on hepatic  and to delineate the underlying signaling pathways involved, using HepG2 cells as an experimental model. Cellular neutral lipids, stained with BODIPY493/503, were quantified by flow cytometry, and the protein expression and activity were determined by immunoblotting. Capsaicin reduced basal neutral lipid content in HepG2 cells, as well that induced by troglitazone or by . This effect of capsaicin was prevented by dorsomorphin and GW9662, pharmacological inhibitors of AMPK and PPARγ, respectively. In addition, capsaicin activated AMPK and inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway, major regulators of hepatic . Furthermore, capsaicin blocked autophagy and increased PGC-1α protein.

Gomisin J attenuated lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells. It also suppressed the expression of lipogenic enzymes and inflammatory mediators and increased the expression of lipolytic enzymes in OA-induced HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the use of specific inhibitors and fetuin-A siRNA and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) siRNA transfected cells demonstrated that gomisin J regulated  and lipolysis via inhibition of fetuin-A and activation of an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent pathway in HepG2 cells. Our results showed that gomisin J suppressed lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes and inflammatory molecules through activation of AMPK, LKB1, and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and inhibition of fetuin-A in HepG2 cells.

As an important member of monounsaturated fatty acids, oleate, together with other components, is widely used to induce chicken preadipocyte differentiation. However, it is not clear whether oleate alone can induce chicken preadipocyte differentiation. In the present study, four different treatments were designed to test this question: basal medium, IDX [insulin, dexamethasone and IBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine)], oleate and IDX plus oleate. Cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation and mRNA expression for -related genes were monitored. After treatment of oleate on chicken preadipocytes, apparent lipid droplet formation and lipid accumulation were observed, accompanied by increasing expression of PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ) and AFABP (adipocyte fatty -binding protein), but decreasing level of GATA2 (GATA-binding protein 2). In contrast, for cells cultured in the basal medium with or without IDX supplementation, lipid droplet barely occurred. These results suggest that exogenous oleate alone can act as an inducer of preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes.© 2014 The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26869449>Lipid accumulation stimulates the cap-independent translation of SREBP-1a mRNA by promoting hnRNP A1 binding to its 5'-UTR in a cellular model of hepatic steatosis.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic disease characterized by accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Enhanced release of non-esterified fatty acids from adipose tissue accounts for a remarkable fraction of accumulated lipids. However, the de novo  (DNL) is also implicated in the etiology of the NAFLD. Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a transcription factor modulating the expression of several lipogenic enzymes. In the present study, in order to investigate the effect of lipid droplet accumulation on DNL, we used a cellular model of steatosis represented by HepG2 cells cultured in a medium supplemented with free  and palmitic fatty acids (FFAs). We report that FFA supplementation induces the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in the DNL as well as for the transcription factor SREBP-1a. The SREBP-1a mRNA translation, dependent on an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and the SREBP-1a proteolytic cleavage are activated by FFAs. Furthermore, FFA treatment enhances the expression and the nucleus-cytosolic shuttling of hnRNP A1, a trans-activating factor of SREBP-1a IRES. The binding of hnRNP A1 to the SREBP-1a IRES is also increased upon FFA supplementation. The relocation of hnRNP A1 and the consequent increase of SREBP-1a translation are dependent on the p38 MAPK signal pathway, which is activated by FFAs. By RNA interference approach, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 is implicated in the FFA-induced expression of SREBP-1a and of its target genes as well as in the lipid accumulation in cells.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, fermented R. verniciflua Stokes extract (FRVE), an allergen-free extract of R. verniciflua Stokes fermented with the yeast Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, was assessed for its lipid-lowering potential in an in vitro non-alcoholic fatty liver disease model. FRVE markedly suppressed lipid accumulation and intracellular triglycerides (TGs) in the presence of  (OA). Additionally, FRVE decreased both mRNA and protein levels of lipid-synthesis- and cholesterol-metabolism-related factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty  synthase (FAS), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), in OA-induced HepG2 cells. Moreover, FRVE activated low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and fatty  oxidation-related factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1). Further, the AMPK inhibitor compound C suppressed the increased expression of AMPK phosphorylation induced by FRVE. Phenolics and cosanols in FRVE increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and decreased that of SREBP-1. Taken together, our findings suggest that FRVE has antilipogenic potential in non-alcoholic fatty livers via AMPK upregulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057104>Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. alleviates  and oxidative stress during -induced steatosis in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Excess accumulation of lipids and oxidative stress in the liver contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We hypothesized that Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. (PSZ) can protect against NAFLD by regulating lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in the liver. To investigate the effect of PSZ upon NAFLD, we used an established cellular model: HepG2 cells treated with . Then, the extent of hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress was assessed and levels of inflammatory markers measured. -treated HepG2 cells, compared with controls, had greater lipid accumulation. PSZ decreased lipid accumulation by 63% in -treated HepG2 cells. Additionally, PSZ decreased the target gene expression of  such as sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, fatty  synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase-1, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 by 1.75, 6.0, 2.32, 1.93 and 1.81 fold, respectively. In addition, -treated HepG2 cells elicited extensive accumulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) by 4.53 fold, whereas PSZ-treated cells decreased the expression of TNFα mRNA by 1.76 fold. PSZ significantly inhibited oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species.

The function of miR-291b-3p is unknown. The potential role of miR-291b-3p in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism was explored in this study. High-fat diet (HFD)- and chow-fed mice were injected with an adenovirus expressing a miR-291b-3p inhibitor and a miR-291b-3p mimic through the tail vein. Hepatic lipids and lipogenic gene expression were analyzed. Additionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed in vitro to identify direct targets of miR-291b-3p. MiR-291b-3p expression and the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were increased in the steatotic liver of db/db mice and HFD-fed mice versus their respective controls. Inhibition of hepatic miR-291b-3p expression prevented increases in hepatic  and steatosis in HFD-fed mice. The opposite was observed when miR-291b-3p was overexpressed in the livers of chow-fed C57BL/6J wild-type mice. In vitro studies revealed that silencing of miR-291b-3p in NCTC1469 hepatic cells ameliorated /palmitic  mixture-induced elevation of cellular triglycerides. Importantly, we identified AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-291b-3p. Using metformin, an activator of AMPK, we showed that AMPK activation-induced inhibition of hepatic lipid accumulation was accompanied by reduced expression of miR-291b-3p in the liver. Liver miR-291b-3p promoted hepatic  and lipid accumulation in mice. AMPKα1 is a direct target of miR-291b-3p. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-291b-3p promotes hepatic  by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and activity, indicating the therapeutic potential of miR-291b-3p inhibitors in fatty liver disease.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119530>Decreased lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis are coupled with changes in liver microRNAs in obese subjects with NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Many controversies regarding the association of liver miRNAs with obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) call for additional validations. This study sought to investigate variations in genes and hepatic miRNAs in a sample of obese patients with or without NAFLD and human hepatocytes (HH).A total of 60 non-consecutive obese women following bariatric surgery were recruited. Subjects were classified as NAFLD (n=17), borderline (n=24) and controls (n=19) with normal enzymatic profile, liver histology and ultrasound assessments. Profiling of 744 miRNAs was performed in 8 obese women with no sign of hepatic disease and 11 NAFLD patients. Additional validation and expression of genes related to de novo fatty  (FA) biosynthesis, uptake, transport and β-oxidation; glucose metabolism, and inflammation was tested in the extended sample. Induction of NAFLD-related genes and miRNAs was examined in HepG2 cells and primary HH treated with palmitic  (PA), a combination of palmitate and , or high glucose, and insulin (HG) mimicking insulin resistance in NAFLD.In the discovery sample, 14 miRNAs were associated with NAFLD. Analyses in the extended sample confirmed decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-422a, and increased miR-146b-5p in obese subjects with NAFLD. Multiple linear regression analyses disclosed that NAFLD contributed independently to explain miR-139-5p (P=0.005), miR-30b-5p (P=0.005), miR-122-5p (P=0.021), miR-422a (P=0.007) and miR-146a (P=0.033) expression variance after controlling for confounders. Decreased miR-122-5p in liver was associated with impaired FA usage. Expression of inflammatory and macrophage-related genes was opposite to decreased miR-30b-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-422a, whereas increased miR-146b-5p was associated with FABP4 and decreased glucose metabolism and FA mobilization. In partial agreement, PA (but not HG) led to decreased miR-139-5p, miR-30b-5p, miR-422a and miR-146a in vitro, in parallel with increased  and FA transport, decreased glucose metabolism and diminished FA oxidation.This study confirms decreased liver glucose and lipid metabolism but increased FA biosynthesis coupled with changes in five unique miRNAs in obese patients with NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153512>Dose- and type-dependent effects of long-chain fatty acids on adipogenesis and lipogenesis of bovine adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Differentiation and lipid metabolism of adipocytes have a great influence on milk performance, health, and feed efficiency of dairy cows. The effects of dietary long-chain fatty acids (FA) on adipogenesis and lipogenesis of dairy cows are often confounded by other nutritional and physiological factors in vivo. Therefore, this study used an in vitro approach to study the effect of dose and type of long-chain FA on adipogenesis and lipogenesis of bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cells were isolated from adipose tissue of dairy cows and induced into mature adipocytes in the presence of various long-chain FA including myristic, palmitic, stearic, , or linoleic . When concentrations of myristic, palmitic, and  acids in adipogenic mediums were 150 and 200 μM, the induced mature adipocytes had greater lipid content compared with other concentrations of FA. In addition, mature adipocytes induced at 100 μM stearic  and 300 μM linoleic  had the greatest content of lipid than at other concentrations. High concentrations of saturated FA were more toxic for cells than the same concentration of unsaturated FA during the induction. When commitment stage was solely treated with FA, the number of differentiated mature adipocytes was greater for  and linoleic acids than other FA. When the maturation stage was treated with FA, the number of mature adipocytes was not affected, but the lipid content in adipocytes was affected and ranked  > linoleic > myristic > stearic > palmitic. In summary, this study showed that adipogenesis and lipogenesis of bovine adipocytes were differentially affected by long-chain FA, with unsaturated FA more effective than saturated FA.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

This includes basic research on the pathways of solar energy conversion and on lipid biosynthesis and catabolism, and applied research dealing with the various biological and technical bottlenecks of the lipid production process. In here, we review the current knowledge in microalgal lipids with respect to their metabolism and various biotechnological applications, and we discuss potential future perspectives. The committing step in fatty  biosynthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA that is then introduced in the fatty  synthesis cycle leading to the formation of palmitic and stearic acids.  may also be synthesized after stearic  desaturation while further conversions of the fatty acids (i.e. desaturations, elongations) occur after their esterification with structural lipids of both plastids and the endoplasmic reticulum. The aliphatic chains are also used as building blocks for structuring storage acylglycerols via the Kennedy pathway. Current research, aiming to enhance  in the microalgal cell, is focusing on over-expressing key-enzymes involved in the earlier steps of the pathway of fatty  synthesis. A complementary plan would be the repression of lipid catabolism by down-regulating acylglycerol hydrolysis and/or β-oxidation. The tendency of oleaginous microalgae to synthesize, apart from lipids, significant amounts of other energy-rich compounds such as sugars, in processes competitive to , deserves attention since the lipid yield may be considerably increased by blocking competitive metabolic pathways. The majority of microalgal production occurs in outdoor cultivation and for this reason biotechnological applications face some difficulties. Therefore, algal production systems need to be improved and harvesting systems need to be more effective in order for their industrial applications to become more competitive and economically viable. Besides, a reduction of the production cost of microalgal lipids can be achieved by combining lipid production with other commercial applications. The combined production of bioactive products and lipids, when possible, can support the commercial viability of both processes. Hydrophobic compounds can be extracted simultaneously with lipids and then purified, while hydrophilic compounds such as proteins and sugars may be extracted from the defatted biomass. The microalgae also have applications in environmental biotechnology since they can be used for bioremediation of wastewater and to monitor environmental toxicants. Algal biomass produced during wastewater treatment may be further valorized in the biofuel manufacture. It is anticipated that the high microalgal lipid potential will force research towards finding effective ways to manipulate biochemical pathways involved in lipid biosynthesis and towards cost effective algal cultivation and harvesting systems, as well.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported that Bscl2 (-/-) mice develop lipodystrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) due to unbridled lipolysis. The residual epididymal WAT (EWAT) displays a browning phenotype with much smaller lipid droplets (LD) and higher expression of brown adipose tissue marker proteins. Here we used targeted lipidomics and gene expression profiling to analyze lipid profiles as well as genes involved in lipid metabolism in WAT of wild-type and Bscl2(-/-) mice. Analysis of total saponified fatty acids revealed that the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice contained a much higher proportion of  18:1n9  concomitant with a lower proportion of palmitic 16:0 , as well as increased n3- polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) remodeling. The acyl chains in major species of triacylglyceride (TG) and diacylglyceride (DG) in the residual EWAT of Bscl2(-/-) mice were also enriched with dietary fatty acids. These changes could be reflected by upregulation of several fatty  elongases and desaturases. Meanwhile, Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes from EWAT had increased gene expression in lipid uptake and TG synthesis but not de novo . Both mitochondria and peroxisomal β-oxidation genes were also markedly increased in Bscl2(-/-) adipocytes, highlighting that these machineries were accelerated to shunt the lipolysis liberated fatty acids through uncoupling to dissipate energy. The residual subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) was not browning but displays similar changes in lipid metabolism. Overall, our data emphasize that, other than being essential for adipocyte differentiation, Bscl2 is also important in fatty  remodeling and energy homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27016726>Glycine N-acyltransferase-like 3 is responsible for long-chain N-acylglycine formation in N18TG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Long-chain fatty  amides are signaling lipids found in mammals and other organisms; however, details of the metabolic pathways for the N-acylglycines and primary fatty  amides (PFAMs) have remained elusive. Heavy-labeled precursor and subtraction lipidomic experiments in mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells, a model cell line for the study of fatty  amide metabolism, establish the biosynthetic pathways for the N-acylglycines and the PFAMs. We provide evidence that the N-acylglycines are formed by a long-chain specific glycine-conjugating enzyme, glycine N-acyltransferase-like 3 (GLYATL3). siRNA knockdown of GLYATL3 in the N18TG2 cells resulted in a decrease in the levels of the N-acylglycines and the PFAMs. This is the first report of an enzyme responsible for long-chain N-acylglycine production in cellula. The production of the PFAMs in N18TG2 cells was reported to occur by the oxidative cleavage of the N-acylglycines, as catalyzed by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). siRNA knockdown of PAM resulted in an accumulation of [(13)C18]N-oleoylglycine and decreased levels of [(13)C18]oleamide when the N18TG2 cells were grown in the presence of [(13)C18]. The addition of [1-(13)C]palmitate to the N18TG2 cell growth media led to the production of a family of [1-(13)C]palmitoylated fatty  amides, consistent with the biosynthetic pathways detailed herein.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27768909>High-fructose corn syrup-55 consumption alters hepatic lipid metabolism and promotes triglyceride accumulation.</a></h1><p>High-fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55) has been suggested to be more lipogenic than sucrose, which increases the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and dyslipidemia. The study objectives were to determine the effects of drinking different sugar-sweetened solutions on hepatic gene expression in relation to liver fatty  composition and risk of NAFLD. Female rats were randomly assigned (n=7 rats/group) to drink water or water sweetened with 13% (w/v) HFCS-55, sucrose or fructose for 8 weeks. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest (P=.03) hepatic total lipid and triglyceride content and histological evidence of fat infiltration. Rats drinking HFCS-55 solution had the highest hepatic de novo  indicated by the up-regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and the highest (P<.001)  (18:1n-9) content. This was accompanied by reduced β-oxidation indicated by down-regulation of hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Disposal of excess lipids by export of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein from the liver was increased as shown by up-regulation of gene expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in rats drinking sucrose, but not HFCS-55 solution. The observed lipogenic effects were attributed to the slightly higher fructose content of HFCS-55 solution in the absence of differences in macronutrient and total caloric intake between rats drinking HFCS-55 and sucrose solution. Results from gene expression and fatty  composition analysis showed that, in a hypercaloric state, some types of sugars are more detrimental to the liver. Based on these preclinical study results, excess consumption of caloric sweetened beverage, particularly HFCS-sweetened beverages, should be limited.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722377>Chalcones suppress fatty -induced lipid accumulation through a LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Excessive lipid accumulation in the liver has been proposed to cause hyperlipidemia, diabetes and fatty liver disease. 4-Hydroxyderricin (4HD), xanthoangelol (XAG), cardamonin (CAR) and flavokawain B (FKB) are chalcones that have exhibited various biological effects against obesity, inflammation, and diabetes; however, little is known about the inhibitory effects of these chalcones on fatty liver disease. In the present study, we investigated the ability of 4HD, XAG, CAR, and FKB to reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. When HepG2 cells were treated with a mixture of fatty acids (FAs; palmitic  :  = 1 : 2 ratio), significant lipid accumulation was observed. Under the same experimental conditions, addition of chalcones at 5 μM significantly suppressed the FA-induced lipid accumulation. We found that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a key molecule involved in , was decreased in these chalcone-treated cells. We also found that these chalcones increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is involved in FA oxidation. Moreover, these chalcones increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), upstream regulators of SREBP-1 and PPARα. We confirmed that an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, reversed chalcone-induced changes in SREBP-1 and PPARα expression in the HepG2 cells. Collectively, we found that 4HD, XAG, CAR, and XAG attenuated lipid accumulation through activation of the LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24377368>The polyphenol extract from Sechium edule shoots inhibits  and stimulates lipolysis via activation of AMPK signals in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Fatty liver may have implications for metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Therefore, the development of pharmacological or natural agents to reduce fat accumulation in the liver is an important effort. The Sechium edule shoots have already been verified to decrease serum lipids and cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis. However, how Sechium edule shoots modulate hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of polyphenol extracts (SPE) of Sechium edule shoots in reducing lipid accumulation in -treated HepG2 cells. We found that water extracts (SWE) of Sechium edule shoots could decrease serum and hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triacylglycerol and cholesterol). Furthermore, SWE and SPE through the AMPK (AMP-activating protein kinase) signaling pathway could decrease lipogenic relative enzymes, such as FAS (fatty  synthase), HMGCoR (HMG-CoA reductase), and SREBPs (sterol regulatory element binding proteins), and increase the expression of CPT-I (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) and PPARα (peroxisome proliferators activated receptor α), which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism. These observations suggested that Sechium edule shoots have potential for developing health foods for preventing and remedying fatty liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543975>Risk of diabetes associated with fatty acids in the de novo  pathway is independent of insulin sensitivity and response: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS).</a></h1><p>To examine the associations of fatty acids in the de novo  (DNL) pathway, specifically myristic  (14:0), palmitic  (16:0), palmitoleic  (c16:1 n-7), myristoleic  (c14:1n5), stearic  (18:0) and  (c18:1 n-9), with 5-year risk of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that DNL fatty acids are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes independent of insulin sensitivity.We evaluated 719 (mean age 55.1±8.5 years, 44.2% men, 42.3% Caucasians) participants from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study. Multivariable logistic regression models with and without adjustment of insulin sensitivity were used to assess prospective associations of DNL fatty acids with incident type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes incidence was 20.3% over 5 years. In multivariable regression models, palmitic, palmitoleic, myristic, myristoleic and  acids were associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (p<0.05). Palmitic  had the strongest association (OR per standard unit of palmitic  1.46; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.76; p<0.001), which remained similar with addition of insulin sensitivity and acute insulin response (AIR) to the model (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70, p=0.01).  and palmitoleic acids were also independently associated with incident type 2 diabetes.

Rutin is a natural flavonoid with significant roles in combating cellular oxidative stress and regulating lipid metabolism. The current study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying rutin's hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective effects in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Rutin treatment was applied to male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a high-fat diet and HepG2 cells challenged with . Hepatic lipid accumulation was evaluated by triglyceride assay and Oil Red O staining. Oxidative hepatic injury was assessed by malondialdehyde assay, superoxide dismutase assay and reactive oxygen species assay. The expression levels of various lipogenic and lipolytic genes were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. In addition, liver autophagy was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In both fat-challenged murine liver tissues and HepG2 cells, rutin treatment was shown to significantly lower triglyceride content and the abundance of lipid droplets. Rutin was also found to reduce cellular malondialdehyde level and restore superoxide dismutase activity in hepatocytes. Among the various lipid-related genes, rutin treatment was able to restore the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and its downstream targets, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2 (CPT-1 and CPT-2), while suppressing those of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), diglyceride acyltransfase 1 and 2 (DGAT-1 and 2), as well as acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, rutin was shown to repress the autophagic function of liver tissues by down-regulating key autophagy biomarkers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). The experimental data demonstrated that rutin could reduce triglyceride content and mitigate oxidative injuries in fat-enriched hepatocytes. The hypolipidemic properties of rutin could be attributed to its ability to simultaneously facilitate fatty  metabolism and inhibit .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Because antioxidants are gaining attention as potent preventive agents for HS, we aimed to investigate anti-lipogenic effects of the antioxidants vitamin C (VC), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and astaxanthin (ATX) using hepatocytes. For this, we established an in vitro model using 1 mM  (OA) and human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells; 10 μM antioxidants were evaluated for their ability to reduce fat accumulation in hepatocytes. Our results showed that all three antioxidants were effective to reduce fat accumulation for the molecular targets such as reduction in lipid droplets, triglyceride (TG) concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell apoptosis, as well as in gene expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related effectors, , and inflammatory cytokines. There were simultaneous increases in diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging effect, cell survival, AMPK phosphorylation, NRF2-related gene expression for cellular defense, and FA β-oxidation. However, among these, ATX more effectively inhibited ER stress and  at the intracellular level than VC or NAC. Consequently, ATX was also more effective in inhibiting cell death, lipotoxicity, and inflammation. Our result emphasizes that ATX achieved greater lipotoxicity reduction than VC and NAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28173868>Docosahexaenoic  increases accumulation of adipocyte triacylglycerol through up-regulation of lipogenic gene expression in pigs.</a></h1><p>Changing dietary fatty  composition in modern diet influences the prevalence of obesity. Increasing evidences suggest favorable effects of n-3 PUFA for protecting against obesity and the metabolic syndrome. However, the regulation of n-3 PUFA in adipose is still unclear. Thus, this study addressed metabolism of different dietary fats in the adipose tissue of porcine model.Eight-week-old cross-bred pigs were randomly assigned to three groups and fed a 2% fat diet for 30 days from either soybean oil (SBO), docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or beef tallow. An in vitro experiment was conducted in which linoleic  (LA), DHA or  (OA) were added to represent the major fatty  in the SBO-, DHA- or BT- diets, respectively. Adipocytes size and lipid metabolism related genes were analyzed.Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) was lower in DHA- than in BT-fed pigs, and the product of lipolysis, glycerol was highest in BT-fed pigs. In addition, expression of the lipolytic genes, adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase was higher in BT-fed pigs and with OA treatment in vitro. DHA promoted protein kinase A activity in pigs without affecting lipolytic genes. Adipocyte cell sizes, TAG content and expression of lipogenic-related genes including, adipose differentiated related protein (ADRP) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) were elevated by DHA in vivo and in vitro, indicating DHA promoted  to trap TAG in adipose tissue. Fatty  β-oxidation genes were increased in the DHA-fed pigs.This effect was partly explained by the effect of DHA to promote  to trap TAG in adipocytes and also increase expression of genes involved in adipocyte fatty  oxidation. Therefore, our results suggest a direct effect of DHA on adipocyte metabolism, resulting in TAG turnover and fatty  dissipation to facilitate plasma lipid uptake from the circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28831954>Effects of different dietary DHA:EPA ratios on gonadal steroidogenesis in the marine teleost, tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis).</a></h1><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary DHA and EPA on gonadal steroidogenesis in mature females and males, with a feeding trial on tongue sole, a typical marine teleost with sexual dimorphism. Three experimental diets differing basically in DHA:EPA ratio, that is, 0·68 (diet D:E-0·68), 1·09 (D:E-1·09) and 2·05 (D:E-2·05), were randomly assigned to nine tanks of 3-year-old tongue sole (ten females and fifteen males in each tank). The feeding trail lasted for 90 d before and during the spawning season. Fish were reared in a flowing seawater system and fed to apparent satiation twice daily. Compared with diet D:E-0·68, diet D:E-1·09 significantly enhanced the oestradiol production in females, whereas diet D:E-2·05 significantly enhanced the testosterone production in males. In ovaries, diet D:E-1·09 induced highest mRNA expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). In testes, diet 2·05 resulted in highest mRNA expression of FSHR, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450c17 and 3β-HSD. Fatty  profiles in fish tissues reflected closely those of diets. Female fish had more gonadal EPA content but less DHA content than male fish, whereas there was a reverse observation in liver. In conclusion, the dietary DHA:EPA ratio, possibly combined with the dietary EPA:arachidonic  ratio, differentially regulated sex steroid hormone synthesis in mature female and male tongue soles. Females seemed to require more EPA but less DHA for the gonadal steroidogenesis than males. The results are beneficial to sex-specific nutritive strategies in domestic teleost.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455870>Specific diacylglycerols generated by hepatic  stimulate the oncogenic androgen receptor activity in male hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Obesity-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more prevalent in males than in females, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The influence of hepatic androgen receptor (AR) pathway on the gender difference of HCC has been well documented. Here we investigated the role of hepatic , which is elevated in the livers of obese and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, in stimulating the AR pathway for the male preference of obesity induced HCC.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a fructose-rich high carbohydrate diet (HCD) to induce hepatic . The effect of hepatic  on AR was examined by the expression of hydrodynamically injected AR reporter and the endogenous AR target gene; the mechanism was delineated in hepatoma cell lines and validated in male mice.The hepatic  induced by a fructose-rich HCD enhanced the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR in male mice, which did not happen when fed a high fat diet. This AR activation was blocked by sh-RNAs or inhibitors targeting key enzymes in , either acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (ACCα), or fatty  synthase (FASN), in vivo and in vitro. Further mechanistic study identified that specific unsaturated fatty , the  (C18:1 n-9), incorporated DAGs produced by hepatic  are the key molecules to enhance the AR activity, through activation of Akt kinase, and this novel mechanism is targeted by metformin.Our study elucidates a novel mechanism underlying the higher risk of HCC in obese/NAFLD males, through specific DAGs enriched by hepatic  to increase the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR, a confirmed risk factor for male HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862029>Peanut Sprout Extracts Attenuate Triglyceride Accumulation by Promoting Mitochondrial Fatty  Oxidation in Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Peanut sprouts (PS), which are germinated peanut seeds, have recently been reported to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects. However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates lipid metabolism are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated  by inhibiting lipid accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty  oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28707223>Inhibition of exendin-4-induced steatosis by protein kinase A in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes, resulting in a steatotic liver. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and its analog exendin-4 can ameliorate certain aspects of this syndrome by inducing weight loss and reducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation, but it is unclear whether these effects result from the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 on the pancreas, or from direct action on the liver. This study investigated the direct action and putative cellular mechanism of exendin-4 on steatotic hepatocytes in culture. Steatosis was induced in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells by incubation in media supplemented with 2 mM each of linoleic  and . Steatotic hepatocytes were then pre-incubated in the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 for 30 min, then treated with exendin-4 over a period of 24 h. Cell viability and triglyceride content were characterized by a TUNEL assay and AdipoRed staining, respectively. Our results showed that steatotic cells maintained high levels of intracellular triglycerides (80%) compared to lean controls (25%). Exendin-4 treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular triglyceride content after 12 h that persisted through 24 h, while protein kinase A inhibitors abolished the effects of exendin-4. The results demonstrate the exendin-4 induces a partial reduction in triglycerides in steatotic hepatocytes within 12 h via the GLP-1 receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase A. Thus, the reduction in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation is likely driven primarily by downregulation of  and upregulation of β-oxidation of free fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25879456>Desaturation index versus isotopically measured de novo  as an indicator of acute systemic .</a></h1><p>High carbohydrate feeding is known to increase plasma triglycerides as well as hepatic de novo  (DNL) and may be implicated in the development of hepatic insulin resistance and fatty liver. Unfortunately, it is technically challenging to determine what proportion of circulating plasma triglycerides have been derived from the newly synthesized fatty acids in the postprandial period. The aims of this study were to 1) characterize the changes in the plasma postprandial total fatty  pool in beagles following the consumption of meals containing 44% (Control) and 74% (High Sucrose) carbohydrate and 2) determine if changes in plasma fatty  concentration and delta-9 desaturation index (DI) would be useful as simple and easy to measure biomarkers of systemic DNL.No differences in plasma total palmitic  (16:0), stearic  (18:0) and  (18:1) concentrations or delta-9 DI for the total 18:0 and 18:1 pools between High Sucrose and Controls were observed. However, newly synthesized 16:0 (2.6 ± 0.2% vs. 8.8 ± 2.0%; p = 0.016), 18:0 (0.93 ± 0.2% vs. 4.1 ± 1.7%; p = 0.007) and 18:1 (0.29 ± 0.09% vs. 3.5 ± 1.2%; p = 0.017) were higher in High Sucrose versus Control animals, respectively. Also, the delta-9 DI for the newly synthesized 18:0 and 18:1 pools was higher at 2 and 6 hours postprandial, with a pattern of change which supports the increased stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) activity following high carbohydrate feeding followed by a down regulation of this enzyme.Our data show that high sucrose meals increase the relative contribution of systemic DNL produced fatty acids to the total postprandial plasma fatty  pool. These data also show that a different pattern of both fatty  synthesis and disposal occurs depending on energy and macronutrient profile of the meal. These changes are in spite of no observable changes in the plasma concentrations or ratios of the total fatty  pool opposed to the observed changes in the newly synthesized fatty  pool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845265>The effects of herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rats and HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Hepatic steatosis has risen rapidly in parallel with a dramatic increase in obesity. The aim of this study was to determine whether the herbal composition Gambigyeongsinhwan (4) (GGH(4)), composed of Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae), Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud. (Betulaceae), and the fermented traditional Korean medicine Massa Medicata Fermentata, regulates hepatic steatosis and inflammation.The effects of GGH(4) on hepatic steatosis and inflammation in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats and HepG2 cells were examined using Oil red O, hematoxylin and eosin, and toluidine blue staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) transactivation assay.Administration of GGH(4) to OLETF rats improved hepatic steatosis and lowered serum levels of alanine transaminase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids. GGH(4) increased mRNA levels of fatty  oxidation enzymes (ACOX, HD, CPT-1, and MCAD) and decreased mRNA levels of  genes (FAS, ACC1, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1c) in the liver of OLETF rats. In addition, infiltration of inflammatory cells and expression of inflammatory cytokines (CD68, TNFα, and MCP-1) in liver tissue were reduced by GGH(4). Treatment of HepG2 cells with a mixture of  and palmitoleic  induced significant lipid accumulation, but GGH(4) inhibited lipid accumulation by regulating the expression of hepatic fatty  oxidation and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also increased PPARα reporter gene expression. These effects of GGH(4) were similar to those of the PPARα activator fenofibrate, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reversed the inhibitory effects of GGH(4) on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells.These results suggest that GGH(4) inhibits obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and that this process may be mediated by regulation of the expression of PPARα target genes and lipogenic genes. GGH(4) also suppressed obesity-related hepatic inflammation. Thus, GGH(4) may be a promising drug for the treatment of obesity-related liver diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Lipid homeostasis, closely involved in obesity, has been reported to be regulated by multiple pathways. mTORC1 is emerging as a critical regulator of lipid metabolism. Here, we describe that the consumption of soy isoflavones, with a structural similarity to that of estradiol, could mitigate obesity through an AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Fed with soy isoflavones, the diet-induced obesity (DIO) male rats exhibited decreased body weight, accompanied with suppressed  and , as well as enhanced lipolysis and β‑oxidation.

Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that microRNA-199a-3p exhibited a suppressive role in hepatic . Adenoviral mediated microRNA-199a-3p expression in C57BL/6J mice largely attenuated triglyceride (TG) accumulation and expression of lipogenic genes. Furthermore, we identified Specificity Protein 1 (Sp1) as the functional target of miR-124. Restoration of Sp1 expression largely compromised the effect of microRNA-199a-3p on hepatic TG metabolism.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)-palmitic and -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with , fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of -related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27747453>Dietary Arachidonic  Has a Time-Dependent Differential Impact on  Modulated via COX and LOX Pathways in Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus.</a></h1><p>In this study, we explored the function of arachidonic  (ARA) in  in the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) using in vivo and in vitro models. An 8-week feeding trial was performed using three isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets: ARA-free, ARA, and ARA + acetylsalicylic  [ASA, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor]. Fish were sampled after 4 and 8 weeks of feeding. Results showed that ARA-fed fish had a significantly lower intraperitoneal fat index (IPFI) and smaller adipocytes; these decreases were reversed by ASA after 8 weeks of feeding. Nevertheless, at week 4, the IPFI and adipocyte size were higher in the ARA group, and they were comparable to those of fish fed ARA + ASA. To further investigate the influence of ARA on adipocyte differentiation, confluent pre-adipocytes of grass carp were incubated with ARA for 3 days. This in vitro experiment demonstrated that ARA promoted  in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-treatment with the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic  attenuated the pro-adipogenic function of ARA.

Although AITC is metabolized primarily through the mercapturic  pathway, its exact pharmacokinetics remains undefined and the biological function of AITC metabolites is still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of AITC metabolites on lipid accumulation in vitro and elucidated the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of AITC metabolites in rats. We found that AITC metabolites generally conjugate with glutathione (GSH) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and are distributed in most organs and tissues. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a rapid uptake and complete metabolism of AITC following oral administration to rats. Although AITC has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor activity in bladder cancer, the potential bioactivity of its metabolites has not been explored. We found that GSH-AITC and NAC-AITC effectively inhibit adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and suppress expression of PPAR-γ, C/EBPα, and FAS, which are up-regulated during . GSH-AITC and NAC-AITC also suppressed -induced lipid accumulation and  in hepatocytes. Our findings suggest that AITC is almost completely metabolized in the liver and rapidly excreted in urine through the mercapturic  pathway following administration in rats.

We evaluated the effects of breed, 24 h fasting, and dietary energy source (HO:  versus CH: carbohydrates) on the expression of candidate genes involved in , , and lipolysis in the adipose tissue from Iberian and Duroc growing pigs. The Iberian pigs showed greater feed intake, backfat thickness, and saturated fatty acids (SFA) content in the subcutaneous fat, whereas the Duroc pigs had greater ham weight and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content. In both breeds, the diet induced changes in the fatty  (FA) composition of subcutaneous fat samples. The HO group had higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and , and lower SFA than the CH group. Regarding gene expression, breed and feeding status (fasting versus postprandial) had significant effects on gene expression, with quantitative interactions between them, while diet showed negligible effects. In general, adipogenic and lipogenic genes were upregulated in the Iberian pigs and in postprandial samples. In contrast, the expression of lipolytic genes showed complex interaction effects. Our results agree with the phenotypic differences between the Iberian and Duroc breeds and with the inhibition of  by fasting. Quantitative interactions between breed and feeding status effects were observed, which indicates a different response to fasting of the two breeds, with the obese Iberian breed showing a more stable expression of lipogenic genes. These results highlight the complexity of lipid metabolism regulation, especially in relation to lipolysis processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077002>Palmitoleic (16:1 cis-9) and cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)  alter  in bovine adipocyte cultures.</a></h1><p>Our objectives were to: (1) confirm elongation products of palmitoleic  (16:1 cis-9) elongation in vitro using stable isotopes and (2) evaluate if exogenous supplementation of palmitoleic , elongation products, or both are responsible for decreased desaturation and  rates observed with palmitoleic  supplementation in bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cultures were isolated from adipose tissue of two beef carcasses, allowed to reach confluence, held for 2 days, and differentiated with a standard hormone cocktail (day 0). On day 2, secondary differentiation media containing 1 of 4 fatty  treatments [0 μM fatty  (control), or 150 μM palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic, or cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)] was added for 4 days. On day 6, cells were incubated with [(13)C] 16:1, [(13)C] 2, or [(13)C] 18:0 to estimate elongation, lipogenic, and desaturation rates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Enrichment of [(13)C] 18:1 cis-11 confirmed 18:1 cis-11 is an elongation product of 16:1. Additionally, [(13)C] label was seen in 20:1 cis-13 and cis-9, cis-11 CLA. Synthesis of [(13)C] 16:0 from [(13)C] 2 was reduced (P < 0.05) in palmitoleic  and cis-vaccenic -treated compared with control cells following 36 h incubation. By 12 h of [(13)C] 18:0 incubation, cells supplemented with palmitoleic  had reduced (P < 0.05) [(13)C] 18:1 cis-9 compared with all other treatments. Gene expression and fatty  results support isotopic data for  and desaturation. Therefore, palmitoleic  is actively elongated in vitro and its elongation product, cis-vaccenic , can also reduce .

The influence of specific nutrients on the molecular regulation of  is not well characterized and is known to be influenced by many factors including timing and physiological status. A trial was performed to study the effects of different dietary energy sources on lipogenic genes transcription in ham adipose tissue of Iberian pigs, at different growth periods and on feeding/fasting situations. A total of 27 Iberian male pigs of 28 kg BW were allocated to two separate groups and fed with different isocaloric feeding regimens: standard diet with carbohydrates as energy source (CH) or diet enriched with high  sunflower oil (HO). Ham subcutaneous adipose tissue was sampled by biopsy at growing (44 kg mean BW) and finishing (100 kg mean BW) periods. The first sampling was performed on fasted animals, while the last sampling was performed twice, with animals fasted overnight and 3 h after refeeding. Effects of diet, growth period and feeding/fasting status on gene expression were explored quantifying the expression of a panel of key genes implicated in  and lipid metabolism processes. Quantitative PCR revealed several differentially expressed genes according to diet, with similar results at both timings: RXRG, LEP and FABP5 genes were upregulated in HO group while ME1, FASN, ACACA and ELOVL6 were upregulated in CH. The diet effect on ME1 gene expression was conditional on feeding/fasting status, with the higher ME1 gene expression in CH than HO groups, observed only in fasting samples. Results are compatible with a higher de novo endogenous synthesis of fatty acids (FA) in the carbohydrate-supplemented group and a higher FA transport in the -supplemented group. Growth period significantly affected the expression of most of the studied genes, with all but PPARG showing higher expression in finishing pigs according to a pattern dissimilar from the usual in cosmopolitan pig breeds. Feeding/fasting status only influenced PPARG gene transcription. The lack of effects of feeding/fasting status on lipogenic gene expression and the higher ME1 response to diet in fasting samples than in postprandial sampling, suggest the persistence of de novo  during fasting. Overall results improve the understanding of the influence of different factors on lipid metabolism regulation in Iberian pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24327170>Abomasal infusion of arginine stimulates SCD and C/EBPß gene expression, and decreases CPT1ß gene expression in bovine adipose tissue independent of conjugated linoleic .</a></h1><p>Based on previous research with bovine peadipocytes, we hypothesized that infusion of arginine into the abomasum of Angus steers stimulates stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene expression in bovine subcutaneous (s.c.) adipose tissue, and that this would be attenuated by conjugated linoleic  (CLA). Growing Angus steers were infused abomasally with L-arginine 50 g/day; n = 13; provided as L-arginine HCl) or L-alanine (isonitrogenous control, 100 g/day; n = 11) for 14 days. For the subsequent 14 days, half of the steers in each amino  group were infused with CLA (100 g/day). Body weight gain and average daily gain were unaffected (P > 0.15) by infusion of arginine or CLA into the abomasum. The plasma concentrations of cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA were increased CLA infusion (P = 0.001) and infusion of arginine increased plasma arginine (P = 0.01). Compared with day 0, fatty  synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase enzyme activities in s.c. adipose tissue increased by day 14 in steers infused with either alanine or arginine (all P < 0.01). NADP-MDH activity was higher (P = 0.01) in steers infused with arginine than in steers infused with arginine plus CLA by day 28, but lipid synthesis in vitro from glucose and acetate was unaffected by infusion of either arginine or CLA (P > 0.40). By day 28, C/EBPβ and SCD gene expression was higher, and CPT1β gene expression was lower, in s.c. adipose tissue of steers infused with arginine than in steers infused with alanine (±CLA) (P = 0.05). CLA decreased adipose tissue  (18:1n-9) in alanine- or arginine-infused steers (P = 0.05), although CLA had no effect on SCD gene expression. The data indicate that supplemental arginine promotes adipogenic gene expression and may promote lipid accumulation in bovine adipose tissue.

Few prospective studies have used fatty  biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [palmitic  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0)] and MUFA [ (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study.

Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic  and stearic  were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas  showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle, palmitic  (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic  (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas  was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses, vaccenic  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty  biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating palmitic  and stearic  were associated with higher diabetes risk, and vaccenic  was associated with lower diabetes risk.

SCD1 catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). MUFA are then incorporated into triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Previous studies have shown that  deficiency in mice induces metabolic changes in the liver characterized by a decrease in de novo  and an increase in β-oxidation. Interestingly, -deficient mice show a decrease in the expression and maturation of the principal lipogenic transcription factor sterol receptor element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The mechanisms mediating this effect on de novo  and β-oxidation have not been fully elucidated. We evaluated the role of  on de novo  and β-oxidation in HepG2 cells. We also used -deficient mice and two strains of transgenic mice that produce either oleate (GLS5) or palmitoleate (GLS3) in a liver-specific manner. We demonstrate that the expression of β-oxidation markers increases in -deficient hepatocytes and suggest that this is due to an increase in cellular polyunsaturated fatty  content. We also show that the changes in the level of SREBP-1 expression, for both the precursor and the mature forms, are mainly due to the lack of oleate in -deficient hepatocytes. Indeed, oleate treatment of cultured HepG2 cells or hepatic oleate production in chow-fed GLS5 mice can restore SREBP-1 expression and increase hepatic de novo . Finally, we show that oleate specifically increases SREBP-1 nuclear accumulation, suggesting a central role for oleate in SREBP-1 signaling activity.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26257990>Pathways commonly dysregulated in mouse and human obese adipose tissue: FAT/CD36 modulates differentiation and .</a></h1><p>Obesity is linked to adipose tissue hypertrophy (increased adipocyte cell size) and hyperplasia (increased cell number). Comparative analyses of gene datasets allowed us to identify 1426 genes which may represent common adipose phenotype in humans and mice. Among them we identified several adipocyte-specific genes dysregulated in obese adipose tissue, involved in either fatty  storage (acyl CoA synthase ACSL1, hormone-sensitive lipase LIPE, aquaporin 7 AQP7, perilipin PLIN) or cell adhesion (fibronectin FN1, collagens COL1A1, COL1A3, metalloprotein MMP9, or both (scavenger receptor FAT/CD36).

In experiment two, where we compared the gene expression profile of DMIOA treated cells with those treated with DMIOA+20(S), out of 212 differentially expressed genes, 90 were over-expressed in cells treated with DMIOA, and 122 were over-expressed in those treated with DMIOA+20(S). Genes over-expressed in control cells compared to those treated with DMIOA include those involved in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction (IL6, CNN2, ITGB3), cellular assembly and organization (BMP6, IGF1, ACTB), and cell cycle (CD4, 9, 38). Genes over-expressed in DMIOA compared to control cells include those involved in cellular development (ADAM22, ADAMTS9, FIGF), lipid metabolism (FABP3, 4 and 5), and molecular transport (MAP3K8, PDK4, AGTR1). Genes over-expressed in cells treated with DMIOA compared with those treated with DMIOA+20(S) include those involved in lipid metabolism (ENPP2, DHCR7, DHCR24), molecular transport (FADS2, SLC6A2, CD36), and vitamin and mineral metabolism (BCMO1, AACS, AR).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the ethyl acetate fraction of Chinese olive fruit extract (CO-EtOAc) in the modulation of lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In cellular studies, CO-EtOAc attenuated -induced lipid accumulation; we then elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CO-EtOAc in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. CO-EtOAc suppressed the mRNA levels of fatty  transporter genes (CD36 and FABP) and  genes (SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC1), but upregulated genes that govern lipolysis (HSL) and lipid oxidation (PPARα, CPT-1, and ACOX). Moreover, CO-EtOAc increased the protein expression of phosphorylated AMPK, ACC1, CPT-1, and PPARα, but downregulated the expression of mature SREBP-1c and FAS. AMPK plays an essential role in CO-EtOAc-mediated amelioration of lipid accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that CO-EtOAc significantly inhibited body weight gain, epididymal adipose tissue weight, and hepatic lipid accumulation via regulation of the expression of fatty  transporter, , and fatty  oxidation genes and proteins in C57BL/6 mice fed a 60% high-fat diet.

Primary cells were isolated from the mammary glands of Holstein dairy cows and were passaged twice. Afterward, the cells were randomly allocated to six treatments, five UFA-treated groups, and one control group. For all of the treatments, the the fetal bovine serum in the culture solution was replaced with fatty -free BSA (1 g/L), and the cells were treated with different ratios of , linoleic, and linolenic acids (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, 2:13.3:1, 3:20:1, and 4:26.7:1) for 48 h, which were group 1 to group 5. The control culture solution contained only fatty -free BSA without UFAs (0 μM). The results indicated that the cell viability was not affected by adding different ratios of UFAs, but the accumulation of TAG was significantly influenced by supplementing with different ratios of UFAs. Adding different ratios of UFAs suppressed the expression of ACACA and FASN but had the opposite effect on the abundances of FABP3 and CD36 mRNA. The expression levels of PPARG, SPEBF1, CSN1S1, and CSN3 mRNA in the BMECs were affected significantly after adding different ratios of UFAs. Our results suggested that groups 1, 2, and 3 (0.75:4:1, 1.5:10:1, and 2:13.3:1) had stronger auxo-action on fat synthesis in the BMECs, where group 3 (2:13.3:1) was the best, followed by group 4 (3:20:1). However, group 5 (4:26.7:1) was the worst. Genes related to protein synthesis in the BMECs were better promoted in groups 2 and 3, and group 3 had the strongest auxo-action, whereas the present study only partly examined the regulation of protein synthesis at the transcriptional level; more studies on translation level are needed in the future. Therefore, when combining fat and protein synthesis, group 3 could be obviously fat and protein synthesis in the BMECs concurrently. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism for regulating fat and protein synthesis in the BMECs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31353555>Dietary fatty acids from pomegranate seeds (Punica granatum) inhibit  and impact the expression of the obesity-associated mRNA transcripts in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a metabolic disorder that manifests into various forms. Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty acids: punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ],  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty acids on , inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited  of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty acids inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the obesity-linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with , inflammation, satiety, energy intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules). The study gives an overview of the vast number of genes impacted by the treatment with SHAMstat3pg paving the way for future studies to demonstrate the exact mode of action of how dietary fatty acids can help manage obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26539118>Nuciferine downregulates Per-Arnt-Sim kinase expression during its alleviation of  and inflammation on -induced hepatic steatosis in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent liver disease associated with lipotoxicity, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Nuciferine, an active ingredient extracted from the natural lotus leaf, has been reported to be effective for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Per-Arnt-Sim kinase (PASK) is a nutrient responsive protein kinase that regulates lipid and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and gene expression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of nuciferine against NAFLD and its inhibitory effect on PASK, exploring the possible underlying mechanism of nuciferine-mediated inhibition on NAFLD. Relevant biochemical parameters (lipid accumulation, extent of oxidative stress and release of inflammation cytokines) in  (OA)-induced HepG2 cells that mimicked steatosis in vitro were measured and compared with the control. It was found that nuciferine and silenced-PASK (siRNA PASK) both inhibited triglyceride (TG) accumulation and was effective in decreasing fatty  (FFAs). The content of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased respectively by nuciferine and siRNA PASK without increase in glutathione (GSH). Malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased respectively by nuciferine and siRNA PASK. In addition, nuciferine decreased TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as the siRNA PASK group. IL-10 was increased by nuciferine and siRNA PASK respectively. Further investigation revealed that nuciferine and siRNA PASK could respectively regulate the expression of target genes involved in  and inflammation, suggesting that nuciferine may be a potential therapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Furthermore, the modulated effect of nuciferine on (OA)-induced HepG2 cells  and inflammation, which was accompanied with PASK inhibition, was also consistent with siRNA PASK, implying that PASK might play a role in nuciferine-mediated regulation on NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24577432>High /stearic fatty- desaturation index in cord plasma from infants of mothers with gestational diabetes.</a></h1><p>Enhanced fatty- desaturation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase enzyme-1 (SCD1) is associated with obesity.

Recently, ellagic  (EA) has drawn attention mainly due to its biological functionalities and a series of molecular targets. However, the molecular mechanism by which EA attenuates hepatic steatosis in individuals with undesirable hepatic genetic alterations remains rarely studied. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of EA in a hepatic steatosis mouse model featuring elevated expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its downstream modulators of  by hydrodynamic injection of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT). Hematoxylin and eosin staining, oil red O staining, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed for mechanistic investigations. Human hepatoma cell lines were used for mechanical validation in vitro. The results suggest that EA lightens the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes of AKT-injected mice and an -induced in vitro hepatic steatosis model. Mechanistically, EA administration decreases the expression of phospho-AKT (Thr308) and suppresses two effectors lying downstream of the AKT/mTORC1 pathway, ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and SREBP-1, in the AKT-injected mice. The consequence of the EA-mediated decrease of SREBP-1 is found to be a transcriptional and translational inhibition of fatty  synthase (FASN), accompanied by the downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Consistent with in vivo findings, EA efficiently represses the SREBP-1/FASN axis in vitro. Collectively, our study provides a novel mechanism whereby EA alleviates AKT-triggered hepatic de novo , indicating that EA might serve as a potential agent in the therapy of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD and/or steatosis-associated complications, especially in that characterized by activation of AKT/mTORC1 signaling in the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361524>Maslinic  protects against obesity-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice through regulation of the Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Maslinic  is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is distributed in the peel of olives.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular link between SHIP2 expression and metabolic dyslipidemia using overexpression or suppression of SHIP2 gene in HepG2 cells. The results showed that overexpression of the wild type SHIP2 gene (SHIP2-WT) led to a higher total lipid content (28%) compared to control, whereas overexpression of the dominant negative SHIP2 gene (SHIP2-DN) reduced total lipid content in oleate treated cells by 40%. Overexpression of SHIP2-WT also led to a significant increase in both secretion of apoB100 containing lipoproteins and de-novo , as demonstrated by an enhancement in secreted apoB100 and MTP expression, increased intra and extracellular triglyceride levels and enhanced expression of lipogenic genes such as SREBP1c, FAS and ACC. On the other hand, overexpression of the SHIP2-DN gene prevented oleate-induced de-novo  and secretion of apoB100 containing lipoproteins in HepG2 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that SHIP2 expression level is a key determinant of hepatic  and lipoprotein secretion, and its inhibition could be considered as a potential target for treatment of dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Steatohepatitis plays a critical role in the process resulting in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Puerarin is a herbal product widely used in Asia, and is believed to have therapeutic benefits for alleviating the symptoms of steatohepatitis. The present study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of puerarin in reducing lipid accumulation in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Hepatocytes were treated with OA with or without puerarin to observe lipid accumulation by Oil Red O staining. We also examined hepatic lipid contents (e.g., triacylglycerol and cholesterol) following treatment with puerarin. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to measure sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty  synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein and mRNA expression, respectively. Our results revealed that puerarin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation, and reduced the triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. Furthermore, puerarin decreased the expression levels of lipogenic enzymes, such as FAS and SREBPs, and increased the expression levels of PPARα, which are critical regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism through the AMPK signaling pathway. These results indicate that puerarin has the same ability to activate AMPK, and reduce SREBP-1 and FAS expression, thus inhibiting hepatic  and increasing hepatic antioxidant activity. We found that puerarin exerted a regulatory effect on lipid accumulation by decreasing  in hepatocytes. Therefore, puerarin extract may have therapeutic benefits in the treatment of fatty liver and lipid-related metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142454>Procyanidin B2 ameliorates free fatty acids-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state.</a></h1><p>Procyanidin B2, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, has been reported to exert multiple beneficial functions. However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating -related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic fatty acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of palmitic ,  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced liver steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Different pathogenic processes have been proposed, among them, an increase of bone marrow (BM) fat resulting from adipocyte accumulation. Marrow adipocytes are active BM residents that influence the microenvironment by releasing cytokines, adipokines, and free fatty acids (FA). We explored the impact of palmitate (Palm) and oleate on function and survival of BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) of osteonecrotic patients (ONMSC) and healthy volunteers. Moreover, we analyzed the FA profile of the serum and the BM supernatant fluid (BMSF). We demonstrated that exposure to the saturated FA Palm favored MSC differentiation through the adipogenic lineage at the expense of the osteoblastic phenotype. Moreover,  was intensified in ONMSC. The susceptibility to Palm toxicity was aggravated in ONMSC concomitantly with a greater activation of the proapoptotic extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Moreover, cellular mechanisms implicated in the protection against lipotoxicity, such as stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 expression, were dysregulated in ONMSC. Palm-induced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretion was also exacerbated in ONMSC. Our results established that, in the serum, the FA profiles were comparable in ON and healthy subjects. However, both the concentrations and the FA composition were modified in the BMSF of ON patients, highlighting a drastic change of the BM microenvironment in ON patients. Altogether, our work suggests that marrow adipocyte enlargement could affect the process of bone remodeling and, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of ON.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29141573>Liver Protective Effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Interaction between Its Chemical Composition and the Cell-signaling Pathways Involved in Protection.</a></h1><p>The liver is an organ susceptible to a multitude of injuries that causes liver damage, like steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), presents several protective effects on the liver, reducing hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrogenesis, preventing lipid peroxidation, among other effects. Due to its high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly  and phenolic compounds, such as hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein, EVOO is able to participate in the activation of different signaling pathways in the hepatocytes involved in the prevention of inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance, allowing the prevention or resolution of liver damage.

Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in  (OA) and palmitic  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed  by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced inflammation in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased lipid accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways.

Mice were fed a HFD, or a HFD supplemented with 0.01% (w/w) CA or 0.02% (w/w) CA, for a period of 12 weeks, after which changes in body weight, blood lipid profiles, and fatty  mechanism markers were evaluated. The 0.02% (w/w) CA diet resulted in a marked decline in steatosis grade, as well as in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index values, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IGTT) results, body weight gain, liver weight, and blood lipid levels (P < 0.05). The expression level of hepatic lipogenic genes, such as sterol regulating element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), liver-fatty  binding protein (L-FABP), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), and fatty  synthase (FAS), was significantly lower in mice fed 0.01% (w/w) CA and 0.02% (w/w) CA diets than that in the HFD group; on the other hand, the expression level of β-oxidation-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), was higher in mice fed a 0.02% (w/w) CA diet, than that in the HFD group (P < 0.05). In addition, the hepatic content of palmitic  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1), and  (C18:1) was significantly lower in mice fed the 0.02% (w/w) CA diet than that in the HFD group (P < 0.05).

They consist of a hydrophobic core of storage lipids, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with proteins attached. While some of these proteins are known to be essential for the regulation of cellular and organismic lipid metabolism, key questions concerning LD protein function, such as their targeting to LDs, are still unanswered. Intriguingly, some proteins are restricted to subsets of LDs by an as-yet-unknown mechanism. This finding makes LD targeting even more complex. Here, we characterize the  protein CG2254, which is targeted to subsets of LDs in cultured cells and in different larval  tissues, where the prevalence of subsets of LDs appears highly dynamic. We find that an amphipathic amino  stretch mediates CG2254 LD localization. Additionally, we identified a juxtaposed sequence stretch limiting CG2254 localization to a subset of LDs. This sequence is sufficient to restrict a chimeric protein consisting of the subset-targeting sequence introduced to an otherwise pan-LD-localized protein sequence to a subset of LDs. Based on its subcellular localization and annotated function, we suggest that CG2254 is renamed Lipid droplet subset dehydrogenase 1 (Ldsdh1).© 2017.

This study was conducted to examine the therapeutic effect of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a naturally occurring curcuminoid and a metabolite of curcumin, on  (OA)-induced steatosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. HepG2 cells were incubated with OA to induce steatosis, and then treated with various concentrations of THC. The results showed that THC treatment significantly decreased lipid accumulation in OA-treated HepG2 cells, possibly, by inhibiting the expression of the lipogenic proteins, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS), and fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Moreover, THC attenuated OA-induced hepatic lipogenesis in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, which was reversed by pretreatment with an AMPK inhibitor. THC promoted lipolysis and upregulated the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation. Glucose uptake and insulin signaling impaired in HepG2 cells incubated with OA were abated by THC treatment, including phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and downstream signaling pathways, forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which are involved in  and glycogen synthesis, respectively.

Here, we show miR-27a attenuated hepatic de novo lipogenesis and alleviated obesity-initiated NAFLD through inhibiting Fasn and Scd1 in liver. Hepatic levels of miR-27a were significantly augmented in HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Further studies demonstrated that miR-27a directly interacted with 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of hepatic Fasn and Scd1 mRNAs and reduced their expression levels in mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-27a robustly blocked sodium oleate-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes and reduced liver TG contents in mice via repressing hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of hepatic miR-27a impaired lipid contents of livers and attenuated NAFLD development through suppressing lipogenesis in HCD-fed and ob/ob mice. Together, our results reveal a critical role of miR-27a in lipid homeostasis of liver and pathogenesis of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527986>Energy and nitrogen partitioning in dairy cows at low or high metabolizable protein levels is affected differently by postrumen glucogenic and lipogenic substrates.</a></h1><p>This study tested the effects of energy from glucogenic (glucose; GG) or lipogenic (palm olein; LG) substrates at low (LMP) and high (HMP) metabolizable protein levels on whole-body energy and N partitioning of dairy cattle. Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are palmitic, , and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine energy and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross energy intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated energy retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk fat yield and milk energy output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable energy intake, increased milk fat yield and milk energy output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on energy retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable energy intake, and total milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields. Milk energy output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total energy retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted energy retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra energy intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The alterations in lipid and uric  production, glucose metabolism, oxidative status, and related genes and proteins were monitored. The cell model that featured metabolic disorders was established by treatment of 10 mM glucose and 15 mM fructose plus 1 mM CFA. Results showed that palmitic  mainly induced insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and triglyceride (TG) secretion, whereas  mainly contributed to intracellular TG.

Previous studies depict that Cr(III) plays important roles in maintaining normal glucose and lipid metabolism, whereas its effect on the hepatic lipid metabolism is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of Cr on hepatic steatosis induced by  (OA) in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. Hepatic steatosis model was co-administered with Cr. Indexes of lipid accumulation were determined and associated genes expression were analyzed. The data showed that OA could induce lipid accumulation and triglyceride (TG) content in SMMC-7721 cells, and significantly increase the expression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). This steatosis effect of OA was ameliorated by Cr. The TG accumulation and up-regulation of CD36 and DGAT2 genes followed steatosis induction were inhibited by Cr. After the treatment of Cr, excessive intracellular OA content was also attenuated. Furthermore, Cr still performed inhibitory effect of DGAT2 expression at the presence of DGAT2 agonist or inhibitor, which indicated that the inhibitory effect of Cr on  is associated with the downregulation of DGAT2 expression. These findings demonstrate that Cr alleviates hepatic steatosis via suppressing CD36 expression to prevent fatty  uptake, as well as suppressing DGAT2 expression to inhibit TG synthesis. It suggests that CD36 and DGAT2 might become the novel drug targets for their properties in hepatic steatosis. Most importantly, Cr may be a potential anti-steatosis candidate to offer protective effects against liver damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727036>Supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water to grazing lambs on tissue glycogen level and .</a></h1><p>Lambs ( = 18; 40.1 ± 7.4 kg BW) were used to assess supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water on growth, tissue glycogen levels, postmortem glycolysis, and .

Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS with water treatment and time (when appropriate) in the model. During the 28-d grazing period, ADG was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for CON or FRU. During the 2-d fasting period, BW shrink was lower ( < 0.05) for GLY compared with CON or FRU. Hot carcass weight was greater ( < 0.05) for GLY than for FRU. The interaction for glycogen content × postmortem time was significant ( = 0.003) in LM and semitendinosus (ST) muscles.

More recently, AnxA6 has also been linked to triglyceride storage in adipocytes. Here we investigated the potential role of AnxA6 in fatty  (FA) - induced lipid droplet (LD) formation in hepatocytes. AnxA6 was associated with LD from rat liver and HuH7 hepatocytes. In  (OA) -loaded HuH7 cells, substantial amounts of AnxA6 bound to LD in a Ca-independent manner. Remarkably, stable or transient AnxA6 overexpression in HuH7 cells led to elevated LD numbers/size and neutral lipid staining under control conditions as well as after OA loading compared to controls. In contrast, overexpression of AnxA1, AnxA2 and AnxA8 did not impact on OA-induced lipid accumulation. On the other hand, incubation of AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells or primary hepatocytes from AnxA6 KO-mice with OA led to reduced FA accumulation and LD numbers. Furthermore, morphological analysis of liver sections from A6-KO mice revealed significantly lower LD numbers compared to wildtype animals. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2α (cPLAα)-dependent LD formation was ineffective in AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells. We conclude that cPLAα-dependent pathways contribute to the novel regulatory role of hepatic AnxA6 in LD formation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatic mTOR activity and Insig2a were stimulated, while AKT2, sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were decreased by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in both DMSO and rapamycin treated diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Increment of hepatic  and decline of mTOR signaling induced by rapamycin were significantly reversed by RYGB in DIO mice. RYGB significantly improved high-fat diet- and rapamycin- induced hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo . Administration of adenovirus-mediated p70 ribosomal protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (Ad-S6K1) from tail vein improved hepatic steatosis. Infusion of Ad-S6K1 suppressed AKT2, SREBP1c, PPARγ, and -related genes while stimulating Insig2a in DIO mice. Ad-S6K1 decreased -induced lipid deposition in primary mouse hepatocytes. Our results suggest that mTOR-AKT2-Insig2 signaling pathway contributes to the improvement effect of RYGB on hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat diet.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The methanol content in crude glycerol (0.5%, w/v) did not show a significant effect on biomass production by strain KM281507. However, demethanolized crude glycerol significantly supported the production of biomass (8.64 ± 0.13 g/L), lipids (2.92 ± 0.03 g/L), β-carotene (15.76 ± 0.85 mg/L), and total carotenoids (33.67 ± 1.28 mg/L). The optimal conditions suggested by central composite design were crude glycerol concentration (55.04 g/L), initial pH of medium (pH 5.63) and cultivation temperature (24.01°C). Under these conditions, the production of biomass, lipids, β-carotene, and total carotenoids were elevated up to 8.83 ± 0.05, 4.00 ± 0.06 g/L, 27.41 ± 0.20, and 53.70 ± 0.48 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, an addition of olive oil (0.5 - 2.0%) dramatically increased the production of biomass (14.47 ± 0.15 g/L), lipids (6.40 ± 0.09 g/L), β-carotene (54.43 ± 0.95 mg/L), and total carotenoids (70.92 ± 0.51 mg/L). The  content in lipids was also increased to 75.1% (w/w) of total fatty acids, indicating a good potential to be an alternative biodiesel feedstock. Meanwhile, the β-carotene content in total carotenoids was increased to 76.7% (w/w). Hence, strain KM281507 could be a good potential source of renewable biodiesel feedstock and natural carotenoids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25008074>Activation of free fatty  receptor 1 improves hepatic steatosis through a p38-dependent pathway.</a></h1><p>Hepatic steatosis is highly correlated with insulin resistance and diabetes. Although, it has been demonstrated that activation of free fatty  receptor 1 (FFAR1) by agonists showed benefits for the improvement of diabetes, the effects of FFAR1 agonists on hepatic steatosis were unknown. In this study, a high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis animal model was utilized to evaluate the effects of an FFAR1 agonist, GW9508, on hepatic lipid accumulation, and HepG2 hepatoma cells were also used to clarify the possible mechanisms. Administration of GW9508 significantly decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation with decreased expressions of -related proteins in HFD mice. Knockdown of hepatic Ffar1 by lentiviral vectors containing short hairpin RNA targeted to Ffar1 diminished the effect of GW9508 in HFD mice. In addition, GW9508 decreased -induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by decreases in the expression of -related proteins. Moreover, GW9508 downregulated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) through a p38-dependent pathway, whereas knockdown of Ffar1 in HepG2 cells diminished the effect of GW9508 on the decrease in SREBP1. Considering all these results together, GW9508 exerts a therapeutic effect to improve hepatic steatosis through a p38-dependent pathway. Thus, investigation of chemicals that act on FFAR1 might be a new strategy for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.© 2014 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23731091>Mulberry anthocyanins inhibit  induced lipid accumulation by reduction of  and promotion of hepatic lipid clearance.</a></h1><p>Mulberry (Morus alba L.) has been considered to possess different benefits such as protecting liver; improving fever, urine excretion disorder, hypertension, and diabetic syndrome; and preventing cardiovascular diseases. Recently, mounting evidence has shown that mulberry anthocyanin extract (MAE) is beneficial to hyperlipidemia; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. The present study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of MAE on hepatocyte cultured with high fatty  and the underlying mechanisms. By using human hepatoma cell HepG2 as cell model, the results showed that MAE suppressed fatty  synthesis and enhanced fatty  oxidation, contributing to amelioration of lipid accumulation induced by  (OA). Moreover, MAE also inhibited acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) activities by stimulating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). MAE attenuated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and its target molecules, such as fatty  synthase (FAS). Similar results were also found in the expressions of enzymes involved in triglyceride and cholesterol biosyntheses including glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCoR), adipocyte-specific fatty  binding protein (A-FABP), and SREBP-2. In contrast, the lipolytic enzyme expressions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and carnitinepalmitol- transferase-1 (CPT1) were increased. This study suggests the hypolipidemic effects of MAE occur via phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of lipid biosynthesis and stimulation of lipolysis. Therefore, the mulberry anthocyanins may actively prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29792205>Distinct correlations between lipogenic gene expression and fatty  composition of subcutaneous fat among cattle breeds.</a></h1><p>The fatty  (FA) composition of adipose tissue influences the nutritional quality of meat products. The unsaturation level of FAs is determined by fatty  desaturases such as stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs), which are under control of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). Differences in SCD genotype may thus confer variations in lipid metabolism and FA content among cattle breeds. This study investigated correlations between FA composition and lipogenic gene expression levels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of beef cattle breeds of different gender from the Basque region of northern Spain. Pirenaica is the most important beef cattle breed in northern Spain, while Salers cattle and Holstein-Friesian cull cows are also an integral part of the regional beef supply.Pirenaica heifers showed higher monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and conjugated linoleic  (CLA) contents in subcutaneous adipose tissue than other breeds (P < 0.001). Alternatively, Salers bulls produced the highest  content, followed by Pirenaica heifers (P < 0.001). There was substantial variability in SCD gene expression among breeds, consistent with these differences in MUFA and CLA content. Correlations between SCD1 expression and most FA desaturation indexes (DIs) were positive in Salers (P < 0.05) and Pirenaica bulls, while, in general, SCD5 expression showed few significant correlations with DIs. There was a significant linear correlation between SCD1 and SRBEP1 in all breeds, suggesting strong regulation of SCD1 expression by SRBEP1. Pirenaica heifers showed a stronger correlation between SCD1 and SREBP1 than Pirenaica bulls. We also observed a opposite relationship between SCD1 and SCD5 expression levels and opposite associations of isoform expression levels with the ∆9 desaturation indexes.These results suggest that the relationships between FA composition and lipogenic gene expression are influenced by breed and sex. The opposite relationship between SCD isoforms suggests a compensatory regulation of total SCD activity, while opposite relationships between SCD isoforms and desaturation indexes, specially 9c-14:1 DI, previously reported as an indicator of SCD activity, may reflect distinct activities of SCD1 and SCD5 in regulation of FA content. These findings may be useful for beef/dairy breeding and feeding programs to supply nutritionally favorable products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430456>Pinolenic  ameliorates -induced  and oxidative stress via AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Pinolenic  (PLA), a natural compound isolated from pine nut oil, has been reported to exert bioactivity against lipid anabolism. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on  (OA)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by  in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce -related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression. However, pretreatment with compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) inhibited the effect of PLA on promoting the expression of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PPARα for lipolysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PLA possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells via upregulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which supported the development of new drug candidate against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Also, there were no treatment effects on mammary mRNA abundance for key lipogenic enzymes and proteins involved in the regulation of milk lipid synthesis. In contrast, there was a treatment effect on hepatic , with FO resulting in a decrease of ~50% in hepatic lipid content and a similar downregulation of lipogenic gene expression compared with the 2 control diets.

Here, the fatty  composition of the outer plasma membranes of cells differentiated into the osteogenic and adipogenic direction is studied with surface-sensitive time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). For data evaluation, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied. Human (bone-derived) mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) from an osteoporotic donor and a control donor are compared to reveal differences in the fatty  composition of the membranes. The chemical information is correlated to staining and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) results to provide insight into the gene expression of several differentiation markers on the RNA level. Adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs from a non-osteoporotic donor correlates with increased relative intensities of all fatty acids under investigation. After osteogenic differentiation of non-osteoporotic cells, the relative mass signal intensities of unsaturated fatty acids such as  and linoleic acids are increased. However, the osteoporotic cells show increased levels of palmitic  in the plasma membrane after exposure to osteogenic differentiation conditions, which correlates to an immature differentiation state relative to non-osteoporotic osteogenic cells. This immature differentiation state is confirmed by increased early osteogenic differentiation factor Runx2 on RNA level and by less calcium mineralization spots seen in von Kossa staining and ToF-SIMS images.

Fatty  oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects  is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of  enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to  was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage.

While saturated fatty acids are known to induce liver stress, the role of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), synthesized by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) family of enzymes, in regulation of liver function during lipogenic dietary conditions remains largely unknown. The major products of SCD-catalyzed reactions are oleate (18:1n-9) and palmitoleate (16:1n-7).We generated mouse models with restricted exogenous MUFA supply and reduced endogenous MUFA synthesis, in which SCD1 global knockout (GKO) or liver-specific knockout (LKO) mice were fed a lipogenic high-sucrose very low-fat (HSVLF) or high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. In a gain-of-function context, we introduced liver-specific expression of either human SCD5, which synthesizes 18:1n-9, or mouse Scd3, which synthesizes 16:1n-7, into SCD1 GKO mice and fed the HSVLF diet.Lipogenic high-carbohydrate diets induced hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation in SCD1 GKO and LKO mice. Dietary supplementation with 18:1n-9, but not 18:0, prevented the HSVLF diet-induced hepatic ER stress and inflammation in SCD1 LKO mice, while hepatic SCD5, but not Scd3, expression reduced the ER stress and inflammation in GKO mice. Additional experiments revealed liver-specific deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α reduced hepatic inflammatory and ER stress response gene expression in SCD1 LKO mice.Our results demonstrate an indispensable role of hepatic oleate in protection against lipogenic diet-induced hepatic injury, and PGC-1α potentiates the ER stress response under conditions of restricted dietary oleate coupled to reduced capacity of endogenous hepatic oleate synthesis.Susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. In this study we show that modulation of two genes regulates the liver response, including ER stress and inflammation, to a high-carbohydrate low-fat diet. We reveal that hepatic availability of oleate, a monounsaturated fatty , is important for maintenance of liver health.Copyright © 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Studies have indicated that abnormal fat metabolism, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance are positively correlated with peroxidation and abnormal cytokine production. Recent studies have revealed that Solanum nigrum extracts (SNE) possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, antihyperlipidemia, and liver protection abilities. Therefore, the present study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of an SNE on nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)-induced hepatitis. In vivo data demonstrated that the SNE reduced blood triglyceride, sugar, and cholesterol levels, as well as fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation in high-fat-diet-treated mice. The results indicated that the SNE downregulated the expression of fatty  synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and upregulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Furthermore, we prepared a Solanum nigrum polyphenol extract (SNPE) from the SNE; the SNPE reduced hepatic lipid () accumulation. Therefore, SNE have the potential to alleviate NAFL-induced hepatitis, and polyphenolic compounds are the main components of SNE.

Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) with or without supplementation with either 1% or 3% TA (w/w) for 12 weeks. Finally, the possibility of interacting p300 and TA was simulated.TA suppressed HAT activity both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TA abrogated occupancy of p300 on the sterol regulatory element in the fatty  synthase and ATP-citrate lyase promoters, eventually inducing hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H3K36. Furthermore, TA decreased acetylation at lysine residues 9 and 36 of histone H3 protein and that of total proteins. Consequently, TA decreased the mRNA expression of -related genes and attenuated lipid accumulation in vivo. We observed that NAFLD features, including body weight, liver mass, fat mass, and lipid profile in serum, were improved by TA supplementation in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility that TA directly binds to p300 through docking simulation between ligand and protein.Our findings demonstrate that TA, a novel HATi, has potential application for the prevention of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo  but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25304740>Polymorphisms in lipogenic genes and milk fatty  composition in Holstein dairy cattle.</a></h1><p>Changing bovine milk fatty  (FA) composition through selection can decrease saturated FA (SFA) consumption, improve human health and provide a means for manipulating processing properties of milk.

PA+OA co-treatment fully prevents PA lipotoxicity through mechanisms that are not well defined but which have been previously attributed to more efficient esterification and sequestration of PA into triglycerides (TGs) when OA is abundant. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested by experimentally modulating the relative partitioning of PA/OA between TGs and other lipid fates in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that addition of OA to PA-treated hepatocytes enhanced TG synthesis, reduced total PA uptake and PA lipid incorporation, decreased phospholipid saturation and rescued PA-induced ER stress and lipoapoptosis. Knockdown of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the rate-limiting step in TG synthesis, significantly reduced TG accumulation without impairing OA-mediated rescue of PA lipotoxicity. In both wild-type and DGAT-knockdown hepatocytes, OA co-treatment significantly reduced PA lipid incorporation and overall phospholipid saturation compared to PA-treated hepatocytes. These data indicate that OA's protective effects do not require increased conversion of PA into inert TGs, but instead may be due to OA's ability to compete against PA for cellular uptake and/or esterification and, thereby, normalize the composition of cellular lipids in the presence of a toxic PA load.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Intracellular lipid contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of  genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

We also found robust evidence that treatment with IF significantly depleted infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80 Kupffer cells and CD68 macrophages) and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity in IF-treated hepatic tissue correlated with down-regulation of TLR4 expression and NF-κB transcription.

Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of , the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated lipid accumulation in cultured human hepatocytes (HepG2) and rat liver after exposure to four different carbon-based particles. HepG2 cells were exposed to particles for 3h and subsequently incubated for another 18h to manifest lipid accumulation. In an animal model of metabolic syndrome we investigated the association between intake of carbon black (CB, 14nm) particles and hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and gene expression of Srebp-1, Fasn and Scd-1 involved in lipid synthesis. There was a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular lipid content after exposure to CB in HepG2 cells, which was only observed after co-exposure to /palmitic . Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells after exposure to diesel exhaust particles, fullerenes C60 or pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes. All four types of particles also generated oxidatively damaged DNA, assessed as formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) sensitive sites, in HepG2 cells after 3h exposure. The animal model of metabolic syndrome showed increased lipid load in the liver after one oral exposure to 6.4mg/kg of CB in lean Zucker rats. This was not associated with increased iNOS staining in the liver, indicating that the oral CB exposure was associated with hepatic steatosis rather than steatohepatitis. The lipid accumulation did not seem to be related to increased  because there were unaltered gene expression levels in both the HepG2 cells and rat livers. Collectively, exposure to particles is associated with oxidative stress and steatosis in hepatocytes.© 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, miR-1224-5p was highly expressed in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and in obese (ob/ob) mice. To examine the potential role of miR-1224-5p, we constructed liver-specific adenoviral vectors expressing either an miR-1224-5p inhibitor sequence or miR-1224-5p mimic sequences. After tail-vein vector injection, HFD-fed mice were examined for expression of lipogenic genes. We found that miR-1224-5p inhibitors significantly attenuated hepatic  and steatosis in HFD-fed mice, whereas miR-1224-5p mimicked promoted lipid accumulation in the liver of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that downregulation of miR-1224-5p in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes led to a reduction of cellular triglycerides after treatment with an  and palmitic  mixture. Importantly, this study also identified adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 as a direct target of miR-1224-5p. miR-1224-5p binding to the 3' untranslated region of AMPKα1 suppressed expression of the AMPKα1 protein and its downstream molecules. Metformin, an activator of AMPK, also inhibited hepatic expression of miR-1224-5p. Together, these findings indicate that miR-1224-5p promotes hepatic  by suppressing AMPKα1 expression and suggest that miR-1224-5p inhibitors warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic tools in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060692>Shifts in dietary carbohydrate-lipid exposure regulate expression of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated gene PNPLA3/adiponutrin in mouse liver and HepG2 human liver cells.</a></h1><p>Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3, adiponutrin) has been identified as a modifier of lipid metabolism. To better understand the physiological role of PNPLA3/adiponutrin, we have investigated its regulation in intact mice and human hepatocytes under various nutritional/metabolic conditions.PNPLA3 gene expression was determined by real-time PCR in liver of C57BL/6 mice after dietary treatments and in HepG2 cells exposed to various nutritional/metabolic stimuli. Intracellular lipid content was determined in HepG2 cells after siRNA-mediated knockdown of PNPLA3.In vivo, mice fed a high-carbohydrate (HC) liquid diet had elevated hepatic lipid content, and PNPLA3 mRNA and protein expression, compared to chow-fed mice. Elevated expression was completely abrogated by addition of unsaturated lipid emulsion to the HC diet. By contrast, in mice with high-fat diet-induced steatosis, Pnpla3 expression did not differ compared to low-fat fed mice. In HepG2 cells, Pnpla3 expression was reversibly suppressed by glucose depletion and increased by glucose refeeding, but unchanged by addition of insulin and glucagon. Several unsaturated fatty acids each significantly decreased Pnpla3 mRNA, similar to lipid emulsion in vivo. However, Pnpla3 knockdown in HepG2 cells did not alter total lipid content in high glucose- or -treated cells.Our results provide evidence that PNPLA3 expression is an early signal/signature of carbohydrate-induced , but its expression is not associated with steatosis per se. Under lipogenic conditions due to high-carbohydrate feeding, certain unsaturated fatty acids can effectively suppress both  and PNPLA3 expression, both in vivo and in a hepatocyte cell line.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are closely associated with hepatic lipid metabolism, they seem to play important roles in NAFLD. However, the effects of PPAR agonists on steatosis that is a common pathology associated with NAFLD, remain largely controversial. In this study, the effects of various PPAR agonists, i.e. fenofibrate, bezafibrate, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, muraglitazar and tesaglitazar on -induced steatotic HepaRG cells were investigated after a single 24-hour or 2-week repeat treatment. Lipid vesicles stained by Oil-Red O and triglycerides accumulation caused by  overload, were decreased, by up to 50%, while fatty  oxidation was induced after 2-week co-treatment with PPAR agonists. The greatest effects on reduction of steatosis were obtained with the dual PPARα/γ agonist muraglitazar. Such improvement of steatosis was associated with up-regulation of genes related to fatty  oxidation activity and down-regulation of many genes involved in . Moreover, modulation of expression of some nuclear receptor genes, such as FXR, LXRα and CAR, which are potent actors in the control of , was observed and might explain repression of de novo .Altogether, our in vitro data on steatotic HepaRG cells treated with PPAR agonists correlated well with clinical investigations, bringing a proof of concept that drug-induced reversal of steatosis in human can be evaluated in in vitro before conducting long-term and costly in vivo studies in animals and patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C-acetate label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo  in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
