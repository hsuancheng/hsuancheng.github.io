(figs) on antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antiobesogenic effects in vitro. Fruit, leaves, and stembark of the F. carica plant were sequentially extracted using organic and inorganic solvents and their total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were estimated. The effects of the extracts on antioxidative, antidiabetic (inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes), and antiobesogenic (antilipase) activities were measured using several experimental models. The fruit ethanolic extract contained a high quantity of polyphenols and flavonoids (104.67±5.51 μg/mL and 81.67±4.00 μg/mL) compared with all other extracts. The activity of the ethanolic extract of F. carica fruit was significantly (p<0.05) higher than all other extracts and parts of the plant in terms of antioxidative, antidiabetic, and antiobesogenic effects. The IC values of the fruit ethanolic extract in terms of antioxidative (134.44±18.43 μg/mL), and inhibition of α-glucosidase (255.57±36.46 μg/mL), α-amylase (315.89±3.83 μg/mL), and pancreatic lipase (230.475±9.65 μg/mL) activity indicate that the activity of fruit ethanolic extract is better than all other extracts of the plant. The gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the fruit ethanolic extract showed the presence of a number of bioactive compounds such as butyl butyrate, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, 1-butoxy-1-isobutoxy butane, malic acid, tetradecanoic acid, phytol , trans phytol, n-hexadecanoic acid, 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, stearic acid, sitosterol, 3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-2,3-dihydro-4H-pyran-4-one, and 2,4,5-trimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one. The results of this study suggest that the ethanolic extract of the fruit of F. carica may have potential antidiabetic and antiobesogenic agents.Copyright © 2017.

Here, heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp 90, adiponectin, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, Hsp32) are profiled in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from 25 T2DM patients and 25 healthy control subjects. Cells cultured with phorbol 12-myristate 13-/ionomycin were evaluated by three-color flow cytometry for immunophenotypic biomarkers. Plasma HO-1, Hsp, and adiponectin levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Relative to healthy controls, T2DM patients exhibited significantly elevated plasma Hsp70, and representation of T helper immunophenotypes activated to express inflammatory cytokines, including CD4+ IFN-γ+, CD4+ TNF-α+, CD4+ IL-6+, CD4+ IL-1β+ T cells, significantly lower representation of CD4+ IL-10+ T cells, plasma adiponectin and cell-associated HO-1 expression-with no significant differences in plasma Hsp90 between T2DM and healthy controls. Plasma HO-1 and adiponectin in T2DM patients inversely correlated with TNF-α and showed inverse correlation between serum LDL and plasma HO-1. Moreover, TNF-α and Hsp90 in T2DM patients correlated positively with fasting blood glucose (FBG). These results demonstrate correlation between potentially pathogenic T cells, HO-1, and adiponectin, additionally revealing a T helper (Th)1-related character of T2DM immunopathogenesis, suggesting potential for novel T cell-related management strategies for T2DM and related co-morbidities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577083>Metabolomic profiling of urinary changes in mice with monosodium glutamate-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity with related complications represents a widespread health problem. The etiopathogenesis of obesity is often studied using numerous rodent models. The mouse model of monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced obesity was exploited as a model of obesity combined with . The aim of this work was to characterize the metabolic status of MSG mice by NMR-based metabolomics in combination with relevant biochemical and hormonal parameters. NMR analysis of urine at 2, 6, and 9 months revealed altered metabolism of nicotinamide and polyamines, attenuated excretion of major urinary proteins, increased levels of phenylacetylglycine and allantoin, and decreased concentrations of methylamine in urine of MSG-treated mice. Altered levels of creatine, citrate, succinate, and  were observed at 2 months of age and approached the values of control mice with aging. The development of obesity and  in 6-month-old MSG mice was also accompanied by decreased mRNA expressions of adiponectin, lipogenetic and lipolytic enzymes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma in fat while mRNA expressions of lipogenetic enzymes in the liver were enhanced. At the age of 9 months, biochemical parameters of MSG mice were normalized to the values of the controls. This fact pointed to a limited predictive value of biochemical data up to age of 6 months as NMR metabolomics confirmed altered urine metabolic composition even at 9 months.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27286915>Antidiabetic activity of perylenequinonoid-rich extract from Shiraia bambusicola in KK-Ay mice with spontaneous type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Bitter and cold traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been long used to treat diabetes mellitus (DM) based on unique medical theory system since ancient China. As one of bitter and cold TCMs, the stromatas of Shiraia bambusicola have been used for the treatment of DM and exerted clinical effects to a certain extent. However, the corresponding active principles and antidiabetic mechanism of the TCM still remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the potential antidiabetic effect of the active Shiraia bambusicola EtOAc extract (SB-EtOAc) in vitro and in vivo, and elucidate its probable antidiabetic mechanism.A LC-PDA-ESIMS protocol was developed to determine the chemical principles of the active EtOAc extract rapidly and unambiguously. The effect of SB-EtOAc on the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation and glucose uptake in L6 cells was examined. SB-EtOAc was orally administration at the dose of 30, 60 and 120mg/kg/d in KK-Ay mice, for 21 days. Body weight, plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, fasted blood glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance test and  tolerance test, serum  and blood-lipid indexes were measured. GLUT4 on L6 cells membrane and phosphorylation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) expression in L6 cells were measured. The GLUT4 and p-AMPK expression in KK-Ay mice skeletal muscle were measured. Phosphorylation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) and p-AMPK were measured.In vitro, SB-EtOAc exhibited a strong effect of stimulation on GLUT4 translocation by 3.2 fold in L6 cells compared with basal group, however, the selective AMPK inhibitor compound C can completely inhibit the AMPK pathway and prevent the GLUT4 translocation caused by SB-EtOAc. The further western blotting experiments showed that SB-EtOAc can stimulate AMPK phosphorylation in L6 cells and improve the expression of GLUT4. In vivo, SB-EtOAc can improve the KK-Ay mice  resistant and oral glucose tolerance to a certain extent. And the body weight, blood glucose levels and the serum TC, TG, FFA, AST, ALT and LDL-C were significantly reduced and HDL-C were increased after 3 weeks treatment. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of the AMPK and ACC had been improved obviously and the levels of AMPK phosphorylation and GLUT4 had been also enhanced.In vitro, SB-EtOAc exhibited a strong effect of stimulation on GLUT4 translocation and improved significantly the glucose uptake. In vivo, SB-EtOAc significantly improved oral glucose tolerance and the  resistant as well as glucolipid metabolism. In this study, SB-EtOAc displayed promising positive antidiabetic activity in vitro and in vivo, partly by modulating AMPK-GLUT4 and AMPK-ACC signaling pathways.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Secondary metabolites with biological activities and pharmacological potential have been identified in species of the Baccharis genus that are specifically distributed in the Americas.This study evaluated the effects of methanol extracts from Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. Asteraceae on metabolic parameters, satiety, and growth in monosodium glutamate (MSG) induced-obesity model rats.MSG was administered to 32 newborn rats (4 mg/g of body weight) once daily for 5 consecutive days. Four experimental groups (control, control + extract, MSG, and MSG + extract) were treated for 30 consecutive days with 400 mg/kg of B. dracunculifolia extract by gavage. Biochemical parameters, antioxidant activity, total extract phenolic content (methanolic, ethanolic, and acetone extractions), and pancreatic islets were evaluated.High levels of phenolic compounds were identified in B. dracunculifolia extracts (methanol: 46.2 ± 0.4 mg GAE/L; : 70.5 ± 0.5 mg GAE/L; and ethanol: 30.3 ± 0.21 mg GAE/L); high antioxidant activity was detected in B. dracunculifolia ethanol and methanol extracts. The concentration of serum  increased 30% in obese animals treated with extract solutions (1.4-2.0 µU/mL, p < 0.05).  secretion in pancreatic islets was 8.3 mM glucose (58%, p < 0.05) and 16.7 mM (99.5%, p < 0.05) in rats in the MSG + extract and MSG groups, respectively.Treatment with B. dracunculifolia extracts protected pancreatic islets and prevented the irreversible cellular damage observed in animals in obesity and diabetes models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31212845>Effect of  var.  Extract on Neurodegeneration Improvement: Ameliorating Role in Cognitive Disorder Caused by High-Fat Diet Induced Obesity.</a></h2><p>This study was performed to estimate the possibility of using an ethyl  fraction from  var.  (EFAD) on metabolic syndrome that is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). It was demonstrated that EFAD suppresses lipid accumulation and improves  (IR) caused by Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in  experiments using the 3T3-L1 cell. In  tests, C57BL/6 mice were fed EFAD at 20 and 40 mg/kg body weight (BW) for four weeks after the mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity. EFAD significantly suppressed the elevation of BW and improved impaired glucose tolerance in obese mice. Additionally, this study showed that EFAD has an ameliorating effect on obesity-induced cognitive disorder with behavioral tests. The effect of EFAD on peripheral-IR improvement was confirmed by serum analysis and western blotting in peripheral tissues. Additionally, EFAD showed an ameliorating effect on HFD-induced oxidative stress, impaired cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are interrelated symptoms of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease and central nervous system (CNS)-IR in brain tissue. Furthermore, we confirmed that EFAD improves CNS-IR by confirming the IR-related factors in brain tissue. Consequently, this study suggests the possibility of using EFAD for the prevention of neurodegeneration by improving metabolic syndrome that is caused by HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25982919>Metabolic syndrome in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MS) has not yet been studied in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) men treated with novel hormonal therapies. The study aims to assess the impact of MS on outcome from time starting abiraterone.We retrospectively evaluated a consecutive series of metastatic CRPC patients treated with abiraterone after docetaxel failure. MS, as defined by modified Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria, was assessed at the time of initiation of abiraterone, during treatment and follow-up.Sixty-seven of 178 patients evaluated (37.6%) met MS criteria at baseline, before abiraterone initiation, whereas for 11 (9.9%) without MS before treatment with abiraterone this occurred during treatment. Median PFS was equal to 4.7 months for patients with MS versus 9 months for those without MS. Patients with MS had an increased risk of 71% of progression or death for all causes than patients without MS (HR = 1.7, 95% CI [1.2-2.4], P = 0.03). Median OS was 14.7 months and 22.3 months in patients with and without MS, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, MS resulted not significantly associated to OS (HR = 1.42, 95% CI [0.91-2.22], P = 0.073).The presence of MS is a significant risk factor for shorter PFS in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone, even if it does not show a significant impact on OS.

Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect metabolic syndrome-related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high  (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and  were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/browning markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved  sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic fatty acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed lipogenesis in liver. Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; B. animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and B. pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on liver and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27434092>Effects of Arabinoxylan and Resistant Starch on Intestinal Microbiota and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomised Crossover Study.</a></h2><p>Recently, the intestinal microbiota has been emphasised as an important contributor to the development of metabolic syndrome. Dietary fibre may exert beneficial effects through modulation of the intestinal microbiota and metabolic end products. We investigated the effects of a diet enriched with two different dietary fibres, arabinoxylan and resistant starch type 2, on the gut microbiome and faecal short-chain fatty acids. Nineteen adults with metabolic syndrome completed this randomised crossover study with two 4-week interventions of a diet enriched with arabinoxylan and resistant starch and a low-fibre Western-style diet. Faecal samples were collected before and at the end of the interventions for fermentative end-product analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene amplification for identification of bacterial taxa. Faecal carbohydrate residues were used to verify compliance. The diet enriched with arabinoxylan and resistant starch resulted in significant reductions in the total species diversity of the faecal-associated intestinal microbiota but also increased the heterogeneity of bacterial communities both between and within subjects. The proportion of Bifidobacterium was increased by arabinoxylan and resistant starch consumption (P<0.001), whereas the proportions of certain bacterial genera associated with dysbiotic intestinal communities were reduced. Furthermore, the total short-chain fatty acids (P<0.01),  (P<0.01) and butyrate concentrations (P<0.01) were higher by the end of the diet enriched with arabinoxylan and resistant starch compared with those resulting from the Western-style diet. The concentrations of isobutyrate (P = 0.05) and isovalerate (P = 0.03) decreased in response to the arabinoxylan and resistant starch enriched diet, indicating reduced protein fermentation. In conclusion, arabinoxylan and resistant starch intake changes the microbiome and short-chain fatty acid compositions, with potential beneficial effects on colonic health and metabolic syndrome.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29522176>Treatment Options for Hirsutism: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Several pharmacologic treatments for hirsutism are used in practice; however, their relative efficacy is unclear.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL through January 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up of at least 6 months that evaluated antiandrogens,  sensitizers, and oral contraceptives in women with hirsutism. Independent pairs of reviewers selected and appraised trials. Random-effects network meta-analysis was used to compare individual drugs and classes.We included 43 trials. Estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives pills (OCPs), antiandrogens, and  sensitizers were superior to placebo, with standardized mean reductions (95% confidence intervals) of -0.94 (-1.49 to -0.38), -1.29 (-1.80 to -0.79), and -0.62 (-1.00 to -0.23), respectively. Antiandrogen monotherapy, the combination of OCP and antiandrogen, the combination of OCPs and  sensitizer, and the combination of antiandrogen and  sensitizer were superior to  sensitizer monotherapy. The combination of OCPs and antiandrogen was superior to OCPs.

Medroxyprogesterone 17‑ (MPA) has been used in the treatment of EC for many years. However, the therapeutic effect of this agent on EC has not been satisfactory. 36 arMetformin was recently reported to be a promising agent for the treatment of malignant diseases including EC. However, information on the synergistic effect of the two agents in EC is limited. With the aim to evaluate the synergistic effect of metformin and MPA, we conducted the present study in vitro and in vivo. We found that the combined application of metformin and MPA significantly inhibited the proliferation of the Ishikawa cells and arrested the cells in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate of the Ishikawa cells was significantly increased. In the animal study, the development of the xenograft tumors was significantly suppressed by the combined application of the two agents. Further investigation revealed that the synergistic inhibitory effect of the two agents on EC can be at least partly, explained by the decreased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E.

We assessed whether exposure to repeat antenatal betamethasone increased risk factors for later cardiometabolic disease in children whose mothers participated in the Australasian Collaborative Trial of Repeat Doses of Corticosteroids.Women were randomized to betamethasone or placebo treatment, ≥ 7 days after an initial course of glucocorticoids, repeated each week that they remained at risk for preterm birth at <32 weeks' gestation. In this follow-up study, children were assessed at 6 to 8 years' corrected age for body composition,  sensitivity, ambulatory blood pressure, and renal function.Of 320 eligible childhood survivors, 258 were studied (81%; 123 repeat betamethasone group; 135 placebo [single course] group). Children exposed to repeat antenatal betamethasone and those exposed to placebo had similar total fat mass (geometric mean ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 1.23), minimal model  sensitivity (geometric mean ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.08), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (mean difference systolic 0 mm Hg, 95% CI -2 to 2; diastolic 0 mm Hg, 95% CI -1 to 1), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (mean difference 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -3.2 to 5.6).Exposure to repeat doses of antenatal betamethasone compared with a single course of glucocorticoids does not increase risk factors for cardiometabolic disease at early school age.Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25817096>Apelin inhibits the activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and the leucine-rich, repeat-containing family, pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and ameliorates  in severely burned rats.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia with  remains a challenging problem in severely burned patients. Recent studies indicated the involvement of the nucleotide-binding domain and the leucine-rich, repeat-containing family, pyrin-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in  and a beneficial role of apelin in . Our aim was to investigate whether apelin inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and ameliorates  in severely burned rats.Male Wistar rats were subjected to a full-thickness burn injury comprising 40% of the total body surface area and were randomized to receive apelin, N(G)-methyl-L-arginine  salt (L-NMMA), and apelin plus treatments with L-NMMA. The following outcome measurements were assessed: apelin/APJ mRNA expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscles, plasma apelin level, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in WAT, Interleukin-1 β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in plasma, , survival rates, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in soleus muscles.Severe burn induced a decreased expression of apelin/APJ mRNA in soleus muscles and a decrease in plasma apelin levels. Burn injury with apelin treatment restored plasma apelin level, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activity in WAT, and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels in plasma. Rats treated with apelin also showed improved  sensitivity and decreased mortality, accompanied by a remarkable induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation in soleus muscle. Furthermore, the aforementioned effects of apelin were inhibited in part by treatment with L-NMMA.Apelin inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, attenuates systemic inflammatory response, ameliorates , and promotes survival after severe burn, in part through an endothelial nitric oxide synthase-dependent pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate in high fat diet-induced obese male rats the effects of GbE supplementation for 2 weeks on adipocyte volume and adipose tissue lipid accumulation. GbE supplementation was effective in reducing energy intake in obese rats compared to the saline-treated placebo group.

Samples of ruminal digesta, biopsies of ruminal epithelium, and blood were obtained during -14 through 28d in milk (DIM). A total of 35 genes associated with metabolism, transport, inflammation, and signaling were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Among metabolic-related genes, expression of HMGCS2 increased gradually from -14 to a peak at 28 DIM, underscoring its central role in epithelial ketogenesis. The decrease of glucose and the increase of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in the blood after calving confirmed the state of negative energy balance. Similarly, increases in bilirubin and decreases in albumin concentrations after calving were indicative of alterations in liver function and inflammation. Despite those systemic signs, lower postpartal expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD45, and NFKB1 indicated the absence of inflammation within the epithelium. Alternatively, these could reflect an adaptation to react against inducers of the immune system arising in the rumen (e.g., bacterial endotoxins). The downregulation of RXRA, INSR, and RPS6KB1 between -14 and 10 DIM indicated a possible increase in . However, the upregulation of IRS1 during the same time frame could serve to restore sensitivity to  of the epithelium as a way to preserve its proliferative capacity. The upregulation of TGFB1 from -14 and 10 DIM coupled with upregulation of both EGFR and EREG from 10 to 28 DIM indicated the existence of 2 waves of epithelial proliferation. However, the downregulation of TGFBR1 from -14 through 28 DIM indicated some degree of cell proliferation arrest. The downregulation of OCLN and TJP1 from -14 to 10 DIM indicated a loss of tight-junction integrity. The gradual upregulation of membrane transporters MCT1 and UTB to peak levels at 28 DIM reflected the higher intake and fermentability of the lactation diet. In addition, those changes in the diet after calving resulted in an increase of butyrate and a decrease of ruminal pH and , which partly explain the increase of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Prevotella bryantii, and Megasphaera elsdenii and the decrease of fibrolytic bacteria (Fibrobacter succinogenes, Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus). Overall, these multitier changes revealed important features associated with the transition into lactation. Alterations in ruminal epithelium gene expression could be driven by nutrient intake-induced changes in microbes; microbial metabolism; and the systemic metabolic, hormonal, and immune changes. Understanding causes and mechanisms driving the interaction among ruminal bacteria and host immunometabolic responses merits further study.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

In this context, cell culture models provide a level of abstraction that aid in our understanding of cellular physiology. Here we describe the development of an in vitro myotube contraction system that provides this protective effect, and which we have harnessed to investigate lipid-induced . C2C12 myocytes were differentiated into contractile myotubes. A custom manufactured platinum electrode system and pulse stimulator, with polarity switching, provided an electrical pulse stimulus (EPS) (1 Hz, 6-ms pulse width, 1.5 V/mm, 16 h). Contractility was assessed by optical flow flied spot noise mapping and inhibited by application of ammonium . Following EPS, myotubes were challenged with 0.5 mM palmitate for 4 h. Cells were then treated with or without  for glucose uptake (30 min), secondary  signaling activation (10 min), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-α (PI3Kα) activity (5 min). Prolonged EPS increased non--stimulated glucose uptake (83%,  = 0.002), Akt (Thr308) phosphorylation ( = 0.005), and  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated PI3Kα activity ( = 0.048). Palmitate reduced -specific action on glucose uptake (-49%,  < 0.001) and inhibited -stimulated Akt phosphorylation ( = 0.049) and whole cell PI3Kα activity ( = 0.009). The inhibitory effects of palmitate were completely absent with EPS pretreatment at the levels of glucose uptake,  responsiveness, Akt phosphorylation, and whole cell PI3Kα activity. This model suggests that muscle contraction alone is a sufficient stimulus to protect against lipid-induced  as evidenced by changes in the proximal canonical -signaling pathway.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26163429>Postmenopausal hormone therapy, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and brain volumes.</a></h2><p>To examine whether the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) on brain volumes in women aged 65-79 years differs depending on type 2 diabetes status during postintervention follow-up of a randomized controlled clinical trial.The Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials assigned women to HT (0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogens with or without 2.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone ) or placebo for an average of 5.6 years. A total of 1,402 trial participants underwent brain MRI 2.4 years after the trials; these were repeated in 699 women 4.7 years later. General linear models were used to assess the interaction between diabetes status and HT assignment on brain volumes.Women with diabetes at baseline or during follow-up who had been assigned to HT compared to placebo had mean decrement in total brain volume of -18.6 mL (95% confidence interval [CI] -29.6, -7.6). For women without diabetes, this mean decrement was -0.4 (95% CI -3.8, 3.0) (interaction p=0.002). This interaction was evident for total gray matter (p<0.001) and hippocampal (p=0.006) volumes. It was not evident for changes in brain volumes over follow-up or for ischemic lesion volumes and was not influenced by diabetes duration or oral medications.For women aged 65 years or older who are at increased risk for brain atrophy due to type 2 diabetes, prescription of postmenopausal HT is associated with lower gray matter (total and hippocampal) volumes.

PKCs are involved in innumerable neuronal processes including differentiation, apoptosis, survival, maintaining synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and memory formation. In the present study, we made an attempt to elucidate the role of PKC, if any, in regulating  signalling and  in Neuro-2a (N2a) cells in vitro. We show that phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) -activated PKC inhibited Akt activation in neuronal cell, N2a. In the process of inhibiting Akt, PMA-activated PKC decreased downstream  signalling proteins like Akt substrate 160 kDa (AS160) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β), followed by a decrease of glucose uptake in N2a cells. PKC activation caused  in N2a cells and worsened the resistant state of already -resistant cells.

Three candidate probiotic strains, Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4270 (LC), L. rhamnosus I-3690 (LR) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis I-2494 (BA), were individually administered to HFD-fed mice (10(8) cells day(-1)) for 12 weeks. Each strain attenuated weight gain and macrophage infiltration into epididymal adipose tissue and markedly improved glucose- homeostasis and hepatic steatosis. Weighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed that the probiotic strains shifted the overall structure of the HFD-disrupted gut microbiota toward that of lean mice fed a normal (chow) diet. Redundancy analysis revealed that abundances of 83 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were altered by probiotics. Forty-nine altered OTUs were significantly correlated with one or more host MS parameters and were designated 'functionally relevant phylotypes'. Thirteen of the 15 functionally relevant OTUs that were negatively correlated with MS phenotypes were promoted, and 26 of the 34 functionally relevant OTUs that were positively correlated with MS were reduced by at least one of the probiotics, but each strain changed a distinct set of functionally relevant OTUs. LC and LR increased cecal  but did not affect circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; in contrast, BA did not increase  but significantly decreased adipose and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α gene expression.

The studies had a similar goal, i.e., to characterize mitochondrial oxidative function. These efforts could have a direct impact on our ability to understand metabolic abnormalities that affect the pathophysiology of fatty liver and allow us to examine mechanisms surrounding potential therapeutic interventions. Briefly, one method couples the continuous infusion of [(13)C] with direct real-time measurements of [(13)C]glutamate labeling in liver; the other method administers [(13)C]propionate, in combination with other tracers, and subsequently measures the (13)C labeling of plasma glucose and/or acetaminophen-glucuronide. It appears that a controversy has arisen, since the respective methods yielded different estimates of the anaplerotic/TCA flux ratio (VANA:VTCA) in "control" subjects, i.e., the [(13)C]- and [(13)C]propionate-derived VANA:VTCA flux ratios appear to be ∼1.4 and ∼5, respectively. While the deep expertise in the respective groups makes it somewhat trivial for each to perform the tracer studies, the data interpretation is inherently difficult. The current perspective was undertaken to examine potential factors that could account for or contribute to the apparent differences. Attention was directed toward 1) matters of practicality, 2) issues surrounding stoichiometry, and 3) hidden assumptions. We believe that the [(13)C] method has certain weaknesses that limit its utility; in contrast, the [(13)C]propionate method likely yields a more correct answer. We hope our discussion will help clarify the differences in the recent reports.

Exercise is a first-line means to treat obesity and its complications. While diet-induced obesity alters mitochondrial function and induces  (IR), no data exist as to whether supplementation with vitamin E and vitamin C modify responses to exercise in pre-existing obesity. We tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with vitamin E (0.4 g α-tocopherol /kg) and vitamin C (0.5 g/kg) blocks exercise-induced improvements on IR and mitochondrial content in obese rats maintained on a high-fat (45% fat energy (en)) diet. Diet-induced obese, sedentary rats had a 2-fold higher homeostasis model assessment of  and larger  area under the curve following glucose tolerances test than rats fed a low-fat (10% fat en) diet. Exercising (12 weeks at 5 times per week in a motorized wheel) of obese rats normalized IR indices, an effect not modified by vitamin E and vitamin C. Vitamin E and vitamin C supplementation with exercise elevated mtDNA content in adipose and skeletal muscle to a greater extent (20%) than exercise alone in a depot-specific manner. On the other hand, vitamin C and vitamin E decreased exercise-induced increases in mitochondrial protein content for complex I (40%) and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (35%) in a muscle-dependent manner.

Monocytes/macrophages are critical in the development of metabolic syndrome, including gout, obesity and atherosclerosis. However, how high uric acid (HUA) exposure affects monocyte/macrophage function remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of HUA exposure in monocytes/macrophages and its impact on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced foam-cell formation in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1.We primed THP-1 cells with phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) for differentiation, then exposed cells to HUA and detected the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and analyzed the level of phospho-AMPKα. THP-1 cells were pre-incubated with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, or HUA before PMA, to assess CD68 expression and phospho-AMPKα level. PMA-primed THP-1 cells were pre-treated with oxLDL before Compound C and HUA treatment. Western blot analysis was used to examine the levels of phospho-AMPKα, CD68, ABCG1, ABCA1, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and NF-κB (p65). Flow cytometry was used to assess ROS production and CD68 expression in live cells. Oil-red O staining was used to observe oxLDL uptake in cells.HUA treatment increased ROS production in PMA-primed THP-1 cells; NAC blocked HUA-induced oxidative stress. HUA treatment time-dependently increased phospho-AMPKα level in PMA-primed THP-1 cells. The HUA-induced oxidative stress increased phospho-AMPKα levels, which was blocked by NAC. HUA treatment impaired CD68 expression during cell differentiation by activating the AMPK pathway, which was reversed by Compound C treatment. Finally, HUA treatment inhibited oxLDL uptake in the formation of foam cells in THP-1 cells, which was blocked by Compound C treatment. HUA treatment significantly increased the expression of ABCG1 and reversed the oxLDL-reduced ABCG1 expression but did not affect the expression of ABCA1, NF-κB (p65) or COX-2.HUA exposure activated the ROS-AMPK pathway, impaired CD68 expression, and inhibited oxLDL-induced foam-cell formation in a human monocytic cell line, THP-1.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

In this meta-analysis the effects of the different durations (from 3months to 1year) of OC treatment using cyproterone  (CA) or third generation progestins on metabolic profile of patients with PCOS were assessed.PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect databases (2001-2015) were searched to identify clinical trials investigating the effects of OC containing CA or third generation progestins on metabolic profiles of women with PCOS. Both fixed and random effect models were used. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the progestin compounds used and on duration of treatment.Oral contraceptive (OC) use was found to be associated with a worsening in lipid profiles but no changes were observed in other metabolic outcomes, including body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting , homeostatic model for measuring  (HOMA-IR) and in blood pressure (BP) values. All studied OCs showed similar effects on lipid profiles but with different timings, with products containing CA, requiring 6months to raise high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and 12months to increase triglycerides (TG). On the contrary, products containing drospirenone (DRSP) or desogestrel (DSG) increased HDL-C after only 3months but determined elevations of TG after 6months. All OCs induced an increase in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 12months of use.The study shows that, in women with PCOS, OC use is associated with significant changes in lipid profiles, including elevation not only in HDL-C but also in TG and LDL-C. All OCs studied showed similar effects but with different timings, with products containing CA generally requiring more prolonged use to increase serum lipids.

In the combination group, no negative effect on TG and TC was seen, other lipid fractions improved, as well as BMI, % body fat, and all parameters for glucose metabolism like fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting , HOMA- index, and  sensitivity index (ISI), whereby the beneficial effect of metformin got significance compared with Diane-35 for BMI, FPG, and ISI.With the exception of increasing triglycerides, Diane-35 had no relevant negative effects in the metabolic system. It does not negatively impact the beneficial effects of metformin in lipids and glucose metabolism.

(PA) in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells and HepG2-GFP-CYP2E1 (E47) cells and in a pre-diabetic rat model, as well as to identify the active chemical constituents. The in vitro results showed that PA has a strong anti-diabetic capacity to relieve oxidative stress and inhibit α-glucosidase activity. Mechanistic analysis also showed that ethyl  extracts of aerial parts and fruit of PA (PAG-EA and PAF-EA) enhanced glucose transporter 4 expression and function as well as enhanced  sensitivity by inhibiting the expression of cytochrome P450-2E1 (CYP2E1) mRNA and protein. In vivo, PAG-EA and PAF-EA significantly decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose and fasting , as well as total cholesterol and triglyceride, in the pre-diabetic rats. The results from  sensitivity index and homeostasis model assessment- index along with an oral glucose tolerance test also showed that PAG-EA and PAF-EA could significantly enhance the  sensitivity, which confirmed the in vitro findings. Moreover, HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis identified flavonoids, physalins and phenolic acids as the main plant constituents. Our findings support the ethnopharmacological use of PA fruit, along with its aerial parts, as a strong anti-diabetic agent. The EA fraction, especially the constituent polyphenols and flavonoids, may have a good potential to treat diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The rats were divided into normal control, diabetic control (DC), standard, sham, and test groups. The test groups were treated with an oral dose of 200, 400, and 600 mg/kg of crude, aqueous, and ethyl  partition of S. persica extract. After 21 days of experiment, the fasting blood glucose (FBS), LPs, lipid peroxidation, IS, liver enzymes levels, liver histopathology, and body weight alteration were evaluated. A significant decrease in FBS and lipid profile (except HDL) were observed in rats treated with various dose of extract compared with the DC rats ( P < 0.05). Treating diabetic rats with various extracts of S. persica meaningfully decreased the level of malondialdehyde ( P < 0.05). Animals treated with various dose of aqueous extract showed better results ( P < 0.01). On the basis of used indirect indexes to determine IS, all partitions of extracts showed anti- effects in diabetic rats. On the basis of our statistical analyzing, treating diabetic rats with all of the three extracts of S. persica decreased the elevated levels of alanine phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine transferase. Also, pathological changes in the liver tissue were reduced following treatment with the S. persica. In conclusion, our results give evidence that the S. persica extract, especially aqueous partition, has a healing effect on diabetes and can be considered as an alternative therapy for this disease.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654312>Clinical, hormonal and metabolic parameters in women with PCOS with different combined oral contraceptives (containing chlormadinone  versus drospirenone).</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 5-10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by chronic anovulation leading to menstrual disorders, and increased infertility. The syndrome can also manifest as hirsutism and acne.The aim of the study was to compare, over a duration of 6 months, the effects of drospirenone (DRSP) versus chlormadinone  (CMA) containing oral contraceptives (OCs) on clinical, hormonal, and metabolic parameters in 120 PCOS women.120 women with the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam 2003 criteria were recruited to the study. All patients were divided to two treatment groups of OCs, containing: 3 mg DRSP/30 mcg EE (ethinylestradiol) (60 patients) and 2 mg CMA/30 mcg EE (60 patients). Clinical parameters such as hirsutismus and acne were evaluated. Metabolic parameters such as serum , glucose concentration, homeostatic model assessment of , body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also measured. Among hormonal parameters, serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxine were measured.The use of both DRSP- or CMA-containing OCs provided similar positive therapeutic effects with regard to clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Among clinical parameters, like hirsutismus, after 6 months of continuous OC treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed in both groups: DRSP (p <  0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant improvement was showed according to acne lesions both after DRSP (p < 0.0001) and CMA treatments (p < 0.0001). Among glucose,  levels and HOMA-IR, there were statistically significant higher levels in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.05) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.02, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Hormonal parameters such as LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone and DHEA-S were statistically significant lower in both groups after DRSP (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0,002, and p < 0.0001) and CMA OC treatment (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.0001).Further research, however, is needed not only to define optimal duration, and to clarify the effects of treatment on long-term metabolic outcomes, but also to explore different treatment options and possible combined therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29065451>Inhibitory Effects of Siegesbeckia orientalis Extracts on Advanced Glycation End Product Formation and Key Enzymes Related to Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome typically includes Type 2 diabetes associated with hyperglycemia, central obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It is highly related to oxidative stress, formation of advanced glycated end products (AGEs) and key enzymes, such as carbohydrate digesting enzymes like pancreatic α-amylase and intestinal α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). This study used an in vitro approach to assess the potential of four extracts of  linne on key enzymes relevant to metabolic syndrome. In this research,  was firstly extracted by ethanol. The ethanol extract (SE) was then partitioned sequentially with hexane, ethyl  and methanol, and these extracts were named SE-Hex, SE-EA and SE-MeOH, respectively. The experimental results showed that SE-EA had the highest total phenolic content (TPC, 76.9 ± 1.8 mg/g) and the total flavonoids content (TFC, 5.3 ± 0.3 mg/g). This extract exhibited the most significant antioxidant activities, including DPPH radical-scavenging capacity (IC = 161.8 ± 2.4 μg/mL), ABTS radical-scavenging capacity (IC = 13.9 ± 1.5 μg/mL) and reducing power. For anti-glycation activities, SE-EA showed the best results in the inhibition of AGEs, as well as inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase (IC = 362.3 ± 9.2 μg/mL) and α-amylase (IC = 119.0 ± 17.7 μg/mL). For anti-obesity activities, SE-EA indicated the highest suppression effect on pancreatic lipase (IC = 3.67 ± 0.52 mg/mL). Finally, for anti-hypertension activity, SE-EA also demonstrated the strongest inhibitory activity on ACE (IC = 626.6 ± 15.0 μg/mL). Close relationships were observed among the parameters of TPC, antioxidant activities, inhibitory activities on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase and ACE (R > 0.9). Moderate correlations were found among the parameters of TFC, antioxidant activities, and suppression of dicarbonyl compounds formation (R = 0.5-0.9). Taken together these in vitro studies reveal the therapeutic potential of SE-EA extract in the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26378573>Green and Black Cardamom in a Diet-Induced Rat Model of Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Both black (B) and green (G) cardamom are used as flavours during food preparation. This study investigated the responses to B and G in a diet-induced rat model of human metabolic syndrome. Male Wistar rats were fed either a corn starch-rich diet (C) or a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet with increased simple sugars along with saturated and trans fats (H) for 16 weeks. H rats showed signs of metabolic syndrome leading to visceral obesity with hypertension, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular remodelling and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Food was supplemented with 3% dried B or G for the final eight weeks only. The major volatile components were the closely related terpenes, 1,8-cineole in B and α-terpinyl  in G. HB (high-carbohydrate, high-fat + black cardamom) rats showed marked reversal of diet-induced changes, with decreased visceral adiposity, total body fat mass, systolic blood pressure and plasma triglycerides, and structure and function of the heart and liver. In contrast, HG (high-carbohydrate, high-fat + green cardamom) rats increased visceral adiposity and total body fat mass, and increased heart and liver damage, without consistent improvement in the signs of metabolic syndrome. These results suggest that black cardamom is more effective in reversing the signs of metabolic syndrome than green cardamom.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30018269>High-Resolution PTP1B Inhibition Profiling Combined with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR for Identification of PTP1B Inhibitors from .</a></h2><p>Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an intracellular enzyme responsible for deactivation of the  receptor, and consequently acts as a negative regulator of  signal transduction.

We investigated short- and long-term effects of dietary Ac and Pr supplementation on diet-induced obesity and hepatic lipid metabolism.C3H/HeOuJ mice received high-fat (HF) diets supplemented with 5% SCFA in different Ac:Pr ratios, a high  (HF-HAc; 2.5:1 Ac:Pr) or high Pr ratio (HF-HPr; 1:2.5 Ac:Pr) for 6 or 22 weeks. Control diets (low-fat (LF), HF) contained no SCFA. SCFA did not affect body composition but reduced hepatic gene and protein expression of lipogenic enzymes leading to a reduced hepatic triglyceride concentration after 22 weeks in HF-HPr mice. Analysis of long-chain fatty acid composition (liver and plasma phospholipids) showed that supplementation of both ratios led to a lower ω6:ω3 ratio. Pr directly led to increased odd-chain fatty acid (C15:0, C17:0) formation as confirmed in vitro using HepG2 cells. Remarkably, plasma C15:0 was correlated with the attenuation of HF diet-induced .Dependent on the Ac:Pr ratio, especially odd-chain fatty acid formation and  sensitivity are differentially affected, indicating the importance of Pr.© 2016 The Authors.

Vitamin A status was evaluated before surgery (T0), and 30 (T30), 180 (T180), and 365 (T365) days after surgery, applying biochemical and functional indicators. Anthropometric measures, lipid profile, glycemia, and basal  also were assessed. No patients were lost during follow-up.Before surgery, 26.6% of the sample group experienced vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Serum retinol levels dropped significantly 30 days after surgery and then returned to basal levels. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of β-carotene deficiency and night blindness throughout the postsurgery period. A significant reduction in blood glucose, , lipid profile, and anthropometric parameters was observed.The finding that oral daily supplementation with 5000 IU retinol  failed to reverse VAD and night blindness after RYGB is highly significant.

The aims of this study were to characterize the effects of antenatal exposure to glucocorticoids on glucose handling and the role of adipose tissue. Pregnant sheep received betamethasone (Beta, 0.17 mg/kg) or vehicle 24 h apart at 80 days of gestation and allowed to deliver at term. At 9 mo, male and female offspring were fed at either 100% of nutritional allowance (lean) or ad libitum for 3 mo (obese). At 1 yr, they were chronically instrumented under general anesthesia. Glucose tolerance was evaluated using a bolus of glucose (0.25 g/kg). Adipose tissue was harvested after death to determine mRNA expression levels of angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 1, ACE2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ). Data are expressed as means ± SE and analyzed by ANOVA. Sex, obesity, and Beta exposure had significant effects on glucose tolerance and mRNA expression. Beta impaired glucose tolerance in lean females but not males. Superimposed obesity worsened the impairment in females and unmasked the defect in males. Beta increased ACE1 mRNA in females and males and AGT in females only ( < 0.05 by three-way ANOVA). Obesity increased AGT in females but had no effect on ACE1 in either males or females. PPAR-γ mRNA exhibited a significant sex ( = 42.8;  < 0.01) and obesity ( = 6.9;  < 0.05) effect and was significantly higher in males ( < 0.01 by three-way ANOVA).

As glycogen synthase (GS) is a key enzyme involved in the synthetic process, it presents a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we identified a novel, potent and orally available GS activator AJS1669 {sodium 2-[[5-[[4-(4,5-difluoro-2-methylsulfanyl-phenyl)phenoxy] methyl]furan-2-carbonyl]-(2-furylmethyl)amino] }. In vitro, we performed a glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) activation assay for screening GS activators and identified that the activity of AJS1669 was further potentiated in the presence of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). In vivo, we used ob/ob mice to evaluate the novel anti-diabetic effects of AJS1669 by measuring basal blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance and body fat mass index. Repeated administration of AJS1669 over 4 weeks reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in ob/ob mice. AJS1669 also improved glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased body fat mass. The mRNA levels of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis were elevated in skeletal muscle tissue following AJS1669 treatment. Hepatic tissue of treated mice also exhibited elevated expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation. In contrast to ob/ob mice, in C57Bl/6 mice AJS1669 administration did not alter body weight or reduce glucose levels.

FFAs play a significant role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by activating specific G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) in pancreatic β cells, immune cells, white adipose tissue, intestine and several other tissues. Free Fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) also known as GPR43 belongs to this group of GPCRs and has been shown to participate in a number of important biological activities. FFAR2 is activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as , propionate and butyrate. SCFAs are formed in the distal gut by bacterial fermentation of macro-fibrous material that escapes digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and enters the colon and have been shown to play vital role in the immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis. FFAR2 and other free fatty acid receptors are considered key components of the body's nutrient sensing mechanism and targeting these receptors is assumed to offer novel therapies for the management of diabetes and other metabolic disorders.

Our findings suggest that the proportion of CD16 monocytes in peripheral blood might be related to the inflammatory condition of PCOS.© 2019 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26075576>An -Specific GPCR, FFAR2, Regulates  Secretion.</a></h2><p>G protein-coupled receptors have been well described to contribute to the regulation of glucose-stimulated  secretion (GSIS). The short-chain fatty acid-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), is expressed in pancreatic β-cells, and in rodents, its expression is altered during . Thus, we explored the role of FFAR2 in regulating GSIS. First, assessing the phenotype of wild-type and Ffar2(-/-) mice in vivo, we observed no differences with regard to glucose homeostasis on normal or high-fat diet, with a marginally significant defect in  secretion in Ffar2(-/-) mice during hyperglycemic clamps. In ex vivo  secretion studies, we observed diminished GSIS from Ffar2(-/-) islets relative to wild-type islets under high-glucose conditions. Further, in the presence of , the primary endogenous ligand for FFAR2, we observed FFAR2-dependent potentiation of GSIS, whereas FFAR2-specific agonists resulted in either potentiation or inhibition of GSIS, which we found to result from selective signaling through either Gαq/11 or Gαi/o, respectively. Lastly, in ex vivo  secretion studies of human islets, we observed that  and FFAR2 agonists elicited different signaling properties at human FFAR2 than at mouse FFAR2. Taken together, our studies reveal that FFAR2 signaling occurs by divergent G protein pathways that can selectively potentiate or inhibit GSIS in mouse islets. Further, we have identified important differences in the response of mouse and human FFAR2 to selective agonists, and we suggest that these differences warrant consideration in the continued investigation of FFAR2 as a novel type 2 diabetes target.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098126>The effects of dietary supplementation with inulin and inulin-propionate ester on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate, produced through fermentation of dietary fibre by the gut microbiota, has been shown to alter hepatic metabolic processes that reduce lipid storage. We aimed to investigate the impact of raising colonic propionate production on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eighteen adults were randomized to receive 20 g/d of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to deliver propionate to the colon, or an inulin control for 42 days in a parallel design. The change in intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) following the supplementation period was not different between the groups (P = 0.082), however, IHCL significantly increased within the inulin-control group (20.9% ± 2.9% to 26.8% ± 3.9%; P = 0.012; n = 9), which was not observed within the IPE group (22.6% ± 6.9% to 23.5% ± 6.8%; P = 0.635; n = 9). The predominant SCFA from colonic fermentation of inulin is , which, in a background of NAFLD and a hepatic metabolic profile that promotes fat accretion, may provide surplus lipogenic substrate to the liver. The increased colonic delivery of propionate from IPE appears to attenuate this -mediated increase in IHCL.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28292969>Exercise Increases Human Skeletal Muscle  Sensitivity via Coordinated Increases in Microvascular Perfusion and Molecular Signaling.</a></h2><p> is a major health risk, and although exercise clearly improves skeletal muscle  sensitivity, the mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that initiation of a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp 4 h after single-legged exercise in humans increased microvascular perfusion (determined by contrast-enhanced ultrasound) by 65% in the exercised leg and 25% in the rested leg ( < 0.05) and that leg glucose uptake increased 50% more ( < 0.05) in the exercised leg than in the rested leg. Importantly, infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l--monomethyl-l-arginine  (l-NMMA) into both femoral arteries reversed the -stimulated increase in microvascular perfusion in both legs and abrogated the greater glucose uptake in the exercised compared with the rested leg. Skeletal muscle phosphorylation of TBC1D4 Ser and Ser and glycogen synthase activity were greater in the exercised leg before  and increased similarly in both legs during the clamp, and l-NMMA had no effect on these -stimulated signaling pathways. Therefore, acute exercise increases  sensitivity of muscle by a coordinated increase in -stimulated microvascular perfusion and molecular signaling at the level of TBC1D4 and glycogen synthase in muscle. This secures improved glucose delivery on the one hand and increased ability to take up and dispose of the delivered glucose on the other hand.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391700>Serum levels of TSP-1, NF-κB and TGF-β1 in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients in northern China suggest PCOS is associated with chronic inflammation.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and nuclear factor kappaβ (NF-κβ) in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with and without  and after treatment with cyproterone /ethinyloestradiol with or without concomitant metformin.Prospective.Patients with PCOS and healthy women were recruited.

This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effect of EASL in C57BL/6J mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced type 2 diabetes. Mice were randomly divided into normal diet (ND), HFD (60 kcal% fat diet), EASL (HFD with 0.56% (wt/wt) EASL), and Pinitol (HFD with 0.15% (wt/wt) pinitol) groups. Weight gain and abdominal fat accumulation were significantly suppressed by EASL. Levels of plasma glucose, HbA1c, and  in the EASL group were significantly lower than those of the HFD group, and the pancreatic islet of the EASL group had greater size than those of the HFD group. EASL group up-regulated neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), paired box 4 (Pax4), and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (MafA), which are markers of pancreatic cell development, as well as  receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS2, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), which are related to  sensitivity.

Soluble dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (sDPP-4) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are involved in the initiation and/or progression of cardiometabolic disorders. We therefore, hypothesized that increased DPP-4 and ADA activities are involved in glucose deregulation and hepatic triglyceride accumulation induced by COC treatment. This study also investigated whether short-chain fatty acid, , would protect against COC-induced dysmetabolic effects. Female Wistar rats received (p.o.) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg levonorgestrel) with or without sodium  (ACE; 200 mg) for 8 weeks. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, , free fatty acid, , and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic triglycerides (TG), TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA, and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. On the other hand, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, ACE significantly ameliorated the alterations induced by COC treatment, but XO activity remains elevated during COC treatment. This result also demonstrates that increased DPP-4 and ADA activities are at least in part involved in glucose deregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, sodium  would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, by inhibition of DPP-4 and ADA activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25554582>Improvements in body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors and  sensitivity with trenbolone in normogonadic rats.</a></h2><p>Trenbolone (TREN) is used for anabolic growth-promotion in over 20 million cattle annually and continues to be misused for aesthetic purposes in humans. The current study investigated TREN's effects on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors; and its tissue-selective effects on the cardiovascular system, liver and prostate. Male rats (n=12) were implanted with osmotic infusion pumps delivering either cyclodextrin vehicle (CTRL) or 2mg/kg/day TREN for 6 weeks. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry assessment of body composition; organ wet weights and serum lipid profiles; and  sensitivity were assessed. Cardiac ultrasound examinations were performed before in vivo studies assessed myocardial susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Circulating sex hormones and liver enzyme activities; and prostate and liver histology were examined. In 6 weeks, fat mass increased by 34±7% in CTRLs (p<0.01). Fat mass decreased by 37±6% and lean mass increased by 11±4% with TREN (p<0.05). Serum triglycerides, HDL and LDL were reduced by 62%, 57% and 78% (p<0.05) respectively in TREN rats. Histological examination of the prostates from TREN-treated rats indicated benign hyperplasia associated with an increased prostate mass (149% compared to CTRLs, p<0.01). No evidence of adverse cardiac or hepatic effects was observed. In conclusion, improvements in body composition, lipid profile and  sensitivity (key risk factors for cardiometabolic disease) were achieved with six-week TREN treatment without evidence of adverse cardiovascular or hepatic effects that are commonly associated with traditional anabolic steroid misuse. Sex hormone suppression and benign prostate hyperplasia were confirmed as adverse effects of the treatment.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipoic acid is known to modulate the redox status of the cell and has  mimetic effects. This study was aimed at determining the effects of dietary administration of lipoic acid on a HFD-induced obesity model in terms of (a)  signaling, (b) brain glucose uptake and neuronal- and astrocytic metabolism, and (c) synaptic plasticity. 3-Month old C57BL/6J mice were divided into 4 groups exposed to their respective treatments for 9 weeks: (1) normal diet, (2) normal diet plus lipoic acid, (3) HFD, and (4) HFD plus lipoic acid. HFD resulted in higher body weight, development of , lower brain glucose uptake and glucose transporters, alterations in glycolytic and  metabolism in neurons and astrocytes, and ultimately synaptic plasticity loss evident by a decreased long-term potentiation (LTP).

This study aimed to compare the different effects of drospirenone (DRP)-containing COCs with cyproterone  (CPA)-containing COCs, combined with metformin and lifestyle modifications in women with PCOS and metabolic disorders.Ninety-nine women with PCOS and a metabolic disorder between January 2011 and January 2013 were enrolled into this prospective randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized into two groups such as DRP-containing COCs, and CPA-containing COCs. Participants took COCs cyclically for 6 months, combined with metformin administration (1.5 g/d) and lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise). Clinical measures and biochemical and hormone profiles were compared. Comparisons for continuous variables were evaluated with paired and unpaired Student's t-tests. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used when the data were not normally distributed. Analysis of covariance was used to control for age, body mass index (BMI), and baseline data of each analyzed parameter when compared between the two groups.A total of 68 patients have completed the study. The combination regimen of COCs, metformin, and lifestyle modifications in these patients resulted in a significant decrease in BMI, acne, and hirsutism scores when compared to baseline levels in both groups (P < 0.05). Blood pressure (BP) was significantly different in the CPA group when compared to baseline (75.14 ± 6.77 mmHg vs. 80.70 ± 5.60 mmHg, P < 0.01), and after 6 months of treatment, only the change in systolic BP was significantly different between the two groups (4.00 [-6.00, 13.00] mmHg vs. -3.50 [-13.00, 9.00] mmHg, P = 0.009).

Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) P2X3 receptor upregulation is one important mechanism underlying PDN. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) at low frequency could effectively attenuate neuropathic pain. Our previous study showed that 2-Hz EA could relieve pain well in PDN. The study aimed to investigate whether 2-Hz EA relieves pain in PDN through suppressing PKC-mediated DRG P2X3 receptor upregulation. A 7-week feeding of high-fat and high-sugar diet plus a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in a dose of 35 mg/kg after a 5-week feeding of the diet successfully induced type 2 PDN in rats as revealed by the elevated body weight, fasting blood glucose, fasting  and , and the reduced paw withdrawal threshold (PWT), as well as the destructive ultrastructural change of sciatic nerve. DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level and DRG PKC expression were elevated. Two-hertz EA failed to improve peripheral neuropathy; however, it reduced PWT, DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level, and DRG PKC expression in PDN rats. Intraperitoneal administration of P2X3 receptor agonist αβ-meATP or PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) blocked 2-Hz EA analgesia. Furthermore, PMA administration increased DRG plasma membrane P2X3 receptor level in PDN rats subject to 2-Hz EA treatment. These findings together indicated that the analgesic effect of EA in PDN is mediated by suppressing PKC-dependent membrane P2X3 upregulation in DRG.

A recent investigation showed the significant protective effect of ethyl  extract against metabolic syndrome (MS). However, the corresponding active principles responsible for this effect and relations between their structure and biological actions remain unclear. Thus, ethyl  extract was subjected to column chromatography, which yielded seven compounds identified on the basis of spectroscopic data as rutin, hesperidin, kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, rosmarinic acid, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin, and kaempferol. The isolated compounds (5 mg/kg/day) were tested in a fructose enriched-diet rat model using metformin as a standard drug. Blood samples were withdrawn for estimation of MS-associated biomarkers and liver samples were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. The isolated compounds impaired most of the changes associated with MS as evidenced by improved  sensitivity, glucose tolerance, kidney function, lipid profiles and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation by different degrees. It is worth noting that quercetin and kaempferol showed the most potent effect.

Extracts from many sea cucumbers possess pharmacological activities proposed to benefit human health. In this study, we investigated the anti-oxidant and anti-ageing activities of extracts from H. scabra by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. Parts of H. scabra were solvent-extracted and divided into nine fractions including whole body-hexane (WBHE), whole body-ethyl  (WBEA), whole body-butanol (WBBU), body wall-hexane (BWHE), body wall-ethyl  (BWEA), body wall-butanol (BWBU), viscera-hexane (VIHE), viscera-ethyl  (VIEA), and viscera-butanol (VIBU). All fractions of the extracts were tested for anti-oxidant activities by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays and for anti-ageing effects by lifespan assays using C. elegans as a model. The results showed anti-oxidant properties in all fractions with the highest activity shown by the DPPH assay in WBBU (EC = 3.12 ± 0.09 mg/ml), and by the ABTS assay in WBHE (EC = 0.31 ± 0.10 mg/ml). In lifespan assays the highest anti-ageing effect was detected in WBBU- and BWEA-treated C. elegans with increased mean lifespans of 8.12% and 4.77%, respectively. Furthermore, WBBU and BWEA-treated C. elegans exhibited significantly higher  against heat shock and paraquat-induced oxidative stresses than controls. By using LC-MS/MS, both extracts were characterized to contain triterpene glycosides as the main bioactive components. To explore mechanisms of H. scabra extracts on longevity and stress , worms with genetic mutations in anti-ageing pathways were analyzed and showed that WBBU and BWEA did not prolong the lifespan of daf-16, age-1, sir-2.1, jnk-1, sek-1, and osr-1 mutants, suggesting that these genetic pathways are involved in mediating the anti-ageing effects of the H. scabra extracts. Moreover, WBBU and BWEA enhanced the nuclear translocation of the FoxO/DAF-16 transcription factor, and increased mRNA expression of this gene and its downstream targets sod-3, hsp12.3, and hsp16.2. In conclusion, this study strongly demonstrates anti-oxidant and anti-ageing properties of H. scabra extracts containing triterpene glycosides, which, in the C. elegans model, may be mediated via the /IGF-1 signaling (IIS)-DAF-16 pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated how IR affects fertility-sparing treatment in endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH) patients.The 151 EAH patients received fertility-sparing treatment were retrospectively investigated. All patients received high-dose progestin combined with hysteroscopy. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by hysteroscopy every 3 months during the treatment.The median age was 33.0 years old (range, 21-54 years old). Sixty-one patients (40.4%) were  resistant. Three patients were excluded from the analysis because they chose hysterectomy within 3 months after initiation of progestin treatment. The 141 out of 148 (95.3%) patients achieved complete response (CR). No difference was found in cumulative CR rate between those with or without IR (90.2% vs. 95.6%, p=0.320). IR significantly affected therapeutic duration to achieve CR (8.1±0.5 months with IR vs. 6.1±0.4 months without IR, p=0.004). Overweight (body mass index [BMI]≥25 kg/m²) was associated with higher risk of treatment failure (odds ratio=5.61; 95% confidence interval=1.11-28.35; p=0.040) and longer therapeutic duration to achieve CR (7.6±0.5 months vs. 6.3±0.4 months, p=0.019).

However, GA-specific target proteins and the mechanisms involved in the downstream signaling and cross-talk to improve  sensitivity have not been fully elucidated. In this study, the potential targets of GA were identified by chemical proteomics strategies using serial GA probes for target fishing and cell molecular imaging. Intracellular enzyme activity evaluation and  models were used for validating the function of the target proteins on the downstream  signaling pathways. Collectively, our data demonstrate that GA improved the -responsive pathway and glucose consumption levels via multiple diabetogenic factors that activated the  signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. GA improved Glucose transporter 4(GLUT4) expression by targeting the Ras protein to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. GA exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on IRS1ser307 phosphorylation in cells treated with the Protein kinase C (PKC) activator Phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA.)

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short-term intervention with WG rye on cognitive functions, mood and cardiometabolic risk markers in middle-aged test subjects.Rye-based breads were provided to 38 healthy test subjects (aged 52-70y) during three consecutive days in a crossover study design, using white wheat flour bread (WWB) as a reference. The rye-based bread consisted of a WG rye kernel/flour mixture (1:1 ratio) supplemented with resistant starch type 2 (RS2) (RB + RS2). The last bread portion was ingested at 2100 h, and cognitive function, mood and cardiometabolic risk markers were determined the following morning, 11 - 14 h post intake.In comparison to WWB, the RB + RS2 product increased ratings of mood parameters (valance, P < 0.001; activation P < 0.05). No differences were seen in the cognitive tests depending on intervention (P > 0.05). RB + RS2 increased  sensitivity (P < 0.05), fasting levels of gut hormones (PYY, P < 0.05; GLP-2, P < 0.01) and fasting concentrations of plasma , butyrate and total SCFA (P < 0.001).

Intermittent fasting is an effective and natural strategy for weight control, but the mechanism for its efficacy is poorly understood. Here, we show that an every-other-day fasting (EODF) regimen selectively stimulates beige fat development within white adipose tissue and dramatically ameliorates obesity, , and hepatic steatosis. EODF treatment results in a shift in the gut microbiota composition leading to elevation of the fermentation products  and lactate and to the selective upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in beige cells. Microbiota-depleted mice are  to EODF-induced beiging, while transplantation of the microbiota from EODF-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activates beiging and improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings provide a new gut-microbiota-driven mechanism for activating adipose tissue browning and treating metabolic diseases.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293742>Effect of dietary energy substrate and days on feed on apparent total tract digestibility, ruminal short-chain fatty acid absorption,  and glucose clearance, and  responsiveness in finishing feedlot cattle.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary energy substrate and days on feed on apparent total tract digestibility, ruminal fermentation, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) absorption, plasma glucose and  clearance rates, and  responsiveness. Eight ruminally cannulated, crossbred growing heifers were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 dietary treatments. The control (CON) diet consisted of 75.2% barley grain, 9.8% canola meal, 9% mineral and vitamin supplement, and 6% barley silage (DM basis). To evaluate the effect of energy source, a high-lipid, high-fiber byproduct pellet (HLHFP) was included in the diet by replacing 55% of the barley grain and 100% of canola meal. The study consisted of 4 consecutive 40-d periods (P1 to P4), with data and sample collection occurring in the last 12 d of each period. Dry matter intake tended ( = 0.10) to decrease by period and HLHFP-fed heifers tended to eat less ( = 0.09). The ADG of the CON was greater than that of the HLHFP during P1 and P4 (treatment × period, = 0.02). Heifers fed HLHFP tended to have greater mean ruminal pH (6.10 vs. 5.96; = 0.07) than heifers fed the CON, but pH was not affected by period. The CON heifers had a greater digestibility for DM, OM, CP, and NDF ( ≤ 0.03), and the digestibility for DM and OM linearly increased ( = 0.01) and for CP, NDF, and starch quadratically increased ( ≤ 0.04) with advancing period. Total SCFA concentration in the rumen was greater ( < 0.01) for the CON than for the HLHFP (141.6 vs. 128.1 m). The molar proportion of  and isobutyrate linearly increased and butyrate and valerate linearly decreased ( ≤ 0.05) with advancing periods. The rate of valerate absorption tended to increase (linear, = 0.06) and the ruminal liquid passage rate tended to decrease (linear, = 0.08) with advancing period. The arterial clearance rate of  tended to quadratically increase ( = 0.06) with period, whereas the clearance rate of glucose was not affected by treatment or period. Both fasting plasma  and the area under the  curve in response to glucose infusion linearly increased ( = 0.04) with period. These data suggest that partially replacing barley grain with HLHFP negatively affects total tract digestibility and performance. Moreover, with advancing days on feed, digestibility and  increases without changes in ruminal pH and plasma metabolite clearance rates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27800650>Supplementation of oligofructose, but not sucralose, decreases high-fat diet induced body weight gain in mice independent of gustducin-mediated gut hormone release.</a></h2><p>Enteroendocrine cells sense nutrients through taste receptors similar to those on the tongue. Sweet and fatty acid taste receptors (FFAR) coupled to the gustatory G-protein, gustducin, on enteroendocrine cells play a role in gut hormone release. We studied if supplementation of artificial (sucralose) or prebiotic (oligofructose; OFS) sweeteners target gustducin-mediated signaling pathways to alter gut hormone release and reduce obesity-associated disorders.Wild-type (WT) and α-gustducin knockout (α-gust ) mice were fed a high-fat diet and gavaged once daily (8 wk) with water or equisweet concentrations of sweeteners. OFS but not sucralose decreased body weight gain (-19 ± 3%, p < 0.01), fat pad mass (-55 ± 6%, p < 0.001), and  (-39 ± 5%, p < 0.001) independent of α-gustducin. Neither sweetener improved glucose intolerance, while solely OFS improved the disturbed colonic permeability. OFS decreased (-65 ± 8%, p < 0.001) plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) but not ghrelin and peptide YY (PYY) levels in WT mice. Cecal  and butyrate levels were reduced by OFS in both genotypes suggesting enhanced uptake of SCFAs that may target FFAR2 (upregulated expression) in adipose tissue.OFS, but not sucralose, reduced body weight gain and decreased intestinal permeability, but not glucose intolerance. Effects were not mediated by altered gut hormone levels or gustducin-mediated signaling. Artificial sweeteners do not affect gut hormone levels and are metabolically inert in mice on a high-fat diet. In contrast, prebiotic oligosaccharides (OFS) prevent body weight gain but not glucose intolerance. Alterations in sweet and short-chain fatty acid receptors (FFAR) (studied in WT and α-gust mice) that regulate gut hormone levels are not mandatory for the positive effects of OFS. Enhanced uptake of SCFAs may favor interaction with FFAR2/3 on adipose tissue to induce weight loss.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the function of DHCR24 in endometrial cancer (EC) remains largely elusive. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of DHCR24 and the progesterone receptor (PGR) in our tissue microarray of EC (n = 258), the existing EC database in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). We found that DHCR24 was significantly elevated in patients with EC, and that the up-regulation of DHCR24 was associated with advanced clinical stage, histological grading, vascular invasion, lymphatic metastasis, and reduced overall survival. In addition, DHCR24 expression could be induced by  though STAT3, which directly binds to the promoter elements of DHCR24, as demonstrated by ChIP-PCR and luciferase assays. Furthermore, genetically silencing DHCR24 inhibited the metastatic ability of endometrial cancer cells and up-regulated PGR expression, which made cells more sensitive to progestin. Taken together, we have demonstrated for the first time the crucial role of the /STAT3/DHCR24/PGR axis in the progression of EC by modulating the metastasis and progesterone response, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of EC with progesterone receptor loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27378919>Pharmacometabolomic Assessment of Metformin in Non-diabetic, African Americans.</a></h2><p>Millions of individuals are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), which increases the risk for a plethora of adverse outcomes including cardiovascular events and kidney disease. Metformin is the most widely prescribed medication for the treatment of T2D; however, its mechanism is not fully understood and individuals vary in their response to this therapy. Here, we use a non-targeted, pharmacometabolomics approach to measure 384 metabolites in 33 non-diabetic, African American subjects dosed with metformin. Three plasma samples were obtained from each subject, one before and two after metformin administration. Validation studies were performed in wildtype mice given metformin. Fifty-four metabolites (including 21 unknowns) were significantly altered upon metformin administration, and 12 metabolites (including six unknowns) were significantly associated with metformin-induced change in glucose (q < 0.2). Of note, indole-3-, a metabolite produced by gut microbes, and 4-hydroxyproline were modulated following metformin exposure in both humans and mice. 2-Hydroxybutanoic acid, a metabolite previously associated with  and an early biomarker of T2D, was positively correlated with fasting glucose levels as well as glucose levels following oral glucose tolerance tests after metformin administration. Pathway analysis revealed that metformin administration was associated with changes in a number of metabolites in the urea cycle and in purine metabolic pathways (q < 0.01). Further research is needed to validate the biomarkers of metformin exposure and response identified in this study, and to understand the role of metformin in ammonia detoxification, protein degradation and purine metabolic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29862342>Phellopterin isolated from  reduces blood glucose level in diabetic mice.</a></h2><p> is the critical condition for the development of metabolic syndromes including type II diabetes and heart disease. To investigate the active components of  root which is known to increase  sensitivity, its methanol extract was subfractionated. The ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction of the  root extract significantly promoted adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. Among the three compounds isolated from the EtOAc extract (bergapten (), imperatorin () and phellopterin (), phellopterin () induced the highest adipocyte differentiation at 25 and 50 μg/mL. In addition, treatment with imperatorin () and phellopterin () increased the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ). In diabetic animal model induced by high-fat diets (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ), administration of phellopterin ((), 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the levels of blood glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol. Taken together, these results indicate that phellopterin () enhances adipocytes differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, phellopterin () significantly prevents HFD/STZ-induced type Ⅱ diabetes. The present study also provides phellopterin () may be a valuable therapeutic alternative for enhancing  sensitivity through promotion of adipocyte differentiation and by increasing mRNA expression levels of PPARγ, which is a major mediator of  sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593890>AMPK activating and anti adipogenic potential of Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower in 3T3-L1 cells.</a></h2><p>The flowers of Hibiscus rosa sinensis has array of pharmacological actions.

Effect on adipolysis was determined, adipogenic and its regulatory gene and protein expression were studied and effect of HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL on AMPK was confirmed in the presence of dorsomorphin.Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and was found to alleviate triglyceride accumulation significantly (p < 0.001) by 1.6 and 2.3 times respectively in pre adipocytes during differentiation. HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also nonsignificantly reduced lipolysis which releases free fatty acids, a major contributing factor for . Activation of AMPK by phosphorylation has led to reduced gene and protein expression of adipogenic factors Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), CCAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), Sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and their targets Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), Perilipin and enhanced Adiponectin expression. Treatment with HRF 25 and 50 µg/mL also resulted in inactivation of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) by enhancing ACC phosphorylation, which reduced the levels of malonyl-CoA an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Enhanced CPT1 levels causes induction of fatty acid β- oxidation. Effects of HRF were nullified in the presence of AMPK antagonist dorsomorphin.In summary, HRF treatments reduced adipogenesis, enhanced factors regulating fatty acid oxidation and this is mediated by AMPK activation. The results conclusively showed anti-obesity potential of HRF and it might be helpful in treatment of associated complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolic signals derived from dietary intake or secreted from adipose tissue, gut, and liver contribute to energy homeostasis. Recent metabolomic studies identified novel metabolites and enlarged our knowledge on classic metabolites. This review summarizes the evidence of their roles as mediators of interorgan crosstalk and regulators of  sensitivity and energy metabolism. Circulating lipids such as free fatty acids, , and palmitoleate from adipose tissue and short-chain fatty acids from the gut effectively act on liver and skeletal muscle. Intracellular lipids such as diacylglycerols and sphingolipids can serve as lipotoxins by directly inhibiting  action in muscle and liver. In contrast, fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids have been recently shown to exert a series of beneficial effects. Also, ketoacids are gaining interest as potent modulators of  action and mitochondrial function. Finally, branched-chain amino acids not only predict metabolic diseases, but also inhibit  signaling. Here, we focus on the metabolic crosstalk in humans, which regulates  sensitivity and energy homeostasis in the main -sensitive tissues, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584015>Trenbolone Improves Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Myocardial Tolerance to Ischemia-Reperfusion in Male Rats With Testosterone-Deficient Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity adds another dimension to the pathophysiology of testosterone (TEST) deficiency (TD) and potentially impairs the therapeutic efficacy of classical TEST replacement therapy. We investigated the therapeutic effects of selective androgen receptor modulation with trenbolone (TREN) in a model of TD with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Male Wistar rats (n=50) were fed either a control standard rat chow (CTRL) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet. After 8 weeks of feeding, rats underwent sham surgery or an orchiectomy (ORX). Alzet miniosmotic pumps containing either vehicle, 2-mg/kg·d TEST or 2-mg/kg·d TREN were implanted in HF/HS+ORX rats. Body composition, fat distribution, lipid profile, and  sensitivity were assessed. Infarct size was quantified to assess myocardial damage after in vivo ischaemia reperfusion, before cardiac and prostate histology was performed. The HF/HS+ORX animals had increased sc and visceral adiposity; circulating triglycerides, cholesterol, and ; and myocardial damage, with low circulating TEST compared with CTRLs. Both TEST and TREN protected HF/HS+ORX animals against sc fat accumulation, hypercholesterolaemia, and myocardial damage. However, only TREN protected against visceral fat accumulation, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia and reduced myocardial damage relative to CTRLs. TEST caused widespread cardiac fibrosis and prostate hyperplasia, which were less pronounced with TREN. We propose that TEST replacement therapy may have contraindications for males with TD and obesity-related MetS. TREN treatment may be more effective in restoring androgen status and reducing cardiovascular risk in males with TD and MetS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26456345>Ethyl  fraction of Aframomum melegueta fruit ameliorates pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and major diabetes-related parameters in a type 2 diabetes model of rats.</a></h2><p>In West Africa, various preparations of the fruit, seed and leaf of Aframomum melegueta K.

Clinopodium chinense (Benth.) O. Kuntze has been shown to lower blood glucose and attenuate high glucose-induced vascular endothelial cells injury. In the present study we investigated the effects of ethyl  extract of C. chinense (CCE) on PA-induced inflammation and IR in the vascular endothelium and its molecular mechanism. We found that CCE significantly inhibited PA-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consequently, this led to the inhibition of the following downstream adapted proteins myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-  and TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased -mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse  mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired  signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29250843> improvement by cinnamon powder in polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Our aim is to assess the effect of cinnamon powder capsules on , anthropometric measurements, glucose and lipid profiles, and androgens of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Most modern liquid formulations have a simple composition; comprising a buffer, a tonicity modifier, a surfactant, sometimes a stabiliser, the therapeutic protein and water. Recent formulations of monoclonal antibodies often use histidine or  as the buffer, sucrose or trehalose as the tonicity modifier and polysorbate 20 or 80 as the surfactant with a pH of 5.7 +/- 0.4. The mechanisms for the behaviour of excipients is still debated by academics so formulation design is still a black art. Fortunately, a statistical approach like design of experiment is suitable for formulation development and has been successful when combined with accelerated stability experimentation. The development of prefilled syringes and pens has added low viscosity and shear  to the quality attributes for a successful formulation. To achieve patient compliance for self-administration, formulations that cause minimal pain and tissue damage is also desirable.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abnormal metabolism and hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia in the body induces the development of an overactive and continuous inflammatory response, resulting in obesity and metabolic syndromes, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and . Torenia concolor Lindley var. formosana Yamazaki (TC), a perennial creeping herbaceous plant, is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb widely used for the treatment of heat stroke, aching muscles and bones, cold, dysentery, and ambustion.This study evaluated the influence of TC on inflammation responses and lipid metabolism.In this study, ground TC powder was extracted with 95% ethanol. The ethanol was removed by vacuum concentration, and the resulting extract was further extracted with a number of solvents of different polarity to produce four final extracts: an ethanol extract (TCEE), an ethyl  extract (TCEAE), an n-butanol extract (TCBUE), and a water extract (TCWE). The anti-inflammatory efficacy of the extracts and their capability for lipid metabolism regulation was then explored.TCEE, TCEAE, and TCBUE exhibited good anti-inflammatory efficacy; TCEAE also simultaneously regulated lipid metabolism. In RAW264.7 cells, these three extracts suppressed the expression of iNOS and IL-6 via the signaling pathway activation of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and thereby showed anti-inflammatory efficacy. In 3T3-L1 cells, these three extracts promoted lipid metabolism and reduced lipid accumulation through the activation of PPARα and the increased expression of adiponectin, thus demonstrating regulation of lipid metabolism.These results indicate that TC possesses anti-inflammatory efficacy and can regulate lipid metabolism through the activation of transcription factor PPARs. We speculate that these nutraceutical effects are attributable to betulin, an active ingredient in this herbal medicine.© Author(s) 2017.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of elevated glucocorticoid levels on the development of MetS in middle-aged female rhesus monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) after ovariectomy. Six female ovariectomized rhesus monkeys (9-13years) were randomly assigned to either a control group (normal diet, n=3) or a group in which MetS was facilitated (n=3). The MetS group fed with HFD (15% fat) and received oral prednisone  treatment (50mg/day). After 24months, the GCs treatment was withdrawn with continuation of high-fat feeding for a further 12months. After 24months, the MetS group displayed a significant increase in body weight and abdominal circumference. Additionally, the MetS animals displayed abnormal serum lipids,  and impaired glucose tolerance. Histology of liver biopsies indicated marked accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes of MetS animals. Withdrawal of GCs treatment led to recovery from above-mentioned metabolic disorders. Whereas GCs treatment increased leptin expression, it lowered expression of adiponectin and other factors in adipose tissue. Expression of Hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase-1 and glucose transporter type-4 in the livers of MetS animals were reduced. We conclude that in the context of high fat diet, high levels of exogenous GCs contribute to the development of MetS in non-human primates.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, glucose uptake and utilization is important for adipose tissue development in beef cattle, and increasing glucose utilization in intramuscular adipose tissue can increase carcass quality. Research from the 1980s demonstrated a lack of  sensitivity in isolated bovine adipocytes and adipose tissue explants incubated in vitro.  did not stimulate glucose or  incorporation into fatty acids, nor did it increase concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in bovine adipose tissue incubated with exogenous glucose. Specific binding of [I] iodoinsulin and  degradation in bovine isolated adipocytes was low to non-detectable. These early studies indicated that -dependent receptor-mediated signaling was less important in bovine adipose tissue than in adipose tissues of humans, swine, or laboratory species. More recent research demonstrated that glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) expression in muscle and adipose tissue declines markedly after birth in calves, indicating the development of  as cattle transition from suckling to functional ruminants.  is important in dairy cattle, causing ketosis and fatty liver.

We repeated these analyses over time at 6 and 12 months after starting GA treatment.Our analysis showed that naïve-to-treatment RRMS patients had a lower number of CD16(+)CD56(+) NK cells, CD19(+) B cells, CD4(+) T cells co-expressing the MHC class II activation marker HLA-DR (CD4(+)DR(+)) and naïve CD4(+)CD45RA(+) T cells in basal conditions. GA treatment induced a specific and significant decrease of circulating CD19(+) B cells. Naïve-to-treatment RRMS patients also showed a significantly higher number of CD4(+) T cells with a memory phenotype (CD4(+)CD45RO(+)) whose peripheral frequency was not affected by GA treatment. These changes over time associated with a higher serum concentration of leptin and lower levels of MPO. GA treatment also reduced significantly the circulating levels of sCD40-L and sTNF-R overtime.Our data suggest that the clinical outcome of GA treatment is associated with changes in immune cell subpopulations and modulation of specific immunometabolic markers. These data add substantial evidence of the immune modulating effect of GA during RRMS and could be of relevance in understanding the pathogenesis of disease and its follow-up.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study assessed carbohydrate metabolism in non-obese users of DMPA using the HEC technique.A prospective, non-randomized, comparative study conducted at the Family Planning Clinic/Metabolic Unit, University of Campinas, Brazil. Forty-eight women aged 18-39 years underwent HEC: 30 initiating use of DMPA and 18 initiating use of a copper intrauterine device (IUD). Data from 15 women in each group, who completed the follow-up and underwent HEC at12 months, were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. All women were advised to perform aerobic physical exercise for 150 min/week; body composition and total energy intake were evaluated. Main outcome measures were IR defined by M-value <4 mg/kg/min, and blood levels of . Additional outcomes were total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, adipokines and free fatty acids.At 12 months, two women in the DMPA group and none in the IUD group had developed IR. The groups were similar in in M-values and in blood levels of , total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, adipokines or free fatty acids. Triglyceride levels increased in the DMPA group when compared to the IUD group, 80.0 (SD 47.8) versus 61.8 (SD 35.8) mg/dL respectively, (p=.033); and increased the total daily energy intake, 1828.3 (SD 518.9) versus 1300.8 (SD 403.4) kilocalories/24hs, respectively in the same groups, (p=.041). All the DMPA users showing higher  sensitivity at 12 months reported performing physical activity regularly.Changes occurred in carbohydrate metabolism in DMPA users in the first year of use of the method. It is possible that the regular aerobic exercise may exert a beneficial and protective effect against the factors that trigger these changes.Carbohydrate metabolism undergoes adverse changes in few young non-obese women during the first year of DMPA use and regular aerobic exercise may exert a beneficial and protective effect against these changes.Copyright © 2018.

The study involved 12 patients with T2 DM without verified cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 36 patients with T2 DM and functional stage of CAN, of median age 50–59 years, disease duration 1–6 years and HbA1c levels – 7.1±0.6%. 15 healthy subjects were control group. Screening for CAN, that included five standard cardiovascular tests, was performed. The levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, immunoreactive  (IRI), hsCRP, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were measured. The index of  (HOMA-IR) and TNFα/IL-10 ratio were calculated. Patients with T2 DM and CAN were divided into 2 groups: patients of the 1st group (group of comparison, n=15) received standard glucose-lowering therapy; patients of the 2nd group (n=21) received one capsule/day of the ω-3 PUFA (∼90% ethyl ester of PUFA (1000 mg), in particular eicosapentaenoic – 460 mg, docosahexaenoic acid – 380 mg and 4 mg α-tocopherol ) in addition to the standard therapy. The duration of the study was 3 months. Obtained results showed, that development of CAN in patients with T2 DM is accompanied by increase of the IRI (26.6±1.73 mcIU/ml, p<0.001 – compared to the control; p1<0.001 – compared to T2 DM patients without CVD); hsCRP (2.77±0.24 mg/l, p<0.001, p1<0,001); TNFα (5.75±0.24 pg/ml, p<0.001, p1<0.001); IL-6 (5.88±0.38 pg/ml, p<0.001, p1<0.001); IL-8 (6.65±0.3 pg/ml, p<0.001, p1>0.05); IL-10 (15.86±1.4 pg/ml, p<0.05, p1>0.05) levels; TNFα/IL-10 (44.2±3.57%, p<0.01, p1<0.05) and HOMA-IR. After 3 months of treatment no statistically significant changes (p>0.05) of investigated parameters, in particular levels of IRI (-6.8±2.0%); hsCRP (-7.2±1.63%); TNFα (-6.1±1.0%); IL-6 (-5.8±1.77%); IL-8 (-3.9±1.57%); IL-10 (-3.7±2.34%); TNFα/IL-10 (-0.5±2.3%) in patients from the group of comparison were found. The administration of ω-3 PUFA to patients with T2 DM and CAN promoted to the statistically significant decrease in hsCRP (-14.8±2.91%, p<0.05), TNFα (-14.1±2.15%, p<0.01), IL-6 (-13.5±2.7%, p<0.05), IL-8 (-9.8±2.13%, p<0.05), TNFα/IL-10 ratio (-34.6±1.93%, p<0.05); a slighty decrease in the content of the IRI (-10.3±1.1%, p>0.05), IL-10 (+7.9 ±6.42%, p>0.05), HOMA-IR was observed.

After preconception intervention, women underwent standardized ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate and timed intercourse for four cycles. Pregnancies were followed with trimester visits until delivery.Weight, ovulation, and live birth were measured.We consented 216 and randomly assigned 149 women (Lifestyle: n = 50; OCP: n = 49; Combined: n = 50). We achieved significant weight loss with both Lifestyle (mean weight loss, -6.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -7.4--5.0; and Combined (mean weight loss, -6.4%; 95% CI, -7.6--5.2) compared with baseline and OCP (both P < .001). There was a significant increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome at the end of preconception treatment compared with baseline within OCP (odds ratio [OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.42-4.27) whereas no change in metabolic syndrome was detected in the Lifestyle (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63-2.19) or Combined (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.44-1.17) groups.

Live birth rates were OCP, 12%; Lifestyle, 26%; and Combined, 24% (P = .13).A preconception weight loss intervention eliminates the adverse metabolic oral contraceptive effects and, compared with oral contraceptive pretreatment, leads to higher ovulation rates.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578736>Phase II study of medroxyprogesterone  plus metformin as a fertility-sparing treatment for atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.</a></h2><p>Metformin, widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, reduces the risk of cancer and relapse after treatment. Fertility-sparing treatment for endometrial cancer (EC) with progestin is associated with a high chance of disease regression, and the high relapse rate continues to be a problem. We assessed the efficacy of metformin in preventing recurrence after medroxyprogesterone  (MPA) as fertility-sparing treatment for atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and EC.This phase II study enrolled 17 patients with AEH and 19 patients with EC limited to the endometrium (age, 20-40 years). MPA (400 mg/day) and metformin (750-2250 mg/day) were administered for 24-36 weeks to achieve a complete response (CR). Metformin was administered until conception, even after MPA discontinuation. The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS) after remission. We analyzed all efficacy end points in the full analysis set.The body mass index was ≥25 kg/m(2) in 27 patients (mean, 31 kg/m(2); range, 19-51 kg/m(2)), and the homeostasis model assessment for  index was ≥2.5 in 24 patients (mean, 4.7; range, 0.7-21). Two patients showed progression at 12 weeks [6%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2-18]. At 36 weeks, 29 (81%; 95% CI 65-90) patients achieved CR, and 5 (14%; 95% CI 6-29) patients achieved partial response. During a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 9-66 months) after remission, relapse was confirmed in three of the patients who had achieved CR (relapse rate, 10%). The 3-year estimated RFS rate was 89%. No patients experienced severe toxicity.Metformin inhibited disease relapse after MPA therapy. The combination of metformin and MPA in EC treatment should be studied further.UMIN 000002210.© The Author 2015.

Here we show that increased production of  by an altered gut microbiota in rodents leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which, in turn, promotes increased glucose-stimulated  secretion, increased ghrelin secretion, hyperphagia, obesity and related sequelae.

Given that some studies indicate that artificial sweeteners might have adverse effects, alternative solutions are sought. Xylitol and erythritol have been known for a long time and their beneficial effects on caries prevention and potential health benefits in diabetic patients have been demonstrated in several studies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) are released from the gut in response to food intake, promote satiation, reduce gastric emptying (GE), and modulate glucose homeostasis. Although glucose ingestion stimulates sweet taste receptors in the gut and leads to incretin and gastrointestinal hormone release, the effects of xylitol and erythritol have not been well studied. Ten lean and 10 obese volunteers were given 75 g of glucose, 50 g of xylitol, or 75 g of erythritol in 300 ml of water or placebo (water) by a nasogastric tube. We examined plasma glucose, , active GLP-1, CCK, and GE with a [(13)C]sodium  breath test and assessed subjective feelings of satiation. Xylitol and erythritol led to a marked increase in CCK and GLP-1, whereas  and plasma glucose were not (erythritol) or only slightly (xylitol) affected. Both xylitol and erythritol induced a significant retardation in GE. Subjective feelings of appetite were not significantly different after carbohydrate intake compared with placebo. In conclusion, acute ingestion of erythritol and xylitol stimulates gut hormone release and slows down gastric emptying, whereas there is no or only little effect on  release.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911997>The effectiveness of metformin, oral contraceptives, and lifestyle modification in improving the metabolism of overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a network meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>We designed a network meta-analysis that investigated relatively different interventions that included the effects of metformin, oral contraceptives, and lifestyle modification on the metabolic parameters of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. In addition, we searched for eligible interventions that improved the metabolism of glucose and lipids.We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central databases from inception to May 2018. Publication types that were categorized as randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The main outcome included the homeostasis model assessment of , total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total triglycerides. We performed both a pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis to evaluate the mean difference value and 95% credibility intervals, and we calculated the surface cumulative rank curve.There were a total of 12 kinds of interventions: metformin, 2 mg cyproterone  plus 0.05 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/CA), 0.15 mg desogestrel plus 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/DSG), and 3 mg drospirenone plus 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol (EE/DRSP), lifestyle, exercise, diet, metformin + lifestyle, metformin + diet, EE/CA + lifestyle, metformin + EE/CA, and EE/DRSP + lifestyle from the 20 eligible RCTs that were included in this study. Our meta-analysis results showed that metformin + lifestyle (MD = -2.04, 95% CrI = -3.64 to -0.41), EE/CA + lifestyle (MD = -2.23, 95% CrI = -4.11 to -0.35), and EE/DRSP + lifestyle (MD = -2.59, 95% CrI = -4.66 to -0.50) resulted in lower in the levels of total cholesterol. Women treated with metformin + lifestyle (MD = -1.82, 95% CrI = -2.88 to -0.79), EE/CA + lifestyle (MD = -2.25, 95% CrI = -3.58 to -1.08), or EE/DRSP + lifestyle (MD = -2.29, 95% CrI = -3.69 to -1.07) exhibited significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with the placebo group. There was no significant difference between any of the interventions compared with a placebo in the levels of homeostasis model assessment of  and total triglycerides. The surface cumulative rank curve revealed that metformin + lifestyle might be the best intervention with respect to the improvement of the homeostasis model of assessment  and EE/DRSP + lifestyle appeared to be the best intervention for the reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, the metformin + diet intervention was more effective in reducing the level of total triglycerides.For overweight polycystic ovary syndrome patients, our evidence revealed that EE/CA and EE/SRSP combined with metformin or lifestyle changes can reduce the adverse effects on glucose and lipid metabolism of the use of oral contraceptive agents alone.

The anti- effects of BE and EE were evaluated on palmitate induced  model of H4IIE, C2C12 and 3T3L1 cells by using several metabolic parameters. Specifically, whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed by using microarray over 55.000 genes in control,  resistant and EE (25 µg/mL) treated  resistant H4IIE cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of both extracts were analyzed in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.Both EE and BE at low doses (25-50 µg/mL) significantly decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis in H4IIE cell line by suppressing the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase. In C2C12 myotubes, both extracts increased the  stimulated glucose uptake more effectively than metformin. Both extracts decreased the isoproterenol induced lipolysis in 3T3L1 cell line. Moreover, they also effectively increased the expression of lipoprotein lipase protein level in  resistant myotubes at low doses. EE increased the protein level of PPARγ and stimulated the activation AKT in  resistant H4IIE and C2C12 cell lines. The results obtained from biochemical assays, mRNA/protein studies and whole genome transcriptome analyses were found to be complementary and provided support for the hypothesis that EE might be biologically active against  and act through the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and AKT activation. Besides, LPS induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages was mainly inhibited by EE through suppression of iNOS/NO signaling, IL1β and COX-2 genes. HPLC-TOF/MS analysis of EE of L. stoechas mainly resulted in caffeic acid, apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid and its methyl ester, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, ferrulic acid and salicylic acid.Data suggest that EE of L. stoechas contains phytochemicals that can be effective in the treatment/prevention of  and inflammation. These results validate the traditional use of L. stoechas in Anatolia against several metabolic disorders including metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018.

By degrading dietary substrates, the gut microbiota produces several metabolites that bind human pharmacological targets, impact subsequent signalling networks and in fine modulate host's metabolism. In this review, we revisit the pharmacological relevance of four classes of gut microbial metabolites in CMD: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, methylamines and indoles. Unravelling the signalling mechanisms of the microbial-mammalian metabolic axis adds one more layer of complexity to the physiopathology of CMD and opens new avenues for the development of microbiota-based pharmacological therapies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, a reduction in the circulating levels of TNF-α and IL-6 was also observed. Furthermore, at molecular level, it was demonstrated that the HEPa/EtOAc treatment was able to improve these physiological parameters, through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) per si, as well as the enhancement of antioxidant mechanism by an increase in PPARγ/Cu(2+), Zn(2+)-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) axis expression in liver and adipose tissue.

Hence, effects of its sub-toxic exposure on redox sensitive kinases (RSKs),  signaling and -induced glucose uptake were assessed in rat muscle cell line. In this in vitro study, rat myoblast (L6) cells were differentiated to myotubes and were exposed to sub-toxic concentrations (10 mg/l and 20 mg/l) of Malathion for 18 hours.

Phosphorylation levels of RSKs (JNK, p38MAPK and IκBα component of NFκB) were increased and that of IRS-1 and Akt on  stimulation was decreased following Malathion exposure as compared to those in controls. PON1 and PON2 genes were expressed in myotubes with and without Malathion exposure. Significant PON activity was present in cell lysate. We conclude that sub-toxic Malathion exposure induces oxidative stress in muscle cells activating RSKs that impairs  signaling and thereby -stimulated glucose uptake in muscle cells. This probably explains the biochemical basis of Malathion-induced  state and diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26990559>Rye-Based Evening Meals Favorably Affected Glucose Regulation and Appetite Variables at the Following Breakfast; A Randomized Controlled Study in Healthy Subjects.</a></h2><p>Whole grain has shown potential to prevent obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Possible mechanism could be related to colonic fermentation of specific indigestible carbohydrates, i.e. dietary fiber (DF). The aim of this study was to investigate effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and appetite regulation the next day when ingesting rye kernel bread rich in DF as an evening meal.Whole grain rye kernel test bread (RKB) or a white wheat flour based bread (reference product, WWB) was provided as late evening meals to healthy young adults in a randomized cross-over design. The test products RKB and WWB were provided in two priming settings: as a single evening meal or as three consecutive evening meals prior to the experimental days. Test variables were measured in the morning, 10.5-13.5 hours after ingestion of RKB or WWB. The postprandial phase was analyzed for measures of glucose metabolism, inflammatory markers, appetite regulating hormones and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in blood, hydrogen excretion in breath and subjective appetite ratings.With the exception of serum CRP, no significant differences in test variables were observed depending on length of priming (P>0.05). The RKB evening meal increased plasma concentrations of PYY (0-120 min, P<0.001), GLP-1 (0-90 min, P<0.05) and fasting SCFA ( and butyrate, P<0.05, propionate, P = 0.05), compared to WWB. Moreover, RKB decreased blood glucose (0-120 min, P = 0.001), serum  response (0-120 min, P<0.05) and fasting FFA concentrations (P<0.05). Additionally, RKB improved subjective appetite ratings during the whole experimental period (P<0.05), and increased breath hydrogen excretion (P<0.001), indicating increased colonic fermentation activity.The results indicate that RKB evening meal has an anti-diabetic potential and that the increased release of satiety hormones and improvements of appetite sensation could be beneficial in preventing obesity. These effects could possibly be mediated through colonic fermentation.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795972>: a diet-derived key metabolite in energy metabolism: good or bad in context of obesity and glucose homeostasis?</a></h2><p>To highlight recent research findings on effects of the short-chain fatty acid  in the control of body weight,  sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis.

Therefore, we examined the relationship between gut microbiota, blood metabolic markers, dietary habits and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Dietary habits, blood and fecal samples from 59 T2DM patients were recruited, and the association of intestinal microbiota with metabolic markers and dietary habits was analyzed.Total energy intake was 1,692 ± 380 kcal/day. Carbohydrate, fat and protein intakes were 57.5 ± 5.2, 23.2 ± 5.3 and 13.2 ± 2.2%, respectively. Dietary habits - high carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake - were associated with increased counts of Clostridium clusters IV and XI and decreased counts of Bifidobacterium spp., order Lactobacillales and Clostridium cluster IV. Protein intake was negatively correlated with fecal  and total SCFAs. Total SCFAs, propionate and  were negatively correlated with blood  levels and the homeostasis model of .Diets low in protein and carbohydrates favor a healthy gut microbiome and improve glucose tolerance in T2DM patients, although further elucidation of the role of the gut microbiome could lead to better therapies and prophylaxes.© 2016 S.

Experimental rats were induced by high fat diet feeding coupled with combined exposure to streptozotocin and nicotinamide. Treatment with EAF improved glucose tolerance and lipid profiles, but the  secretion was unaltered. Gene expression analyses on /adipocytokine signalling-related genes demonstrated tissue-specific transcriptional responses. In skeletal muscle and liver tissues, Socs1, Tnf and Mapk8 showed consistent transcript regulation. Furthermore, hepatic translational analyses revealed sensitization on proximal  signalling, with reduced expression of IRS1 serine phosphorylation, increased IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and increased phospho-AKT (Ser473). The present findings suggested that EAF exerted its effect by modulating  signalling, potentially via IRS1/AKT activation.

However, A-type-EGCG-dimer affects gluose metabolism in the liver and the underlying mechanism is not clarified. The present study aims to examine the protective effects of A-type-EGCG-dimer on Pb-induced hepatic , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in rats. Male wistar rats exposed to 0.05% w/v Pb  in the drinking water with or without A-type-EGCG-dimer coadministration (200 mg/kg body weight/day, intragastrically) for three months. We found that A-type-EGCG-dimer and pioglitazone supplementation significantly deceased glucose and  levels in plasma as compared with the Pb group. A-type-EGCG-dimer markedly prevents Pb-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis in livers. A-type-EGCG-dimer and pioglitazone reduced the expression levels of the GRP78, PEPCK, G6Pase, p-PERK, p-IRE1, p-JNK, ATF4, CHOP and increased p-AKT in livers of the Pb group. Moreover, A-type-EGCG-dimer reduced ROS production and restored the activities of SOD and GPx in livers. A-type-EGCG-dimer decreased Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3 and increased Bcl-2 in livers of Pb-exposed rats.

The aim was to elucidate the clinical background and detailed menstrual history of EC and/or AEH in young women with PCOS.From January 2001 to December 2013, women under 35 years of age who had been diagnosed with EC and/or AEH and who had been treated at Kumamoto University Hospital, Japan, were recruited. The patients' clinical characteristics, clinical stages of EC and/or AEH, medication and operation methods, endocrine profiles, and menstrual history were assessed retrospectively.Of all the cases of EC and/or AEH, 25 (4.6%) were under 35 years of age. The mean age was 29.0 years and all the patients were nulligravida. The clinical stages of EC and/or AEH that were identified included: AEH (five cases), stage IA (18 cases), IB (one case), and IIIA (one case). Fourteen (56%) cases met the criteria for PCOS. Both the Body Mass Index and Homeostatic Model Assessment- were significantly higher in the patients with PCOS than in the patients without PCOS.

All the patients with PCOS exhibited irregular menstruation or amenorrhea, the mean duration of which was 13.1 years before PCOS and EC and/or AEH were diagnosed.Although both the patients with and without PCOS had irregular menstruation, the patients with PCOS were less likely to have fertility-sparing surgery than the patients without PCOS because they had more advanced disease or failed to respond to medroxyprogesterone  therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28513986>Pleiotropic Effects of Chronic Phorbol Ester Treatment to Improve Glucose Transport in -Resistant Cardiomyocytes.</a></h2><p>Stimulation of glucose transport is an important determinant of myocardial susceptibility to ischemia and reperfusion. Stimulation of glucose transport is markedly impaired in cardiomyocytes exposed to free fatty acids (FFA). Deactivation of the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) by FFA contributes to glucose transport impairment, and could be corrected by chronic treatment with the phorbol ester TPA. However, TPA must have effects in addition to FAK reactivation to restore stimulated glucose transport. Chronic treatment with TPA improved basal and stimulated glucose transport in FFA-exposed, but not in control cardiomyocytes. Chronic FFA exposure induced the activation of PKCδ and PKCϵ. TPA markedly downregulated the expression of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ, suggesting that PKCδ or PKCϵ activation could contribute to inhibition of glucose transport by FFA. Rottlerin, a specific PKCδ inhibitor, improved glucose transport in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes; and PKCδ was reduced in the particulate fraction of FFA + TPA-exposed cardiomyocytes. TPA also activated Protein Kinase D 1(PKD1) in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes, as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 on Y916. Pharmaceutical inhibition of PKD1 only partially prevented the improvement of glucose transport by TPA. Chronic TPA treatment also increased basal and stimulated glycolysis and favored accumulation of lipid droplets in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, basal and stimulated glucose transport in cardiomyocytes is reduced by chronic FFA exposure, but restored by concomitant treatment with a phorbol ester. The mechanism of action of phorbol esters may involve downregulation of PKCδ, activation of PKD1 and a general switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism. J. Cell.

Therefore, the development of effective anticancer drugs for first-line therapy and for optimal second-line treatment is necessary. Because the 90-kDa molecular chaperone heat shock protein (Hsp90) contributes to the maturation of numerous mutated or overexpressed oncogenic proteins, targeting Hsp90 may offer an effective anticancer therapy. Here, we investigated antitumor activities and toxicity of a novel deguelin-derived C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor, designated L80. L80 displayed significant inhibitory effects on the viability, colony formation, angiogenesis-stimulating activity, migration, and invasion of a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and their sublines with acquired  to paclitaxel with minimal toxicity to normal lung epithelial cells, hippocampal cells, vascular endothelial cells, and ocular cells. Biochemical analyses and molecular docking simulation revealed that L80 disrupted Hsp90 function by binding to the C-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, leading to the disruption of the interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and Hsp90, downregulation of HIF-1α and its target genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and -like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and decreased the expression of various Hsp90 client proteins. Consistent with these in vitro findings, L80 exhibited significant antitumor and antiangiogenic activities in H1299 xenograft tumors. These results suggest that L80 represents a novel C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor with effective anticancer activities with minimal toxicities.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105287>Gut Microbiota Interacts with Markers of Adipose Tissue Browning,  Action and Plasma  in Morbid Obesity.</a></h2><p>To examine the potential relationship among gene expression markers of adipose tissue browning, gut microbiota, and  sensitivity in humans.Gut microbiota composition and gene markers of browning are analyzed in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue from morbidly obese subjects (n = 34).

During the first week after calving, both groups underwent glucose tolerance testing (0.25 g glucose/kg BW). Commercial assays were used to quantify the concentrations of glucose, , nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate, and markers of redox status in blood. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test (α = 0.05).Supplemented cows showed a lower risk for OS, as reflected by a lower OS index (P = .036), different areas under the curve for the concentrations of glucose (P < .01),  (P = .043), and NEFA (P = .041), more rapid elimination rates (P = .080, <.01 and .047 respectively), and shorter half-lives (P = .040, <.01 and .032) of these metabolites.Supplementation with antioxidants before calving resulted in greater  sensitivity after calving, thereby suggesting the role of OS in the development of IR in cattle and the potential benefits of antioxidant supplementation in minimizing the consequences of negative energy balance.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

A reduction in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity has been advanced to explain most lipid-modulating effects of NA. However, due to the central role of CETP in reverse cholesterol transport in humans, other effects of NA may have been hidden. As dogs have no CETP activity, we conducted this study to examine the specific effects of extended-release niacin (NA) on lipids and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester (CE) turnover in obese -Resistant dogs with increase plasma triglycerides.HDL kinetics were assessed in fasting dogs before and four weeks after NA treatment through endogenous labeling of cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI by simultaneous infusion of [1,2 13C2]  and [5,5,5 2H3] leucine for 8 h. Kinetic data were analyzed by compartmental modeling. In vitro cell cholesterol efflux of serum from NA-treated dogs was also measured.NA reduced plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and very-low-density lipoprotein TG concentrations (p < 0.05). The kinetic study also showed a higher cholesterol esterification rate (p < 0.05). HDL-CE turnover was accelerated (p < 0.05) via HDL removal through endocytosis and selective CE uptake (p < 0.05). We measured an elevated in vitro cell cholesterol efflux (p < 0.05) with NA treatment in accordance with a higher cholesterol esterification.NA decreased HDL cholesterol but promoted cholesterol efflux and esterification, leading to improved reverse cholesterol transport.

Fermentation end products, in particular the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) , are believed to be involved in these processes. We investigated the long-term effects of supplementation with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), an acetogenic fiber, on the composition of the human gut microbiota and human metabolism.We performed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention study of 44 overweight or obese (body mass index, 28-40 kg/m) prediabetic men and women (ages, 45-70 y) from October 2014 through October 2015 in Maastricht, The Netherlands. The participants were assigned randomly to groups who ingested 15 g GOS or isocaloric placebo (maltodextrin) daily with their regular meals for 12 weeks. Before and after this period, we collected data on peripheral and adipose tissue  sensitivity, fecal microbiota composition, plasma and fecal SCFA, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation, body composition, and hormonal and inflammatory responses. The primary outcome was the effect of GOS on peripheral  sensitivity, measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method.Supplementation of diets with GOS, but not placebo, increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium species in feces by 5-fold (P = .009; q = 0.144).

Alterations in the adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) may contribute to the adipose tissue remodeling associated with metabolic syndrome and impact the regional distribution of adipose tissue by generating inherently dysfunctional adipocytes. Here we examine the expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes and their relationship with the lipogenic, antioxidant and oxidative potential of adipocytes generated from visceral ASCs (adipo-visASCs) and subcutaneous ASCs (adipo-subASCs) from subjects with different metabolic profiles.Paired samples of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were processed to isolate the respective ASCs from normal-weight (Nw) subjects and obese patients with metabolic syndrome (METS) and without METS (NonMETS). qPCR was used to quantify the expression levels of the genes studied in both adipo-ASCs from the patient groups and those generated after silencing by small interfering RNA of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes. The accumulation of lipids was quantified by absorbance.No significant differences in cell yield or CD34CD31CD45 ASC percentage were observed between the different patient groups. Unlike adipo-visASCs, adipo-subASCs from METS patients showed a decrease in expression levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes as well as proteins linked to lipogenesis, antioxidant defense and fatty acid oxidation. Transcriptional silencing of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes in adipo-subASCs reduced lipid accumulation and affected transcription levels of lipogenic and antioxidant defense proteins.Adipo-subASCs may be more susceptible than adipo-visASCs to deterioration of the lipogenic, oxidative and antioxidant potential associated with metabolic syndrome. Intrinsic alterations in transcription levels of acetyl-CoA-producing enzymes may contribute to the metabolic reprogramming of adipo-subASCs from METS patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Our gut microbiota might affect the cardiometabolic phenotype by fermenting indigestible dietary components and thereby producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These SCFA are not only of importance in gut health and as signalling molecules, but might also enter the systemic circulation and directly affect metabolism or the function of peripheral tissues. In this Review, we discuss the effects of three SCFA (, propionate and butyrate) on energy homeostasis and metabolism, as well as how these SCFA can beneficially modulate adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver tissue function. As a result, these SCFA contribute to improved glucose homeostasis and  sensitivity. Furthermore, we also summarize the increasing evidence for a potential role of SCFA as metabolic targets to prevent and counteract obesity and its associated disorders in glucose metabolism and . However, most data are derived from animal and in vitro studies, and consequently the importance of SCFA and differential SCFA availability in human energy and substrate metabolism remains to be fully established.

The MPV value was significantly higher in the newly diagnosed PCOS patients compared with the other three groups independent of age, BMI, and C-reactive protein level in multiple regression analysis (P < 0.01). The MPV value of control group was comparable to the groups under ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  or metformin therapy (P = 1.0). There was no statistically significant difference in the white blood cell count among the groups. The MPV values were positively correlated with the homeostatic model assessment- and Ferriman-Gallwey Score (P = 0.044, r = 0.261; P = 0.037, r = 0.229, respectively). Ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  and metformin similarly appear to decrease MPV, a marker of cardiovascular risk. Therefore, a possible beneficial effect of ethinyl estradiol/cyproterone  and metformin on long-term cardiovascular morbidities in PCOS may be suggested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152001>Exploring the significance of sex hormone-binding globulin examination in the treament of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).</a></h2><p>To explore whether sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and free androgen index (FAI) can be seen as therapeutic effect indexes of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).The body mass index (BMI), basal sexual hormones, SHBG, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and fasting  (FINS) were collected from 579 women with PCOS, were divided into two groups according to BMI: obese group (n = 145) and non-obese group (n = 434), according to homeostasis model assessment of  status (HOMA-IR). Patients were then divided into four groups: A: non-obese without  (n = 174), B: non-obese with  (n = 260), C: obese without  (n = 34), D: obese with  (n = 111). A and B groups received Diane-35 alone, C and D groups received Diane-35 plus metformin for three months. Then clomiphene citrate and HMAG were used to induce ovulation then compared ovulation rate and pregnancy outcome.FAI decreased significantly and SHBG increased significantly in all groups. In A group FINS and HOMA-IR increased significantly (p < 0.05), but in B and D groups FINS and HOMA-IR decreased significantly (p < 0.05). After treatment the ovulation rate in non-obese group was higher than obese group (p < 0.01). Compared with non-ovulation patients, SHBG increased significantly and FAI decreased significantly in the patient with ovulation. Regarding the pregnancy outcome, FAI decreased significantly in delivery patients than spontaneous abortion patients. Furthermore, SHBG increased significantly.It was important to check SHBG and FAI during the treatment of PCOS patient.

Gut dysbiosis, an imbalance of gut microbiota, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, but its mechanisms are unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main fermentation products of gut microbiota and a link between the gut microbiota and the host's physiology. Here, we investigated a correlation among gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice. We detected enriched levels of Gram-positive bacteria and corresponding decreases in Gram-negative bacteria in 24-wk-old metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice compared with age-matched controls. The abundance of Bacteroidetes species decreased, the abundance of Firmicutes species increased, and nine genera of bacteria were altered in 24-wk-old TSOD mice. The total plasma SCFA level was significantly lower in the TSOD mice than in controls. The major plasma SCFA--decreased in TSOD mice, whereas propionate and butyrate increased. TSOD mice had no minor SCFAs (valerate and hexanoate) but normal mice did. We thus concluded that gut dysbiosis and consequent disruptions in plasma SCFA profiles occurred in metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice. We also propose that the TSOD mouse is a useful model to study gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324831>Loss of Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2 leads to impaired islet mass and beta cell survival.</a></h2><p>The regulation of pancreatic β cell mass is a critical factor to help maintain normoglycemia during . Nutrient-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) contribute to aspects of β cell function, including regulation of β cell mass. Nutrients such as free fatty acids (FFAs) contribute to precise regulation of β cell mass by signaling through cognate GPCRs, and considerable evidence suggests that circulating FFAs promote β cell expansion by direct and indirect mechanisms. Free Fatty Acid Receptor 2 (FFA2) is a β cell-expressed GPCR that is activated by short chain fatty acids, particularly . Recent studies of FFA2 suggest that it may act as a regulator of β cell function. Here, we set out to explore what role FFA2 may play in regulation of β cell mass. Interestingly, Ffar2(-/-) mice exhibit diminished β cell mass at birth and throughout adulthood, and increased β cell death at adolescent time points, suggesting a role for FFA2 in establishment and maintenance of β cell mass. Additionally, activation of FFA2 with Gαq/11-biased agonists substantially increased β cell proliferation in in vitro and ex vivo proliferation assays. Collectively, these data suggest that FFA2 may be a novel therapeutic target to stimulate β cell growth and proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29379255>Current trends in small molecule discovery targeting key cellular signaling events towards the combined management of diabetes and obesity.</a></h2><p>Non- dependent diabetes mellitus, also known as Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disorder leading to abnormalities in the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The major contributors in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) include  to  action, β cell dysfunction, an abnormality in glucose metabolism and storage, visceral obesity and to some extent inflammation and oxidative stress. , along with a defect in  secretion by the pancreatic β cells is instrumental towards progression to hyperglycemia. Increased incidence of obesity is also a major contributing factor in the escalating rates of type 2 diabetes. Drug discovery efforts are therefore crucially dependent on identifying individual molecular targets and validating their relevance to human disease. The current review discusses bioactive compounds from medicinal plants offering enhanced therapeutic potential for the combined patho-physiology of diabetes and obesity. We have demonstrated that 3β-taraxerol a pentacyclic triterpenoid (14-taraxeren-3-ol) isolated from the ethyl  extract of Mangifera indica, chlorogenic acid isolated from the methanol extract of Cichorium intybus, methyl tetracosanoate from the methanol extract of Costus pictus and vitalboside A derived from methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini exhibited significant effects on  stimulated glucose uptake causing  sensitizing effects on 3T3L1 adipocytes (an in vitro model mimicking adipocytes). Whereas, (3β)-stigmast-5-en-3-ol isolated from Adathoda vasica and Aloe emodin isolated from Cassia fistula showed significant  mimetic effects favoring glucose uptake in L6 myotubes (an in vitro model mimicking skeletal muscle cells). These extracts and molecules showed glucose uptake through activation of PI3K, an important  signaling intermediate. Interestingly, cinnamic acid isolated from the hydro-alcohol extract of Cinnamomum cassia was found to activate glucose transport in L6 myotubes through the involvement of GLUT4 via the PI3K-independent pathway. However, the activation of glucose storage was effective in the presence of 3β-taraxerol and aloe emodin though inhibition of GSK3β activity. Therefore, the mechanism of improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism exhibited by the small molecules isolated from our lab is discussed. However, Obesity is a major risk factor for type-2 diabetes leading to destruction of  receptors causing .

The purpose of this study was to identify potential intrinsic defects in lipid turnover and lipolysis in myotubes established from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. Lipid trafficking and lipolysis were measured by pulse-chase assay with radiolabeled substrates in myotubes from non-obese/non-diabetic (lean), obese/non-diabetic (obese) and obese/diabetic (T2D) subjects. Lipolytic protein content and level of Akt phosphorylation were measured by Western blot. HSL was overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. Myotubes established from obese and T2D subjects had lower lipolysis (-30-40%) when compared to lean, using oleic acid as precursor. Similar observations were also seen for labelled glycerol. Incorporation of oleic acid into diacylglycerol (DAG) and free fatty acid (FFA) level was lower in T2D myotubes, and  incorporation into FFA and complex lipids was also lower in obese and/or T2D subjects. Both protein expression of HSL (but not ATGL) and changes in DAG during lipolysis were markedly lower in cells from obese and T2D when compared to lean subjects. -stimulated glycogen synthesis (-60%) and Akt phosphorylation (-90%) were lower in myotubes from T2D, however, overexpression of HSL in T2D myotubes did not rescue the diabetic phenotype. In conclusion, intrinsic defects in lipolysis and HSL expression co-exist with reduced  action in myotubes from obese T2D subjects. Despite reductions in intramyocellular lipolysis and HSL expression, overexpression of HSL did not rescue defects in  action in skeletal myotubes from obese T2D subjects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(Asteraceae) has been valued for treating a variety of ailments such as gastro-intestinal, liver and pulmonary diseases, and has gained awareness for its beneficial effect on postprandial hyperglycemia. However, to best of our knowledge, no detailed study of the antidiabetic curative effects of this plant has been conducted yet.To determine the hypoglycemic and antidiabetic effect of dietary supplementation with Anvillea radiata extracts on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity and  in C57BL/6J mice in relation with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, pancreatic beta-cells and skeletal muscle protection, and digestive enzyme inhibiting properties.Six extracts (water soluble and organic) from aerial parts of the plant were analyzed phytochemically (total phenolic and flavonoid content) and screened for in vitro superoxide (by chemiluminescence) and hydroxyl radical (by electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping) scavenging, antioxidant (DPPH, TRAP and ORAC assays), xanthine oxidase, metal chelating, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory property, and protective effects on copper-induced lipoprotein oxidation. Then selected hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts were assessed for toxicity in normal human lung fibroblasts and A549 cancer cells using FMCA and MTT assays. Two water-soluble extracts having the best overall properties were assessed for their (i) protective effect at 1-15µg/mL on metabolic activity of rat insulinoma-derived INS-1 cells exposed to hyperglycemic medium, and (ii) acute hypoglycemic effect on 16-weeks HFD-induced diabetic mice. Then diabetic mice were administered HFD supplemented by extracts (up to 150mg/kg/day) for 12 additional weeks using standard diet as control and the antidiabetic drug, metformin (150mg/kg), as positive control. Then the antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of extracts were determined.Of the highly efficient polyphenolics-enriched hydroalcoholic and ethyl  extracts, the lyophilized aqueous (AQL) and butanol extracts were not toxic in cells (≤ 400µg/mL) or when given orally in normal mice (≤ 2000mg/kg), exerted a dose-dependent hypoglycemic action in diabetic mice, which was maximal at the dose of 150mg/kg. Upon administering this dose for 12 weeks, both extracts significantly ameliorated body weight control capacity, recovery of plasma glucose and  level, reduced oxidative stress in blood, myocardial and skeletal muscles, and improved hyperlipidemic and inflammatory status. Moreover, diabetes-related complications were optimally ameliorated by oral therapy based on halved doses (75mg/kg) of a mixture of AQL and metformin.Current investigation supports the traditional medicinal usage of Anvillea radiata and suggests that both readily accessible and low-cost bio-extracts have the potency to develop an antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic and protective agent against beta-cells and muscle dysfunction at doses compatible with the common practices of indigenous people for the management of metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Secondly, the anti-diabetes effects of the ethyl  extracts of the aerial parts/fruit (EAP/EAF) of P. alkekengi were evaluated in high-fat diet-fed and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (seven groups, n = 7) daily at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg for 28 days. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured with a glucometer and the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), glycated serum protein (GSP), and fasting  (FINS) were measured by ELISA. Furthermore,  sensitivity index (ISI) and homeostasis model assessment- index (HOMA-IR) were calculated based on FBG and FINS. Changes in blood glucose concentration were assessed after an oral glucose challenge in diabetic rats treated with EAF and EAP extracts. In all assays, rosiglitazone, a current antidiabetic drug and  sensitizer, was also tested. Finally, the compounds in EAP were identified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis.EAP increased the uptake of 2-NBDG, a measure of direct glucose uptake, in HepG2 cells. Next, in diabetic rats treated with P. alkegenki extracts for 28 days, the levels of FBG, TC, TG and GSP and were lowered effectively, while FINS was increased significantly. EAP/EAF enhanced  sensitivity significantly as measured by ISI and HOMA-IR along with oral glucose tolerance test analysis. The EAP generally exerted the greatest effects.

Then, the animals were treated with HEPa/EtOAc at two doses (125 and 250mg/kg/day) or metformin (200mg/kg/day) for 16 days. At the end of the experiment, body weight, fat pad weight, fasting serum glucose (FSG),  (FSI) and leptin were measured. Homeostasis Model Assessment for  (HOMA-IR) was also calculated. Glucose,  and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed. The expression and phosphorylation of IRβ(tyr), Akt(ser473), AMPKα and PGC1α in liver, muscle and adipose tissue were determined by Western blot analyses.Herein we demonstrate for the first time an improvement in  following HEPa/EtOAc administration in obese mice, as shown by increased glucose,  and pyruvate tolerance, as well as an improvement in FSG, FSI, HOMA-IR and circulating leptin levels, which together are in part due to enhancement of the  signaling pathway in its main target tissues. Surprisingly, the increase in activation of the AMPKα-PGC1-α axis by HEPa/EtOAc was similar to that produced by metformin treatment in the liver and muscle tissues.In conclusion, P. aculeata appears to be a source of therapeutic agent against obesity-related complications.Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29602978>Effect of Diane-35, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformin in Chinese polycystic ovary syndrome patients.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of Diane-35, alone or in combination with orlistat or metformin, on androgen and body fat percentage parameters in Chinese overweight and obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with .A total of 240 PCOS women were randomly allocated to receive Diane-35 alone (D group), Diane-35 plus orlistat (DO group), Diane-35 plus metformin (DM group), or Diane-35 plus orlistat plus metformin (DOM group).

Exposure to a high glucose concentration has recently been shown to increase phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser(485/491) of its α1/α2 subunit; however, the mechanism by which it does so is not known. Diacylglycerol (DAG), which is also increased in muscle exposed to high glucose, activates a number of signaling molecules including protein kinase (PK)C and PKD1. We sought to determine whether PKC or PKD1 is involved in inhibition of AMPK by causing Ser(485/491) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the PKC/D1 activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), which acts as a DAG mimetic. This caused dose- and time-dependent increases in AMPK Ser(485/491) phosphorylation, which was associated with a ∼60% decrease in AMPKα2 activity. Expression of a phosphodefective AMPKα2 mutant (S491A) prevented the PMA-induced reduction in AMPK activity. Serine phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPK activity were partially prevented by the broad PKC inhibitor Gö6983 and fully prevented by the specific PKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101. Genetic knockdown of PKD1 also prevented Ser(485/491) phosphorylation of AMPK. Inhibition of previously identified kinases that phosphorylate AMPK at this site (Akt, S6K, and ERK) did not prevent these events. PMA treatment also caused impairments in -signaling through Akt, which were prevented by PKD1 inhibition. Finally, recombinant PKD1 phosphorylated AMPKα2 at Ser(491) in cell-free conditions. These results identify PKD1 as a novel upstream kinase of AMPKα2 Ser(491) that plays a negative role in  signaling in muscle cells.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045936>Anti-Diabetic Potential of the Leaves of Anisomeles malabarica in Streptozotocin Induced Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a pandemic metabolic disorder that is affecting a majority of populations in recent years. There is a requirement for new drugs that are safer and cheaper due to the side effects associated with the available medications.We investigated the anti-diabetic activity of leaves of Anisomeles malabarica following bioactivity guided fractionation. The different solvent (hexane, ethyl , methanol and water) extracts of A. malabarica leaves were used in acute treatment studies to evaluate and identify the active fraction. The ethyl  extract was subjected to further fractionation using silica gel column chromatography and the compounds were identified by LC-SRM/MS and GC-MS. Additional chronic treatment studies were carried out using this active fraction (AMAF) for 30 days in experimental diabetic rats. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma  levels and glucose tolerance were measured along with /sensitivity indicators (HOMA-IR, HOMA-β and QUICKI) to assess the beneficial effects of A. malabarica in the management of diabetes mellitus.Among the different solvent extracts tested, ethyl  extract showed maximum (66%) anti-hyperglycemic activity. The hexane and ethyl  (1: 1) fraction that has maximum anti-diabetic activity was identified as active fraction of A. malabarica (AMAF). The FBG, HbA1c, plasma  levels and  sensitivity/ indicators such as glucose tolerance, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β and QUICKI were significantly improved to near normal in diabetic rats treated with AMAF.

Adenovirus-mediated JAZF1 overexpression was used to characterize the role of JAZF1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis in normal chow- or HFD-fed ApoE KO mice.  sensitivity was examined by EHC. Cholesterol de novo synthesis was measured by intraperitoneal [1-(14)C]  injection and atherosclerotic plaques were quantified by histological analysis. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the ability of JAZF1 to regulate HMGCR transcriptional activity. JAZF1 overexpression improved HFD-induced hepatic  in C57BL/6J mice. In HFD-fed ApoE KO mice, JAZF1 overexpression decreased serum cholesterol levels and hepatic cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting CREB-dependent HMGCR promoter transcriptional activity. Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion showed that JAZF1 overexpression had significantly reduced aortic and aortic sinus en face and cross-sectional plaque areas in HFD-fed ApoE KO mice. These data provide the first evidence for an important role of JAZF1 in increasing hepatic  sensitivity and preventing atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), a flagellin receptor, is required for gut microbiota homeostasis. Accordingly, TLR5-deficient (T5KO) mice are prone to develop microbiota-dependent metabolic syndrome. Here we observed that T5KO mice display elevated neutral lipids with a compositional increase of oleate [C18:1 (n9)] relative to wild-type littermates. Increased oleate contribution to hepatic lipids and liver SCD1 expression were both microbiota dependent. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and (13)C- label incorporation revealed elevated SCFA in ceca and hepatic portal blood and increased liver de novo lipogenesis in T5KO mice. Dietary SCFAs further aggravated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Deletion of hepatic SCD1 not only prevented hepatic neutral lipid oleate enrichment but also ameliorated metabolic syndrome in T5KO mice. Collectively, these results underscore the key role of the gut microbiota-liver axis in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to compare clinical and para-clinical responses to the treatment of phlebotomy using oral contraceptive pills (OCs) containing cyproterone  in women with PCOS.In this randomized clinical trial, 64 patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to the phlebotomy and OCs groups (n = 32 in each group). The intervention group, using a single treatment procedure, underwent venesection of 450 mL of whole blood at the early follicular phase of the spontaneous or progesterone-induced menstrual cycle. The control group received OCs pills for 3 months from the 1th day of spontaneous or progesterone-induced menstrual cycle onwards for 3 weeks, followed by a pill-free interval of 7 days. The women were evaluated after the 3-month intervention. The primary outcome measure was a change in the HOMA-IR and free androgen index (FAI). Secondary outcomes were changes in the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score and other clinical, biochemical and hormonal changes from the baseline (pre-treatment) to week 12.In the phlebotomy group, 27 (84.3%) and in the OCs group 30 (93.7%) of the women completed the 3-month follow-up. The median HOMA-IR significantly decreased from 3.5 to 2.7 in the phlebotomy, and from 3.1 to 2.8 in the OCs group, and the changes were comparable between the groups. Median changes in the FAI significantly decreased in both groups, but the differences were not statistically significant between the groups (P = 0.061). With regard to secondary outcomes, mean FG scores in both groups significantly decreased [from 16.8 (6) to 13.3 (7.4), P < 0.028] in the phlebotomy group and [from 14.3 (7) to 9.8 (7.6) in the OCs group, P = 0.001] after 3 months of treatment, but such changes had no statistically significant differences between the groups. During treatment, menstrual cycles became regular in all women in the OCs group and in 12.27 (44.4%) of the women in the phlebotomy group, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Despite no statistically significant differences in lipid profiles between the groups at the baseline, triglycerides were significantly higher in the OCs group compared to the phlebotomy at end of follow up (p = 0.019).Both treatment modalities had similar beneficial effects on  and on androgenic profiles. However, OCs was reported more effective in treating menstrual irregularities and phlebotomy had less adverse effects on triglyceride concentrations.Code: IRCT2013080514277N1 .</p></html>
