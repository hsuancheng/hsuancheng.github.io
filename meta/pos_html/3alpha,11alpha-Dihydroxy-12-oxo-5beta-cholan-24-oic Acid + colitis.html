Present study found that miR-19b was significantly downregulated in active Crohn's disease (CD). Using bioinformatics analysis, suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a physiological regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that controls several immuno-inflammatory diseases, was predicted to be a potential target of miR-19b. An inverse correlation between miR-19b and SOCS3 protein levels, but not mRNA, was identified in active-CD intestinal tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in Caco2 cells and HT29 cells, it was experimentally validated that miR-19b is a direct regulator of SOCS3. Using a luciferase reporter assay, it was confirmed that miR-19b directly recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SOCS3. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-19b decreased SOCS3 expression, leading to increased production of macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in Caco2 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-19b increased SOCS3 and decreased MIP-3α. Finally, intracolonically delivered miR-19b decreased the severity of  induced with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic  (TNBS). Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-19b suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting SOCS3 to modulate chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby prevents the pathogenesis of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887805>Baicalin down-regulates the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) effectively for rats with ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether baicalin, a Chinese herbal extract, down-regulates the expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), an inflammatory factor that regulates the function of macrophages (MΦ), in rats with trinitrobenzene sulphonic  (TNBS)-induced ulcerative  (UC). The results showed that baicalin simultaneously down-regulated the expression of MIF, the quantity of MΦs and the amount of MΦ-related cytokines, including macrophage chemotactic factor-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) and macrophage inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α, CCL20), in rats with UC. There was no statistical difference between baicailin and mesalazine in down-regulating the expression of MIF. Our study demonstrated that baicalin, an inexpensive but effective monomer, could be a new and alternative pharmaceutical for UC.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17272517>MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody protects against TNBS-induced colonic injury and inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>A characteristic feature of human inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease, is the presence of activated CD4(+) T cells. Recently, we have shown that colonic epithelial cell production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-, a CD4 T cell-directed chemokine, is elevated in inflammatory bowel disease. However, the functional relevance of MIP- production during intestinal inflammation is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether MIP- production is increased during murine 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  and to examine the effect of anti-MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody administration in this model. We found that the administration of TNBS significantly increased colonic MIP- protein levels in Balb/c mice. Consistent with this, a marked increase in the number of CCR6-bearing lamina propria CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was also observed in TNBS-treated animals. Treatment of mice with an anti-MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody significantly reduced TNBS-mediated increases in colonic weight-to-length ratio, mucosal ulceration, histological damage, and myeloperoxidase activity. TNBS-mediated increases in the number of CCR6-bearing lamina propria T cells were also substantially reduced by anti-MIP- neutralizing monoclonal antibody treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that blockade of MIP- bioactivity can significantly reduce TNBS-mediated colonic injury and T cell recruitment, suggesting a role for this chemokine in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25975030>[Chemical constituents of the roots of Macleaya microcarpa and activation efficacy of benzophenanthridine alkaloids for the transcription of xbp1 gene].</a></h2><p>Ongoing study on the chemical constituents of the roots of Macleaya microcarpa led to the isolation of eight compounds of derivatives of triterpenes and organic  in addition to some previously identified benzophenanthridines. The eight compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods as well as comparison with literature values as 1-oxo-2, 22 (30)-hopandien-29-oic  (1), 3-oxo-12-oleanen-30-oic  (2), 3α-hydroxy-12-oleanen-30-oic  (3), 3β-hydroxy-12-oleanen-30-oic  (4), ferulic  (5), ferulic  4-O-β-D-glucoside (6), 3-O-feruloylquinic  (7), and methyl 3-O-feruloylquinate (8). Of which, 1 is a new triterpenoid of hopanes and 2-8 are isolated from M microcarpa for the first time. In order to discover natural active compounds as potential agents of anti-ulcerative  (UC), an in vitro drug high-throughput screening model targeted x-box-binding protein 1 (xbp1) was employed to evaluate the activity of the major chemical constituents of M microcarpa. The result confirmed that two dihydrobenzophenanthridines, dihydrosanguinarine (9) and dihydrochelerythrine (10), showed a certain activity on activating the transcription of xbpl, a transcription factor (TF) associated with the occurrence, development, and potential treatment of UC, with their relative activating ratios being 1.76 and 1.77 times, respectively, as compared with control group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16306769>Increased expression of MIP-/CCL20 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ulcerative  and its down-regulation by sulfasalazine and glucocorticoid treatment.</a></h2><p>CCL20 expression is known to increase in the mucosal tissues of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Moreover, the discovery of Nod2 as the IBD1 susceptibility gene has underscored the significance of blood mononuclear cells in IBD pathogenesis.This study addresses whether CCL20 expression is similarly altered in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with ulcerative  (UC), a major type of IBD in Korea.Expression of CCL20 was significantly up-regulated in the PBMCs of patients with UC compared with those of normal healthy controls. Interestingly, untreated UC groups expressed higher levels of CCL20 mRNA than either treated UC or normal control groups, suggesting that CCL20 could be modulated by anti-inflammatory drugs. Accordingly, a strong association between CCL20 levels and disease activity index was observed. Supporting these findings, results from a 3-month follow-up study revealed that the UC groups treated with 5-aminosalicylic  and glucocorticoid exhibited dramatic decreases of CCL20 mRNA in PBMCs, accompanied by ameliorated disease states. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha- or interleukin-1beta-induced CCL20 secretion was greatly diminished by 5-aminosalicylic  and/or glucocorticoid treatment of human intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells. Of note, CCR6 cell populations were significantly reduced in the blood of severe patients with UC compared with normal controls, whereas no significant changes in CCR6 cell populations were observed in the blood of patients with mild UC or acute .Collectively, these findings suggest that CCL20 expression in blood mononuclear cells is associated with altered immune and inflammatory responses in patients with UC.</p></html>
