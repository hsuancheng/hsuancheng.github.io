We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, , C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, , Phe, Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower  concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315826>Effect of extrusion processing of soybean meal on ileal amino acid digestibility and growth performance of broiler chicks.</a></h2><p>The present experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of extrusion of inadequately processed soybean meal (SBM) on amino acid (AA) digestibility and performance of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of , , Cys, Leu, Phe, , Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily weight gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145747>Identification, structure-activity relationship and in silico molecular docking analyses of five novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides from stone fish (Actinopyga lecanora) hydrolysates.</a></h2><p>Stone fish is an under-utilized sea cucumber with many health benefits. Hydrolysates with strong ACE-inhibitory effects were generated from stone fish protein under the optimum conditions of hydrolysis using bromelain and fractionated based on hydrophobicity and isoelectric properties of the constituent peptides. Five novel peptide sequences with molecular  (mw) < 1000 daltons (Da) were identified using LC-MS/MS. The peptides including Ala-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Phe- (794.44 Da), -Val-Pro-Pro--Ala (638.88 Da), Leu-Ala-Pro-Pro--Met (628.85 Da), Glu-Val-Leu-Ile-Gln (600.77 Da) and Glu-His-Pro-Val-Leu (593.74 Da) were evaluated for ACE-inhibitory activity and showed IC50 values of 0.012 mM, 0.980 mM, 1.310 mM, 1.440 mM and 1.680 mM, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory effects of the peptides were further verified using molecular docking study. The docking results demonstrated that the peptides exhibit their effect mainly via hydrogen and electrostatic bond interactions with ACE. These findings provide evidence about stone fish as a valuable source of raw materials for the manufacture of antihypertensive peptides that can be incorporated to enhance therapeutic relevance and commercial significance of formulated functional foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781926>Complete Covalent Structure of Human Platelet Factor 4.</a></h2><p>The amino acid sequence of the subunit of human platelet factor 4 has been determined.

Experiment 1 was conducted to validate a dietary formulation approach in which broilers were fed 1 of 5 diets including a 19.0% CP corn-soybean meal based (CSBM) diet, a LCP control diet (16.7% CP) that matched the AA profile of the CSBM diet, and 3 LCP diets with 30% reductions in standardized ileal digestible concentrations of TSAA, , or  from 14 to 23 d post-hatch. Body weight gain and G:F were greatest (P < 0.05) and similar for broilers fed the CSBM and LCP control diets, whereas reductions in , TSAA, and  each decreased (P < 0.05) G:F of broilers. In Experiment 2, birds were allotted to 18 treatment groups in a factorial arrangement of 9 dietary treatments × 2 infection states. Dietary treatments included a LCP control diet similar to that fed in Experiment 1 and 8 LCP diets with 40% individual reductions in TSAA, , , Val, Ile, Arg, Phe + , or Gly + Ser. Broilers received experimental diets from 10 d to 28 d post-hatch and were inoculated with 0 or 4.0 × 10 sporulated E. acervulina oocysts at 15 d. Decreased (P < 0.05) growth performance (10 to 28 d) of broilers was observed with each AA reduction, except Phe + , compared with birds fed the LCP control diet. Body weight gain and G:F were lowest (P < 0.05) for birds fed diets reduced in  or Val. Eimeria acervulina decreased growth performance and plasma carotenoids of broilers, but effects varied among dietary treatment groups as indicated by diet × infection interactions (P < 0.05). Dietary AA reductions did not alter (P > 0.05) the increase in intestinal gene expression of interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, or interleukin-10 observed in E. acervulina-infected birds.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862400>Optimal in-feed amino acid ratio for broiler breeder hens based on deletion studies.</a></h2><p>An ideal amino acid ratio (IAAR) for breeder hens is needed for maximum nitrogen retention (NR) taking into account nitrogen deposition in  (ND ), feathers (ND ) and egg mass (NEM) to improve dietary protein efficiency. Thus, the aim of this study was to apply the deletion method to derive the IAAR for broiler breeder hens. The nitrogen balance trials were performed from 31 to 35 weeks and from 46 to 50 weeks. Twelve treatments with eight replicates and one hen per cage were used. A balanced diet (BD) was formulated to meet the requirement of all nutrients. The other diets were formulated diluting 55% of BD with corn starch and refilled with amino acids (AAs) and other ingredients, except the AA tested. Each trial lasted 25 days. Feather losses, egg production and egg  were recorded daily, and the samples were stored to further determine NEM and nitrogen in feather losses (ND ). At the start and the end of each period, a group of birds were slaughtered to further determine ND and ND . The NR was calculated as the sum of ND , ND , ND , NEM and the nitrogen maintenance requirement (NMR). The deletion of valine greatly depressed the NR in peak production (31 to 35 weeks) while the deletion of the isoleucine greatly depressed the NR of the hens from 46 to 50 weeks of age. The percentual reduction in NR and the per cent of the AA to delete from the BD were used to calculate the AA requirement. The average IAAR was  100, Met+Cys 86, Trp 23,  80, Arg 113, Val 90, Ile 91, Leu 133, Phe+ 108, Gly+Ser 94 and His 35. The IAAR was in line with the recommendation from the literature, validating deletion method with the advantages from a rapid and low-cost procedure.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959521>Meta-regression analysis to predict the influence of branched-chain and large neutral amino acids on growth performance of pigs1.</a></h2><p>A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), their interactions, and interactions with large neutral amino acids (LNAA) to develop prediction equations for growth performance of pigs. Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average  (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:, Leu:, Val:, BCAA:, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, :, Leu:, Ile:, Val:, BCAA:, (Phe+):, Leu:(Phe+), Ile:(Phe+), Val:(Phe+), BCAA:(Phe+), LNAA:, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the  statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:) + (20.2659 × Ile:) - (0.1479 × Ile: × Ile:) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:) + (1.7284 × Val:) - (0.00795 × Val: × Val:) - (1.7594 × Met:); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu: negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

The newly isolated bacterial strain mj1212 was identified as B. megaterium using phylogenetic analysis and, its phosphate solubilization ability was shown by the clear zone formation on National Botanical Research Institute's Phosphate medium. Moreover, the phosphate solubilization ability of B. megaterium mj1212 was enhanced by optimal culture conditions at pH 7.0 and 35 °C which might be due to the presence of malic and quinic acid in the culture medium. The beneficial effect of B. megaterium mj1212 in mustard plants was determined by an increasing shoot length, root length and fresh weight of plants. In the biochemical analysis revealed that chlorophyll, sucrose, glucose, fructose and amino acids (Asp, , Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Val, Met, Ilu, Leu, , Phe, , His, Arg and Pro) were higher in B. megaterium mj1212 treated plants, when compared to their control. The result of present study suggests that B. megaterium mj1212 treatment could be act as phosphate biofertilizer to improve the plant growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504948>Targeted disruption of TORC1 retards young squab growth by inhibiting the synthesis of crop milk protein in breeding pigeon (Columba livia).</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to explore the regulatory role of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons (Columba livia). Three groups of breeding pigeons in the lactation period (n = 30 pairs/group) were respectively injected with rapamycin (RAPA, a specific inhibitor of the target of rapamycin complex) at doses of 0 (vehicle, control), 0.6, or 1.2 mg/kg  (BW)/day via the wing vein for 7 days. The average daily feed intake (ADFI) and BW of the breeding pigeons and the BW of young squabs were respectively recorded throughout the experimental period. The breeding pigeons were sacrificed to collect their crop tissues, crop milk, and serum on the eighth day of the experiment. The results showed that neither 0.6 nor 1.2 mg/kg BW RAPA injection affected BW loss or ADFI in breeding pigeons (P > 0.05), while crop thickness and crop relative  were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the 1.2 mg/kg BW rapamycin-injected group. Simultaneously, RAPA (especially at 1.2 mg/kg BW) decreased the crude protein, αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein, and amino acid contents (Asp, , Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Cys, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, , , His, Arg, and Pro) of crop milk (P < 0.05) and the concentrations of albumin, total protein, and uric acid in the serum of breeding pigeons (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of TORC1 pathway-related proteins (TORC1, S6K1, S6, 4EBP1, and eIF4E) was downregulated in the crop tissues of breeding pigeons by 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg BW/day RAPA injection (P < 0.05). Accordingly, the average daily gain (ADG) of young squabs declined, and the mortality rate increased significantly (P < 0.05). Together, the results showed that RAPA reduced protein and amino acid levels in the crop milk of breeding pigeons and retarded young squab growth, suggesting a crucial role of TORC1 in crop milk synthesis in breeding pigeons.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423885>Effect of fermented biogas residue on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effect of fermented biogas residue (FBR) of wheat on the performance, serum biochemical parameters, and meat quality in pigs.We selected 128 pigs (the mean initial  was 40.24±3.08 kg) and randomly allocated them to 4 groups (1 control group and 3 treatment groups) with 4 replicates per group and 8 pigs per pen in a randomized complete block design based on initial  and sex. The control group received a corn-soybean meal-based diet, the treatment group fed diets containing 5%, 10%, and 15% FBR, respectively (abbreviated as FBR5, FBR10, and FBR15, respectively). Every group received equivalent-energy and nitrogen diets. The test lasted 60 days and was divided into early and late stages. Blood and carcass samples were obtained on 60 d. Meat quality was collected from two pigs per pen.During the late stage, the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of the treatment groups was greater than that of the control group (p<0.05). During the entire experiment, the average daily gain of the treatment groups was higher than that of the control group (p<0.05). Fermented biomass residue did not significantly affect serum biochemical parameters or meat quality, but did affect amino acid profiles in pork. The contents of Asp, Arg, , Phe, Leu, , Ser, , Pro, Ala, essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, and total amino acids in pork of FBR5 and FBR10 were greater than those of the control group (p<0.05).These combined results suggest that feeding FBR could increase the average daily gain and average daily feed intake in pigs and the content of several flavor-promoting amino acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287398>Exploration of the molecular interactions between angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) and the inhibitory peptides derived from hazelnut (Corylus heterophylla Fisch.).</a></h2><p>The mechanism of action of food-derived angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides has not been completely elucidated. In the present study, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass (LC-ESI-MS/MS) were employed for purifying and identifying the ACE inhibitory peptides from hazelnut. To understand the mode of action of these peptides, ACE inhibition kinetics, in vitro and in vivo bioavailability assays, active site analysis, and interaction between the inhibitory peptides and ACE were investigated. The results identified novel ACE inhibitory peptides Ala-Val--Val-Leu (AVKVL), -Leu-Val-Arg (YLVR), and -Leu-Val-Gly-Arg (TLVGR) with IC values of 73.06, 15.42, and 249.3 μM, respectively. All peptides inhibited the ACE activity via a non-competitive mode. The binding free energies of AVKVL, YLVR, and TLVGR for ACE were -3.46, -6.48, and -7.37 kcal/mol, respectively. The strong inhibition of ACE by YLVR may be attributed to the formation of cation-pi interactions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
