Participant groups were defined based on the share of consumed organic products; to discriminate between effects of food origin and food patterns, healthy diet indicators were considered in some statistical models.Consumption of organic food was associated with a more favourable pre-pregnancy BMI and lower prevalence of gestational diabetes. Compared with participants consuming no organic food (reference group), a marker of dairy products intake (pentadecanoic acid) and trans-fatty acids from natural origin (vaccenic and rumenic acids) were higher among participants consuming organic food (organic groups), whereas elaidic acid, a marker of the intake of trans-fatty acids found in industrially hydrogenated fats, was lower. Plasma levels of homocysteine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in the organic groups than in the reference group. Differences in pentadecanoic acid,  and vitamin D retained statistical significance when correcting for indicators of the healthy diet pattern associated with the consumption of organic food.Consumption of organic food during pregnancy is associated with several health-related characteristics and blood biomarkers. Part of the observed associations is explained by food patterns accompanying the consumption of organic food.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29446544>Association between plasma trans-fatty acid concentrations and diabetes in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</a></h1><p>A diet high in trans-fatty acids (TFA) induces insulin resistance in rodent models and primates. However, previous epidemiological studies on the association between TFAs, based primarily on self-reported intake from the diet, and diabetes in humans have yielded conflicting results. Herein we examined the associations of objectively measured plasma TFA concentrations with diabetes in a large population-based study among US adults.We included 3801 participants aged ≥20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 and 2009-10. Four major TFAs, namely palmitelaidic acid (C16:1 n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1 n-9t),  (C18:1 n-7t), and linolelaidic acid (C18:2 n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Diabetes was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis, plasma fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quintile of plasma TFAs was 2.19 (1.27-3.79) for total TFAs (P  = 0.01), 2.34 (1.48-3.72) for elaidic acid (P  = 0.0004), 1.33 (0.82-2.15) for linolelaidic acid (P  = 0.18), 1.58 (0.97-2.58) for palmitelaidic acid (P  = 0.02), and 1.64 (0.95-2.84) for  (P  = 0.08). In addition, total TFAs, elaidic acid, palmitelaidic acid, and  were significantly associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the insulin resistance index, and HbA1c.In a nationally representative population, plasma TFAs, in particular elaidic acid, were positively associated with diabetes and biomarkers of glucose metabolism.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498854>Assessment of anti-diabetic activity of an ethnopharmacological plant Nerium oleander through alloxan induced diabetes in mice.</a></h1><p>Nerium oleander L. (syn. Nerium indicum Mill. and Nerium odorum Aiton.) is used for its anti-diabetic properties in Pakistan, Algeria, Morocco and is also recognized in Ayurveda. The present study was undertaken to investigate the anti-diabetic capacity of a standardized hydromethanolic extract of Nerium oleander in alloxan induced diabetes in mice.Nerium oleander leaf extract (NOLE) was orally administered at 50 and 200mg/kg body weight (BW) dose to alloxanized mice (blood glucose >200mg/dl). After 20 consecutive days of treatment, various diabetic parameters were studied and compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was employed to reveal the phytochemical composition of the plant extract.NOLE demonstrated antihyperglycaemic activity by reducing 73.79% blood glucose level after 20 days of treatment. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed increase in glucose tolerance as evident by 65.72% decrease in blood glucose in 3h post treatment. Percentage decrease in different liver marker enzymes were significant along with decrease in triglyceride and cholesterol levels, displaying potent antihyperlipidemic activity. Peroxidase and catalase activity in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle were significantly restored besides marked reduction in lipid peroxidation and normalization of hepatic glycogen level in the NOLE treated alloxanized mice. Different bioactive phytocompounds with potent anti-diabetic activity were identified by GC-MS and HPLC analysis.The present investigation revealed that Nerium oleander possess potent anti-diabetic activity as claimed in different ethnopharmacological practices.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we reveal new mechanism(s) by which VA can alter body fat distribution, energy utilization and dysfunctional lipid metabolism in an animal model of obesity displaying features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Obese JCR:LA-cp rats were assigned to a control diet that included dairy-derived fat or the control diet supplemented with 1% VA. VA reduced total body fat (-6%), stimulated adipose tissue redistribution [reduced mesenteric fat (-17%) while increasing inguinal fat mass (29%)] and decreased adipocyte size (-44%) versus control rats. VA supplementation also increased metabolic rate (7%) concomitantly with an increased preference for whole-body glucose utilization for oxidation and increased insulin sensitivity [lower HOMA-IR (-59%)]. Further, VA decreased nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores (-34%) and reduced hepatic (-27%) and intestinal (-39%) triglyceride secretion relative to control diet, while exerting differential transcriptional regulation of SREBP1 and FAS amongst other key genes in the liver and the intestine. Adding VA to dairy fat alleviates features of MetS potentially by remodeling adipose tissue and attenuating ectopic lipid accumulation in a rat model of obesity and MetS. Increasing VA content in the diet (naturally or by fortification) may be a useful approach to maximize the health value of dairy-derived fats.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Long-term exposure of the beta-cell to high levels of fatty acids causes enhanced insulin secretion at low glucose (basal insulin release), while glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is decreased or unchanged. We have previously demonstrated that the spatial configuration of fatty acids (cis and trans isomers) is of importance for the acute impact on the beta-cell function. In this study we aimed to elucidate whether the spatial configuration also influenced beta-cell function after long-term exposure. Thus, we compared the effect of 3 days culture of INS-1 cells with cis (cis C 18:1-11) and trans  (trans C 18:1-11), as well as oleic (cis C 18:1-9) and elaidic acid (trans C 18:1-9), on basal and glucose-stimulated insulin release. All fatty acids tested increased basal insulin release; however, a significantly lower basal insulin release was demonstrated for cells cultured with 0.3 to 0.4 mmol/L trans  compared to equimolar levels of the cis isomer. GSIS was not changed by cis or trans  or by oleic acid, whereas it was stimulated by 0.3 to 0.4 mmol/L elaidic acid. The mechanisms behind the fatty acid-induced changes in the beta cells have been linked to changes in glucose and fatty acid oxidation. We demonstrated an increased fatty acid oxidation in beta cells after long-term exposure to all of the tested fatty acids. Interestingly, both trans isomers (trans vaccenic and elaidic acid) induced higher fatty acid oxidation than the cis isomers (cis vaccenic and oleic acid, respectively). No changes in glucose oxidation were found when INS-1 cells were cultured with either of the fatty acids. The increased fatty acid oxidation was associated with an increased content of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) mRNA, but no difference in the content of CPT-I mRNA to the different fatty acids was found. Insulin mRNA expression in beta cells was not affected by the fatty acids. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the pathological changes in insulin secretion from INS-1 cells to long-term culture with elevated levels of fatty acids are more pronounced for the cis (cis  and oleic acid) rather than the trans isomers (trans  and elaidic acid). We suggest that this, at least in part, may be explained by a lower fatty acid oxidation in cells cultured with the cis compared to the trans fatty acid isomers. Apparently, the difference in fatty acid oxidation was not caused by an increased induction of CPT-I mRNA, nor by changes in glucose oxidation or insulin mRNA in beta cells chronically exposed to the fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23957001>Antioxidant and α -amylase inhibitory property of phyllanthus virgatus L.: an in vitro and molecular interaction study.</a></h1><p>The present study on Phyllanthus virgatus, known traditionally for its remedial potential, for the first time provides descriptions of the antioxidant and inhibition of α -amylase enzyme activity first by in vitro analyses, followed by a confirmatory in silico study to create a stronger biochemical rationale. Our results illustrated that P. virgatus methanol extract exhibited strong antioxidant and oxidative DNA damage protective activity than other extracts, which was well correlated with its total phenolic content. In addition, P. virgatus methanol extract strongly inhibited the α -amylase activity (IC50 33.20 ± 0.556  μ g/mL), in a noncompetitive manner, than acarbose (IC50 76.88 ± 0.277  μ g/mL), which showed competitive inhibition. Moreover, this extract stimulated the glucose uptake activity in 3T3-L1 cells and also showed a good correlation between antioxidant and α -amylase activities. The molecular docking studies of the major bioactive compounds (9,12-octadecadienoic acid, asarone, , and acrylic acid) revealed via GC-MS analysis from this extract mechanistically suggested that the inhibitory property may be due to the synergistic effect of these bioactive compounds. These results provide substantial basis for the future use of P. virgatus methanol extract and its bioactive compound in in vivo system for the treatment and management of  as well as in the related condition of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24429537>trans Palmitoleic acid arises endogenously from dietary .</a></h1><p>trans Palmitoleic acid (t-16:1n-7, or 16:1 t9 in the δ nomenclature usually applied to trans fatty acids and used herein) arouses great scientific interest because it has been suggested to serve as a biomarker for lower risks of type 2  and coronary artery disease.Although 16:1 t9 has been assumed to derive from dietary sources, we examined the hypothesis that 16:1 t9 might also be endogenously produced from its metabolic precursor  (t-18:1n-7 or 18:1 t11).We reevaluated fatty acid data obtained from one human intervention study and one cellular model in both of which 18:1 t11 was supplemented. Both studies have already been published, but to our knowledge, 16:1 t9 has not yet been considered. This reanalysis of the datasets was reasonable because a new methodology for identifying 16:1 cis and trans isomers allowed us to address the subject presented in this article.Data showed that the systemic or intracellular increase in 16:1 t9 was strongly correlated with the increase in 18:1 t11 after the dietary intake or cellular uptake of 18:1 t11. The conversion rate in humans was, on average, 17%.Our findings suggest that endogenous 16:1 t9 is not, as has been assumed, exclusively diet derived but may also be produced by the partial β oxidation of dietary 18:1 t11.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22714958>The intestinal bioavailability of  and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and -γ in a rodent model of dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome.</a></h1><p>Evidence suggests a neutral to beneficial role of certain trans fatty acids (TFA) from natural ruminant sources. Trans11-18:1 (, VA), the most predominant ruminant TFA and a precursor to conjugated linoleic acid, has been shown to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia and symptoms of hepatic steatosis in animal models. The objective of this study was to assess the intestinal bioavailability of various VA sources including synthetic free fatty acid (FFA) and natural ruminant triglyceride forms, as well as the mechanistic pathways that mediate VA's bioactivity.VA acts as a partial agonist to both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and PPAR-γ in vitro, with similar affinity compared to commonly known PPAR agonists. It was further confirmed that VA at 30 and 100 μM concentrations suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy vitro in a PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent manner. In vivo, feeding of VA (1%, w/w) resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-γ in the mucosa of JCR:LA-cp rats, a model of the metabolic syndrome (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) compared to control. In addition, VA from a triglyceride source had greater intestinal bioavailability in vivo compared to VA provided in an FFA form (p < 0.01).The activation of PPAR-α- and PPAR-γ-dependent pathways provides a mechanistic explanation of how VA improves blood lipids and related metabolic disorders during conditions of hyperlipidemia.

Detrimental effects of consumption of industrial trans-fatty acids (TFA) (elaidic acid; 18 : 1Δ9t) from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils on CVD risk factors are well documented. In addition, epidemiological data suggest that chronic consumption of industrial sources of TFA could alter insulin sensitivity and predispose for type 2 . However, intervention studies on this issue have remained inconclusive. Moreover, very little information is available on the effect of natural sources of TFA (; 18 : 1Δ11t) coming from dairy products and ruminant meat on the development of CVD and type 2 .

The effects of single trans-fatty acid isomers are largely unexplored. The present study examined the effects of a 6-week supplementation with two trans-18 : 1 isomers (trans-11 and trans-12) in human subjects on immune cells, several inflammatory and immunological biomarkers (for example, IL, TNFalpha, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, prostacyclin, phagocytic process). Following a 2-week adaptation period without supplements, the test group (n 12) received  (trans-11-18:1) and trans-12-18 : 1 in equal amounts (6.0 g/d) for 6 weeks. The control group (n 12) consumed an oil without trans-fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). Samples were collected at the end of both periods. Trans-11- and trans-12-18 : 1 were significantly increased in cellular lipids. The endogenous synthesis of cis-9, trans-11-CLA from trans-11-18 : 1 was demonstrated via increased CLA in cellular lipids of the test group. Generally, trans-isomer supplementation did not affect either inflammatory biomarkers (for example, IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha) or immune function (for example, phagocytosis) during the present study. The dietary supplementation of trans-11- and trans-12-18 : 1 (6 g/d) and their accumulation in leucocytes had no effects on biomarkers of inflammation and immune function. However, because of the limited data on the safety of trans-fatty acid intake and effects of individual trans isomers on human health (for example, trans-9-18 : 1, trans-10-18 : 1) at present, it is prudent to reduce trans-fat intake in general.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199725>The scope for manipulating the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of beef: a review.</a></h1><p>Since 1950, links between intake of saturated fatty acids and heart disease have led to recommendations to limit consumption of saturated fatty acid-rich foods, including beef. Over this time, changes in food consumption patterns in several countries including Canada and the USA have not led to improvements in health. Instead, the incidence of , type II diabetes and associated diseases have reached epidemic proportions owing in part to replacement of dietary fat with refined carbohydrates. Despite the content of saturated fatty acids in beef, it is also rich in heart healthy cis-monounsaturated fatty acids, and can be an important source of long-chain omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in populations where little or no oily fish is consumed. Beef also contains polyunsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation products, including vaccenic and rumenic acids, which have been shown to have anticarcinogenic and hypolipidemic properties in cell culture and animal models. Beef can be enriched with these beneficial fatty acids through manipulation of beef cattle diets, which is now more important than ever because of increasing public understanding of the relationships between diet and health. The present review examines recommendations for beef in human diets, the need to recognize the complex nature of beef fat, how cattle diets and management can alter the fatty acid composition of beef, and to what extent content claims are currently possible for beef fatty acids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22252473>Clinical dyslipidaemia is associated with changes in the lipid composition and inflammatory properties of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins from women with type 2 .</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to use lipidomics to determine if the lipid composition of apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins is modified by dyslipidaemia in type 2  and if any of the identified changes potentially have biological relevance in the pathophysiology of type 2 .VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic and dyslipidaemic type 2 diabetic women and controls were isolated and quantified with HPLC and mass spectrometry. A detailed molecular characterisation of VLDL triacylglycerols (TAG) was also performed using the novel ozone-induced dissociation method, which allowed us to distinguish  (C18:1 n-7) from oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) in specific TAG species.Lipid class composition was very similar in VLDL and LDL from normolipidaemic type 2 diabetic and control participants. By contrast, dyslipidaemia was associated with significant changes in both lipid classes (e.g. increased diacylglycerols) and lipid species (e.g. increased C16:1 and C20:3 in phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester and increased C16:0 [palmitic acid] and  in TAG). Levels of palmitic acid in VLDL and LDL TAG correlated with insulin resistance, and VLDL TAG enriched in palmitic acid promoted increased secretion of proinflammatory mediators from human smooth muscle cells.We showed that dyslipidaemia is associated with major changes in both lipid class and lipid species composition in VLDL and LDL from women with type 2 . In addition, we identified specific molecular lipid species that both correlate with clinical variables and are proinflammatory. Our study thus shows the potential of advanced lipidomic methods to further understand the pathophysiology of type 2 .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27144932>Longitudinal Associations of Phospholipid and Cholesteryl Ester Fatty Acids With Disorders Underlying Diabetes.</a></h1><p>Specific serum fatty acid (FA) profiles predict the development of incident type 2 diabetes; however, limited longitudinal data exist exploring their role in the progression of insulin sensitivity (IS) and β-cell function.To examine the longitudinal associations of the FA composition of serum phospholipid (PL) and cholesteryl ester (CE) fractions with IS and β-cell function over 6 years.The Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort is a longitudinal observational study, with clinic visits occurring every 3 years. Three visits have been completed, totaling 6 years of follow-up.Individuals (n = 477) at risk for diabetes recruited from the general population in London and Toronto, Canada.Values from an oral glucose tolerance test were used to compute 1/HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index for IS, the insulinogenic index over HOMA-IR, and the insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 for β-cell function. Thin-layer chromatograph and gas chromatograph quantified FA. Generalized estimating equations were used for the analysis.IS and β-cell function declined by 8.3-19.4% over 6 years. In fully adjusted generalized estimating equation models, PL cis-vaccenate (18:1n-7) was positively associated with all outcomes, whereas γ-linolenate (GLA; 18:3n-6) and stearate (18:0) were negatively associated with IS. Tests for time interactions revealed that PL eicosadienoate (20:2n-6) and palmitate (16:0) and CE dihomo-γ-linolenate (20:3n-6), GLA, and palmitate had stronger associations with the outcomes after longer follow-up.In a Canadian population at risk for diabetes, we found that higher PL stearate and GLA and lower cis- predicted consistently lower IS and β-cell function over 6 years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803879>Associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway with risk of metabolic syndrome in a cohort study of middle-aged and older Chinese.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies suggest that elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) might be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. Few prospective studies have been conducted, especially among populations with a high carbohydrate intake, to determine whether DNL fatty acids are associated with the risk of the metabolic syndrome (MetS).We aimed to investigate associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the DNL pathway-including myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), stearic acid (18:0),  (18:1n-7), and oleic acid (18:1n-9)-with the risk of MetS in a Chinese population with an average carbohydrate intake of >60% of energy.A total of 1176 free-living Chinese men and women aged 50-70 y from Beijing and Shanghai were included in our analysis, giving rise to 412 incident MetS cases during 6 y of follow-up. Erythrocyte fatty acids and metabolic traits were measured in these participants.Erythrocyte fatty acids in the DNL pathway were correlated with a high ratio of carbohydrate-to-fat intake, less favorable lipid profiles, and elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,  acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the  and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation.

In this study, we investigated the effect of VA on insulin secretion in vivo in rats and in vitro in human and rat islets after diabetogenic insult.Hyperglycemic clamp showed that VA dietary supplementation for 8 weeks significantly increased glucose turnover in rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D), accompanied by an elevated plasma C-peptide concentration, indicating improved insulin secretion. The β-cell area and proliferation rate were higher in T2D+VA than T2D group. Isolated islets from T2D+VA rats had higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) than T2D group. In vitro, VA treatment for 24 and 48 h significantly enhanced GSIS in rat and human islets after diabetogenic challenges. The mRNA expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and regenerating islet-derived 1α (REG-1α) were consistently increased by VA in both rat and human islets.These results indicate that VA may improve insulin secretion and growth of islets in T2D, at least partly by altering GPR40 and REG-1α mRNA expression.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This in vitro study determined the effect of individual fatty acids (FA) found in dairy, and FA mixtures representative of a high SFA and a low SFA dairy lipid on markers of endothelial function in healthy and type II diabetic aortic endothelial cells.Cells were incubated for 24 h with FA mixtures (400 μM) and individual FA: oleic acid (OA; 150 μM); palmitic acid (PA; 150 μM); stearic acid (SA: 40 μM); trans-palmitelaidic acid (trans-PA; 20 μM); trans- (trans-VA; 20 μM); α-linolenic acid (ALA; 20 μM) and linoleic acid (LA; 20 μM). Cellular adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured using ELISA and a chemiluminescent-based assay, respectively. Relative gene expression of these markers, including the insulin receptor, was performed using real-time PCR as well as FA compositions of cell pellets by gas chromatography.FA mixtures affected sE-selectin concentrations (P = 0.008), with concentrations lower following the high SFA compared to the low SFA mixture (P = 0.004), while NO concentrations were higher in diabetic compared to healthy cells (P = 0.029). Individual FA affected NO (P = 0.007) and sE-selectin (P = 0.040) concentrations with an increase following PA incubation relative to all other FA treatments (P < 0.05). PA increased sE-selectin compared with other FA treatments (P < 0.05). sE-selectin concentrations were also higher in healthy compared to diabetic cells (P = 0.023).

The major dietary sources of these unusual fatty acids are foods derived from ruminant animals, in particular dairy products. The main form of CLA, cis-9, trans-11-18:2, can be produced directly by bacterial hydrogenation in the rumen or by delta-9 desaturation of the co-product  (trans-11-18:1) in most mammalian tissues including man. The second most abundant isomer of CLA is the trans-10, cis-12-18:2 form. Initially identified in grilled beef as a potential anti-carcinogen a surprising number of health benefits have subsequently been attributed to CLA mixtures and more recently to the main individual isoforms. It is also clear from recent studies that the two main isoforms can have different effects on metabolism and cell functions and can act through different cell signalling pathways. The majority of studies on body compositional effects (i.e. fat loss, lean gain), on cancer and cardiovascular disease attenuation, on insulin sensitivity and  and on immune function have been conducted with a variety of animal models. Observations clearly emphasise that differences exist between mammalian species in their response to CLAs with mice being the most sensitive. Recent studies indicate that some but not all of the effects observed in animals also pertain to human volunteers. Reports of detrimental effects of CLA intake appear to be largely in mice and due mainly to the trans-10, cis-12 isomer. Suggestions of possible deleterious effects in man due to an increase in oxidative lipid products (isoprostanes) with trans-10, cis-12 CLA ingestion require substantiation. Unresponsiveness to antioxidants of these non-enzymatic oxidation products casts some doubt on their physiological relevance. Recent reports, albeit in the minority, that CLAs, particularly the trans-10, cis-12 isomer, can elicit pro-carcinogenic effects in animal models of colon and prostate cancer and can increase prostaglandin production in cells also warrant further investigation and critical evaluation in relation to the many published anti-cancer and anti-prostaglandin effects of CLAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797122>Association between plasma concentrations of elaidic acid, a major trans fatty acid, and depression in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.</a></h1><p>Previous studies on health effects of trans fatty acids (TFA) have focused mainly on cardiovascular health. Little is known about the association of TFA with brain or mental health. In this study, we examined the associations of objectively-measured plasma TFA concentrations with depression in a large population-based cross-sectional study among U.S. adults.We included 2136 non-pregnant participants aged 20 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. Four major TFAs, including palmitelaidic acid (C16:1n-7t), elaidic acid (C18:1n-9t),  (C18:1n-7t), and linoelaidic acid (C18:2n-6t, 9t), were measured in fasting plasma using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9.Participants with depressive symptoms had a higher plasma concentration of total TFA compared with those without depressive symptoms (6.6 vs 6.0 μmol/g lipids, P = 0.046). After adjustment for other major risk factors, the odds ratio (OR) of depressive symptoms comparing the highest with lowest tertile of TFAs was 1.44 (95% CI, 0.86-2.39) for total TFAs (P for trend 0.15). For each individual type of TFA, the corresponding OR was 1.78 (1.03-3.07) for elaidic acid (P for trend 0.049), 1.23 (0.76-2.00) for linoelaidic acid (P for trend 0.37), 1.19 (0.75-1.87) for palmitelaidic acid (P for trend 0.46), and 1.20 (0.75-1.94) for  (P for trend 0.43).The cross-sectional study design limited causal inferences of the findings.In a nationally representative population, plasma elaidic acid, a major trans fatty acid, was positively associated with depressive symptoms in adults. A positive but non-significant association of depressive symptoms was observed for total TFAs, linolelaidic acid, palmitelaidic acid, and .Copyright © 2019.

It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty acid profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic acid significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the oleic acid and  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic acid levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis- concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty acid profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637686>High Serum Phospholipid Dihomo-γ-Linoleic Acid Concentration and Low Δ5-Desaturase Activity Are Associated with Increased Risk of Type 2 Diabetes among Japanese Adults in the Hitachi Health Study.</a></h1><p> The association between the circulating fatty acid (FA) composition and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been reported in Western populations, but evidence is scarce among Asian populations, including Japanese, who consume large amounts of fish. The objective of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between circulating concentrations of individual FAs and T2D incidence among Japanese adults. We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of 4754 employees, aged 34-69 y, who attended a comprehensive health checkup in 2008-2009 and donated blood samples for the Hitachi Health Study. During 5 y of follow-up, diabetes was identified on the basis of plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and self-report. Two controls matched to each case by sex, age, and date of checkup were randomly chosen by using density sampling, resulting in 336 cases and 678 controls with FA measurements. GC was used to measure the FA composition in serum phospholipids. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs after adjusting for potential confounders. We examined the association of T2D risk with 25 different individual and combinations of FAs. T2D risk was positively associated with serum dihomo-γ-linoleic acid concentration (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.11; trend = 0.02) and inversely associated with Δ5-desaturase activity (highest compared with the lowest quartile-HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.99; trend = 0.02), independent of body mass index (BMI). There were also inverse associations between T2D risk with serum total n-6 (ω-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic acid, and -, but these were attenuated and became nonsignificant after adjustment for BMI. Serum n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were not associated with T2D risk. T2D risk was associated with circulating concentrations of the n-6 PUFA dihomo-γ-linoleic acid and Δ5-desaturase activity but not with n-3 PUFA or SFA concentrations in Japanese adults.© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527759>Prospective association of fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway with risk of type 2 diabetes: the Cardiovascular Health Study.</a></h1><p>Experimental evidence suggests that hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) affects insulin homeostasis via synthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Few prospective studies have used fatty acid biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0)] and MUFA [oleic acid (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We secondarily assessed other DNL fatty acid biomarkers [myristic acid (14:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), and  (18:1n-7)] and estimated dietary SFAs and MUFAs.In 3004 participants free of diabetes, plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured in 1992, and incident diabetes was identified by medication use and blood glucose. Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas oleic acid showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle, palmitic acid (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic acid (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas oleic acid was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses,  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty acid biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were associated with higher diabetes risk, and  was associated with lower diabetes risk.

Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of lipid intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important metabolic characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

All statistical analyses (analysis of covariance and linear regression) accounted for the survey design and sample weights.We included 3876 participants, overall (48.6%) participants were men, and (51.4%) were women, generally (69.0%) had high food security. Subjects with higher food security had a higher level of education as well (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted, sex-adjusted, race-adjusted, education-adjusted mean of trans 9-octadecenoic acid and trans-9, trans-12-octadecadienoic acid were higher in plasma of participants with lower food security (all p < 0.001), moreover in same model there was a significant positive association between plasma level of trans-, trans-9-octadecenoic acid and trans-9, trans-12-octadecadienoic acid and score of food security. Further, age, sex, race, education, and energy intake adjusted mean of dietary fatty acids show that total polyunsaturated fatty acids are higher in subjects with higher food security (p = 0.026) while, cholesterol consumption is higher in subjects with lower food security (p = 0.039).Our findings provide more evidence on the association between food insecurity and the higher level of TFAs in serum and different type of fat in the diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281760>Deletion of ELOVL6 blocks the synthesis of oleic acid but does not prevent the development of fatty liver or insulin resistance.</a></h1><p>Elongation of very long chain fatty acid-like family member 6 (ELOVL6) is a fatty acyl elongase that performs the initial and rate-limiting condensing reaction required for microsomal elongation of long-chain fatty acids. Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a fat-free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high-fat diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of , fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h1><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether  induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of  did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of  and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9920140>Differential effects of cis and trans fatty acids on insulin release from isolated mouse islets.</a></h1><p>In vitro and in vivo studies in animals have shown that elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) induce impaired beta-cell function corresponding to the abnormalities observed in non-insulin-dependent  (NIDDM). Previously, it was demonstrated that the chain length and degree of unsaturation are of importance for the insulinotropic effect of fatty acids. However, it is not known if the spatial configuration of the fatty acid influences beta-cell function. The present study examines whether cis and trans fatty acids acutely influence insulin release and glucose oxidation in isolated mouse islets in the same way and to the same extent. Thus, we studied the impact of both cis and trans forms of C 18:1 fatty acids. We found that cis and trans  (cis and trans C 18:1 delta11), as well as oleic acid (cis C 18:1 delta9) and elaidic acid (trans 18:1 delta9), caused a dose-dependent increase in glucose (16.7 mmol/L)-stimulated insulin secretion during static islet incubations. The maximal stimulatory effect for cis and trans  and for oleic and elaidic acid was observed at concentrations of 2.0 and 3.0 mmol/L, respectively. The trans isomers, trans vaccenic and elaidic acid, elicited a higher maximal insulin output than the respective cis isomers, cis vaccenic and oleic acid. In the presence of another insulin secretagogue, L-leucine, trans vaccenic but not elaidic acid caused a higher response than their cis isomeric fatty acids. The higher potency of trans fatty acids compared with the cis forms was confirmed in perifusion experiments. Both cis and trans C 18:1 fatty acids stimulated insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Also, glucose oxidation was influenced differentially by the isomers of fatty acids. Glucose oxidation at 16.7 mmol/L glucose was significantly inhibited by oleic and cis  compared with elaidic and trans , respectively. In summary, our results demonstrate that the fatty acid spatial configuration modulates glucose oxidation and insulin secretion in mouse beta cells.</p></html>
