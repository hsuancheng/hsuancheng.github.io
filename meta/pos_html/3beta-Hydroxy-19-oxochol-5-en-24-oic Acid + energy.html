Inspired by nature, where specific amino  residues and soft-material coordination environments regulate the redox poise of metal centers in proteins during enzymatic reactions, thin-film polymeric coatings have been developed to assemble molecular components, including catalysts, onto solid-state (semi)conducting surfaces. In this report, we describe the immobilization of metalloporphyrins onto transparent conductive oxide supports using either coordination to an initially applied thin-film polypyridyl coating or direct grafting to the oxide surface. The composite materials enable direct measurements of electrochemical and optical properties associated with the surface-immobilized components. Despite the similarity of the core cobalt porphyrin units used in assembling these hybrid architectures, the redox couples associated with the surface-immobilized species span a 350 mV range across the distinct constructs. This range in redox potential is extended to 960 mV when including comparisons to constructs utilizing polymer-immobilized cobaloxime catalysts in place of the cobalt porphyrins, where reduction of the cobaloximes requires significantly more-negative bias potentials. This work illustrates the use of soft-material interfaces for assembling molecular-modified electrodes where the nanoscale connectivity of the surface coatings determines the electrochemical properties of the macroscopic assemblies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655641>Application of linear solvation  relationships and principal component analysis methods for the prediction of the retention behaviour of E-resveratrol analogues with substituted silica hydride stationary phases.</a></h2><p>In this investigation, application of linear solvent  relationships (LSERs) and principal component analysis (PCA) methods have been employed to investigate the structure-retention dependencies of E-resveratrol analogues separated under different stationary and mobile phase conditions. To this end, the retention of 22 analogues have been determined with phenyl, diol, bidentate anchored C18 (BDC18) and Diamond Hydride™ C18 (DHC18) substituted silica hydride stationary phases under isocratic chromatographic conditions using mobile phases containing 0.1 (% v/v) formic  and different acetonitrile or methanol contents from 10 to 90% (v/v) in 10% increments. In general, these compounds showed decreasing retention with increased acetonitrile or methanol content in the mobile phase with all the stationary phases. The retention order generally followed their log P values, although some unique selectivity variations were apparent depending on the nature of the selected stationary and mobile phases. These 22 compounds contained different backbone functionalities linking the phenyl ring A to phenyl ring B and different numbers of hydroxyl groups in the phenyl ring A/phenyl ring B. Structure-retention descriptors, derived according to LSER concepts, were analysed by PCA methods to provide group classification of these resveratrol analogues from the associated PC1 versus PC2 score plots. These results revealed that the selectivity of these compounds was dominated by hydrophobic and steric interactions. Based on the number and position of hydroxyl groups in a specific resveratrol analogue, a reliable curve fitting approach (indicated by R > 0.99 for the correlation between experimental and predicted log k values) was derived for prediction of the retention of these analytes under different mobile phase isocratic separation conditions. The application of similar methods are anticipated to find general utility for the analysis of diverse classes of other low molecular mass compounds in the different modes of liquid chromatography, permitting enhanced levels of prediction and evaluation of the retention attributes of polar and non-polar compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By using LC-MS/MS via negative/positive ion switching mode, an efficient and fast multi-residual method for simultaneous determination of multiclass 52 illegal dyes with different acidic-basic properties in foodstuffs was developed and validated during one single run, including 23 fat-soluble neutral azo dyes, 8 acidic sulfonated azo dyes, 12 triphenylmethane basic dyes, three basic indole dyes, three xanthene dyes, one quinoline dye, and two anthraquinones dyes. The illegal dyes were extracted with methanol-acetonitrile and further purified with d-SPE procedure to reduce interference. Sample dilution with 100-fold was used for the elimination of matrix effects of the quantitation of LC-MS/MS analysis. Validation data showed the good recoveries in the range of 71.2-111.2%, with relative standard deviations less than 20%, suggesting the developed method is suitable for the identification and quantitation of multiclass illegal dyes at trace levels in foods.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that SCA pretreatment can selectively remove lignin with minimal impact on cellulose and hemicellulose. After up to 200 min of SCA treatment, 79.4% of lignin was removed and over 90% of the holocellulose was retained. The physicochemical changes after pretreatment were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, X-ray diffractometer and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, showing that the majority of lignin was removed from secondary cell walls and cell middle lamella while the chlorite-resistant lignin remained in the cell corner. Lignin removal significantly enhanced the biodegradability from 59.6% to 86.4% and increased methane production by 38.3%.  balance showed that SCA pretreatment was efficient to increase the  output of hybrid Pennisetum.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

MMUT catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an anaplerotic reaction which feeds into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle. As part of the pathological mechanisms of MMA, previous studies have suggested there is decreased TCA activity due to a "toxic inhibition" of TCA cycle enzymes by MMA related metabolites, in addition to reduced anaplerosis. Here, we have utilized mitochondria isolated from livers of a mouse model of MMA (Mut-ko/ki) and their littermate controls (Ki/wt) to examine the amounts and enzyme functions of most of the TCA cycle enzymes. We have performed mRNA quantification, protein semi-quantitation, and enzyme activity quantification for TCA cycle enzymes in these samples. Expression profiling showed increased mRNA levels of fumarate hydratase in the Mut-ko/ki samples, which by contrast had reduced protein levels as detected by immunoblot, while all other mRNA levels were unaltered. Immunoblotting also revealed decreased protein levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Interesting, the decreased protein amount of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was reflected in decreased activity for this enzyme while there is a trend towards decreased activity of fumarate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase 2. Citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3, succinyl-CoA synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase are not statistically different in terms of quantity of enzyme or activity. Finally, we found decreased activity when examining the function of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in series with succinate synthase and succinate dehydrogenase in the Mut-ko/ki mice compared to their littermate controls, as expected. This study demonstrates decreased activity of certain TCA cycle enzymes and by corollary decreased TCA cycle function, but it supports decreased protein quantity rather than "toxic inhibition" as the underlying mechanism of action. SUMMARY: Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an inborn metabolic disorder of propionate catabolism. In this disorder, toxic metabolites are considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism for acute and long-term complications. However, despite optimized therapies aimed at reducing metabolite levels, patients continue to suffer from late complications, including metabolic stroke and renal insufficiency. Since the propionate pathway feeds into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle, we investigated TCA cycle function in a constitutive MMA mouse model. We demonstrated decreased amounts of the TCA enzymes, Mdh2 and Ogdh as semi-quantified by immunoblot. Enzymatic activity of Ogdh is also decreased in the MMA mouse model compared to controls. Thus, when the enzyme amounts are decreased, we see the enzymatic activity also decreased to a similar extent for Ogdh. Further studies to elucidate the structural and/or functional links between the TCA cycle and propionate pathways might lead to new treatment approaches for MMA patients.Copyright © 2019.

While it is clear that these monocopper enzymes have extended substrate-binding surfaces for interacting with their fibrous substrates, the structural determinants of LPMO substrate specificity remain largely unknown. To gain additional insight into substrate specificity in LPMOs, here we generated a mutant library of a cellulose-active family AA10 LPMO from  A3(2) (LPMO10C, also known as CelS2) having multiple substitutions at five positions on the substrate-binding surface that we identified by sequence comparisons. Screening of this library using a newly developed MS-based high-throughput assay helped identify multiple enzyme variants that contained four substitutions and exhibited significant chitinolytic activity and a concomitant decrease in cellulolytic activity. The chitin-active variants became more rapidly inactivated during catalysis than a natural chitin-active AA10 LPMO, an observation likely indicative of suboptimal substrate binding leading to autocatalytic oxidative damage of these variants. These results reveal several structural determinants of LPMO substrate specificity and underpin the notion that productive substrate binding by these enzymes is complex, depending on a multitude of amino  located on the substrate-binding surface.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679022>Effects of central and peripheral administration of an acute phase protein, α-1--glycoprotein, on feed intake and rectal temperature in sheep.</a></h2><p>In rodents, an acute phase protein, α-1- glycoprotein (AGP), was shown to provide a link between inflammation and suppression of feed intake by acting as a leptin receptor agonist. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of AGP on feed intake and rectal temperature in sheep. Ewes were ovariectomized, implanted with a cannula into a lateral ventricle of the brain, and kept indoors in individual pens. Feed intake and rectal temperature was determined for sheep in all experiments. In the first experiment, ewes (n = 4) received 1 of 4 treatments [0 (control), 0.012 (low), 0.06 (medium), or 0.30 (high) mg / kg BW AGP] into the lateral ventricle (ICV). All sheep received all treatments in a Latin square design balanced for carryover effects with 10 d between treatments. In the second experiment, ewes (n = 10) received one of two treatments (0 and 3 mg / kg BW of AGP) intravenously (IV) in a completely randomized design. In the third experiment, ewes (n = 19) received peripheral treatments (IV) of an antipyretic [0 (control) or 2.2 mg / kg BW flunixin meglumine (FLU)] 30 minutes before receiving central AGP [0 (control) or 0.3 mg / kg BW of AGP] in a completely randomized design. All data were analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance and tested for effects of treatment, time, and the interaction of treatment and time. Cumulative 48-h feed intake after administration of treatments was also determined. In the first experiment there was no effect of ICV treatment (P = 0.37) on feed intake rate or on cumulative feed intake (P = 0.31). There was an effect of ICV treatment (P = 0.002) on rectal temperatures, which were greater (P < 0.05) after the high dose of centrally administered AGP. In the second experiment there was no effect of AGP administration IV on feed intake rate (P = 0.98), on cumulative feed intake (P = 0.41) or on rectal temperature (P = 0.71). In the third experiment there was an effect of central AGP treatment (P < 0.0001) and an interaction of central AGP and time (P < 0.0001) on rectal temperature, whereas FLU had no effect (P = 0.93), demonstrating that AGP increased rectal temperatures regardless of antipyretic treatment. These results indicate that central AGP increases rectal temperature in sheep by pathways that do not involve prostaglandins. Further research is needed to determine if AGP may be an important integrator of  balance and inflammation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Growth, biomass allocation, leaf structure, gas exchange parameters, fatty  and water-soluble carbohydrates were quantified for a high-expressing cys-OLE/DGAT ryegrass transformant (HL) and a wild type (WT) control grown under controlled conditions with 1-10 mM N supply at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2. A dramatic shift in leaf C storage occurred in HL leaves, away from readily mobilizable carbohydrates and towards stable lipid droplets. HL exhibited an increased growth rate, mainly in non-photosynthetic organs, leading to a decreased leaf mass fraction. HL leaves, however, displayed an increased specific leaf area and photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area, delivering greater overall C capture and leaf growth at high N supply. HL also exhibited a greater photosynthesis response to elevated atmospheric CO2. We speculate that by behaving as uniquely stable micro-sinks for carbon, cys-OLE encapsulated lipid droplets can reduce feedback inhibition of photosynthesis and drive greater C capture. Manipulation of many genes and gene combinations have been used to increase non-seed lipid content. However, the cys-OLE/DGAT technology remains the only reported case that increases plant biomass. We contrast cys-OLE/DGAT with other lipid accumulation strategies and discuss the implications of introducing lipid sinks into non-seed organs on plant  homeostasis and growth.© The Author(s) 2019.

Two-phase anaerobic digestion was proposed in this study. Acidogenic fermentation was carried out with corn straw hydrolysate as feedstock for volatile fatty  (VFAs) production. Using anaerobic sludge (AnS), different inoculum to substrate ratios (ISRs) of 0.5:1, 1:1 and 2:1 were investigated. The highest VFAs yield was obtained at ISR of 0.5:1.VFAs composition analysis showed that butyric  was the predominant , followed by acetic  and propionic . The effects of AnS and aerobic sludge (AeS) on the acidogenic performance of hydrolysate were compared. The optimum VFA yields were 0.38 g/g COD-added for AnS and 0.32 g/g COD-added for AeS with HRT of 5 d, respectively. The bacterial diversities of inocula and digestates were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Two origins of inocula had distinct bacterial structures, but they did share core communities that included Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes at phylum level. The bacterial communities of both digestates changed significantly as compared with those in inoculum. Firmicutes was absolutely dominant in all the bacterial species. Therefore, the AeS could be an option as the acidogenic inoculum. The microbial information will be beneficial for the enrichment and acclimatization of microbes. In methanogenic process, VFAs obtained in acidogenic stage could be efficiently converted into methane. The ultimate methane yield at organic loading rate (OLR) of 8 g/L·d could reach 290 mL CH/g COD-added and 279 mL CH/g COD-added for AnS and AeS acidified digestate. Two-phase anaerobic digestion was proved to be suitable for bioconversion of lignocellulosic hydrolysate into biogas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we derived a TFE profile named General Transfer Free  Profile (GeTFEP) based on computation of the TFEs of 58 β-barrel membrane proteins (βMPs). The GeTFEP agrees well with experimentally measured and computationally derived TFEs. Analysis based on the GeTFEP shows that residues in different regions of the TM segments of βMPs have different roles during the membrane insertion process. Results further reveal the importance of the sequence pattern of transmembrane strands in stabilizing βMPs in the membrane environment. In addition, we show that GeTFEP can be used to predict the positioning and the orientation of βMPs in the membrane. We also show that GeTFEP can be used to identify structurally or functionally important amino  residue sites of βMPs. Furthermore, the TM segments of α-helical membrane proteins can be accurately predicted with GeTFEP, suggesting that the GeTFEP is of general applicability in studying membrane protein.© 2019 The Protein Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h2><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of  metabolism thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular  and exerts essential functions on  metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of  metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty  utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac  metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac  metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681175>Melanocortin-4 Receptor in Spotted Sea Bass, : Cloning, Tissue Distribution, Physiology, and Pharmacology.</a></h2><p>Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) plays important roles in regulation of multiple physiological processes including  homeostasis, reproduction, sexual function, and other functions in mammals. Recent studies suggested that teleost MC4Rs have different physiological functions and pharmacological characteristics when compared to mammalian MC4Rs. In this study, we investigated spotted sea bass () MC4R (MC4R) physiology and pharmacology. Spotted sea bass  consisted of a 984 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 327 amino . MC4R was homologous to those of several teleost MC4Rs and human MC4R (hMC4R). qRT-PCR and  hybridization revealed that  transcripts were highly expressed in the brain, followed by pituitary and liver. Brain  transcripts were down-regulated in long-term and short-term fasting challenges. MC4R was a functional receptor with lower maximal binding and higher basal activity than hMC4R. THIQ was not able to displace I-NDP-MSH but could affect intracellular cAMP accumulation, suggesting that it was an allosteric ligand for MC4R.  studies with spotted sea bass brain cells indicated that mRNA levels of  and  were down-regulated by α-MSH. In summary, we cloned spotted sea bass MC4R, and showed that it had different pharmacological properties compared to hMC4R, and potentially different functions.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Hou, Wen, Li, Qi, Li and Tao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681836>Volcanic mercury and mutagenesis in land plants during the end-Triassic mass extinction.</a></h2><p>During the past 600 million years of Earth history, four of five major extinction events were synchronous with volcanism in large igneous provinces. Despite improved temporal frameworks for these events, the mechanisms causing extinctions remain unclear. Volcanic emissions of greenhouse gases, SO, and halocarbons are generally considered as major factors in the biotic crises, resulting in global warming,  deposition, and ozone layer depletion. Here, we show that pulsed elevated concentrations of mercury in marine and terrestrial sediments across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in southern Scandinavia and northern Germany correlate with intense volcanic activity in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. The increased levels of mercury-the most genotoxic element on Earth-also correlate with high occurrences of abnormal fern spores, indicating severe environmental stress and genetic disturbance in the parent plants. We conclude that this offers compelling evidence that emissions of toxic volcanogenic substances contributed to the end-Triassic biotic crisis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The abundance of E. faecalis in the intestine of silkworm is affected by fluoride exposure. However, the response mechanism of E. faecalis toward fluoride remains largely unknown. In this study, a strain of E. faecalis (named TV4), which is a symbiotic bacteria of silkworm, was isolated and characterized. Inhibition assay showed that fluoride could significantly inhibit the growth of the TV4 strain (P<0.05) after culture for 4 h. Finally, Illumina X-Ten platform was used to investigate the response mechanism of E. faecalis TV4 under fluoride exposure. We found that the TV4 strain demonstrated significant changes in its carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  metabolism. The transcriptome sequencing results revealed that 237 genes were differentially expressed for TV4 grown after fluoride exposure, i.e., 92 genes were differentially up-regulated and 145 genes were differentially down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in cell carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  production, whereas the up-regulated genes were mostly related to ethanolamine utilization and amino  synthesis and metabolism. Our results revealed that strain TV4 reduced its carbohydrate metabolism and  metabolism and increased ethanolamine utilization and amino  metabolism to adapt and survive under fluoride exposure. This study enhances our understanding about the response mechanism of E. faecalis after fluoride exposure and has important implications for investigations on the three-way interaction among fluoride, symbiotic bacteria and silkworm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its robust properties, it is also increasingly considered for use as a cell factory. It produces several industrially important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol and reuterin natively, but for cell factory purposes, developing improved strategies for engineering and fermentation optimization is crucial. Genome-scale metabolic models can be highly beneficial in guiding rational metabolic engineering. Reconstructing a reliable and a quantitatively accurate metabolic model requires extensive manual curation and incorporation of experimental data.A genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 was reconstructed and the resulting model, Lreuteri_530, was validated and tested with experimental data. Several knowledge gaps in the metabolism were identified and resolved during this process, including presence/absence of glycolytic genes. Flux distribution between the two glycolytic pathways, the phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathways, varies considerably between LAB species and strains. As these pathways result in different  yields, it is important to include strain-specific utilization of these pathways in the model. We determined experimentally that the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway carried at most 7% of the total glycolytic flux. Predicted growth rates from Lreuteri_530 were in good agreement with experimentally determined values. To further validate the prediction accuracy of Lreuteri_530, the predicted effects of glycerol addition and adhE gene knock-out, which results in impaired ethanol production, were compared to in vivo data. Examination of both growth rates and uptake- and secretion rates of the main metabolites in central metabolism demonstrated that the model was able to accurately predict the experimentally observed effects. Lastly, the potential of L. reuteri as a cell factory was investigated, resulting in a number of general metabolic engineering strategies.We have constructed a manually curated genome-scale metabolic model of L. reuteri JCM 1112 that has been experimentally parameterized and validated and can accurately predict metabolic behavior of this important platform cell factory.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677391>An ICP study and an ICR/MALDI study at high mass resolution of two ancient Maya greenstone artifacts from Pacbitun, Belize, and two decorative jade specimens.</a></h2><p>Two Early Classic period (ca 250-600 CE) Maya carved, greenstone jade pendants, Specimens A and B, were recovered from the Pacbitun site in Belize in 1987. Novel highly-resolved polyatomic ions from jade grit have been observed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS), specifically using the Bruker Daltonics, SolariX XR mass spectrometer, combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI); the matrix material was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic . Mass scans of resolution ~600,000 were obtained for the jade pendants and two British Columbia jade ornaments. Observation of polyatomic ion species of m/z 800-1400 indicate the ejection of charged ensembles composed of 60 - 180 atoms from jade grit. The charged ensembles represent minute regions of jade grit that have retained many of the spatial relationships of atoms within the jade; the required ejection  is provided by laser photons accumulated in the matrix.  solutions of grit from Specimens A and ornament KMM were analyzed by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The novelty of this application of mass spectrometry to jade was reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. Presented here is an interpretation of the mass spectrometric observations from multiplicities of silicate materials. Isotopic fine structure analysis can yield elemental compositions for ions composed of base isotopes together with stable isotope intensities arising from ions with one and two additional neutrons. The analysis is challenging as jade is a multiplicity of similar solid solutions; thus, a multiple isotopic fine structure approach has been explored. Attempts to compose ensembles of atoms, of those elements found normally in coloured silicates, to match the observed ion mass/charge ratios were unsuccessful without the addition of multiple hydrogen atoms.

We compare the comparatively inert infectious elementary body (EB) and the active replicative reticulate body (RB) systematically using a genome-scale metabolic model with 321 metabolites and 277 reactions. This did yield 84 extreme pathways based on a published proteomics dataset at three different time points of infection. Validation of predictions was done by quantitative RT-PCR of enzyme mRNA expression at three time points. 's major active pathways are glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycerol-phospholipid (GPL) biosynthesis (support from host acetyl-CoA) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), while its incomplete TCA and fatty  biosynthesis are less active. The modeled metabolic pathways are much more active in RB than in EB. Our  model suggests that EB and RB utilize folate to generate NAD(P)H using independent pathways. The only low metabolic flux inferred for EB involves mainly carbohydrate metabolism. RB utilizes  -rich compounds to generate ATP in nucleic  metabolism.

In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry weight in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and  sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677435>Unveiling the mechanisms of medium-chain fatty  production from waste activated sludge alkaline fermentation liquor through physiological, thermodynamic and metagenomic investigations.</a></h2><p>Effective sludge treatment with bioenergy production is attracting increasing interests as large quantities of waste activated sludge (WAS) are produced during the wastewater treatment. In this study, a new biotechnical process for converting the WAS alkaline fermentation liquor (WASAFL) into valuable, easy-separated medium chain fatty  (MCFAs) through chain elongation (CE) was investigated, which may provide a new insight into sludge treatment. In the process, ethanol was served as the electron donor (EDs) and WASAFL were main electron acceptors (EAs). The MCFAs productions were investigated under three different ED to EA ratios (i.e., 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1). The result showed that MCFAs production was increased from 2.88 ± 0.01 to 5.28 ± 0.18 g COD/L with the increase of ED to EA ratio. However, the highest MCFA selectivity was achieved at 72.9% when the ED to EA ratio was 1:1. The decrease in the selectivity at high ED:EA ratio is mainly due to the production of higher alcohol (i.e., n-butanol and n-hexanol). The thermodynamic analysis confirmed all CE processes for MCFAs production from WASAFL were exothermic reactions, with the spontaneity and  release of the reactions increased with the ethanol level. The microbial community analysis showed that the relative abundances of Clostridium, Oscillibacter, Leptolinea and Exilispira were positively correlated with the MCFAs production. The metagenomic analysis suggested that both the reverse β-oxidization pathway and fatty  biosynthesis pathway contributed to the CE process in the studied system. The functional enzymes were mainly associated within Clostridium, with Clostridium Kluyveri, Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium magnum being likely the key species responsible for the CE process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Originally developed for lead- batteries, Peukert's law states that the delivered charge increases when the discharge current decreases. Recently, it is revealed that this law also applies to supercapacitors when the discharge current is above a certain threshold. This paper examines two application scenarios in which Peukert's law is utilized to predict the supercapacitor discharge time. Extensive experiments are performed using three supercapacitor samples with different rated capacitances from different manufacturers at various voltages. Results show that the prediction error is significantly reduced when the supercapacitor nominal charge and Peukert constant are properly determined and therefore demonstrate the effectiveness of Peukert's law in improving the prediction accuracy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672993>Plasticity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis respiratory chain and its impact on tuberculosis drug development.</a></h2><p>The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on  generated by its respiratory chain. Cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase and type-2 NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) are respiratory chain components predicted to be essential, and are currently targeted for drug development. Here we demonstrate that an Mtb cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase deletion mutant is viable and only partially attenuated in mice. Moreover, treatment of Mtb-infected marmosets with a cytochrome bc1-aa3 oxidase inhibitor controls disease progression and reduces lesion-associated inflammation, but most lesions become cavitary. Deletion of both NDH-2 encoding genes (Δndh-2 mutant) reveals that the essentiality of NDH-2 as shown in standard growth media is due to the presence of fatty . The Δndh-2 mutant is only mildly attenuated in mice and not differently susceptible to clofazimine, a drug in clinical use proposed to engage NDH-2. These results demonstrate the intrinsic plasticity of Mtb's respiratory chain, and highlight the challenges associated with targeting the pathogen's respiratory enzymes for tuberculosis drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675568>New insights on cytostatic drug risk assessment in aquatic environments based on measured concentrations in surface waters.</a></h2><p>Cytostatic drugs are compounds used to treat cancer, one of the deadliest diseases worldwide with a rising yearly incidence. However, the occurrence and concentrations of a large number of cytostatics in waters and wastewaters are unknown. Thus, this study sought to analyze the concentrations of these compounds in different aquatic environments worldwide to assess the risk that these compounds pose to aquatic organisms. The top five most monitored cytostatics in aquatic environments are fluorouracil, methotrexate, tamoxifen, ifosfamide, and cyclophosphamide. Risk quotients (RQs) based on maximum reported measured concentrations revealed that mycophenolic  and tamoxifen pose a high risk to aquatic organisms (RQ ≥ 1) at concentrations observed in surface waters. Moreover, methotrexate and tegafur were categorized as moderate risk compounds, and bicalutamide was found to pose a low risk. Importantly, the available analytical methodologies for the quantification of some cytostatics (e.g., cisplatin, fluorouracil, daunorubicin, imatinib, and mycophenolic ) in water could not rule out potential risk to aquatic biota, since estimated risks for these compounds using the lowest method detection limits reported in the literature (RQ MDL) were all ≥0.01 (i.e., low risk or higher). Moreover, risks based on predicted concentrations (RQ PEC) were consistently lower than those based on measured concentrations, highlighting the importance of risk assessment based on measured values. Thus, accurate and sensitive analytical methods are crucial to identify and quantify cytostatic exposure in aquatic ecosystems in order to preserve biodiversity and ensure a safer environment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Several cultivars exhibited a significant difference in biomass and yield with enhanced uptake in shoots and low accumulation in roots from two Cd-contaminated soil types, an Oxisol and an Iceptisol. The Transfer Factor of Cd was >1 in several cultivars in both soil types, where as a significant difference in phytoextraction of Cd was observed in the Oxisol (acidic soil), greater than in the Inceptisol (alkaline soil). The results revealed that of the 40 cultivars, S9178, Huanong 667in the Oxisol and cvs. DW 667, HN 667, Huanong 667 and 668F1 in the Inceptisol showed a high biomass, better yield and enhanced accumulation of Cd in the shoots but a lesser accumulation in oil. The screened cultivar S 9178 produced the greatest amount of oil (55.6%) with 77% oleic , which makes it suitable for human consumption. Cultivar Huanong 667 was found to be the highest accumulating cultivar in both soil types. It is therefore suggested that some sunflower cultivars do exhibit phytoremediation potential together with agro-production potential.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Char-clay composite derived from refinery spent bleaching earth (SBE) is an economical and readily available catalyst that can be used during the ozonation treatment of recalcitrants in wastewater. Four catalysts of SBE-N-650, SBE-N-850, SBE-O-650, and SBE-O-850 were prepared by heating the SBE at 650 and 850 °C under N or O conditions. High surface OH sites in the SBE-N-650 and SBE-O-650 relative to the SBE-N-850 and SBE-O-850 resulted in an increase in catalytic activity. Additional carbon (C), that existed in the SBE-N-650 and SBE-N-850, had a positive effect on catalytic activity. The SBE-N-650 exhibited the highest activity among those prepared catalysts. During catalytic ozonation, the SBE-N-650 increased the mineralization rate of benzoic  by 36% when compared with single ozonation. Molecular ozone was decomposed at the surface active sites on SBE-N-650, generating active •OH, •O, or O species. Gas and liquid products having calorific values that are generated during SBE-N-650 preparation can be further utilized. This study introduces a potential use of SBE for the ozonation treatment of recalcitrant wastewaters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Deregulation of cellular metabolism, leading to development of leukemia, occurs through abnormally high expression of transcription factors such as MYC and Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 protein homolog (EVI1). Overexpression of EVI1 in adults and children with mixed lineage leukemia-rearrangement acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) has a very poor prognosis. To identify a metabolic inhibitor for EVI1-induced metabolic reprogramming in MLL-r AML, we used an XFp extracellular flux analyzer to examine metabolic changes during leukemia development in mouse models of AML expressing MLL-AF9 and Evi1 (Evi1/MF9). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Evi1/MF9 AML cells accelerated prior to activation of glycolysis, with a higher dependency on glutamine as an  source. Furthermore, EVI1 played a role in glycolysis as well as driving production of metabolites in the tricarboxylic  cycle. L-asparaginase (L-asp) exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and suppressed OXPHOS and proliferation of Evi1/MF9 both in vitro and in vivo; high sensitivity to L-asp was caused by low expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and L-asp-induced suppression of glutamine metabolism. Also, samples from patients with EVI1+MF9 showed low ASNS expression, suggesting that it is a sensitive marker of L-asp treatment. Clarification of metabolic reprogramming in EVI1+ leukemia cells may aid development of treatments for EVI1+MF9 refractory leukemia.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675623>A DFT study on reaction force approach of ammonia catalysed amide bond formation reaction between ammonia and formic .</a></h2><p>A reaction force approach of ammonia catalysed stepwise amide bond formation between ammonia and formic  is investigated using B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level of density functional theory in gas phase.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their  intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in weight gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and  response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function. These data suggest that taste buds are previously unappreciated targets of chronic sucrose consumption.Copyright © 2019.

However, it is extremely challenging to increase membrane water flux and simultaneously achieve high rejection rates of cations or organic dyes. Herein, we report a tannic  (TA) assisted exfoliation method to fabricate TA-modified MoS (TAMoS) nanosheets with high production yield (90 ± 5%). The TAMoS nanosheets membranes show excellent non-swelling stability in water. It is found that a hybrid membrane with 1 wt% of TAMoS in MoS nanosheets demonstrates overall better performance than pure MoS and TAMoS membrane. Such a hybrid membrane with a thickness of 5 µm shows fast water flux at around 32 L m h (LMH) and >97% rejection of various cations under static diffusion mode. Under vacuum-driven filtration condition, the as-prepared hybrid membrane demonstrates ultrafast water flux of 15,000 ± 100 L/(m h bar) and 99.87 ± 0.1% rejection of multiple model organic dyes. To the best of our knowledge, the above performances are superior to those of all MoS-based membranes reported previously in terms of water flux and ion/dye rejection. This work represents a leap forward towards the practical applications of 2D TAMoS membranes in various engineering and environmental areas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Optimal process conditions for dicarboxylic- yield and recovery include slow growth, low pH and high CO . To quantify and understand how these process parameters affect yeast physiology, this study investigates individual and combined impacts of low pH (3.0) and high CO (50 %) on slow-growing chemostat and retentostat cultures of the reference strain S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D. Combined exposure to low pH and high CO led to increased maintenance- requirements and death rates in aerobic, glucose-limited cultures. Further experiments showed that these effects were predominantly caused by low pH. Growth under ammonium-limited, -excess conditions did not aggravate or ameliorate these adverse impacts. Despite the absence of a synergistic effect of low pH and high CO on physiology, high CO strongly affected genome-wide transcriptional responses to low pH. Interference of high CO with low-pH signaling is consistent with low-pH and high-CO signals being relayed via common (MAPK-)signaling pathways, notably the cell wall integrity (CWI), high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) and calcineurin pathways. This study highlights the need to further increase robustness of cell factories to low pH for carboxylic- production, even in organisms that are already applied at industrial scale.

The molecular systems have potential applications as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. Three molecules were taken from the literature, and seven are proposals inspired in the above, including the azomethine group in the π-bridge expecting a better charge transfer. These molecular structures are composed of triphenylamine (donor part); different combinations of azomethine, thiophene, and benzene derivatives (π-bridge); and cyanoacrylic  (acceptor part). This study focused on the effect that the azomethine group caused on the π-bridge. Ground-state geometry optimization, the highest occupied molecular orbital, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, and their  levels were obtained and analyzed. Absorption wavelengths, oscillator strengths, and electron transitions were obtained via time-dependent density functional theory using the M06-2X density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. The free  of electron injection (ΔG) was calculated and analyzed. As an important part of this study, chemical reactivity parameters are discussed, such as chemical hardness, electrodonating power, electroaccepting power, and electrophilicity index.

Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant  expenditure, -base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for oxygen mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of oxygen and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655646>A novel electrochemiluminescence sensor based on resonance  transfer system between nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots and boron nitride quantum dots for sensitive detection of folic .</a></h2><p>Electrochemiluminescence resonance  transfer (ECL-RET) between quantum dots (QDs) was firstly proposed. In this work, boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs) as the donor and nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) as the acceptor were confirmed by the absorption spectrum, the emission spectrum and fluorescence spectrum. Based on the reaction between FA and the SO in the ECL system of NGQDs/BNQDs/KSO, the ECL sensing platform for FA was successfully constructed. Surprisingly, a stable and strong ECL signal was obtained based on the RET, which was used for signal-off detection of FA in the presence of coreactant KSO. Notably, about 10-fold enhancement was observed compared with the absence of BNQDs. The proposed sensor showed wide linear ranges of 1.0 × 10 M to 1.0 × 10 M and a low detection limit of 5.13 × 10 M.

PhIP was detected in proline and phenylalanine model systems but not in the glycine model system. The phenylalanine model system demonstrated low activation  (Ea) of 95.36 kJ/mol that resulted in a high rate of PhIP formation (great amount of PhIP formed).

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative  balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and  expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty  status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex  intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and microbiota composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651144>Multilegged Exosomal Walker for Electrochemical Detection of Exosomes.</a></h2><p>Detection of exosomes has aroused great interests due to their intrinsic advantages in liquid biopsy for tumor diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Herein, a cascade amplified electrochemical biosensor based on multilegged exosomal walkers was developed for the sensitive and selective detection of exosomes. First, the exosomes were captured specifically by its membrane protein's aptamer and fabricated into multilegged exosomal walkers with a large amount of cholesterol-labeled DNA strands plunging into their lipid bilayers. After being released efficiently by lock nucleic  (LNA)-modified DNA strands complementary to the aptamers, the walkers were propelled by toehold mediated strand displacement reaction (TMSDR) and "walked" efficiently along DNA "track", introducing considerable signal molecules attached on the "track" and achieving sensitive exosomes detection with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 29 exosomes/μL. Owing to excellent discriminative capability enhanced by LNA and TMSDR, the method possesses high selectivity toward tumor and nontumor cells derived exosomes, even for the serum exosomes from cancer patients in different stages. Furthermore, the designed biosensor is reproducible. Overall, this approach provides the potential to promote the large-scale development of liquid biopsy technology with exosomes as biomarkers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667409>Optimization of the antioxidant-rich xanthone extract from mangosteen (.) pericarp via microwave-assisted extraction.</a></h2><p>Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant properties of xanthone extract from mangosteen pericarp via microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM).

Ubiquinol has been increasingly reported to exert antioxidant functions, in addition to its role in the cell -producing system of mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free fatty  (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the liver and muscle glycogen content, an important  source during exercise.

These effects are not due to elevated BCAA  or hepatic mTOR activation, but rather due to a shift in the relative quantity of dietary BCAAs and other AAs, notably tryptophan and threonine. Increasing the ratio of BCAAs to these AAs resulted in hyperphagia and is associated with central serotonin depletion. Preventing hyperphagia by calorie restriction or pair-feeding averts the health costs of a high BCAA diet. Our data highlight a role for amino  quality in  balance and show that health costs of chronic high BCAA intakes need not be due to intrinsic toxicity but, rather, a consequence of hyperphagia driven by AA imbalance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663724>Lithium-Templated Formation of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes (POSS).</a></h2><p>A coordination complex, lithium hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate (; Li-T), a stable intermediate in silsesquioxane (SQ) syntheses, was successfully isolated in 65% yield and found to be highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as hexane. The structure of Li-T was confirmed by NMR, IR spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and computational simulation, providing detailed elucidation of the intermolecular self-association of the SQ cage with a box-shaped LiO polyhedron through strong coordination bonds. After  treatment, Li-T undergoes lithium-proton cationic exchange, yielding hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanol (; H-T) quantitatively. The high yield of H-T seems to be influenced by Li-O bonding in the Li-T complex that affects the selective formation of hepta(-butyl)silsesquioxane trisilanolate and the bulky -butyl groups which may prevent decomposition or SQ cage-rearrangement even at reflux under alkaline conditions. Single-crystal X-ray crystallography confirms the presence of the dumbbell-shaped SQ partial cages through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, lowering the polarity of the reaction solution by adding dichloromethane results in formation of the cubic octa(-butyl)silsesquioxane (; T) cage in a good yield (47%), which is isolated by crystallization from the reaction solution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665369>Voluntary folic  fortification levels of food staples in Ireland continue to decline: further implications for passive folic  intakes?</a></h2><p>Ireland previously had widespread voluntary fortification but research at Dublin City University carried out in 2014 by our research group demonstrated a major decline in the number of food staples fortified with folic  in Irish supermarkets over the previous 10 years. The aim of the study was to repeat the audit conducted 3 years ago to compare the levels of folic  fortification of foodstuffs over this time-frame.Over a period of 8-weeks between June and August 2017, the nutrition labels of all foodstuffs that might typically be fortified with micronutrients for sale in the supermarkets with the majority of market share in Ireland were examined. The amount of added folic  detailed on the label was compared with those captured in 2014.In total, 1081 products with added micronutrients were examined. In percentage terms, there has been a decline of Folic  (FA) fortified products within the food groups-spreads, breads, cereals, cereal snacks, milks, fruit juices, yogurts/yogurt drinks and  drinks since 2014.The number of food staples fortified with FA continues to decline demonstrating that voluntary fortification in Ireland is no longer an effective measure for passively augmenting the folic  levels of consumers.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this regard, algae are being exploited as a third generation feedstock for the production of biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, and biohydrogen. However, algal based biofuel does not reach successful peak due to the higher cost issues in cultivation, harvesting and extraction steps. Therefore, this review presents an extensive detail of deriving biofuels from algal biomass starting from various algae cultivation systems like raceway pond and photobioreactors and its bottlenecks. Evolution of biofuel feedstocks from edible oils to algae have been addressed in the initial section of the manuscript to provide insights on the different generation of biofuel. Different configuration of photobioreactor systems used to reduce contamination risk and improve biomass productivity were extensively discussed. Photobioreactor performance greatly relies on the conditions under which it is operated. Hence, the importance of such conditions alike temperature, light intensity, inoculum size, CO nutrient concentration, and mixing in bioreactor performance have been described. As the lipid is the main component in biodiesel production, several pretreatment methods such as physical, chemical and biological for disrupting cell membrane to extract lipid were comprehensively reviewed and presented. This review article had put forth the recent advancement in the pretreatment methods like hydrothermal processing of algal biomasses using  or alkali. Eventually, challenges and future dimensions in algal cultivation and pretreatment process were discussed in detail for making an economically viable algal biofuel.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A few studies have examined the effects of TeaCrine® on cognitive perception, but no research exists examining its effects on resistance exercise performance. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of TeaCrine®, a caffeine-like compound, on maximal muscular strength, endurance, and power performance in resistance-trained men.Twelve resistance-trained men participated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over designed study. Each participant performed one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press, 1RM squat, bench press repetitions to failure (RTF) at 70% 1RM, squat RTF at 70% 1RM, and 2-km rowing time trial 90 min after consumption of: (1) Caffeine 300 mg (CAFF300); (2) TeaCrine® 300 mg (TEA300); (3) TeaCrine® + Caffeine (COMBO; 150 mg/150 mg); (4) Placebo 300 mg (PLA). Power and velocity were measured using a TENDO Power Analyzer. Visual analogue scales for , focus, motivation to exercise, and fatigue were administered at baseline and 90 min post-treatment ingestion (pre-workout).

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the  soluble Cd in soil was increased by 2.83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate//amino  metabolism were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino  metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty  elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular  metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving. Interestingly, BHBA and IL-1β connected with the transcriptome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671268>Nanoholes Regulate the Phytotoxicity of Single-layer Molybdenum Disulﬁde.</a></h2><p>Single-layer molybdenum disulfide (SLMoS) are applied as a hot 2D nanosheet in various fields involving water treatments. Both intentional design and environmental or biological processes induce many nanoholes in SLMoS. However, the effects of nanoholes on the environmental stability and ecotoxicity of SLMoS remain largely unknown. The present work discovered that visible-light irradiation induced nanoholes (diameters, approximately 20 nm) in the plane of SLMoS, with irregular edges and increased interplanar crystal spacing. The ratios of Mo to S in pristine and transformed SLMoS were 0.53 and 0.33, respectively. After 96 h exposure at concentrations from 0.1-1 mg/L, the above nanoholes promoted algal division, induced a stress-response hormesis, decreased the generation of •OH and mitigated the cell shrinkage and wall rupture of Chlorella vulgaris induced by SLMoS. In terms of stress response, the nanohole-bearing SLMoS induced fewer vacuoles and polyphosphate bodies of Chlorella vulgaris than the pristine form. Metabolomic analysis revealed that nanoholes perturbed the metabolisms of , carbohydrates and fatty . This work proposes that nanoholes cause obvious effects on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of SLMoS and that the environmental risks of engineered nanomaterials should be reevaluated using nanohole-bearing rather than pristine forms for testing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671233>Effects of acute heat stress on intestinal microbiota in grow-finishing pigs, and associations with feed intake and serum profile.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to assess the effects of acute heat stress (HS) on intestinal microbiota, and the associations with the changes in feed intake (FI) and serum profile.Twenty four individually housed pigs (Duroc × Large White × Landrace, 30 ± 1 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (8 pigs / treatment): 1) thermal neutral (TN) conditions (25 ± 1°C), 2) HS conditions (35 ± 1°C), 3) pair-feeding (PF) with HS under TN conditions. After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with  metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681895>Enhanced Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Corncob by Synthesized Enzyme-Mimetic Magnetic Solid  Pretreatment in an Aqueous Phase.</a></h2><p>A novel magnetic carbon-based solid  catalyst (C350-Cl) was synthesized through a simple impregnation-carbonization process and used for the pretreatment of corncob in an aqueous medium. Under the optimized pretreatment reaction conditions, the yield of pentose reached 91.6% with a hemicellulose removal rate of 91.7%, and the subsequent enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated corncob residue reached 90.0% at 48 h. C350-Cl is a magnetic enzyme-mimetic solid  catalyst, and its catalytic behavior is similar to those of enzymes. In addition, the catalyst is also an excellent carrier for Fe and Cl in that the Fe and Clcan be released slowly in the pretreatment to assist the hydrolysis of lignocellulose.

There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes to malignant transformation and progression. Lipid metabolism is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and  balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675519>Ensiling characteristics, physicochemical structure and enzymatic hydrolysis of steam-exploded hippophae: Effects of calcium oxide, cellulase and Tween.</a></h2><p>To find a comprehensive way to enhance the utilizability of steam-exploded hippophae, calcium oxide (CaO) preimpregnation, cellulase-added storage and saccharification with addition of Tween 20 were investigated in this study. Both CaO preimpregnation and cellulase addition promoted the ensiling fermentation of anaerobically stored steam-exploded hippophae indicated by lower cellulose proportion and higher organic  content, but led to the decrease of saccharification yield by 11.83% and 46.77-51.22%, respectively. When taking into account of organic  being utilizable  source, storing with addition of cellulase enhanced the utilizability of the materials in whole. Moreover, the addition of Tween 20 enhanced saccharification yield of the steam-exploded hippophae by 26.69-45.25%. Additionally, FTIR and XRD spectra clearly illustrated the structural alteration during storage. It is concluded that storing with addition of cellulase and hydrolyzing with addition of Tween 20 can enhance the utilizability of steam-exploded hippophae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The synthetic approach involves a two-step successive polymerization reaction. First, the radical polymerization of NIPAM is done using 4-aminothiophenol as a chain transfer agent for the obtention of thermosensitive block terminated with an aniline (ANI) moiety. Second, the oxidative polymerization of ANI is initiated in ANI moiety of thermosensitive block to grow the second conductive PANI block.

Static Light Scattering (SLS) and UV-Visible combined measurements allowed the determination of the  for PNIPAM--PANI macromolecule: 5.5 × 10 g mol. The resulting copolymer is soluble in water (8.3 g L) and in non-aqueous solvents, such as ethanol, formic , acetonitrile, and others. Both polymer blocks chains show the properties of the polymer chains. The block copolymer shows a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at the same temperature (32-34 °C) than PNIPAM, while the copolymer shows pH dependent UV-vis-NIR absorption similar to PANI. The PNIPAM block suffers a coil to globule transition upon NIR light irradiation (785 nm, 100 mW), as shown by turbidimetry and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), due to local heating (more than 9 °C in 12 min) induced by the NIR absorption at the PANI block.

This may result from altered  metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg body weight) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05).

Using water spray to simulate rain, we demonstrate that jasmonic  (JA) signaling plays a key role in early gene-expression changes, well before it leads to developmental changes in flowering and plant architecture. The JA-activated transcription factors MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 modulate transiently induced expression of 266 genes, most of which peak within 30 min, and control 52% of genes induced >100-fold.

The polar modifiers adsorbed on the surface of sliding solids dominate the friction properties when the sliding surfaces are in close proximity. However, a few methods are available for the characterization of the adsorbed modifiers of a nanometer-scale thickness. In this study, we applied frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy to evaluate the vertical and lateral density distributions of the adsorbed modifier in a real lubricant, namely, poly-α-olefin (PAO) modified with an orthophosphoric  oleyl ester. The liquid-induced force on the probing tip was mapped on a plane that was perpendicular to the lubricant-iron interface with a force sensitivity on the order of 10 pN. The PAO in the absence of the ester modifier was directly exposed to the film, which produced a few liquid layers parallel to the film surface with layer-to-layer distances of 0.6-0.7 nm. A monomolecular layer of the modifier was intermittently adsorbed with increasing ester concentration in the bulk lubricant, with complete coverage seen at 20 ppm. The CH chains of the oleyl esters fluctuating in the lubricant produced a repulsive force on the tip, which monotonically decayed with the tip-to-surface distance. The dynamic friction coefficient of sliding steel-lubricant-steel interfaces, which was separately determined using a friction tester, was compared with the force map determined on the iron film immersed in the corresponding lubricant. The complete monomolecular layer of the ester modifier on the static lubricant-iron boundary is a requirement for achieving smooth and stable friction at the sliding interface.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652004>Drude polarizable force field for cation-π interactions of alkali and quaternary ammonium ions with aromatic amino  side chains.</a></h2><p>Cation-π interactions play important roles in molecular recognition and in the stability and function of proteins. However, accurate description of the structure and energetics of cation-π interactions presents a challenge to both additive and polarizable force fields, which are rarely designed to account for the complexation of charged groups with aromatic moieties.

Using an FAP-PK-130 commercial AEM, it was shown that the AEM-based process was more efficient than the traditional processes. Subsequently, 11 novel polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based blend AEMs were compared with the commercial AEM. The best performing novel AEM (BM-5), yielded a current efficiency of 95% at an SEC of 3.53 kWh/kg Fe, which is a 10% increase in current efficiency and a 0.72 kWh/kg Fe decrease in SEC when compared to the existing Pyror process. Furthermore, the use of the novel BM-5 AEM resulted in a 0.22 kWh/kg Fe lower SEC than that obtained with the commercial AEM, also showing mechanical stability in the EW flow cell. Finally, it was shown that below 5 g/L Fe, side reactions at the cathode resulted in a decrease in process efficiency, while 40 g/L yielded the highest efficiency and lowest SECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672317>Protein intake and amino  supplementation regulate exercise recovery and performance through the modulation of mTOR, AMPK, FGF21, and immunity.</a></h2><p>Exercise is considered to be the best approach to improve quality of life, and together with a healthy and adequate dietary pattern, exercise represents the best strategy to reduce the risk of chronic metabolic and inflammatory diseases, such as those related to obesity. The regularity and intensity of exercise is modulated at the molecular level in the skeletal muscle by two protein kinases, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which act as sensors of external stimuli, showing the  status of muscular fibers. The mTOR pathway is activated by insulin and amino  availability, and its metabolic actions culminate in increased protein synthesis and reduced autophagy, leading to an increase in muscle mass. In contrast, AMPK activation induces a transcriptional program aimed to increase the mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, transforming fast-twitch glycolytic fibers to slow-twitch oxidative fibers and increasing resistance to fatigue. In addition, inadequate exercise training induces imbalance in the immune response, generating excessive inflammation and/or immunosuppression. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that provide insight into dietary protein interventions and/or amino  supplementation that may improve outcomes after exercise by modulating 1) mTOR and AMPK activation during early exercise recovery, leading to increased muscle protein synthesis or increased oxidative capacity; 2) undesirable inflammatory responses; and 3) fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels that may have relevant implications in skeletal muscle metabolism, particularly during the exercise recovery and performance of obese subjects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to characterize main constituents of Ocimum basilicum L. (OB) aqueous extract and examine its protective effect on doxorubicin/irradiation (DOXO/IR)-induced testicular injury in rats.Spectrophotometric analysis showed considerable amount of polyphenolic (146.31 µg/mg) and flavonoid contents (28.63 µg/mg); UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis revealed that the major flavonoid was apigenin-O-glucoside (7.53%) followed by luteolin (5.94%), while rosmarinic  was the major polyphenolic (15.76%) followed by caftaric  (9.39%); rutin and querctin were also present and were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Administration of OB extract (200 mg/kg per day; p.o.) to DOXO/IR rats resulted in marked improvement of associated testicular damage.Ocimum basilicum L. significantly decreased testicular levels of nuclear factor-kappa B and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2)-associated protein X, along with caspase-3 immunohistochemical staining. In addition, OB elevated testicular total antioxidant capacity, nuclear erythroid-related factor-2, Bcl2 and testosterone contents and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining. Such changes were also accompanied by restoration of testicular architecture.The study highlights the protective role of OB aqueous extract in hampering most of the harmful chemotherapy/radiotherapy-induced outcomes via its antioxidant, antiapoptotic and cell regeneration abilities. Such findings may offer an incentive in expanding its use during chemotherapy and radiotherapy.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669864>Effects of the dietary inclusion of babassu oil or buriti oil on lamb performance, meat quality and fatty  composition.</a></h2><p>The effects of adding babassu oil (BAO) or buriti oil (BUO) to lamb diets, on performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality and fatty  (FA) composition were evaluated.

A promising approach for an effective anti-inflammatory therapy is the development of inhibitors targeting more than one enzyme of this cascade. Aiming to develop balanced COX/LOX inhibitors; 4-aminosalicylate based thiazolinones having different substituents at the 5th position of the 4-thiazolinone ring (2-22) were designed, synthesized, characterized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their anti-inflammatory activity. Most of the investigated compounds showed high COX-2 inhibitory potencies (IC 39-200 nM) with selectivity indexes (30-84). Two compounds, 19 and 21, (IC = 41 and 44 nM), are equipotent to celecoxib (IC = 49 nM), while compound 22 (IC = 39 nM) was the most potent. For 15-LOX, compounds 5, 11, 19, 21 and 22 revealed higher potency (IC 1.5-2.2 µM) than zileuton (IC 15 µM). Thus, compounds 5, 11, 19, 21 and 22 are potent dual inhibitors of COX-2 and 15-LOX. In vivo anti-inflammatory testing of these compounds revealed that, compounds 5 and 21 had an anti-inflammatory activity similar to indomethacin and celecoxib (% inhibition of oedema = 60 ± 9) and higher than diclofenac potassium (% inhibition = 52 ± 29), while compound 22 (% inhibition = 63 ± 5) was more active than the reference drugs. The results showed that the activity is controlled by the bulkiness and lipophilicity of the substituent at the 5th position. The cytotoxicity results revealed that all compounds are not cytotoxic, additionally, in an experimental model of ulcerogenic effect, the most active compounds 21 and 22 showed better safety profile than indomethacin. Further, at the active sites of the COX-1, COX-2 and 15-LOX co-crystal, 19, 21, and 22 showed high binding forces in free binding  study, which is consistent with in vitro and in vivo results. In conclusion, these compounds are good candidates for further biological investigation as potential anti-inflammatory drugs with dual balanced inhibition of COX and 15-LOX and good safety profile.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Under physiologic conditions, there is a distinct and finely tuned balance between the utilization of these substrates. Using the non-ischemic heart as an example, we discuss that upon stress this substrate balance is upset resulting in an over-reliance on either fatty  or glucose, and that chronic fuel shifts towards a single type of substrate appear to be linked with cardiac dysfunction. These observations suggest that interventions aimed at re-balancing a tilted substrate preference towards an appropriate mix of substrates may result in restoration of cardiac contractile performance. Examples of manipulating cellular substrate uptake as a means to re-balance fuel supply, being associated with mended cardiac function underscore this concept. We also address the molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent need for a fatty -glucose fuel balance. We propose that re-balancing cellular fuel supply, in particular with respect to fatty  and glucose, may be an effective strategy to treat the failing heart.Copyright © 2019 The Author.

The goal of this study was to further explore the pharmacodynamic substances that inhibit  metabolism.The components of DHZCP absorbed into plasma were identified by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The Swiss and STITCH databases were used for target collection. The DAVID database was used for pathway enrichment analysis. Cytoscape software was used for network construction. The CCK-8 method detected cell viability. Chemiluminescence was used to detect ATP levels.A total of 89 components absorbed into plasma were identified by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Based on this, 24 potential pharmacodynamic substances were selected by network pharmacology. Among them, 11 components such as rhein can significantly inhibit ATP levels.Rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, hypoxanthine, baicalein, baicalin, wogonoside, acteoside, formononetin, isoliquiritigenin, and glycyrrhizic  were the pharmacodynamic substances responsible for inhibition of  metabolism of DHZCP.Copyright © 2019.

The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins, lipid metabolism proteins, cytoskeleton proteins,  metabolism proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

The ZIF-8@SiO@FeO derived from self-assembly of ZIF-8 and SiO@FeO were then synthesized and used for ceftazidime (CAZ) removal. ZIF-8 was a regular dodecahedral particle with uniform particle size. The pore diameter was 6.47 nm and the specific surface area was 1182.5 m²·g in ZIF-8@SiO@FeO. The adsorption of CAZ on ZIF-8@SiO@FeO as a function of adsorption temperature, contact time, ionic strength solution pH, and humic  concentration were investigated. The error of equilibrium adsorption capacity between model fitting and actual experiments is only 1.19%. Kinetics for CAZ removal on ZIF-8@SiO@FeO was found to follow pseudo-second-order kinetics. Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips isotherm fitted the adsorption data well and gave similar correlation coefficients, suggesting a single layer adsorption of CAZ on ZIF-8@SiO@FeO. The ZIF-8@SiO@FeO showed no apparent loss in CAZ adsorption after five cycles. These features indicate that the ZIF-8@SiO@FeO may be a promising adsorbent for CAZ removal from aqueous solution.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such a method normally uses fluorescent proteins or chemical labeling methods which are often only accessible to surface exposed residues and risk disturbing target protein structures. Here, we demonstrate that the genetic incorporation of a synthetic fluorescent amino , L-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Cou), and natural endogenous fluorophore Tryptophan (Trp) residues of a protein, could serve as an efficient FRET pair to monitor protein interactions, using the signaling transducer β-arrestin-1 as a model system. We used this technology to record the dynamic spectra in both binding and competition experiments of β-arrestin-1, the contribution of each specific phosphate in ternary complex formation, in a rapid and efficient manner. The determined Kd value for the association between the active arres-tin and Fab30 is 0.68 μM in the three components interaction system. Moreover, we were able to determine the contributions of the site 3 phospho-site and the site 6 phospho-site binding each contributed to the high affinity ternary complex assem-bling as 2.7 folds and 15.5 folds respectively, which were never determined before. These results thus highlighted the poten-tial usage of this new method in measurement of the allosteric induced enhanced affinity with small amount proteins and in a fast manner and in a complex system.

The xanthotoxin cocrystals were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and FT-IR spectra, and the crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystal structures and thermal analysis showed that XT-OA was more stable than XT-PABA.  framework calculation indicated that H-bond and π···π interactions generated in XT-OA were stronger than that in XT-PABA and xanthotoxin. The powder dissolution experiments of xanthotoxin and its cocrystals suggested the XT-OA cocrystal might be applied as an alternative formulation of API, on account of its enhanced solubility and stability in the hydrochloric  buffer solution (pH 1.2).

Increased UGCG synthesis is associated with pro-cancerous processes such as increased proliferation and multidrug resistance in several cancer types. We investigated the influence of UGCG overexpression on glutamine metabolism in breast cancer cells. We observed adapted glucose and glutamine uptake in a limited  supply environment following UGCG overexpression. Glutamine is used for reinforced oxidative stress response shown by increased mRNA expression of glutamine metabolizing proteins such as glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) resulting in increased reduced glutathione (GSH) level. Augmented glutamine uptake is also used for fueling the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle to maintain the proliferative advantage of UGCG overexpressing cells.

Specifically, the assumption of constant loss of  of digestible organic matter from  losses in urine and CH4 applied in evaluation of silage metabolisable  (ME) was investigated. Urinary excretion of high- phenolic compounds related to solubilisation of lignin was assumed to affect urinary  (UE) losses from sheep fed highly digestible grass silage (GS). A total of 25 primary growth and regrowth silages of timothy (Phleum pratense) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) grass mixtures and red clover (Trifolium pratense) samples collected in digestibility trials with sheep, including faecal and urine samples, were used for  and N determinations. Urinary concentration of monophenolic compounds and CH4 emissions in vitro were also analysed. Daily faecal N output, CH4 yield (MJ/kg DM intake), proportion of CH4  in digestible  (DE) and proportion of UE in DE were greater (P ≤ 0.03) in sheep fed red clover silage (RCS) than GS. Furthermore, less (P = 0.01)  was lost as UE of DE in sheep fed primary growth GS compared with the other treatments. The relationship between UE and silage N intake or urinary N output for both silage types (i.e. grass v. red clover) was strong, but the fit of the regressions was better for GS than RCS. The CH4/DE ratio decreased (P < 0.05) and the UE/DE ratio increased (P < 0.05) with increasing organic matter digestibility in RCS. These relationships were not significant (P < 0.05) for the GS diets. The regression coefficient was higher (P < 0.05) for GS than RCS when regressing ME concentration on digestible organic matter. The results of this study imply that ME/DE ratio is not constant across first-cut GS of different maturities. The ME production response may be smaller from highly digestible first-cut GS but could not be clearly related to urinary excretion of monophenols derived from solubilisation of lignin. Furthermore,  lost in urine was not clearly defined for RCS and was much more predictable for GS from silage N concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677481>Simultaneous determination of 24 free amino  in MGC803 cells by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Amino  play key roles in cellular protein biosynthesis and  metabolism pathways. In this study, a simple, rapid and sensitive method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 24 free amino  in cell samples using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS). Cell samples were deproteinized with methanol/HO (80:20, v/v) without intricate derivatization process. The analytes were separated on a Waters BEH Amide column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm), and accomplished within 5 min at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The good linearity was obtained for all analytes (r > 0.99) with the limits of quantification from 0.1 to 25 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 0.35 to 10.36% and from 2.22 to 9.93%, respectively. The recoveries of most analytes were between 80% and 120% with RSD less than 10.0%. The developed method was then applied to the direct analysis of 24 underivatized amino  in human gastric cancer cell line MGC803 treated with the antitumor candidate drug J3, and significant differences in the concentration levels of amino  were also assessed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Because the intensity and quality of sunlight can change dramatically throughout the day, various regulatory mechanisms help plants adjust their photosynthetic output accordingly, including the regulation of light  accumulation to prevent the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism that dissipates excess light , but how it is regulated is not fully elucidated. Herein, we report a new NPQ-regulatory protein named Day-Length-dependent Delayed-Greening1 (DLDG1). The Arabidopsis DLDG1 associates with the chloroplast envelope membrane, and the dldg1 mutant had a large NPQ value compared with wild type. The mutant also had a pale-green phenotype in developing leaves but only under continuous light; this phenotype was not observed when dldg1 was cultured in the dark for ≥8 h per day. DLDG1 is a homolog of the plasma-membrane-localizing cyanobacterial proton-extrusion-protein A that is required for light-induced H+ extrusion, and also shows similarity in its amino- sequence to that of Ycf10 encoded in the plastid genome. Arabidopsis DLDG1 enhances the growth-retardation phenotype of the Escherichia coli K+/H+ antiporter mutant, and the everted membrane vesicles of the E. coli expressing DLDG1 show the K+/H+ antiport activity. Our findings suggest that DLDG1 functionally interacts with Ycf10 to control H+ homeostasis in chloroplasts, which is important for the light-acclimation response, by optimizing the extent of NPQ.© The Author(s) 2019.

Planktonically grown  is known to prioritize the consumption of organic  including lactic  over catabolism of glucose using a CCR strategy termed "reverse diauxie."  is an opportunistic pathogen with well-documented biofilm phenotypes that are distinct from its planktonic phenotypes. Reverse diauxie has been described in planktonic cultures, but it has not been documented explicitly in  biofilms. Here a combination of exometabolomics and label-free proteomics was used to analyze planktonic and biofilm phenotypes for reverse diauxie.  biofilm cultures preferentially consumed lactic  over glucose, and in addition, the cultures catabolized the substrates completely and did not exhibit the acetate secreting "overflow" metabolism that is typical of many model microorganisms. The biofilm phenotype was enabled by changes in protein abundances, including lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, GTP cyclohydrolase, L-ornithine N(5)-monooxygenase, and superoxide dismutase. These results are noteworthy because reverse diauxie-mediated catabolism of organic  necessitates a terminal electron acceptor like O, which is typically in low supply in biofilms due to diffusion limitation. Label-free proteomics identified dozens of proteins associated with biofilm formation including 16 that have not been previously reported, highlighting both the advantages of the methodology utilized here and the complexity of the proteomic adaptation for  biofilms. Documenting the reverse diauxic phenotype in  biofilms is foundational for understanding cellular nutrient and  fluxes, which ultimately control growth and virulence.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677136>The Effects of Conspecific Alarm Cues on Larval Cane Toads (Rhinella marina).</a></h2><p>Many aquatic organisms detect and avoid damage-released cues from conspecifics, but the chemical basis of such responses, and the effects of prolonged exposure to such cues, remain poorly understood. Injured tadpoles of the cane toad (Rhinella marina) produce chemical cues that induce avoidance by conspecific tadpoles; and chronic exposure to those cues decreases rates of tadpole survival and growth, and reduces body size at metamorphosis. Such effects suggest that we might be able to use the cane toads' alarm cue for biocontrol of invasive populations in Australia. In the present study, we examined behavioral and ecological effects of compounds that are present in cane toad tadpoles and thus, might trigger avoidance of crushed conspecifics. Four chemicals (L-Arg, L-Leu-L-Leu-OH, L-Leu-L-Ile-OH and suberic ) induced behavioral avoidance in toad tadpoles at some (but not all) dosage levels, so we then exposed toad larvae to these chemicals over the entire period of larval development. Larval survival and size at metamorphosis were decreased by chronic exposure to crushed conspecifics (consistent with earlier studies), but not by exposure to any of the four chemicals. Indeed, L-Arg increased body size at metamorphosis. We conclude that the behavioral response to crushed conspecifics by cane toad tadpoles can be elicited by a variety of chemical cues, but that consistent exposure to these individual chemical cues does not affect tadpole viability or developmental trajectory. The optimal behavioral tactic of a tadpole may be to flee if it encounters even a single chemical cue likely to have come from an injured conspecific (indicative of predation risk), whereas the continuing presence of that single chemical (but no others) provides a less reliable signal of predation risk. Our data are consistent with results from studies on fish, that suggest a role for multiple chemicals in initiating alarm responses to damage-released cues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683048>Biotechnological perspectives on algae: a viable option for next generation biofuels.</a></h2><p>Because of their biofuel producing capabilities, algae (including microalgae and cyanobacteria) are effective and sustainable tools to attain  security with a growing world population and for reduction of our current reliance on fossil fuels.

Here, we report a case of CD36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy with a unique pathophysiology. Heart failure was accelerated by co-existing mitral valve prolapse (MVP) without a distinct phenotype of hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy.A middle-aged man was aware of dyspnoea and hospitalized for heart failure with MVP. Cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency was found based on the absence of myocardial l-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic  (BMIPP) uptake by myocardial scintigraphy. Type I CD36 deficiency was further diagnosed by the lack of CD36 in both platelets and monocytes by flow cytometry. Left ventricular muscle was obtained intraoperatively, and a histological examination reflected compensative hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes with myofibrillar loss and reactive fibrosis. The microvascular structure around the cardiomyocytes was highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for CD31, while CD36 expression was absent. He had an operation of mitral valve replacement and improved heart failure.Cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency potentially mediates various pathological conditions in the heart. Incidental CD36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy may accelerate heart failure in the presence of co-existing heart diseases. BMIPP scintigraphy might be helpful for predicting CD36 deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

It requires many and different radioactivity measurements in order to radiation protection, radioactive waste management and environmental protection. An accurate and reliable determination of Strontium-90 in various environment matrices has been studied with many techniques such as co-precipitation, ion exchange, solvent extraction and extraction chromatography for environmental contamination monitoring purposes. In this study, the method used for dissolution and radiochemical separation to determine strontium-90 activity concentration in tea matrix used as proficiency test sample with liquid scintillation counter was investigated. As a result of these studies, the average mean activity concentration of strontium-90 in proficiency test material was determined as 155 ± 16 Bq kg dry matter (k = 2) by liquid scintillation efficiency tracing (CIEMAT/NIST) method for seven selected samples. This value was also confirmed by Joint Research Center-Geel with the CIEMAT/NIST method. The proficiency test results for consistency were checked by Dioxon's Q-test. Uncertainties arising from counting statistics, background, weighing, half-life, chemical recovery, efficiency and homogeneity were calculated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epitopes centering GSTA sequence are also predicted by NetMHC programs to bind to MHC molecules. Detecting MUC1 glycopeptide epitopes remains a challenge since antigenic epitopes are often shorter than 10 amino .In this study, we used pronase from Streptomyces griseus, which has no amino  sequence preference for enzymatic cleavage sites, to digest synthetic glycopeptides RPAPGST (Tn)APPAHG and RPAPGS (Tn)TAPPAHG, and analyzed the digests by LC-MS using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and higher- collisional dissociation (HCD) methods with Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid Mass Spectrometer.We found that short glycopeptides containing 8 to 11 amino  could be efficiently generated by pronase digestion. Such glycopeptides of minimal epitope lengths were clearly distinguished by characteristic MS/MS ion patterns and elution profiles of liquid chromatography. A glycopeptide library was generated which may serve as standards for measuring neoantigen epitopes centering GSTA sequence.Our data established the LC-MS/MS identities of a clinically-relevant MUC1 glycopeptide neoantigen epitope centering GSTA motif. A library of short MUC1 glycopeptides centered on GSTA motif was created, which is a critical step for analysis of such antigen epitopes in real biological samples.This article is protected by copyright.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) primarily regulates the expression of target genes involved in  control as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Although the pivotal roles of these receptors on female fertility have been reported, there are limited studies addressing PPARs role(s) in the male. This study was designed to determine and compare  and  mRNA expression in sperm cells of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men. In addition, flow cytometric analyses, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to evaluate PPARγ protein levels in spermatozoa. We have compared the sperm  mRNA relative expression in 27 normozoospermic and 28 asthenozoospermic samples and monitored sperm PPARγ protein levels in 39 normozoospermic and 40 asthenozoospermic samples using flow cytometry. We have also assessed in a sub-group of seven normozoospermic and eight asthenozoospermic samples, PPARγ protein levels by western blotting. Relative expression of PPARγ mRNA in normozoospermic men was found to be significantly higher (P = 0.004) than in asthenozoospermic men while  and  relative expression was similar in the two groups. Likewise,  showed a positive correlation with motility (r = 0.34; P < 0.05), sperm concentration (r = 0.33) and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (r = 0.31). In agreement with the mRNA behavior, sperm PPARγ protein levels as measured by flow cytometry (P = 0.066) and western blot (P = 0.089) showed a tendency to be higher in normozoospermic than asthenozoospermic men.

Mitochondrial proteins have been discovered to modulate these signaling pathway networks, and multiple biological behaviors to adapt to various internal environments or signaling events of human pathogenesis. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction that alters the bioenergetic and biosynthetic state might contribute to multiple diseases, including cell transformation and tumor. Multiomics studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell cycle dysregulation signaling pathways operate in human pituitary adenomas, which suggest mitochondria play critical roles in pituitary adenomas. Some drugs targeting mitochondria are found as a therapeutic strategy for pituitary adenomas, including melatonin, melatonin inhibitors, temozolomide, pyrimethamine, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic , gossypol acetate, Yougui pill, T-2 toxin, grifolic , cyclosporine A, dopamine agonists, and paeoniflorin.

By taking into account that storage is a key factor in the effective use of renewable , the present article is an overview about storage systems which are appropriate for BIPV and BIPVT applications. The literature review shows that there are multiple storage solutions, based on different kinds of materials (batteries, Phase Change Material (PCM) components, etc.). In terms of BIPV and BIPVT with batteries or PCMs or water tanks as storage systems, most of the installations are non-concentrating, façade- or roof-integrated, water- or air-based (in the case of BIPVT) and include silicon-based PV cells, lead- or lithium-ion batteries, paraffin- or salt-based PCMs. Regarding parameters that affect the environmental profile of storage systems, in the case of batteries critical factors such as material manufacturing, accidental release of electrolytes, inhalation toxicity, flammable elements, degradation and end-of-life management play a pivotal role. Regarding PCMs, there are some materials that are corrosive and present fire-safety issues as well as high toxicity in terms of human health and ecosystems. Concerning water storage tanks, based on certain studies about tanks with volumes of 300 L and 600 L, their impacts range from 5.9 to 11.7 GJ and from 0.3 to 1.0 t CO. Finally, it should be noted that additional storage options such as Trombe walls, pebble beds and nanotechnologies are critically discussed. The contribution of the present article to the existing literature is associated with the fact that it presents a critical review about storage devices in the case of BIPV and BIPVT applications, by placing emphasis on the environmental profile of certain storage materials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cu and InO catalysts both show catalytic activity for acetic  hydrogenation. However, monometallic Cu catalysts are less active in the dissociative adsorption of acetic  through C-O bond breaking, while the H adsorption and dissociation ability of InO is weak. In this work, Cu/InO is designed to enhance the dissociation of both acetic  and H. The detailed mechanism of acetic  hydrogenation to ethanol on Cu/InO is explored using periodic density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the H adsorption and dissociation are enhanced by the Cu cluster, while the H atom spillover from Cu to InO is favorable on the Cu/InO(110) surface. Additionally, a synergistic effect exists between the Cu cluster and InO surface: H adsorbs on the Cu cluster and the dissociated H atoms react with acetic  activated by the InO oxygen vacancy. Finally, compared with a CuIn(100) surface, the Cu/InO(110) surface possesses higher catalytic activity owing to the reduced  barriers of acetic  dissociation and hydrogenation of the intermediates (CHCOO*, CHCHO*, and CHCHO*). The Cu/InO catalyst proposed in this work can provide promising guidance for related catalyst design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652604>Hyperacetylation of Cardiac Mitochondrial Proteins Is Associated with Metabolic Impairment and Sirtuin Downregulation after Chronic Total Body Irradiation of ApoE  Mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Alteration in  metabolism has been suggested to contribute to radiation-induced heart pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction being a hallmark of this disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the regulatory role of acetylation in heart mitochondria in the long-term response to chronic radiation. ApoE-deficient C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate (20 mGy/day) gamma radiation for 300 days, resulting in a cumulative total body dose of 6.0 Gy. Heart mitochondria were isolated and analyzed using quantitative proteomics. Radiation-induced proteome and acetylome alterations were further validated using immunoblotting, enzyme activity assays, and ELISA. In total, 71 proteins showed peptides with a changed acetylation status following irradiation. The great majority (94%) of the hyperacetylated proteins were involved in the TCA cycle, fatty  oxidation, oxidative stress response and sirtuin pathway. The elevated acetylation patterns coincided with reduced activity of mitochondrial sirtuins, increased the level of Acetyl-CoA, and were accompanied by inactivation of major cardiac metabolic regulators PGC-1 alpha and PPAR alpha. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial acetylation after irradiation is associated with impairment of heart metabolism. We propose a novel mechanism involved in the development of late cardiac damage following chronic irradiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658659>A Facile Method to Prepare Silver Doped Graphene Combined with Polyaniline for High Performances of Filter Paper Based Flexible Electrode.</a></h2><p>A flexible filter paper based composite electrode was prepared via the convenient one-step synthesis of silver doped graphene for the first time, followed by in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers. Using L-ascorbic  for simultaneous reduction of grapheme oxide and silver nitrate, we provided a new and green method to prepare graphene hybrid sheets without toxicity. It was found that the as-fabricated hybrid electrode formed a three-dimensional porous architecture, which not only increased the specific surface area of composite, but also facilitated the ion diffusion of the electrolyte. In addition, according to the tests of electrochemical performances, the flexible hybrid electrode subsequently exhibited exceptional specific capacitance of 437.3 F/g,  density of 1133.5 W·h/kg and power density of 88.8 kW/kg, respectively. Meanwhile, the as-prepared hybrid demonstrated a good cycling stability with only 10.99% specific capacitance deterioration after 5000 times of cycling. This preparation technology presented here shows great potential for the development and application of wearable and portable  storage devices, particularly for flexible supercapacitors. Moreover, this study puts forward a general, simple and low-cost route of fabricating a novel flexible electrode on a large scale, eventually for environmental protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678210>Targeting glucose metabolism to suppress cancer progression: prospective of anti-glycolytic cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>Most solid tumor cells adapt to their heterogeneous microenvironment by depending largely on aerobic glycolysis for  production, a phenomenon called the Warburg effect, which is a hallmark of cancer. The altered  metabolism not only provides cancer cell with ATP for cellular , but also generate essential metabolic intermediates that play a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of macromolecules, to support cell proliferation, invasiveness, and chemoresistance. The cellular metabolic reprogramming in cancer is regulated by several oncogenic proteins and tumor suppressors such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), Myc, p53, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis can help in developing glycolytic inhibitors as anticancer agents. These metabolic antiglycolytic agents could be more effective if used in drug combinations to combat cancer. Several preclinical and early clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of targeting the glycolytic pathway as a therapeutic approach to suppress cancer progression. This review aimed to present the most recent data on the emerging drug candidate targeting enzymes and intermediates involved in glucose metabolism to provide therapeutic opportunities and challenges for antiglycolytic cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019.

The transport and retention of CuO NPs are vital to understanding the fate as well as the life cycle of CuO NPs in the environment. This study systematically investigates the transport and retention of CuO NPs in saturated porous media, and the experimental results were explained by the CFT and DLVO theory. The van der Waals force between CuO NPs and collector was repulsive, resulting in the unfavorable deposition condition. Column experiments were conducted with saturated quartz sand under environmentally relevant pH (6, 8, 9), ionic strength (IS, 1, 10, 50 mM), and humic  (HA, 0.1-10 mg-C/mL). Experimental results show that the breakthrough curves (BCTs) were affected by different pH and IS. Under pH 6 and 9, the mobility of CuO NPs was enhanced by high IS while the mobility was inhibited by high IS under pH 8. The mobility of CuO NPs was enhanced by humic  and the effect was best at 0.5 mg-C/mL HA. The experimental results were successfully explained by CFT and DLVO theory, the main mechanisms were aggregation of CuO NPs, interaction  and collision between CuO NPs and collector. In general, these findings can improve our understanding of the transport and retention of CuO NPs in subsurface environments, and suggest pH, IS, HA may be key factors governing mobility and stability of CuO NPs in natural environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant advances in the chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity of [2+2] photocycloadditions have been made, but exceptional and tunable diastereoselectivity and regioselectivity (head-to-head versus head-to-tail adducts) is required for the synthesis of bioactive molecules.

This study aimed to investigate the bactericidal effect of direct application of an APPJ using helium gas (He-APPJ) on  biofilms on sandblasted and -etched (SLA) titanium discs.On the SLA discs covered by  biofilms, an APPJ with helium (He) as a discharge gas was applied at 3 different time intervals (0, 3, and 5 minutes). To evaluate the effect of the plasma itself, the He gas-only group was used as the control group. The bactericidal effect of the He-APPJ was determined by the number of colony-forming units. Bacterial viability was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and bacterial morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).As the plasma treatment time increased, the amount of  decreased, and the difference was statistically significant. In the SEM images, compared to the control group, the bacterial biofilm structure on SLA discs treated by the He-APPJ for more than 3 minutes was destroyed. In addition, the CLSM images showed consistent results. Even in sites distant from the area of direct He-APPJ exposure, decontamination effects were observed in both SEM and CLSM images.He-APPJ application was effective in removing  biofilm on SLA titanium discs in an  experiment.Copyright © 2019.

Two initiation channels, one producing sarcosine, the other N-methylaminomethylphosphonic , have been located. Both initial products decompose to dimethylamine and the mechanism of further decomposition and toxic products is explored.

The ratios of the slopes of the correlations between -DlnA values and individual DBPs concentrations (S/S) were observed to be linearly correlated with the ratios of the Gibbs free energies (ΔG/ΔG) of the corresponding reactions of chloramine and chlorine with acetaldehyde which was used as a model DBP precursor in QC simulations. Further QC examination of the kinetics of chlorination and chloramination of the model compound acetoacetic  showed that the activation  of reactions between monochloramine that directly participates in substitution reactions to form mono-, di and tri-halogenated intermediates are 2-3 times higher than those of HOCl formed via the hydrolysis monochloramine. This result confirms that the interactions of chloramine with NOM and ensuing DBP formation are primarily mediated by the free chlorine released as a result of the hydrolysis of monochloramine while direct halogenation of NOM by monochloramine is likely to provide a small contribution to DBP formation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Triplet excited states of these drugs have been shown as reporters of FQ self-association using laser flash photolysis technique. A study using low-temperature phosphorescence technique was performed with quinolone derivatives such as enoxacin (ENX), norfloxacin (NFX), pefloxacin (PFX), ciprofloxacin (CPX, ofloxacin (OFX), nalidixic  (NLA), pipemidic  (PPA) and piromidic  (PRA) to explore emission changes associated with self-associations and to shed some light on the triplet excited state  (E) discrepancies described in the literature for most of these drugs. The emissions obtained at 77 K in buffered aqueous medium revealed that the amphoteric nature of the quinolones CPX, NFX, PFX, ENX, OFX and PPA must generate their self-associations because a redshift of their phosphorescence maxima is produced by FQ concentrations increases. Hence, this effect was not observed for NLA and PRA or when all quinolones were analysed using ethanol or ethylene glycol aqueous mixtures as glassed solvents. Interestingly, the presence of these organic mixtures produced a blue-shift in the phosphorescence emission maximum of each FQ. Additionally, laser flash photolysis experiments with PRA and the amphoteric quinolone PPA, compounds with the same skeleton but different peripheral substituent, confirm the expected correlations between the amphoteric nature of compounds and their self-associations in aqueous media because the excimer generation was only detected for PPA. Now, the discrepancies described in the literature for the E of FQs can be understood considering that changes of medium polarity or proticity as well as the temperature can considerably modify their E values. Thereby, low-temperature phosphorescence technique, is an effective way to detect molecular self-associations and surrounding changes in quinolones that opens the possibility to evaluate these effects in other drug families.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The clock-driven cellular oscillations are highly tissue specific to efficiently fine-tune local signaling, manage  use and segregate incompatible processes. In most peripheral tissues, food acts as the main cue that entrains the oscillations to external time. Food intake and  balance are under control of endocannabinoid (EC) signaling. Despite this obvious link between the circadian and EC systems, evidence for their interaction started to emerge only recently. We used targeted lipidomics to analyze circadian variations in EC tone in rat plasma, liver and adrenal tissue. The results provide the evidence that ECs, monoacylglycerols, N-acylethanolamines and their precursors oscillate with a tissue-specific circadian phase in plasma and liver. We then identified a set of rhythmically expressed genes likely responsible for the variations in EC tissue tone. In contrast to the liver, EC levels did not oscillate in the adrenal glands. Instead, we revealed that local EC receptor genes are under circadian regulation. To explore the impact of metabolic signals on expression of these genes, we used daytime-restricted feeding schedule. We subsequently showed that daytime feeding strongly suppressed liver-expressed fatty  binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and adrenal-expressed non-canonical endocannabinoid receptors Gpr55 and Trpv1, whereas it upregulated liver-expressed Trpv1 and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (Gde1).

Silk scaffolds were fabricated from dissolved Bombyx mori silk fibers by freeze-drying, resulting in silk scaffolds with high porosity (>94%), well-connected macropores, a high swelling degree (>550%) and resistance to in vitro degradation. Furthermore, drug-loaded scaffolds displayed a sustained drug release and excellent cytocompatibility could be observed with osteoblast-like MG63 cells. Cultivating M1-like macrophages on the scaffolds revealed that scaffolds loaded with nicotinic  suppress gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α, CXCL10 and CD197 as well as secretion of TNF-α in a concentration dependant manner.

No effect was observed on either the protein recovery or the content of sugars and lignin in the extraction residues. Concerning the recovery of proteins, three operational parameters were evaluated by response surface methodology. The optimum (63.1%) was achieved using NaOH 0.7 M at 100 °C for 240 min. Then, the selected scheme was applied to olive leaves from the field, observing differences in the content of some of the studied components.

Using solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography method, the detection limits were 0.005-0.046 μg mL and the recoveries were between 82.3-104.3%. The improved adsorption performance may be assigned to the synergistic effects among boronate-affinity, hollow SnO, and 2-AE self-polymerization. It may enhance binding cavities, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility of adsorbent material, and prevent the aggregation of Sn during the preparation processes.Copyright © 2019.

The atypical profilin Arabidopsis AtPRF3 has been reported to cooperate with canonical profilin isoforms in suppressing formin-mediated actin polymerization during plant innate immunity responses. AtPRF3 has a 37-amino--long N terminal extension (NTE), and its suppressive effect on actin assembly is derived from enhanced interaction with the poly-proline (Poly-P) of the formin AtFH1. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of AtPRF3Δ22 and AtPRF3Δ37, as well as AtPRF2 apo form and in complex with AtFH1 Poly-P at 1.5-3.6 Å resolutions. By combining these structures with molecular modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE has high plasticity, with a primary "closed" conformation that can adopt an open conformation that enables Poly-P binding. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation and free- calculations of protein-protein binding, along with experimental validation, we show that the AtPRF3Δ22 binds to Poly-P in an adaptive manner, thereby enabling different binding modes that maintain the interaction through disordered sequences. Together, our structural and simulation results suggest that the dynamic conformational changes of the AtPRF3 NTE upon Poly-P binding modulate their interactions to fine-tune formin-mediated actin assembly.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653845>Anomalous hydrogen evolution behavior in high-pH environment induced by locally generated hydronium ions.</a></h2><p>Most fundamental studies of electrocatalysis are based on the experimental and simulation results obtained for bulk model materials. Some of these mechanistic understandings are inapplicable for more active nanostructured electrocatalysts. Herein, considering the simplest and most typical electrocatalytic process, the hydrogen evolution reaction, an alternative reaction mechanism is proposed for nanomaterials based on the identification of a new intermediate, which differs from those commonly known for the bulk counterparts. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical thermal/kinetic measurements were conducted on a series of nanomaterials under different conditions. In high-pH electrolytes with negligible hydronium (HO) concentration in bulk phase, massive HO intermediates are found generating on the catalytic surface during water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption processes. These HO intermediates create a unique -like local reaction environment on nanostructured catalytic surfaces and cut the  barrier of the overall reaction. Such phenomena on nanostructured electrocatalysts explain their widely observed anomalously high activity under high-pH conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675854>The dual-function of lipoic  groups as surface anchors and sulfhydryl reactive sites on polymer-stabilized QDs and Au nanocolloids.</a></h2><p>Coating inorganic nanocrystals [e.g., quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles] with polymer ligands presenting multiple lipoic  anchoring groups provides nanocolloids with remarkable long-term colloidal and photophysical stability. Here, we show that the natural swelling of macromolecules leaves a fraction of the lipoic  groups in the surface coating free, which are targeted for activation and conjugation to target molecules, using the reliable sulfhydryl-to-maleimide reaction. This implies that simple and efficient functionalization of the nanocrystals can be achieved without introducing additional reactive groups in the coating. We apply a photomediated ligand exchange strategy to luminescent QDs and AuNPs and react the resulting nanocrystals with maleimide Cy3 dye. We then use optical absorption and resonance  transfer measurements applied to QD-Cy3 and AuNP-Cy3 conjugates to extract estimates for the fraction of accessible lipoic  groups per QD or AuNP. In addition, we demonstrate the potential utility of this approach by constructing a ratiometric pH sensor made of QD-SNARF conjugates. Our ligand design combined with the photoligation strategy yield colloidally stable dispersions of QDs and AuNPs that present accessible reactive thiols, without introducing new functionalities or requiring disulfide reducing reagents, making them useful for potential use in applications such as biological sensing and imaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652958>Quantitative H NMR Metabolomics Reveal Distinct Metabolic Adaptations in Human Macrophages Following Differential Activation.</a></h2><p>Macrophages (MΦs) are phagocytic immune cells that are found in nearly all human tissues, where they modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. MΦs display a spectrum of functional phenotypes as a result of microenvironmental and stress-induced stimuli. Evidence has emerged demonstrating that metabolism is not only crucial for the generation of  and biomolecular precursors, but also contributes to the function and plasticity of MΦs. Here, 1D H NMR-based metabolomics was employed to identify metabolic pathways that are differentially modulated following primary human monocyte-derived MΦ activation with pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2a) stimuli relative to resting (M0) MΦs. The metabolic profiling of M1 MΦs indicated a substantial increase in oxidative stress as well as a decrease in mitochondrial respiration. These metabolic profiles also provide compelling evidence that M1 MΦs divert metabolites from  glycerophospholipid synthesis to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, glycolysis and lactic  fermentation were significantly increased in both M1 and M2a MΦs. These metabolic patterns highlight robust metabolic activation markers of MΦ phenotypes. Overall, our study generates additional support to previous observations, presents novel findings regarding the metabolic modulation of human MΦs following activation, and contributes new knowledge to the rapidly evolving field of immunometabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664805>The Role of Lipids in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with few treatment options and a 70% recurrence rate. This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Given the central role of the liver in lipid homeostasis, altered hepatic lipid metabolism has been identified as a contributing factor to hepatocellular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on lipid metabolism as a source of  and to support rapid cell division, and fatty  derivatives play key roles in cell signaling. Aberrant expression of liver fatty –binding protein and changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated triacylglycerols have been shown to be associated with disease severity and subtype.

Herein, we had reported a method to synthesize highly reactive yet stable defective iron-based Metal organic frameworks by using different monocarboxylic  with varying lengths as a modulator. The physical-chemical characterization illustrating that modulators could improve the crystallinity, enlarge pore size and enhance catalytic performance and octanoic  (OA) was screened to be the suitable choice. The catalytic performance of catalysts was detected through persulfate (PS) activation for degrading Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). The study demonstrated that the highest degradation efficiency for 0.018 mmol L TBBPA was that 97.79% in the conditions of the 1.0 g L Fe(BDC)(DMF,F)-OA-30 dosage and TBBPA:PS = 200:1. In addition, there was observed that no obvious change of the crystal structure, little the leachable iron concentration in the solutions and no significant loss of catalytic activities of Fe(BDC)(DMF,F)-OA-30 after 5th cycles.

The involved molecular mechanisms were investigated for the first time using transcriptome and metabolome in this study. Results showed that subinhibitory concentration of PT (0.5 mg/ml) induced significant changes in MRSA at both transcriptional and metabolic levels, as 370 genes and 19 metabolites were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the varying genes and metabolites were mainly involved in pathways of membrane transport, amino , carbohydrate, and  metabolism. The highlighted changes were those related to osmotic regulation, intracellular pH regulation, amino  synthesis and metabolism, glycolysis, TCA cycle and iron metabolism, suggesting the multifaceted effects including cell membrane damage, amino  limitation,  metabolism disorder and iron deprivation induced by PT.

Here in, we developed a single step method for the direct deposition of 2D-NbS on high-aspect ratio topographies of silicon nanowires (NWs) by chemical vapor deposition for the appli-cations in HER electrocatalyst. The resultant 2D-NbS electrocatalyst demonstrates the HER overpotential of ~74mV vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) @ 1 mA/cm under acidic conditions and stable for more than 20 hours. More importantly, we developed the Si NWs array based photoelectrochemical water-splitting system with the direct deposi-tion of 2D-NbS as HER catalyst. The resultant 2D-NbS-Si NWs photocathode system demonstrates improved charge transfer characteristics at the Si-NbS interfaces that leads to an enhanced turn on potential (from 0.06 V to 0.34 V vs. RHE) with the current density of -28 mA/cm at the 0 V vs. RHE.

Sludge pretreatments have been previously used in hydrogen production; however, information about how they can affect VFAs production from microalgae is still lacking. Thermal pretreatment was studied at: (i) 80 °C for 10 and 30 min; (ii) 120 °C for 10 and 30 min; and (iii) 100 °C for 20 min. 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) at 10 mM and 30 mM was used as chemical pretreatment. Besides, a combination of both pretreatment methods (80 °C and 120 °C at 10 mM and 30 mM BES) was also tested. Thermal pretreatment increased organic matter conversions into VFAs (up to 71% COD-VFAs/COD) when compared to control values (40% in the untreated anaerobic sludge). Acetic  was the most abundant VFAs at high temperatures (120 °C) and when BES was employed (up to 60% and 40%, respectively, in terms of COD). On the other hand, propionic  was the most abundant product at low temperatures and in the untreated anaerobic sludge (up to 60% in terms of COD). This research work might set guidelines in order to choose a suitable sludge pretreatment for VFAs production from microalgae.Copyright © 2019.

However, high pressure devices are essential for observing mechanical responses of carbon dots, but they limit the widespread application of mechanical responsive CDs. Two kinds of CDs were prepared using pyrene derivative (pyrene-1-butyric , PyBA) as carbon source, and had fluorescence enhancement via simply grinding. An apparent 20-30 times emission enhancement can be observed after the treatment of grinding because of CDs packed structure and morphology changes. To the best of our knownledge, it is the first example of mechanical responsive CDs with fluorescence enhancement without the stimulation of any complex pressure instrumentation. This simple approach could be extended to other carbon sources with π-conjugated structure for building new intelligentized CDs, and provide new routes for the applications of CDs toward mechanical sensing.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Data from two non-consecutive food records from the National Dietary Survey/Household Budget Survey 2008-2009 were used to estimate the usual dietary folate intake in µg dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variance and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method was used to calculate the POFI. The survey included 32,749 individuals, 15,700 males and 17,049 females, over 10 years old. Pregnant women, lactating women, and individuals with unreliable  intake data were excluded.Overall POFI was 31.5% and mean dietary folate intake was 411.1 µg DFE. The lowest POFI occurred in the youngest age group of 10-13 years in both sexes, while the highest POFI was observed in the group ≥ 71 years. In women of childbearing age, POFI was around 32%. The lowest income strata had the highest POFI. The most developed regions (South and Southeast) had the lowest POFI compared to less developed regions.Our data show that folate inadequacy is still prevalent in Brazil mainly in low-income groups and less developed regions. Actions need to be taken to ensure that women of childbearing age, who presented a high prevalence of inadequate folate intake, achieve the recommended daily intake of 400 µg DFEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671238>Humic  functionalized hyperbranched polytriazine based dispersive solid-phase extraction for acaricides determination in tea matrix.</a></h2><p>Hyperbranched polytriazine functionalized with humic  was prepared and developed as new sorbents for dispersive solid-phase extraction of three acaricides (clofentezine, fenpyroximate and pyridaben) in tea samples combined with HPLC detection.

While intermediary metabolites serve as co-factors for histone-modifying enzymes during metabolic flux, how these modifications contribute to transcriptional responses is poorly understood. Here, we utilize the highly synchronized yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) and find that fatty  β-oxidation genes are periodically expressed coincident with the β-oxidation byproduct histone crotonylation. Specifically, we found that H3K9 crotonylation peaks when H3K9 acetylation declines and  resources become limited. During this metabolic state, pro-growth gene expression is dampened; however, mutation of the Taf14 YEATS domain, a H3K9 crotonylation reader, results in de-repression of these genes. Conversely, exogenous addition of crotonic  results in increased histone crotonylation, constitutive repression of pro-growth genes, and disrupted YMC oscillations. Together, our findings expose an unexpected link between metabolic flux and transcription and demonstrate that histone crotonylation and Taf14 participate in the repression of -demanding gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The literature was systematically reviewed and 21 experiments, with up to 66 treatment means and 1,313 prepartum parous cows, were included. All experiments had a treatment with no supplemental choline (0 g/d; n = 30 treatment means), and the amount of choline ion supplemented to treated cows ranged from 5.6 to 25.2 g/d (n = 36 treatment means). Duration of pre- and postpartum feeding of RPC averaged (±standard deviation) 22.0 ± 6.0 and 57.5 ± 42.2 d, respectively. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of pre- and postpartum diets, amount of choline ion supplemented, number of cows per treatment, frequency of health events, and the least squares means and respective standard error of the means for production responses, liver composition, and blood parameters. The concentrations of net  for lactation and metabolizable amino  and protein (MP) in pre- and postpartum diets were predicted for each treatment mean using National Research Council (2001). Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted including the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the standard error of the means squared. Increasing supplementation of choline ion during transition linearly increased pre- (β = 0.0184 ± 0.00425) and postpartum dry matter intake (β = 0.0378 ± 0.00974), and yields of milk (β = 0.436 ± 0.112), -corrected milk (ECM; β = 0.422 ± 0.0992), fat (β = 0.00555 ± 0.000793), and protein (β = 0.0138 ± 0.00378). Nevertheless, an interaction between choline and postpartum metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP (METMPPo) was observed for yields of milk, ECM, and protein because as METMPPo increased, the positive response to choline on yields of milk, ECM, and protein decreased. Supplementing choline during transition tended to reduce the risks of retained placenta and mastitis, but it had no effect on metritis, milk fever, displaced abomasum and ketosis, or the concentration of triacylglycerol in the hepatic tissue postpartum. The median amount of choline ion supplemented was 12.9 g/d and responses in postpartum dry matter intake and yields of milk, ECM, fat, and protein to that amount of supplementation were 0.5, 1.6, 1.7, 0.07, and 0.05 kg/d, respectively. No interactions were observed between supplemental choline and prepartum dietary net  for lactation or metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP. Collectively, feeding RPC during the transition period improves performance in parous cows. Increases in yields of milk and milk components were observed in spite of pre- and postpartum diets, although the increments in milk, ECM, and protein yields with supplementing choline decreased as the concentration of methionine in postpartum diets increased. The optimum dose of choline ion was not detected, but likely it is more than the 12.9 g/d fed in most experiments evaluated in the current meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-analysis identified lack of sufficient data to understand the role of supplemental choline in nulliparous cows.The Authors.

Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of oxygen demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino  concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino  nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced oxygen competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661239>High Ion Transport within Freeze-Casted Gel Film for High-Rate Integrated Flexible Supercapacitors.</a></h2><p>Gel electrolytes are important components in flexible solid-state supercapacitors.

This study was aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism by which SAL attenuates doxorubicin (DOX)-induced chronic heart failure (CHF) in rats and improves mitochondrial function in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.  Rats were intraperitoneally injected with DOX to establish CHF model. Therapeutic effects of SAL on hemodynamic parameters, serum indices, and the histopathology of the heart were analyzed . Moreover, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with SAL for 2 h before DOX treatment in all procedures . Cell viability, cardiomyocyte morphology, proliferation, and mitochondrial function were detected by a high-content screening (HCS) assay. In addition, a Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XFp) analyzer was used to evaluate the cell  respiratory and  metabolism function. To further investigate the potential mechanism of SAL, relative mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes in the tricarboxylic  cycle  and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) signaling pathway-related molecules  were detected.  The present data demonstrated the pharmacological effect of SAL on DOX-induced CHF, which was through ameliorating heart function, downregulating serum levels of myocardial injury markers, alleviating histological injury to the heart, increasing the relative mRNA expression levels of key enzymes downstream of the tricarboxylic  cycle , and thus enhancing myocardial  metabolism. In addition, SAL had effects on increasing cell viability, ameliorating DOX-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and increasing mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in H9c2 cardiomyocyte. Moreover, we found that SAL might have an effect on improving mitochondrial respiratory function and  metabolism  inhibiting excessive activation of MCU pathway in H9c2 cells. However, the protective effect could be ameliorated by ruthenium red (an MCU inhibitor) and abrogated by spermine (an MCU activator) .  The therapeutic effects of SAL on CHF are possibly related to ameliorating cardiomyocyte function resulting in promotion of mitochondrial respiratory and  metabolism. Furthermore, the potential mechanism might be related to downregulating MCU pathway. These findings may provide a potential therapy for CHF.Copyright © 2019 Wen, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Li, Yang, Wang, Cai, Li and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673007>Effect of shell structure of Ti-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography core-shell magnetic particles for phosphopeptide enrichment.</a></h2><p>Magnetic materials in sample preparation for shotgun phosphoproteomics offer several advantages over conventional systems, as the enrichment can be achieved directly in solution, but they still suffer from some drawbacks, due to limited stability and selectivity, which is supposed to be affected by the hydrophilicity of the polymeric supports used for cation immobilization. The paper describes the development of an improved magnetic material with increased stability, thanks to a two-step covering of the magnetic core, for the enrichment of phosphopeptides in biological samples. Four materials were prepared featuring a polymeric shell with tunable hydrophilicity, obtained by "grafting from" polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate with 0-8.3% of polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA), the latter used to modulate the hydrophilicity of the material surface. Finally, the materials were functionalized with iminodiacetic  for Ti ion immobilization. The materials were analyzed for their composition by a combination of CHN elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, also hyphenated to gas chromatography and mass spectrometric detection. Surface characteristics were evaluated by water contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy and  dispersive X-ray spectrometry. These materials were applied to the enrichment of phosphopeptides from yeast protein digests. Peptides were identified by proteomics techniques using nano-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Qualitatively the peptides identified by the four systems were comparable, with 1606-1693 phosphopeptide identifications and a selectivity of 47-54% for all materials. The physico-chemical features of the identified peptides were also the same for the four materials. In particular, the grand average of hydropathy index values indicated that the enriched phosphopeptides were hydrophilic (ca. 90%), and only some co-enriched non-phosphorylated peptides were hydrophobic (21-28%), regardless of the material used for enrichment. Peptides had a pI ≤ 7, which indicated a well-known bias for acidic peptides binding, attributed to the interaction with the metal center itself. The results indicated that the enrichment of phosphopeptides and the co-enrichment of non-phosphorylated peptides is mainly driven by interactions with Ti and does not depend on the amount of PEGMA chains in the polymer shell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656522>The effects of post-partum drops in body condition on indices of  metabolism in mid-lactation Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>Evaluation of  metabolism indices in mid-lactation Holstein cows is critical to monitor health status.  The objective of this study was to assess the effects of low (≤0.75) . high (>0.75) drops in body condition score (BCS) until day 60 post-partum on  metabolism indices during mid-lactation in Holstein cows.Twenty-eight Holstein cows were included in the study from the day of calving to day 120 of lactation. Whole blood samples were taken on 60, 90, and 120 days in milk (DIM). Serum was analyzed for insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels.In cows with low BCS drop (LoD group), insulin did not change significantly through days 60 to 120 of lactation, but increased in high drop cows (HiD group) (P<0.001). Glucose concentrations decreased linearly in the LoD cows (P=0.039) and showed a quadratic increase in the HiD group on day 90 (P=0.028). Concentrations of non-esterified fatty  showed both linear (P=0.04) and quadratic (P=0.002) changes in the HiD group. The HiD cows had significantly higher concentrations of insulin on day 120 (P=0.017) compared to the LoD group. Glucose concentration was lower (P<0.01) in HiD cows on 60 DIM. The concentration of non-esterified fatty  was higher in HiD cows on day 90 (P<0.01). Surrogate indices of insulin resistance (calculated based on the concentrations of the measured metabolites) were different between the groups on day 90, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity in the HiD cows.Greater depletion of body reserves during early lactation may result in some inconsistencies in  metabolism during mid-lactation periods. Controlling BCS loss during early lactation may help alleviate such alterations possibly through modifying insulin sensitivity of the tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high fat diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty  β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic fat accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/B index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and  utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty  (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and , enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is important to design probes with good fluorescence and two-photon (TP) active cross-sections (Φ) to explore the concentration distribution of Ca. In this manuscript, a novel TP fluorescence calcium probe (BAPTAVP) with positive charges, based on the classical Ca indicator of BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane--tetra acetic ), and a conjugated polymer (PCBMB) with negative charges were designed and synthesized. The results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential (ZP) showed that nanoparticles were obtained by the self-assembly of PCBMB and BAPTAVP. Moreover, the fluorescence properties of BAPTAVP were effectively improved by fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) with PCBMB and attenuating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) after the addition of Ca. The quantum yield and Φ of PCBMB-BAPTAVP increased by about four and six times in comparison to those of BAPTAVP, respectively. The TP fluorescence imaging experiments indicated that the PCBMB-BAPTAVP system could effectively detect Ca in living cells with high sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680401>Microalgae Schizochytrium sp. as a source of docosahexaenoic  (DHA): Effects on diet digestibility, oxidation and palatability and on immunity and inflammatory indices in dogs.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the microalgae Schizochytrium sp., as a dietary source of docosahexaenoic  (DHA), on diet palatability, coefficients of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of nutrients and metabolizable  (ME), blood variables and indicators of immunity in dogs.

On Experiment I the palatability of diets containing 0% versus 0.4% microalgae was compared. In Experiment II test diets were offered for 30 days to determine digestibility, fecal characteristics, and blood parameters. In Experiment III, the oxidative stability of diets containing microalgae versus anchovy oil was evaluated. There was a higher intake ratio of the diet containing microalgae (p < .05). The ME and CTTAD of nutrients increased (p < .05), except for ether extract after  hydrolysis, with the inclusion of the microalgae in diet. The amount of monocytes and phagocytic granulocytes was higher (p < .05) in dogs fed 0.4% microalgae. There was greater oxidative stability for the sample containing microalgae.

Herein, we develop a simple yet robust -treatment strategy to judiciously create an amorphous TiO 2 buffer layer intimately situated on the anatase TiO 2 surface as electron transport layer (ETL) for efficient electron transport. The facile  treatment is capable of weakening the bonding of zigzag octahedral chains in anatase TiO 2 , thereby shortening staggered octahedron chains to form an amorphous buffer layer on the anatase TiO 2 surface. Such amorphous TiO 2 -coated ETL possesses an increased electron density due to the presence of oxygen vacancies, leading to efficient electron transfer from perovskite to TiO 2 . Compared to pristine TiO 2 -based devices, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with -treated TiO 2 ETL exhibit enhanced short circuit current and power conversion efficiency. These findings demonstrate an unconventional route to crafting effective ETLs by deliberately creating an intimate, tailored amorphous semiconductor buffer layer for high-performance PSCs. This study may provide insights into the importance of rational design of efficient electron transporting layers in PSCs.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to  wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular  sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the activities of these pathways in hepatomas in vivo have not been distinguished. Here we examined pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle through PDH versus PC in vivo using hepatoma-bearing rats.Hepatoma-bearing rats were generated by intrahepatic injection of H4IIE cells. Metabolism of C-labeled glycerol, a physiological substrate for both gluconeogenesis and  production, was measured with C NMR analysis. The concentration of key metabolites and the expression of relevant enzymes were measured in hepatoma, surrounding liver, and normal liver.In orthotopic hepatomas, pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle occurred exclusively through PDH and the excess PDH activity compared to normal liver was attributed to downregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 2/4. However, pyruvate carboxylation via PC and gluconeogenesis were minimal, which was linked to downregulated forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by Akt activity. In contrast to many studies of cancer metabolism, lactate production in hepatomas was not increased which corresponded to reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase. The production of serine and glycine in hepatomas was enhanced, but glycine decarboxylase was downregulated.The combination of [U-C]glycerol and NMR analysis enabled investigation of multiple biochemical processes in hepatomas and surrounding liver. We demonstrated active PDH and other related metabolic alterations in orthotopic hepatomas that differed substantially not only from the host organ but also from many earlier studies with cancer cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Many bacteria use AMP-forming :CoA ligases to convert organic  into their corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives, which can then enter metabolism. The soil environment contains a broad diversity of organic , so it is not surprising that bacteria such as Streptomyces lividans can activate many of the available organic . Our group has shown that the activity of many :CoA ligases is posttranslationally controlled by acylation of an active-site lysine. In some cases, the modification is reversed by deacylases of different types. We identified eight new :CoA ligases in S. lividans TK24.

In this configuration, the process performance in both temperatures were estimated and the microbial communities were characterized by full-length16S rRNA genes and/or microbial activities. In addition, the appropriate solubilization reaction time was assessed. The results revealed that the higher hydrolysis and acidogenesis activities were achieved with longer reaction time of pretreatment (5 days) and thus higher organic nitrogen conversion and alkalinity were attained. Under appropriate pretreatment reaction time, pretreated sludge was characterized by 65% higher organic matters solubilization and 1.4-fold higher volatile fatty  (VFAs) concentration compared to raw sludge. The overall methane yield produced under this scenario was 179 L CH. KgVS, with 15% of the absolute yield was produced in hydrolysis reactor. 50% reduction in bacteria belong to Firmicurtes was observed at mesophilic reactor and meanwhile the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Cloacimonetes were enhanced. The predominant methanogens in both stages did not change implying adaptation of Methanothermobacter (>62%) to mesophilic condition. However, increasing acetoclastic methanogens up to 30% in mesophilic reactor indicating methane was produced from pretreated sludge mainly through H- mediated CO reduction and partially from acetate cleavage.

S components rotate within the membrane to expose their binding pockets alternately to the exterior and the cytoplasm. In contrast to vitamin transporters, metal-specific systems rely on additional proteins with essential but poorly understood functions. CbiN, a membrane protein composed of two transmembrane helices tethered by an extracytoplasmic loop of 37 amino- residues represents the auxiliary component that temporarily interacts with the CbiMQO Co transporter. CbiN was previously shown to induce significant Co transport activity in the absence of CbiQO in cells producing the S component CbiM plus CbiN or a Cbi(MN) fusion. Here we analyzed the mode of interaction between the two protein domains. Any deletion in the CbiN loop abolished transport activity. In silico predicted protein-protein contacts between segments of the CbiN loop and loops in CbiM were confirmed by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and crosslinking. Likewise, an ordered structure of the CbiN loop was observed by electron paramagnetic resonance analysis after site-directed spin labeling. The N-terminal loop of CbiM containing three of four metal ligands was partially immobilized in wild-type Cbi(MN) but completely immobile in inactive variants with CbiN loop deletions. Decreased dynamics of the inactive form was also detected by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance of isotope-labeled protein in proteoliposomes. In conclusion, CbiM-CbiN loop-loop interactions facilitate metal insertion into the binding pocket.Copyright © 2019.

The mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) causing its misfolding and aggregation are found linked to the motor neuron disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since the mutations are scattered throughout SOD1 structure, determining the exact molecular mechanism underlying the ALS pathology remains unresolved. In this study, we have investigated the major molecular factors that mainly contribute to SOD1 destabilization, intrinsic disorder, and misfolding using sequence and structural information. We have analysed 153 ALS causing SOD1 point mutants for aggregation tendency using four different aggregation prediction tools, viz., Aggrescan3D (A3D), CamSol, GAP and Zyggregator. Our results suggest that 74-79 mutants are susceptible to aggregation, due to distorted native interactions originated at the mutation site. Majority of the aggregation prone mutants are located in the buried regions of SOD1 molecule. Further, the mutations at the hydrophobic amino  primarily promote the aggregation tendency of SOD1 protein through different destabilizing mechanisms including changes in hydrophobic free , loss of electrostatic interactions in the protein's surface and loss of hydrogen bonds that bridges the protein core and surface.Copyright © 2019.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of supplementing SFA in the form of triglycerides (TSFA), as compared to CSFA, on yields, efficiency and diet digestibility in high-yielding dairy cows. Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and volatile fatty  concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46.2 kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas acetate concentrations and acetate : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary  content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669707>Regulation of metabolism during hibernation in brown bears (Ursus arctos): Involvement of cortisol, PGC-1α and AMPK in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in expression of known cellular regulators of metabolism during hyperphagia (Sept) and hibernation (Jan) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of brown bears and determine whether signaling molecules and transcription factors known to respond to changes in cellular  state are involved in the regulation of these metabolic adaptations. During hibernation, serum levels of cortisol, glycerol, and triglycerides were elevated, and protein expression and activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were reduced. mRNA expression of the co-activator PGC-1α was reduced in all tissues in hibernation whereas mRNA expression of the transcription factor PPAR-α was reduced in the vastus lateralis muscle and adipose tissue only. During hibernation, gene expression of ATGL and CD36 was not altered; however, HSL gene expression was reduced in adipose tissue. During hibernation gene expression of the lipogenic enzyme DGAT in all tissues and the expression of the FA oxidative enzyme LCAD in the vastus lateralis muscle were reduced. Gene and protein expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was decreased in adipose tissue in hibernation. Our data suggest that high cortisol levels are a key adaptation during hibernation and link cortisol to a reduced activation of the AMPK/PGC-1α/PPAR-α axis in the regulation of metabolism in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Moreover, our results indicate that during this phase of hibernation at a time when metabolic rate is significantly reduced metabolic adaptations in peripheral tissues seek to limit the detrimental effects of unduly large  dissipation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars.

In comparison with the verified results of the model solution, it was found that the Lifshitz-van der Waals, Lewis  and base  values for the tested membranes would deviate by 50-87%, 30-160% and 52-97% respectively if surface roughness and porosity were neglected in the calculation. The profound effect of roughness and porosity on surface  determination was further confirmed via theoretical analysis of the Young-Dupré and Cassie-Baxter relationships. This improved approach may apply to the surface  characterization of hydrophilic rough porous membranes (e.g. hydrophilic microfiltration membranes).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657548> Design of Novel Mutant Anti-MUC1 Aptamers for Targeted Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>The transmembrane glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1) is an attractive tumor marker for cancer therapy and diagnosis. The nine amino  extracellular epitope APDTRPAPG of this protein is selectively recognized by the S2.2 single-stranded DNA anti-MUC1 aptamer, which has emerged as a promising template for designing novel targeting agents for MUC1-directed therapy. In this work, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM/GBSA binding free  calculations, and conformational analysis were employed to propose a novel prospective anti-MUC1 aptamer with increased affinity toward the MUC1 epitope resulting from the double mutation of the T11 and T12 residues with PSU and U nucleosides, respectively. The double mutant aptamer exhibits a tight interaction with the MUC1 epitope and adopts a groove conformation that structurally favors the intermolecular contact with the epitope through the intermediate T11-A18 region leaving the 3' and 5' ends free for further chemical conjugation with a nanocarrier or pharmaceutical. These results are valuable to gain understanding about the molecular features governing aptamer-epitope interactions and constitute a first key step for the design of novel aptamer-based nanocarriers for MUC1-targeted cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669471>Sensitive glycoprofiling of insulin-like growth factor receptors isolated from colon tissue of patients with colorectal carcinoma using lectin-based protein microarray.</a></h2><p>Glycosylation of cell receptors influences their function and development of tumour induces changes in glycosylation. Cell growth depends on the activation of receptors which bind growth factors and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors are among the most important ones. Usually, only small quantities of isolated receptors are available thus there is a need of suitable assay to study receptors glycosylation. Therefore, we developed a lectin-based reverse-phase protein microarray method for screening the glycosylation pattern of receptors in picomolar (pM) concentrations. The method was applied to glycoprofile IGF1 and IGF2 receptors and the solubilised membrane proteins isolated from tumour and non-tumour colon tissue of patients with colorectal cancer. We found that common to both receptors was partial overlapping of the major glycan structures with those present in the entire glycome of membrane proteins. In contrast, receptors possess higher level of α2,3 sialic  residues and lower level of tri-/tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans and terminal mannose in high-mannose structures. Increased levels of fucosylation and branched mannose structures were observed in both receptors derived from tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue. The described method enabling glycan analysis of receptors has a big application potential in e.g. biomarker research, biology and diagnostics.Copyright © 2019.

Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in  balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of  metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice.  metabolism was determined based on the  expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with  metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in  metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in  balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in  balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured  requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty  substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or lipid transport and metabolism following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty  substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681009>Ghrelin Promotes Proliferation and Inhibits Differentiation of 3T3-L1 and Human Primary Preadipocytes.</a></h2><p>Ghrelin is a 28-amino- peptide that regulates  hemostasis, glucose and lipid metabolism. We aimed to explore the effects of ghrelin on the proliferation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 and human primary preadipocytes.3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) spectrophotometry, Oil Red O staining, intracellular glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3-PDH) assays and semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to investigate the action of ghrelin.Ghrelin (0.01-1000 ng/ml) significantly increased the numbers of 3T3-L1 cells, and the maximum stimulatory effect was observed with the 10 ng/ml ghrelin treatment for 24 h ( < 0.05). Ghrelin also promoted the proliferation of human primary preadipocytes from 24 h ( < 0.05) to 48 h ( < 0.05) at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml. Further investigation showed that IGF-1 levels were notably increased in ghrelin-treated 3T3-L1 and human preadipocytes, and IGF-1 antibody was capable to attenuate this stimulatory action of ghrelin (all  < 0.05). Additionally, ghrelin significantly suppressed the differentiation of 3T3-L1 and human primary preadipocytes; 10 ng/ml ghrelin notably downregulated G-3-PDH activities in 3T3-L1 cells on day 3 and in human cells from days 4 to 12 following differentiation (all  < 0.05), and the intracellular lipoprotein lipase mRNA levels were lower than that of the controls ( < 0.05). Further investigation showed that the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPs) were also suppressed in ghrelin-treated human differentiating adipocytes.Ghrelin promotes the proliferation of 3T3-L1 and human primary preadipocytes by increasing the expression of IGF-1. Ghrelin inhibits murine and human adipocyte differentiation by downregulating PPARγ2 and C/EBPα levels, consequently leading to decreased lipid accumulation and lipogenic enzymes expression.Copyright © 2019 Miao, Pan, Wang, Yang, Zhu and Gong.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678320>Interactions of the Super Complexes: When mTORC1 Meets the Proteasome.</a></h2><p>Homeostatic regulation of  and metabolic status requires that anabolic and catabolic signaling pathways be precisely regulated and coordinated.

Here we first briefly review current understanding of the regulation of mTORC1, the UPS, and the 26S proteasome complex.

In this study, the use of a 16mm twin screw extruder (TSE) as a platform technology for solid feeds is investigated using four solid pharmaceutical ingredients (PI) in a mixture of water and IPA. In order for comparison, the same experiments were also carried out in a batch traditional stirred tank vessel (STV). The objectives of this work are to gain further scientific understanding on dissolution kinetics and to compare kinetics in both a batch and continuous system. The concentration of each PI during dissolution is monitored using an in-line UV-ATR probe, allowing the extraction of dissolution kinetics. Faster dissolution rates are achieved in the TSE than in the STV due to higher power dissipation generated by the aggressive shear mixing and thermal  within the TSE.

A challenge for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) processes is to realize these features in solid materials without undesired phase segregation and detrimental dye aggregation. To achieve this, we combine a palladium porphyrin sensitizer and a 9,10-diphenylanthracene annihilator within a crystalline mesoporous metal-organic framework using an inverted design. In this modular TTA system, the framework walls constitute the fixed sensitizer, while caprylic  coats the channels providing a solvent-like environment for the mobile annihilator in the channel.

Reliable and reproducible automated synthesis of [C]L-glutamine PET (Positron Emission Tomography) radiotracer is critical for these studies.[C]L-Glutamine ([C]L-Gln) was reliably and reproducibly synthesized. The automated process involves cleaning and drying of the synthesis module, azeotropic drying of crown ether and cesium bicarbonate, conversion of [C]CO to [C] CsCN, incorporation of [C] CN into the starting material, and hydrolysis and deprotection of the corresponding [C] nitrile to yield [C]L-glutamine. Starting with approximately 1 Ci of [C] cesium cyanide ([C]CsCN), 47-77 mCi (n = 4) of the final product, [C]L-Gln, was obtained after sterile filtration. The radiochemical purity of the final product was > 90% with almost exclusively L-glutamine isomer.

The present co-twin control study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs was designed to identify nutritional factors potentially involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Cross-sectional study of 50 MZ twin pairs (age range: 23-36 years), of which ten pairs were discordant for liver fat (liver fat percentage of one twin ≤5% and his/her co-twin >5% and a difference between co-twins of >5%) as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nutrient intake was calculated from 3-day food records.Among the ten liver fat-discordant twin pairs, the n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly higher in the twins with higher liver as compared to their co-twins with lower liver fat (6.6:1 vs. 3.2:1, p-value = 0.005). In multiple regression analysis of within-pair differences including all 50 twin pairs, a higher n-6: n-3 ratio was significantly associated with a higher liver fat percentage within MZ twin pairs after adjustment for body mass index,  intake and other covariates (standardized beta = 0.43, p-value = 0.001).Our findings suggest that the n-6: n-3 ratio is a promising dietary agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

The materials were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), also, pHpzc of the materials were studied. The resultant adsorbents were used for both column and batch adsorption of organic pollutants; dye ( Blue 74; AB74) and pharmaceuticals (ciprofloxacin; CIP and acetaminophen; ACTE). Column adsorption capacity, effect of pollutant concentration and effect of flow rate were studied, also, the column was modelled using Thomas, Yoon-Nelson and Adams-Bohart model. Furthermore, batch adsorption experiments were performed, effect of change in pH, time, dose and concentration were studied. Batch adsorption data were fitted with isotherm and kinetic models. The experiment showed tremendous increase in adsorption capacity when the hybrid adsorbent (HYD) was modified with DES (HYD-DES).  Blue 74 on HYD-DES has the highest column sorption capacity followed by ciprofloxacin and acetaminophen. Adsorption was favoured at pH range of 2-10 for both AB74 and ACTE as there is no significant changes in the % removal performance, while adsorption was best at pH 6 and above for CIP. AB74 and CIP are best described by Langmuir isotherm, whereas ACTE adsorption was best explained by Freundlich isotherm equilibrium.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency,  deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic lipid mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Polyphenolic plant derivatives have been shown to alleviate such pathological features and have been used in models of neurodegenerative disorders in previous reports. In the current study, we utilized a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rat model of PD to explore the protective efficacy of polyphenolic phytochemical ferulic  (FA) against mitochondrial dysfunction and explored its effect on gene and protein expression of mitochondrial dynamics regulators dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)/mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) in lesioned animals. We also evaluated its effect on expression of mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC1α and apoptotic regulators BAX, cyt c, p53, and cleaved PARP. We found that oral FA supplementation alleviated 6-OHDA induced oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, morphological changes, and blocked apoptotic cascade. FA also reduced mitochondrial Drp1 expression and increased gene and protein expression of PGC1α, thereby regulating expression of its downstream target Mfn2 and restoring mitochondrial dynamics in lesioned animals. Our data suggest that targeting mitochondrial dynamics through modulation of PGC1α can prove to be a potent preventive strategy against PD pathology.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681368>Deficiencies in the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Affect Redox Poise and Resistance Toward .</a></h2><p>To investigate if and how the integrity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) influences susceptibility of  toward , we have selected previously characterized mutants with defects at different stages of the mETC, namely, the complex I mutant , the complex II mutant , the complex III mutant , and a mutant of the uncoupling protein . Relative to wild type, the selected complex I, II, and III mutants showed decreased total respiration, increased alternative respiration, as well as increased redox charge of the NADP(H) pool and decreased redox charge of the NAD(H) pool in the dark. In the light, mETC mutants accumulated free amino , albeit to varying degrees. Glycine and serine, which are involved in carbon recycling from photorespiration, and N-rich amino  were predominantly increased in mETC mutants compared to the wild type. Taking together the physiological phenotypes of all examined mutants, our results suggest a connection between the limitation in the re-oxidation of reducing equivalents in the mitochondrial matrix and the induction of nitrate assimilation into free amino  in the cytosol, which seems to be engaged as an additional sink for reducing power. The  mutant was less susceptible to  and did not show hampered salicylic  (SA) accumulation as previously reported for  knock-down plants. The ROS burst remained unaffected in , emonstrating that subunit SDH2 is not involved in the control of ROS production and SA signaling by complex II. Moreover, the  mutant showed only 20% of  colonization compared to wild type, with the ROS burst and the production of callose papillae being significantly increased compared to wild type. This indicates that a restriction of respiratory metabolism can positively affect pre-penetration resistance of . Taking metabolite profiling data from all investigated mETC mutants, a strong positive correlation of resistance toward  with NADPH pool size, pyruvate contents, and other metabolites associated with redox poise and  charge was evident, which fosters the hypothesis that limitations in the mETC can support resistance at post-penetration stages by improving the availability of metabolic power.Copyright © 2019 McCollum, Geißelsöder, Engelsdorf, Voitsik and Voll.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655930>Fluorometric visualization of mucin 1 glycans on cell surfaces based on rolling-mediated cascade amplification and CdTe quantum dots.</a></h2><p>A rolling-mediated cascade (RMC) amplification strategy is described for improved visualization of profiling glycans of mucin 1 (MUC 1) on cell surfaces.

In this platform, the fluorescent AgNCs was synthesized using a pair of double-functional ssDNA sequence as a template, including the aptamer segment against thrombin and C-rich segment for AgNCs. Next, the interaction between the fluorescent Apt-AgNCs and CNNS was investigated. It is verified that DNA-stabilized AgNCs could absorb on the CNNS surface via the stronger π-π interaction to form the hybrid platform, whose fluorescence is quenched by CNNS through the photoelectron transfer effect (PET). When targets are introduced into the system, target/Apt-AgNCs complex will fall off from the CNNS surface, resulting in the fluorescence recovery. This hybrid platform can achieve the detection of biomolecule with high sensitivity and selectivity.

The nature of the host immune response dictates whether the initial Mtb infection is cleared or progresses toward active disease, and is ultimately determined by intricate host-pathogen interactions that are yet to be fully understood. The early immune response to infection is mediated by innate immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils that can phagocytose Mtb and mount an antimicrobial response. However, Mtb can exploit these innate immune cells for its survival and dissemination. Recently, it has become clear that the immune response and metabolic remodeling are interconnected, which is highlighted by the rapid evolution of the interdisciplinary field of immunometabolism. It has been proposed that the net outcome to Mtb infection-clearance or chronic disease-is likely a result of combined immunologic and metabolic activities of the immune cells. Indeed, host cells activated by Mtb infection have strikingly different metabolic requirements than naïve/non-infected cells. Macrophages activated by Mtb-derived molecules or upon phagocytosis acquire a phenotype similar to M1 with elevated production of pro-inflammatory molecules and rely on glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway to meet their bioenergetic and metabolic requirements. In these macrophages, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  oxidation are dampened. However, the non-infected/naive, M2-type macrophages are anti-inflammatory and derive their  from oxidative phosphorylation and fatty  oxidation. Similar metabolic adaptations also occur in other phagocytes, including dendritic cells, neutrophils upon Mtb infection. This metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells during Mtb infection can differentially regulate their effector functions, such as the production of cytokines and chemokines, and antimicrobial response, all of which can ultimately determine the outcome of Mtb-host interactions within the granulomas. In this review, we describe key immune cells bolstering host innate response and discuss the metabolic reprogramming in these phagocytes during Mtb infection. We focused on the major phagocytes, including macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils and the key regulators involved in metabolic reprogramming, such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1, mammalian target of rapamycin, the cellular myelocytomatosis, peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors, sirtuins, arginases, inducible nitric  synthase and sphingolipids.Copyright © 2019 Kumar, Singh, Kolloli, Shi, Bushkin, Tyagi and Subbian.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676441>PPARA/RXRA signalling regulates the fate of hepatic non-esterified fatty  in a sheep model of maternal undernutrition.</a></h2><p>Maternal undernutrition during late gestation accelerates body fat mobilization to provide more  for foetal growth and development, which unbalances metabolic homeostasis and results in serious lipid metabolism disorder. However, detailed regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, a sheep model was used to explore the regulatory role of PPARA/RXRA signalling in hepatic lipid metabolism in undernutrition based on RNA sequencing and cell experiments. KOG function classification showed that lipid transport and metabolism was markedly altered in an undernourished model. In detail, when compared with the controls, fatty  transport and oxidation and triglyceride metabolism were up-regulated in an undernourished model, while fatty  synthesis, steroid synthesis, and phospholipid metabolism were down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway was altered. Moreover, PPARA signalling associated genes were positively correlated with hepatic non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) levels, while retinol metabolism associated genes were negatively correlated with blood beta-hydroxybutyric  (BHBA) levels. Results of primary hepatocytes showed that NEFAs could activate PPARA signalling and facilitate fatty  oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, while BHBA could inhibit RXRA signalling and repress FAO and ketogenesis. Excessively accumulated NEFAs in hepatocytes promoted triglyceride synthesis. Furthermore, activation of PPARA/RXRA signalling by WY14643 and 9-cis-retinoic  could enhance FAO and ketogenesis and reduce NEFAs accumulation and esterification. Our findings elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of NEFAs and BHBA on lipid metabolism as well as the potential role of the PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway in hepatic lipid metabolism, which may contribute to exploring new strategies to maintain lipid metabolic homeostasis in human beings.Copyright © 2019.

We are investigating a hydrocarbon pathway from mixed sugars via 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and furfural intermediates. To achieve this goal, we must first convert glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural in favorable yields. Current processes to produce HMF/furfural generally involve the use of  catalysts in biphasic systems or solvents such as ionic liquids. However, the yield from transforming glucose to HMF is lower than the yield of furfural from xylose.In this study, we present an efficient chemical pathway simultaneously transforming glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural via ketose intermediates, i.e., fructose and xylulose, which were generated from glucose and xylose via enzymatic isomerization. In the enzymatic isomerization, by adding sodium borate to complex with the ketoses, xylose conversion reached equilibrium after 2 h with a conversion of 91% and glucose conversion reached 84% after 4 h. By enzymatically isomerizing the aldoses to ketoses, the following dehydration reactions to HMF and furfural could be performed at low process temperatures (i.e., 110-120 °C) minimizing the side reactions of the sugars and limiting the degradation of furfurals to humins and carboxylic . At 120 °C, pH 0.5, and 15 min reaction time, mixed ketose sugars were converted to HMF and furfural in yields of 77% and 96%, respectively (based on starting aldose concentrations).Taken together, our results demonstrate that this combined biological and chemical process could be an effective pathway to simultaneously convert biomass-derived glucose and xylose to HMF and furfural, for use as intermediates in the production of hydrocarbons.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673289>Protein hydrolysis and fermentation under methanogenic and acidifying conditions.</a></h2><p>Many kinds of wastewaters contain appreciable quantities of protein. Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino  fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino  fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino  fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662435>Structural comparisons of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases reveal the evolutionary trajectories of these phosphodiester -conversion enzymes.</a></h2><p>Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) consists of two phosphate molecules and can act as an  and phosphate donor in cellular reactions similar to ATP. Several kinases use PPi as a substrate and these kinases have recently been suggested to have evolved from ATP-dependent functional homologs, which have significant amino  sequence similarity to PPi-utilizing enzymes. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) can be divided into three types according to the phosphate donor (ATP, GTP, or PPi), and the amino  sequence similarity of these PEPCKs is too low to confirm that they share a common ancestor. Here, we solved the crystal structure of a PPi-PEPCK homolog from the bacterium Actinomyces israelii (AiPEPCK) at 2.6 Å resolution and compared it with previously reported structures from ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs to assess the degrees of similarities and divergences among these PEPCKs and to determine the structural basis for the PPi specificity of PPi-type PEPCKs. These comparisons revealed that the amino  residues directly contributing to substrate recognition, except for those that recognize purine moieties, are conserved. Furthermore, the order of secondary structure elements between PPi-, ATP- and GTP-specific PEPCKs was strictly conserved. The structure-based comparisons of the three PEPCK types provide key insights into the structural basis for PPi specificity and suggest that all of these PEPCKs are derived from a common ancestor.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678874>Highly effective remediation of Pb(II) and Hg(II) contaminated wastewater and soil by flower-like magnetic MoS nanohybrid.</a></h2><p>The efficient enrichment and remediation of heavy metals from realistic wastewater and contaminated soil containing large excess of competitive ions remains a daunting challenge by far. In the present study, flower-like molybdenum disulfide decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles (MoS/FeO) is designed via a two-step hydrothermal method and mainly applied in the removal of Hg(II) and Pb(II) ions in aqueous environment. Exhaustive morphological, chemical and magnetic characterizations verify the successful formation of magnetic MoS/FeO. Batch adsorption experiments show that the obtained MoS/FeO nanohybrid enables efficient capture of Hg(II) and Pb(II) ions, accompanied by ease-of-separation from solution by simply applying a magnet. In this respect, high adsorption capacities (263.6 mg g for Pb(II) and 428.9 mg g for Hg(II)) can be gained under optimized conditions (pH = 5.0; 298 K; nanohybrid dosage: 0.8 g L and the contact time: 180 min). In addition, the effects of different parameters such as initial Pb(II)/Hg(II) concentration (50-500 mg L), temperature (298, 308 and 318 K) and co-existing ions (Zn(II), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Mg(II)) were systematically probed. The favorable adsorption capacity, selectivity and recyclability mainly originates from the strong Hg/Pb···S bonding interactions. Practical application potential of magnetic MoS/FeO nanohybrid in realistic lead- battery industry wastewater and Pb(II)-contaminated soil is further explored, achieving promising results with high Pb(II) removal efficiency of 99.63% for wastewater and 57.15% for soil.

The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid metabolism. Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile  content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile . A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an  expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670353>Electrosynthesis of amino  from biomass-derivable  on titanium dioxide.</a></h2><p>Seven amino  were electrochemically synthesized from biomass-derivable α-keto  and NH2OH with faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 77-99% using an earth-abundant TiO2 catalyst.

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a representative eurythermic fish that can survive at a wide range of ambient temperatures, allowing it to live in an extensive geographical range. The goal of this work was to study the glucose metabolism of common carp at different temperatures and determine the miRNAs involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. We determined the indicators related to glucose metabolism after long-term temperature stress and constructed nine small RNA libraries of livers under different temperature stress (5 °C, 17 °C, and 30 °C, with three biological replicates for each temperature), and subjected these samples to high-throughput sequencing. A positive relationship was observed between weight gain rate (WGR) and temperature increase after 18 days of temperature stress. However, the glucose level in the plasma maintained a gentle decrease. Unexpectedly, liver lactic  levels were elevated in HTG (high temperature group) and LTG (low temperature group). Six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-122, miR-30b, miR-15b-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-1, and miR-7b) were identified as involved in the regulation of glycolysis. Twelve genes were predicted as targets of these miRNAs, and these genes are in pathways related to pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). The results allowed prediction of a potential regulatory network of miRNAs involved in the regulation of glycolysis. The target genes of six down-regulated miRNAs were up-regulated under temperature stress, including Aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate, b (ALDOCB), multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 (PDHA1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1a (ALDH9A1A), Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS), lactate dehydrogenase b (LDH-b), and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). Other key genes of glycolysis, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM), and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) were significantly up-regulated in LTG and HTG. Overall, the results suggest that miRNAs maintain their  requirements by regulating glycolysis and play an important role in the molecular response to cold and heat stress of common carp. These data provide the foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in environmental adaptation in fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Sixty Holstein cows, 27 multiparous and 33 primiparous, were blocked by parity and milk yield in the first 20 d in milk (DIM) and randomly assigned to receive 0, 0.5, or 1.0 g/d of LY, resulting in daily intakes of 0, 14.2, and 37.6 billion cells, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CNCM I-1077 from 30 to 107 DIM. Cows were milked twice daily, dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, body weight, and body condition were measured weekly. Blood was sampled weekly and plasma analyzed for concentrations of glucose, fatty , urea N, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and -soluble protein. Digestibility of nutrients was measured in the last 2 wk of the experiment. Ruminal fluid was collected on 2 consecutive days 6 h after the morning feeding for measurements of pH, concentrations of short chain fatty , and NH-N. Feeding behavior was observed for 48 h on experiment d 21 and 63. The mean ambient temperature was 26.8°C, humidity was 83.2%, and the temperature and humidity index ranged from 73 to 81. Treatment did not affect rectal temperature (38.9 ± 0.04°C) or DMI but increased yield of -corrected milk (ECM; 35.2 vs. 36.1 vs. 37.2 kg/d for 0, 0.5, and 1.0 g/d, respectively) and efficiency of conversion of DM into ECM (1.70, 1.79, and 1.83 for 0, 0.5, and 1 g/d, respectively). Feeding LY increased digestibility of crude protein (65.1 vs. 68.8 vs. 70.4%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 47.5 vs. 49.2 vs. 55.2%), and concentration of acetate (64.7 vs. 69.1 vs. 72.2 mM), which resulted in increased concentration of total short chain fatty  in ruminal fluid (110.3 vs. 117.7 vs. 121.4 mM). Mean ruminal pH increased (5.99 vs. 6.03 vs. 6.26), and proportion of cows with pH <5.8 decreased linearly (42.9 vs. 34.9 vs. 7.7%) with increasing inclusion of LY. Concentrations of acute-phase proteins decreased with increasing amount of LY. Some aspects of feeding behavior were altered by LY, and meal size reduced quadratically (3.2, 3.5, and 2.9 kg of DM, respectively), whereas interval between rumination bouts tended to reduce linearly (122, 96.5, and 90.7 min, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. Chewing time per kilogram of NDF tended to increase linearly (71.6, 71.3, and 81.6 min/kg, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. The estimated net  for lactation of the diet increased 5.2%, from 1.72 Mcal/kg of DM for 0 g of LY to 1.81 Mcal/kg for 1 g of LY. Feeding 1 g of LY/d to cows under heat stress increased yield of ECM and efficiency of feed conversion into ECM, improved diet digestibility, and increased ruminal fluid pH; these responses might be related either to direct effects of LY on ruminal microbial activity or to changes in feeding behavior that improved digestion of cows in heat stress.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

In their lifespan, cardiomyocytes undergo a dynamic maturation process from the fetal to adult stage, radically changing their metabolism, morphology, contractile and electrical properties. Before employing cells of human origin, in vitro models often use neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) to obtain key proof-of-principles. Nevertheless, NRCM monolayers de-differentiate when maintained under standard culture conditions, significantly decreasing the expression of mature hallmark-proteins. Supplementation of free fatty  (FFA), the main  source for mature cardiomyocytes, and co-culture with fibroblasts are each by itself known to promote the shift from fetal to adult cardiomyocytes. Using a co-culture system, our study investigates the effects of FFA on the cardiomyocyte phenotype in comparison to glucose as typical fetal  source, and to 10% serum used as standard control condition. Compared to the control condition, FFA- and glucose-supplementation both preserved cardiomyocyte differentiation and functionality with a higher expression of specific (troponin-I) and mature (myosin-light-chain-2v) cardiac markers at the protein- and mRNA-levels. FFA caused a significant increase in the cardiomyocyte contractility compared to the glucose-condition. Moreover, only FFA-supplementation enhanced beta-oxidation-based metabolism, typical of mature cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that cardiomyocytes in co-culture with fibroblasts benefit from FFA-supplementation by better maintaining their differentiated state in vitro.Copyright © 2019.

Among metabolic cornerstones, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is particularly pivotal for electron transfer through reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions, thus participating in a myriad of biochemical processes. Besides redox functions, NAD is now assumed to act as an integral regulator of signaling cascades involved in growth and environmental responses. However, the regulation of NAD metabolism and signaling during fruit development remains poorly studied and understood. Here, we benefit from RNAseq and proteomic data obtained from nine growth stages of tomato fruit (var. Moneymaker) to dissect mRNA and protein profiles that link to NAD metabolism, including  biosynthesis, recycling, utilization, and putative transport. As expected for a cofactor synthesis pathway, protein profiles failed to detect enzymes involved in NAD synthesis or utilization, except for nicotinic  phosphoribosyltransferase (NaPT) and nicotinamidase (NIC), which suggested that most NAD metabolic enzymes were poorly represented quantitatively. Further investigations on transcript data unveiled differential expression patterns during fruit development. Interestingly, among specific NAD metabolism-related genes, early  biosynthetic genes were transcriptionally induced in very young fruits, in association with NAD kinase, while later stages of fruit growth rather showed an accumulation of transcripts involved in later stages of  synthesis and in NAD recycling, which agreed with augmented NAD(P) levels. In addition, a more global overview of 119 mRNA and 78 protein significant markers for NAD(P)-dependent enzymes revealed differential patterns during tomato growth that evidenced clear regulations of primary metabolism, notably with respect to mitochondrial functions. Overall, we propose that NAD metabolism and signaling are very dynamic in the developing tomato fruit and that its differential regulation is certainly critical to fuel central metabolism linking to growth mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Decros, Beauvoit, Colombié, Cabasson, Bernillon, Arrivault, Guenther, Belouah, Prigent, Baldet, Gibon and Pétriacq.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650681>Molecular characterization of African swine fever virus from outbreaks in Namibia in 2018.</a></h2><p>Five samples were collected from four suspected outbreaks of African Swine Fever in Namibia in 2018.

We studied the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities, the soil's nutritional state and strawberry yield, when the soil was biofumigated each year for five consecutive years using fresh chicken manure (BioFum). BioFum significantly increased the soil's NH-N, NO-N, available P and K and organic matter. Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp. which are known to cause plant disease, were significantly decreased after BioFum. In addition, Biofum increased the soil's temperature, enhanced chlorophyll levels in the leaves of strawberry plants, and the soluble sugar and ascorbic  content in strawberry fruit. We used high-throughput gene sequencing to monitor changes in the soil's bacterial and fungal communities. Although BioFum significantly decreased the diversity of these communities, it increased the relative abundance of some biological control agents in the phylum Actinobacteria and the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Chaetomium. An increase in these biological control agents would reduce the incidence of soil-borne pathogens and plant disease. Although strawberry marketable yield using BioFum was higher in the first three years, the decline in the final two years could be due to the accumulation of P and K which may have delayed flowering and fruiting. Methods to overcome yield losses using BioFum need to be developed in the future. Our research, however, showed that BioFum enhanced soil fertility, reduced the presence of soil pathogens, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and fungi and improved strawberry quality. Unlike chemical soil treatments that can cause pest and disease resistance when used continuously over many years, our multi-year research program on BioFum showed that this treatment provided significant benefits to the soil, plant and strawberry fruit.Copyright © 2019.

Choline and methionine (Met) can promote  balance and benefit liver health in transition dairy cows; however, the regulating mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established the hepatocyte damage model by 1.5 mM NEFAs or BHBA treatment, and examined lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NEFAs and 1.5 mM BHBA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α as well as its target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty  synthetase, and Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100). Choline and Met upregulated the phosphorylation level of AMPK-α, which was blocked by BML (an AMPK-α inhibitor). The mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), CPT-1α, and ApoB100 showed a similar trend. The expressions of liver X recptoer α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) were decreased by choline and Met, while only the decrease of LXR-α was blocked by BML. These findings indicate that the high-level NEFAs and BHBA weaken the lipid metabolism by impairing the fatty  oxidation, synthesis, and transport proteins. Choline and Met regulate PPAR-α and LXR-α transcriptional activity through AMPK-α phosphorylation and regulate SREBP-1c independently of AMPK-α to promote lipid oxidation and transport in NEFAs-treated hepatocytes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678454>Effects of in-feed clinoptilolite treatment on serum metabolic and antioxidative biomarkers and acute phase response in dairy cows during pregnancy and early lactation.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of in-feed clinoptilolite (CPL) on serum metabolic and antioxidative biomarkers, acute phase proteins and reproductive performance in cows during pregnancy and lactation. A total of 78 Holstein-Friesian cows were randomly assigned into two groups: the treatment group, cows fed CPL (n = 38) which received 50 g of powdered CPL twice a day from day 180 before parturition to day 60 postpartum; and the control group (n = 40). Blood samples were taken on days 180, 90, 60, 30 and 10 before parturition, on day of calving and on days 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 40 and 60 postpartum, and were analysed for metabolic biomarkers: glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-esterified fatty , beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), antioxidative biomarkers and acute phase proteins: paraoxonase-1 (PON1), apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA). CPL supplementation increased concentration of glucose and significantly decreased (P < .05) level of BHB during puerperium. The SAA concentration in CPL-fed cows was significantly decreased (P < .05) on days 33, 40 and 60 postpartum as well as Hp concentration on days 0 and 12 postpartum. The results of this study suggest that the CPL-fed cows may have improved metabolic status due to the tendency of greater glucose levels and decreased BHB values during early lactation. In addition, acute phase response was lower (P < .05) in CPL-fed cows. Such an outcome might be attributed to the effect of dietary CPL on intensity and severity of the negative  balance and inflammatory response in dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The intravitreous injection of VEGF antibodies has been reported to be an effective treatment to relieve symptoms of WAMD. However, the limitations of this treatment are high costs and invasiveness. For this reason, oral delivery route can be considered as a cost-effective way and the safest method to deliver drug molecules to the eyes. Accordingly, ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was included in the oral formulation as the potential substance for the cure of WAMD in the animal model. Various pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects, have been reported for UDCA and recent reports support the effects of UDCA in ocular treatment. However, due to poor water solubility and low pKa (around 5.0), it has been challenging to formulate aqueous solution of UDCA in the neutral pH range. In the present study, we confirmed the aqueous solubility of the oral UDCA formulation and performed a preclinical study, including pharmacokinetic profiling and WAMD model efficacy study in mice after oral administration of the drug solution. The results demonstrated that the formulation improved bioavailability of UDCA and efficiently delivered UDCA to the eye tissues after oral absorption. UDCA formulation was found to have inhibitory effects of choroidal neovascularization with a functional recovery in mice retinas. Taken together, our results suggest that the oral UDCA formulation could be used as a potent supplement for the cure of WAMD and related retinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678905>Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics reveals short-chain chlorinated paraffin-induced hepatotoxicity in male Sprague-Dawley rat.</a></h2><p>Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) used in various industrial applications have been listed as new POPs. Previous studies based on high-dose exposures indicate their hepatotoxicity. However, their mechanisms of toxicity or adverse outcome pathways and health risks remain largely unknown.This study aimed to evaluate metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to SCCPs at low doses and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity of SCCPs.A combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics, together with general pathophysiological tests were performed to assess the hepatic response of male rats exposed to SCCPs.Our results highlight two major modes of action: Inhibition of  metabolism and activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Exposure to SCCPs suppressed oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and turnover of ATP-ADP-AMP and thus results in deficiencies of amino  and nucleotides in liver of the rat. Exposure to SCCPs affected expression levels of 13 genes downstream of PPARα that encode proteins associated with metabolism of fatty . As a result, peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, microsomal fatty  ω-oxidation, and lipogenesis were accelerated.Results of this work strongly support the conclusion that low-dose exposure to SCCPs can result in adverse outcomes in the rat model. Significant SCCP-induced inhibition of  metabolism occurs at environmentally relevant dosages, which suggests that SCCPs exhibit metabolic toxicity. Interactions of SCCPs with PPARα signaling pathway can explain the disruption of lipids and amino  metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic  (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total  and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth weight compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or 2 years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The highest yield of collagen was 84.14% based on protein weight after ultrasonic treatment for 36 min. Using SDS-PAGE, the extracted protein was identified as collagen-II and its structural integrity was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The triple helical structure remained the same, but some changes in the secondary structure were observed after longer ultrasonication treatments (≥36 min). The amino  profile exhibited high thermal stability. The rheological and functional characteristics of collagen were also considerably improved after ultrasonication for the optimal period (24 min). The ultrasonication treatment is an effective process for the extraction of collagen-II from land animal co-products, which will further meet the increasing industrial demand.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about how the diet fed to BSFL affects their nutritional value, especially their fatty  composition. In this study, BSFL were fed 11 diets based on four different organic waste sources (mussels, bread, fish and food waste). Fatty  and proximate composition (dry matter, crude fat, crude protein and ash) were analysed in the diets, in two-week-old larvae and substrate residues. Larval weight, survival and feed conversion were also recorded. The diet was found to affect all parameters investigated. Irrespective of diet, the larval fat consisted mainly of lauric  and other saturated fatty  and these were found to be synthesised by the larvae. However, both the fatty  composition of the substrate, and the larval weight were found to affect the fatty  profile of the larvae. In general, larvae with a higher weight contained a higher percentage of saturated fatty  and a lower percentage of unsaturated fatty , such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). It was concluded that the possibilities to tailor the fatty  composition of the BSFL through the diet are limited; thus, the BSFL fat may not be suitable to replace fish oil, but has potential of inclusion in other food, feed and fuel products.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Analytes were separated using an Zorbax Extend-Agilent C (1.8 μm, 4.6 × 30 mm) column following a simple methanol precipitation treatment. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0.1% formic , and the total gradient program time was 1.5 min. Method validation results showed TH was linear in 2-500 ng/mL (r > 0.99), and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 2 μg/mL. The intra-run and inter-run precision (coefficient of variation, CV) was within 2.80%, and the accuracy (relative error, RE) was within ±11.10%. Stability of TH was evaluated in different storage conditions, including short-term I-III, long-term I-III, 2 and 4 h in the artificial gastrointestinal tract, respectively. There was no obvious interference between TH and internal standards (IS). With the established Caco-2 monolayer permeability model, Papp(AB) of TH was calculated as 46.29 ± 8.31 × 10 cm/s, and the efflux ratio (ER) value was calculated as 0.22, indicating a high permeability character of TH. The transmembrane transport of TH followed the concentration-dependent, temperature-independent, and -free manner. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that TH is a highly permeable drug and the transport mechanism is mainly via passive diffusion.Copyright © 2019.

We have previously demonstrated its neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties in PC12 cells treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Now, we have investigated the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of p-BTX-I against the toxicity of acrolein in PC12 cells. Studies have demonstrated that acrolein might play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by neuronal and synaptic loss. Our results showed that not only acrolein reduced cell differentiation and cell viability, but also altered the expression of markers of synaptic communication (synapsin I),  metabolism (AMPK-α, Sirt I and glucose uptake), and cytoskeleton (β-III-tubulin). Treatment with p-BTX-I increased the percentage of differentiation in cells treated with acrolein and significantly attenuated cell viability loss, besides counteracting the negative effects of acrolein on synapsin I, AMPK-α, Sirt I, glucose uptake, and β-III-tubulin. Additionally, p-BTX-I alone increased the expression of apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene, associated with the proteolytic degradation of β-amyloid peptide aggregates, a hallmark of AD. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that p-BTX-I protects against acrolein-induced neurotoxicity and might be a tool for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663260>Evidence of non-covalent complexes in some natural extracts: Ceylon tea and Mate extracts.</a></h2><p>Considering the high complexity of natural extracts, due to the presence of organic molecules of different chemical nature, the possibility of formation of non-covalent complexes should be taken into account. In a previous investigation the formation of bimolecular complexes between caffeine and catechins in green tea extracts (GTE) has been experimentally proven by means of mass spectrometric and  H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The same approaches have been employed in the present study to evaluate the presence of bimolecular complexes in Ceylon tea and Mate extracts. The obtained results show that in the case of Ceylon tea extracts protonated theaflavin is detectable, together with theaflavin/caffein complexes, while caffeine/catechin complexes, already detected in green tea, are still present, but at lower concentration. This aspect is evidenced by the comparison of precursor ion scans performed on protonated caffeine for the two extracts. The spectra obtained in these conditions for GTE and Ceylon tea show that the complexes of caffeine with epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), highy abundant in the case of GTE (signal-to-chemical noise ratio in the range 50-100), are negligible (signal-to-chemical noise ratio in the range 2-3) in the case of Ceylon tea. Mate extracts show the formation of bimolecular complexes involving caffeine but not catechins, and chlorogenic  becomes responsible for other complex formation. Under positive ion and negative ion conditions, accurate mass measurements allow the identification of malealdehyde, chlorogenic , caffeine, two isomers of dicaffeoylquinic , rutin and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside. These data indicate that the formation of complexes in natural extracts is a common behaviour and their presence must be considered in the description of natural extracts and, consequently, in their biological activity.This article is protected by copyright.

Blood was sampled before and 180 min after completion of each MTT. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was collected after overnight fast and both MTTs. Prior to each investigation day, participants consumed a 4-week isocaloric diet of the same composition: (1) high-carb meals until 13:30 and high-fat meals between 16:30 and 22:00 or (2) the inverse order.12h-daily lipid patterns showed a complex regulation by both the time of day (67.8%) and meal composition (55.4%). A third of lipids showed a diurnal variation in postprandial responses to the same meal with mostly higher responses in the morning than in the afternoon. Triacylglycerols containing shorter and more saturated fatty  were enriched in the morning. SAT transcripts involved in fatty  synthesis and desaturation showed no diurnal variation. Diurnal changes of seven lipid classes were negatively associated with insulin sensitivity, but not with glucose and insulin response or insulin secretion.This study identified postprandial plasma lipid profiles as being strongly affected by meal timing and associated with insulin sensitivity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Mitochondria are important mediators of metabolic flexibility and dysfunction is associated with metabolic inflexibility and pathology. Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric  (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on  homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of  metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

However, the mechanism underlying this association remains poorly understood. In the present study, a gilt obesity model was developed by exposure to different  diets and used to investigate the role of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) in the placenta. Specifically, 99 gilts (Guangdong Small-ear Spotted pig) at day 60 of gestation were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: low- group (L, DE = 11.50 MJ/kg), medium- group (M, DE = 12.41 MJ/kg), and high- group (H, DE = 13.42 MJ/kg), with 11 replicate pens per treatment and 3 gilts per pen. At the start of the study, maternal body weight and backfat thickness were not significantly different in the three treatments. After the study, data indicated that the H group had higher body weight and backfat thickness gain for gilts during gestation and lower piglet birth weight compared with the other two groups. Additionally, the H group showed glucolipid metabolic disorders and increased triglyceride and nonesterified fatty  contents in the placenta of gilts. Compared with the L group, the H group exhibited lower mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative damage in the placenta. Importantly, increased mRNA expression and protein abundance of Nox2 were observed for the first time in H group placentae. Furthermore, compared with the L group, the H group showed a decrease in the density of placental vessels and the protein levels of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (p-VEGFR2) as well as the immunostaining intensity of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31). Our findings suggest that maternal high- diet-induced obesity increases placental oxidative stress and decreases placental angiogenesis possibly through the upregulation of Nox2.Copyright © 2019 Chengjun Hu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680139>Effects of copper hydroxychloride and distillers dried grains with solubles on intestinal microbial concentration and apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of  and nutrients by growing pigs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that Cu hydroxychloride improves nutrient digestibility and alters the concentration of microbial protein in the small intestine or large intestine by pigs fed a corn-soybean meal diet or a diet based on corn, soybean meal, and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Twenty four barrows (33.3 ± 3.4 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum, were allotted to a 2 × 2 factorial design with 2 levels of DDGS (0 or 45%) and 2 levels of supplemental Cu from Cu hydroxychloride (0 or 150 mg/kg). A 2-period switch back design with the 4 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet in each period was used resulting in 12 replicate pigs per diet for the 2 periods. The initial 9 d of each period was considered an adaptation period to the experimental diets. For each period, feces were collected on d 10, 11, and 12, and ileal digesta were collected for 8 h on d 13 and 14. Results indicated that inclusion of 45% DDGS to diets reduced (P < 0.05) the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and the AID and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, gross , and crude protein. In contrast, inclusion of DDGS to diets increased (P < 0.05) the AID and the ATTD of  hydrolyzed ether extract and the concentration of microbial protein in the hindgut (P < 0.05). However, the total concentration of volatile fatty  (VFA) in ileal digesta and in feces from pigs fed the DDGS diets were not different from concentrations in pigs fed diets without DDGS. The AID and ATTD of dry matter, gross  and crude protein were not affected by dietary Cu concentrations, but the AID and ATTD of  hydrolyzed ether extract were greater (P < 0.05) in diets supplemented with Cu hydroxychloride compared with diets without Cu hydroxychloride. There was also a reduction (P < 0.05) in the concentration of microbial protein and a tendency for a reduction (P < 0.10) in the total concentration of VFA in feces when diets were supplemented with Cu hydroxychloride. In conclusion, supplementation of Cu hydroxychloride to diets improved AID and ATTD of  hydrolyzed ether extract and reduced the concentration of microbial protein in the large intestine and this effect was observed in diets containing DDGS as well as in diets without DDGS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we report the NOx adsorption properties in a family of rare earth (RE) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials. Fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship of NOx adsorption in the RE-DOBDC materials platform was sought via a combined experimental and molecular modeling study. No structural change was noted following humid NOx exposure. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicated that H2O has a stronger affinity to bind with the metal center than NO2, while NO2 preferentially binds with the DOBDC ligands. Further modeling results indicate no change in binding  across the RE elements investigated. Also, stabilization of the NO2 and H2O molecules following adsorption was noted, predicted to be due to hydrogen bonding between the framework ligands and the molecules and nanoconfinement within the MOF structure. This interaction also caused distinct changes in emission spectra, identified experimentally. Calculations indicated that this is due to the adsorption of NO2 molecules onto the DOBDC ligand altering the electronic transitions and the resulting photoluminescent properties, a feature that has potential applications in future sensing technologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677572>Ammoniated MOF-74(Zn) derivatives as luminescent sensor for highly selective detection of tetrabromobisphenol A.</a></h2><p>In this study, a porous framework MOF-74(Zn) (Zn (DHBDC)(DMF)(HO), Hdondc = 1, 5-dioxido-2, 6-naphthalenedicarboxylic ) with open metal sites was successful synthesized.

The fluorescence enhancement showed a good linear relationship with the concentrations of TBBPA in the range of 50-400 μg/L, and its limit of detection could reach to 0.75 μg/L. Furthermore, the possible sensing mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement could be attributed to Förster resonance  transfer (FRET).

After kidney protein extraction, 28% SDS-PAGE was used, followed by in-gel digestion and desalting. Next, the samples were analyzed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with Q-TOF MS, and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and SWATH technology were also used. The gene ontology and pathway analysis were accomplished. Ultimately, these protein biomarkers were validated by using scheduled high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM ).Comparisons of the control group with the other three groups revealed that 95, 130, and 103 proteins were expressed at significantly different levels from in the control group in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. According to the gene ontology analysis, the major processes that these proteins were involved in were metabolic processes, biological regulation, cellular processes, and responses to stimuli; the major functions these proteins were involved in were binding, hydrolase activity, catalytic activity, and oxidoreductase activity; and the major cellular components they were involved in were the cytoplasm, extracellular region, membrane, and mitochondria. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, these proteins were involved in 35 pathways, 5 of which, including the carbohydrate metabolism, folate biosynthesis, renal tubular resorption, amino  metabolism, and Ras signaling pathways, are discussed in this study. Ultimately, 19 proteins involved in 12 important pathways were validated by sMRM .It was demonstrated that maleic  caused insufficient  production, which might lead to a decrease in the activity of the sodium-potassium ATP pump and hydrogen ion ATP pump, which could have in turn caused renal tubular resorption and hydrogen ion regulation to be blocked, thus leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions in the renal tubules, which would then result in renal tubular acidification followed finally by Fanconi syndrome.This article is protected by copyright.
