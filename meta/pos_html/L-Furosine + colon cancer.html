However, whether angiogenesis in the primary tumors of patients with colorectal  affects their prognosis has yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between selected pathoclinical parameters and overall survival of resectable colorectal  patients with the expression of angiogenesis-promoting factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Fms-like  kinase receptor (Flt-1), and microvessel density (MVD) in the primary tumor. VEGF and Flt-1 expression were assessed, as well as MVD (with anti-CD34) by immunohistochemistry in 139 archived primary colorectal  tissue samples. These results were compared with the overall survival of the patients and potential prognostic pathoclinical parameters. A higher MVD in the tumors expressing Flt-1 (P=0.04) was identified. However, there was no correlation between the pathoclinical parameters of  and Flt-1 expression, VEGF expression, or MVD in the tumor. Furthermore, the intensity of VEGF expression, Flt-1 expression and tumor MVD did not correlate with the overall survival of the patients. Therefore, although increased expression of VEGF and Flt-1 was correlated with an increased expression of MVD in the primary tumors of resectable colorectal  patients, these factors were not correlated with prognostic pathoclinical factors and overall survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899829>Inhibition of Fas associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) facilitates apoptosis of  stem cells and enhances the effects of oxaliplatin.</a></h2><p>Fas associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein  phosphatase. Fap1 substrates include Fas and Gsk3β, suggesting a role in regulating cell survival. Consistent with this, increased Fap1 expression is associated with resistance to Fas or platinum induced apoptosis in some human  tumors or cell lines. In the current studies, we found that Fap1 expression was significantly greater in CD133  stem cells compared to CD133 tumor cells.  promoter activity (encoding Fap1) was repressed by interferon regulatory factor 2 (irf2), and expression of Fap1 and Irf2 were inversely correlated in CD133 or CD133  cells. We determined that CD133 cells were relatively resistant to Fas or oxaliplatin induced apoptosis, but this was reversed by Fap1-knockdown or a Fap1-blocking tripeptide (SLV). In a murine xenograft model of , we found treatment with SLV peptide significantly decreased tumor growth and relative abundance of CD133CD44 cells; associated with increased phosphorylation of Fap1 substrates. SLV peptide also enhanced inhibitory effects of oxaliplatin on tumor growth and Fap1 substrate phosphorylation in this model. Our studies suggest that therapeutically targeting Fap1 may decrease persistence of  stem cells during treatment with platinum chemotherapy by activating Fap1 substrates. In a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia, we previously determined that inhibition of Fap1 decreased persistence of leukemia stem cells during  kinase inhibitor treatment. Therefore, Fap1 may be a tissue agnostic target to increase apoptosis in malignant stem cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28827587>A prospective analysis of mucosal microbiome-metabonome interactions in colorectal  using a combined MAS 1HNMR and metataxonomic strategy.</a></h2><p> induces a state of mucosal dysbiosis with associated niche specific changes in the gut microbiota. However, the key metabolic functions of these bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective surgery for  without mechanical bowel preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that microbiota ecology appears to be  stage-specific and strongly associated with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε- Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased with advancing  stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline, lactate, phenylalanine and  and decreased levels of lipids and triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not responsible for the modification of the  mucosal metabonome. Thus the  mucosal microbiome evolves with  stage to meet the demands of  metabolism. Passenger microbiota may play a role in the maintenance of  mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage specific.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381817>Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss induced by regorafenib.</a></h2><p>Regorafenib is a novel multi-targeted  kinase inhibitor approved for use in refractory metastatic colorectal , advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The anti-inflammatory role of PTPN2 is highlighted by the fact that PTPN2-deficient mice die a few weeks after birth because of systemic inflammation and severe colitis. However, the tissues, cells, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of PTPN2 in mice (PTPN2-LysMCre) promotes intestinal inflammation but protects from colitis-associated tumor formation in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Elevated levels of mature IL-1β production in PTPN2-LysMCre mice are a consequence of increased inflammasome assembly due to elevated phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Thus, we have identified a dual role for myeloid PTPN2 in directly regulating inflammasome activation and IL-1β production to suppress pro-inflammatory responses during colitis but promote intestinal tumor development.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

On the other hand, aryl urea moieties which are found in some  kinase inhibitors such as Sorafenib and Linifanib have aroused recent attention as responsible for anticancer activities. The aims of this paper are to synthesize pyrrolo[ 2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives containing urea moiety and evaluate their anti- activity against human lung  cell line (A549), prostate  cell line (PC3), human  cell line (SW480) and human breast  cell line (MCF-7).A series of new pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines containing urea moieties have been synthesized as Scheme 1. In vitro cytotoxicity of target compounds were evaluated against, SW480, PC3, A549 and MCF-7 human  cell lines using a MTT assay. In order to evaluate the mechanism of cytotoxic activity of compounds 9e, 10a and 10b, having the best cytotoxic activity, Annexin V binding assay, cell cycle analysis and western blot analysis were performed.Among the target compounds, 10a (IC50 = 0.19 µM) was found to be the most potent derivative against PC3 cells. Compound 10b and 9e showed the strong cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and A549 cells with IC50 value of 1.66 µM and 4.55 µM, respectively. Flow cytometry data suggest that the cytotoxic activity of the compounds on  cells might be mediated by apoptosis revealing a significant increase in the percentage of late apoptotic cells and causing a cell cycle arrest at different stages. Western blot analysis of apoptosis marker demonstrated that these compounds induce apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway.Compound 9e displayed the strongest cytotoxicity against A549  cell line, and induced late apoptosis in A549, as confirmed by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. In addition, compound 9e reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, besides increased caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as cleavage of PARP levels. These results suggest that compound 9e showed a cytotoxic effect in A549 cells through activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further studies will be undertaken in our laboratory to improve cytotoxic activity of compound 9e and to identify the biological targets of 9e which are responsible for anticancer activity.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31079293>Chronic Mild Gut Inflammation Accelerates Brain Neuropathology and Motor Dysfunction in α-Synuclein Mutant Mice.</a></h2><p>Emerging findings suggest that Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology (α-synuclein accumulation) and neuronal dysfunction may occur first in peripheral neurons of the autonomic nervous system including the enteric branches of the vagus nerve. The risk of PD increases greatly in people over the age of 65, a period of life in which chronic inflammation is common in many organ systems including the gut. Here we report that chronic mild focal intestinal inflammation accelerates the age of disease onset in α-synuclein mutant PD mice. Wild-type and PD mice treated with 0.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in their drinking water for 12 weeks beginning at 3 months of age exhibited histological and biochemical features of mild gut inflammation. The age of onset of motor dysfunction, evaluated using a rotarod test, gait analysis, and grip strength measurements, was significantly earlier in DSS-treated PD mice compared to control PD mice. Levels of the dopaminergic neuron marker  hydroxylase in the striatum and numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were reduced in PD mice with gut inflammation. Levels of total and phosphorylated α-synuclein were elevated in enteric and brain neurons in DSS-treated PD mice, suggesting that mild gut inflammation accelerates α-synuclein pathology. Markers of inflammation in the  and brain, but not in the blood, were elevated in DSS-treated PD mice, consistent with retrograde transneuronal propagation of α-synuclein pathology and neuroinflammation from the gut to the brain. Our findings suggest that interventions that reduce gut inflammation may prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316214>[Expression of  and threonine protein kinase in carcinogenic process of colorectal  and its relationship with prognosis].</a></h2><p> To investigate the expression of TTK ( and threonine protein kinase) in the process of colorectal  (CRC) development and its relationship to prognosis in CRC patients.  Colitis-associated  model was induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. Mice at four different stages of  development were obtained, named AD1 (inflammation of the recovery), AD2 (mild dysplasia), AD3 (adenoma) and AD4 (adenocarcinoma), as well as negative control (no treatment). The expression of TTK was measured by real time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining in mouse  tissues and 24 pairs of CRC specimens. The relationship between TTK and prognosis was analyzed in a set of CRC genome-wide gene expression microarray data that was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  The genome-wide microarray data from mouse AOM-DSS model indicated that the expression of TTK mRNA was gradually elevated during the development of . The subsequent qPCR results showed that TTK mRNA levels in negative control, AD1, AD2, AD3 and AD4 groups were 1.05±0.42, 1.10±0.03, 1.38±0.15, 1.33±0.17 and 2.12±0.22, respectively. And TTK expression in AD2, AD3 and AD4 groups were significantly higher than that in negative control (<0.05). The protein expression of TTK showed by immunohistochemical staining had similar tendency as the results of TTK mRNA. Besides that, the TTK mRNA levels in tumor tissues (0.71±0.10) from 24 CRC patients were significantly higher than those in paired adjacent normal tissues (0.18±0.04; <0.001). The positive expression rate of TTK protein in 5 pairs of CRC clinical samples was 80.0%, and it was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues (30.8%, =0.014). Furthermore, according to a public transcriptomic data (GSE17536), the high levels of TTK were associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients.  Elevated expression of TTK is related to  carcinogenesis in both of mouse model and human CRC samples. TTK is a poor prognostic factor in CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933430>Loss of zinc-finger protein 143 contributes to tumour progression by interleukin-8-CXCR axis in .</a></h2><p>Several studies have shown that expression of zinc-finger protein 143 (ZNF143) is closely related to tumour progression including . However, it remains unclear how ZNF143 expression is related to tumour progression within the tumour microenvironment. Here, we investigated whether ZNF143 expression affects the tumour microenvironment and tumour progression by screening molecules secreted by  cells stably expressing short-hairpin RNAs against ZNF143 or control RNAs. We observed that secretion of interleukin (IL)-8 was increased when ZNF143 expression was reduced in two  cell lines. The mRNA and protein levels of IL-8 were increased in cells following ZNF143 knockdown, and this effect was reversed when ZNF143 expression was restored. The Janus  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways were also shown to contribute to IL-8 expression in ZNF143-knockdown cells. The expression levels of ZNF143 and IL-8 were inversely correlated with three-dimensionally grown spheroids and  tissues. THP-1 cells were differentiated when cells were incubated with condition media from  cell with less ZNF143, drastically.

Clinical studies have demonstrated upregulation of IGF1R mediated signaling in a number of malignancies including , breast, and lung cancers. Overexpression of the IGF1R in these malignancies is associated with a poor prognosis and overall survival. IGF1R specific kinase inhibitors have failed in multiple clinical trials partly because of the complex nature of IGF1R signaling. Thus identifying new binding partners and allosteric sites on IGF1R are emerging areas of research. More recently, IGF1R has been shown to translocate into the nucleus and perform many functions. In this study, we generated a library of IGF1R deletion and point mutants to examine IGF1R subcellular localization and activation of downstream signaling pathways. We show that the nuclear localization of IGF1R is primarily defined by its cytoplasmic domain. We identified a cross-talk between IGF1R and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and showed, for the first time, that IGF1R is associated with upregulation of TCF-mediated β-catenin transcriptional activity. Using loss-of-function mutants, deletion analysis and IGF1R specific inhibitor(s), we show that cytoplasmic and nuclear activities are two independent functions of IGF1R. Furthermore, we identified a unique loss-of-function mutation in IGF1R. This unique loss-of-function mutant retains only nuclear functions and sits in a pocket, outside ATP and substrate binding region, that is suited for designing allosteric inhibitors of IGF1R.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is also considerable potential for KIT to influence tumor growth indirectly based on its expression and function in cell types of the innate immune system, most notably mast cells. We have evaluated syngeneic mouse tumor models for antitumor effects of an inhibitory KIT mAb, dosed either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-KIT mAb treatment enhanced the antitumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs, and promoted immune responses by selectively reducing the immunosuppressive monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell population and by restoring CD8 and CD4 T-cell populations to levels observed in naïve mice.

BITC simultaneously activated the PI3K/Akt/forkhead box O (FoxO) pathway, whereas it significantly inhibited the proliferation in human colorectal  cells. Inhibitory experiments using a PI3K selective inhibitor, LY294002 or NVP-BEZ235, significantly enhanced the BITC-induced antiproliferation and apoptotic cell population with the attenuation of the BITC-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO survival pathway. Furthermore, BITC enhanced the insulin-activated PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway, possibly through its inhibition of the protein  phosphatase 1B enzymatic activity. Taken together, these results suggested that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway negatively regulates the BITC-induced antiproliferation in human colorectal  cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The stage of the disease is related to the survival of the patient, and in early phases surgery is the main modality of treatment. The main aim of modern medicinal chemistry is to synthesize small molecules via drug designing, especially by targeting tumor cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS A new series of 19 compounds containing benzothiazole and thiazole were designed. Molecular docking studies were performed on the designed series of molecules. Compounds showing good binding affinity towards the EGFR receptor were selected for synthetic studies. Characterization of the synthesized compounds was done by FTIR, 1HNMR, Mass and C, H, N, analysis. RESULTS The anticancer evaluation of the synthesized compounds was done at NIC, USA at a single dose against  cell lines HCT 116, HCT15, and HC 29. The active compounds were further evaluated for the 5-dose testing. Compounds were designed by using docking analysis.

Its use is associated with the development of severe diarrhea in up to 40% of patients in the absence of proactive management. We previously developed a rat model of neratinib-induced diarrhea and found inflammation and anatomical disruption in the ileum and . Here we tested whether anti-diarrheal interventions, budesonide and colesevelam, can reduce neratinib-induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology.Rats were treated with 50 mg/kg neratinib via oral gavage for 14 or 28 days (total n = 64). Body weight and diarrhea severity were recorded daily. Apoptosis was measured using immunohistochemistry for caspase-3. Inflammation was measured via a multiplex cytokine/chemokine assay. ErbB levels were measured using PCR and Western Blot.Budesonide co-treatment caused rats to gain significantly less weight than neratinib alone from day 4 of treatment (P = 0.0418). Budesonide (P = 0.027) and colesevelam (P = 0.033) each reduced the amount of days with moderate diarrhea compared to neratinib alone. In the proximal , rats treated with neratinib had higher levels of apoptosis compared to controls (P = 0.0035). Budesonide reduced histopathological injury in the proximal (P = 0.0401) and distal  (P = 0.027) and increased anti-inflammatory IL-4 tissue concentration (ileum; P = 0.0026, ; P = 0.031) compared to rats treated with neratinib alone. In the distal ileum, while budesonide decreased ErbB1 mRNA expression compared to controls (P = 0.018) (PCR), an increase in total ErbB1 protein was detected (P = 0.0021) (Western Blot).Both budesonide and colesevelam show potential as effective interventions against neratinib-induced diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29962093>MicroRNA-137-mediated Src oncogenic signaling promotes  progression.</a></h2><p>The  kinase c-Src is frequently overexpressed and activated in a wide variety of human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the upregulation of c-Src remain elusive. To examine whether microRNA-mediated c-Src upregulation promotes  progression, we screened miRNAs with complementarity to the 3'-UTR of c-Src mRNA. Among these miRNAs, down-regulation of miR-137 was tightly associated with c-Src-mediated tumor progression of human  cells/tissues. Re-expression of miR-137 in human  cells suppressed tumor growth and caused the disruption of focal contacts, suppression of cell adhesion, and invasion, although restoration of c-Src in miR-137-treated cells could not fully rescue the tumor-suppressive effect of miR-137. We found that miR-137 targets AKT2 and paxillin also and miR-137-mediated regulation of c-Src /AKT2 is crucial for controlling tumor growth, whereas that of c-Src/paxillin contributes to malignancy. miR-137 suppressed Src-related oncogenic signaling and changed the expression of miRNAs that are regulated by Src activation. miR-137 controls the expression of c-Src/AKT2/paxillin and synergistically suppresses Src oncogenic signaling evoked from focal adhesions. In various human cancers that harbor c-Src upregulation, the dysfunction of this novel mechanism would serve as a critical trigger for tumor progression.© 2018 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28742842>New hydrazonoindolin-2-ones: Synthesis, exploration of the possible anti-proliferative mechanism of action and encapsulation into PLGA microspheres.</a></h2><p>The synthesis and molecular characterization of new isatin-based hydrazonoindolin-2-ones 4a-o and 7a-e are reported. The in vitro anti-proliferative potential of the synthesized compounds 4a-o and 7a-e was examined against HT-29 (), ZR-75 (breast) and A549 (lung) human  cell lines.

Compound 7e was selected for further pharmacological evaluation in order to gain insight into its possible mechanism of action. It increased caspase 3/7 activity by 2.4- and 1.85-fold between 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively, at 10 μM and it caused a decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a corresponding increase in the S-phase. In addition, compound 7e increased phosphorylated  (p-Tyr) levels nearly two-fold with an apparent IC50 value of 3.8 μM. The 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres were prepared using a modified emulsion-solvent diffusion method. The average encapsulation efficiency of the 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres was 85% ± 1.3.

Chromosome rearrangements are a common feature of human malignancies, but whether they represent bona fide  drivers and therapeutically actionable targets, requires functional testing. Here, we describe the generation of transgenic, inducible CRISPR-based mouse systems to engineer and study recurrent -associated EIF3E-RSPO2 and PTPRK-RSPO3 chromosome rearrangements in vivo. We show that both Rspo2 and Rspo3 fusion events are sufficient to initiate hyperplasia and tumour development in vivo, without additional cooperating genetic events. Rspo-fusion tumours are entirely Wnt-dependent, as treatment with an inhibitor of Wnt secretion, LGK974, drives rapid tumour clearance from the intestinal mucosa without effects on normal intestinal crypts. Altogether, our study provides direct evidence that endogenous Rspo2 and Rspo3 chromosome rearrangements can initiate and maintain tumour development, and indicate a viable therapeutic window for LGK974 treatment of RSPO-fusion cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28274874>Epiregulin-blocking antibody inhibits epiregulin-dependent EGFR signaling.</a></h2><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor  kinase involved in many cellular functions including cell growth and migration. EGFR may be activated by EGF family ligands such as EGF and epiregulin (EREG). EREG is overexpressed in human  and breast cancers, implying that EREG plays roles in tumorigenesis. Although EGF family members share a receptor, it is not well known whether their signaling pathways differ. In order to investigate EREG signaling, we established the anti-EREG antibody that inhibits EGFR downstream signaling stimulated by EREG but not by EGF. While the anti-EREG antibody has little effect on cell growth, it inhibits cell adhesion of EREG-expressing autocrine  cell lines. Our results suggest that anti-EREG antibodies represent valuable tools for elucidating EREG-specific signaling pathways, and may serve as therapeutic candidates for the treatment of cancers.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

This synthetic lethality can be enhanced by inhibitors of DNA repair. To exploit this potential Achilles heel, we tested the ability of a RAD51 inhibitor to potentiate the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs. 2-(Benzylsulfonyl)-1-(1-indol-3-yl)-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline (IBR2) inhibits RAD51-mediated DNA double-strand break repair but also enhances cytotoxicity of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib. The potential for synergy between IBR2 and more drugs was examined in vitro across a spectrum of  cell lines from various tissues. Cells were exposed to IBR2 simultaneously with inhibitors of receptor  kinases, DNA-damaging agents, or microtubule disruptors. IBR2, at concentrations that inhibited proliferation between 0% and 75%, enhanced toxicity by up to 80% of imatinib and regorafenib (targets RAF and kit); epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib; and vincristine, an inhibitor of microtubule function. However, IBR2 antagonized the action of olaparib, cisplatin, melphalan, and irinotecan. A vincristine-resistant squamous cell line was not cross resistant to imatinib, but IBR2 and another RAD51 inhibitor (B02) enhanced imatinib toxicity in this cell line, its HN-5a parent, and the  line HT-29 by up to 60% and much better than verapamil, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor ( < 0.05). Given the disparate agents the functions of which are enhanced by IBR2, the mechanisms of enhancement may be multimodal. Whether RAD51 is common to these mechanisms remains to be elucidated, but it provides the potential for selectivity to tumor cells.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29478325>Carcinogenesis and Reactive Oxygen Species Signaling: Interaction of the NADPH Oxidase NOX1-5 and Superoxide Dismutase 1-3 Signal Transduction Pathways.</a></h2><p>Reduction/oxidation (redox) balance could be defined as an even distribution of reduction and oxidation complementary processes and their reaction end products.

Recent Advances: In the current review, we have summarized the main signaling cascades inducing NADPH oxidase NOX1-5 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1-3 expression and their connection to cell proliferation, immortalization, transformation, and CD34 cell differentiation in thyroid, , lung, breast, and hematological cancers.Interestingly, many of the signaling pathways activating redox enzymes or mediating the effect of ROS are common, such as pathways initiated from G protein-coupled receptors and  kinase receptors involving protein kinase A, phospholipase C, calcium, and small GTPase signaling molecules.The clarification of interaction of signal transduction pathways could explain how cells regulate redox balance and may even provide means to inhibit the accumulation of harmful levels of ROS in human pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215682>Schiff base-nickel, palladium, and platinum complexes derived from N-cyclohexyl hydrazine carbothioamide and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde: Selective antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects against colorectal carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The bidentate N-cyclohexyl-2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzylidene)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide Schiff base ligand (HL) was coordinated to divalent nickel, palladium and platinum ions to form square planar complexes. The nickel and palladium complexes, [NiL ], [PdL ] form square planar complexes with 2:1 ligand to metal ratio. The platinum complex, [PtL(dmso)Cl] formed a square planar complex with 1:1 ligand to metal ratio. Platinum undergoes in situ reaction with DMSO before complexing with the ligand in solution. The cytotoxicity of HL, [NiL ], [PdL ], and [PtL(dmso)Cl] were evaluated against human  cell line (HCT-116), human cervical  (Hela) cell line, melanoma (B16F10) cells, and human normal endothelial cell lines (Eahy926) by MTT assay. The [NiL ] complex displayed selective cytotoxic effect against the HCT 116  cell line with IC of 7.9 ± 0.2 μM. However, HL, [PdL ], and [PtL(dmso)Cl] only exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity with IC = 75.9 ± 2.4, 100.0 ± 1.8, and 101.0 ± 3.6 μM, respectively. The potent cytotoxicity of [NiL ] was characterized using Hoechst and Rhodamine assays. The nickel complex, [NiL ], caused remarkable nuclear condensation and reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, molecular docking studies confirms that [NiL ] possesses significant binding efficiency with  kinase. Altogether, the results revealed that [NiL ] exhibits cytotoxicity against the  cells via  kinase-induced proapoptosis pathway. This study demonstrates that the [NiL ] complex could be a promising therapeutic agent against colorectal carcinoma.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776072>ToF-SIMS and principal component analysis of lipids and amino acids from inflamed and dysplastic human  mucosa.</a></h2><p>Here, time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and multivariate analysis were combined to study the role of ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in the  progression. ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC)  tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino acid composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, arachidonic, and linoleic acid. In the same way, differences in the amino acid composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, , methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino acid fragments. In this case, human  inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

We here investigated the expression and functional role of IL-34 in CRC. A more pronounced expression of IL-34 was seen in CRC samples as compared to matched normal/benign  samples and this occurred at both RNA and protein level. Immunohistochemical analysis of CRC tissue samples showed that both  cells and lamina propria mononuclear cells over-expressed IL-34. Additionally, CRC cells expressed both M-CSFR-1 and PTP-z, thus suggesting that CRC cells can be responsive to IL-34. Indeed, stimulation of DLD-1  cells with IL-34, but not with MSCF1, enhanced the cell proliferation and cell invasion without affecting cell survival. Analysis of intracellular signals underlying the mitogenic effect of IL-34 revealed that the cytokine enhanced activation of ERK1/2 and pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2 abrogated IL-34-driven cell proliferation. Consistently, IL-34 knockdown in HT-29 cells with a specific IL-34 antisense oligonucleotide reduced ERK1/2 activation, cell proliferation and enhanced the susceptibility of cells to Oxaliplatin-induced death. This is the first study showing up-regulation of IL-34 in CRC and suggesting a role for this cytokine in  tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31002949>Honokiol for  therapeutics: A traditional medicine that can modulate multiple oncogenic targets.</a></h2><p>In spite of billions of dollars expended on  research every year, the incidence rate and the mortality rate due to this widespread disease has increased drastically over the last few decades.

Synthetic drugs developed as chemotherapeutics have repeatedly shown adverse side effects and development of chemoresistance.  is basically a multifactorial disease that necessitates the modulation of multiple targets and oncogenic signaling pathways. Honokiol (CHO) is a biphenolic natural compound isolated from the leaves and barks of Magnolia plant species and has been extensively studied for its beneficial effects against several chronic diseases. Honokiol is capable of efficiently preventing the growth of wide variety of tumors such as those of brain, breast, cervical, , liver, lung, prostate, skin, and hematological malignancies. Recent work has shown that this phytochemical can modulate various molecular targets such as activation of pro-apoptotic factors, suppression of anti-apoptotic proteins and different transcription factors, downregulation of various enzymes, chemokines, cell surface adhesion molecules, and cell cycle proteins, and inhibition of activity of protein  kinases and serine/threonine kinases. Because of its pharmacological safety, honokiol can either be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of .

The aim of this study was firstly to examine the effect of hypoxia on the alternative splicing of  associated genes using the prostate  cell line PC3 as a model. Secondly, the effect of hypoxia on the expression of several regulators of splicing was examined.PC3 cells were grown in 1% oxygen in a hypoxic chamber for 48 h, RNA extracted and sent for high throughput PCR analysis at the RNomics platform at the University of Sherbrooke, Canada. Genes whose exon inclusion rate PSI (ψ) changed significantly were identified, and their altered exon inclusion rates verified by RT-PCR in three cell lines. The expression of splice factors and splice factor kinases in response to hypoxia was examined by qPCR and western blotting. The splice factor kinase CLK1 was inhibited with the benzothiazole TG003.In PC3 cells the exon inclusion rate PSI (ψ) was seen to change by > 25% in 12 -associated genes; MBP, APAF1, PUF60, SYNE2, CDC42BPA, FGFR10P, BTN2A2, UTRN, RAP1GDS1, PTPN13, TTC23 and CASP9 (caspase 9). The expression of the splice factors SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SAM68, HuR, hnRNPA1, and of the splice factor kinases SRPK1 and CLK1 increased significantly in hypoxia. We also observed that the splice factor kinase CLK3, but not CLK2 and CLK4, was also induced in hypoxic DU145 prostate, HT29  and MCF7 breast  cell lines. Lastly, we show that the inhibition of CLK1 in PC3 cells with the benzothiazole TG003 increased expression of the anti-apoptotic isoform caspase 9b.Significant changes in alternative splicing of  associated genes occur in prostate  cells in hypoxic conditions. The expression of several splice factors and splice factor kinases increases during hypoxia, in particular the Cdc-like splice factor kinases CLK1 and CLK3. We suggest that in hypoxia the elevated expression of these regulators of splicing helps cells adapt through alternative splicing of key -associated genes. We suggest that the CLK splice factor kinases could be targeted in cancers in which hypoxia contributes to resistance to therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29690619>Erythropoietin Intensifies the Proapoptotic Activity of LFM-A13 in Cells and in a Mouse Model of Colorectal .</a></h2><p>The Bruton&rsquo;s  kinase (BTK) inhibitor LFM-A13 has been widely employed as an antileukemic agent, but applications in solid  have been found recently. The compound promotes apoptosis, has an antiproliferative effect, and increases  cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. We decided to assess the impact of the simultaneous use of erythropoietin (Epo) and LFM-A13 on signal transduction in  DLD-1 and HT-29 cells, as well as in tumor xenografts. The induction of apoptosis by Epo and LFM-A-13 in the cells was confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and modulation of the expression of apoptotic protein BAX and antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 in  adenocarcinoma cells. Nude mice were inoculated with adenocarcinoma cells and treated with Epo and LFM-A13 in order to evaluate the degree of tumor regression. The simultaneous use of Epo and LFM-A13 severely inhibited cell growth, activated apoptosis, and also inhibited tumor growth in xenografts. The addition of Epo to LFM-A13 intensified the antiproliferative effect of LFM-A13, confirmed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the accumulation of apoptotic  cells with externalized phosphatidylserine (PS). These preclinical results suggest that the combination of Epo and LFM-A13 has a high proapoptotic activity and should be tested in the clinic for the treatment of solid tumors such as .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30918895>Cell-free DNA in the supernatant of pleural effusion can be used to detect driver and resistance mutations, and can guide  kinase inhibitor treatment decisions.</a></h2><p>Molecular profiling of tumours has become the mainstay of diagnostics for metastasised solid malignancies and guides personalised treatment, especially in nonsmall cell lung  (NSCLC). In current practice, it is often challenging to obtain sufficient tumour material for reliable molecular analysis. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood or other bio-sources could present an alternative approach to obtain genetic information from the tumour. In a retrospective cohort we analysed the added value of cfDNA analysis in pleural effusions for molecular profiling.We retrospectively analysed both the supernatant and the cell pellet of 44 pleural effusions sampled from 39 stage IV patients with  (n=23) or  (n=16) mutated tumours to detect the original driver mutation as well as for  T790M resistance mutations. Patients were diagnosed with either NSCLC (n=32),  carcinoma (n=4), appendiceal carcinoma (n=2) or adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (n=1). Samples collected in the context of routine clinical care were stored at the Netherlands  Institute biobank. We used droplet digital PCR for analysis.The driver mutation could be detected in 36 of the 44 pleural effusions by analysis of both the supernatant (35 out of 44 positive) and the cell pellet (31 out of 44 positive). In seven out of 20 pleural effusions from patients with  mutation-positive tumours, a T790M mutation was detected. All seven supernatants and cell pellets were positive.cfDNA in pleural effusion can be used to detect driver mutations as well as resistance mechanisms like  T790M in pleural effusion with high accuracy and is therefore a valuable bio-source.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989208>Targeting Wnt signaling pseudokinases in hematological cancers.</a></h2><p>Recent studies showed that several pseudokinases from the receptor  kinase family are important players in regulating  cell invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance, suggesting that targeting these proteins can play a therapeutic role in  treatment. Receptor Tyr kinase-like orphan receptors (RORs), protein Tyr kinase 7 (PTK7) (also called  carcinoma kinase 4 (CCK4)), and receptor-like Tyr kinase (RYK) are Wnt ligand binding receptors within the non-canonical Wnt signaling, with important roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and organogenesis. At the cellular level, these receptors transduce signals important for cell survival, migration, polarization, and chemotaxis. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in the field of pseudokinase signaling, improving our understanding of their structure-function mechanisms, and intracellular network of transduction components. Consequently, their role in various diseases, including , is now scrutinized for therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcome.

However, in the latter case, the mechanisms involved downstream of AT2R remain to be defined. We recently described a novel Caveolin-1(CAV1)/Ras-related protein 5A (Rab5)/Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) signaling axis that promotes metastasis in melanoma, , and breast  cells. Here, we evaluated whether the antimetastatic effect of AT2R is connected to inhibition of this pathway. We found that murine melanoma B16F10 cells expressed AT2R, while MDAMB-231 human breast  cells did not. AT2R activation blocked migration, transendothelial migration, and metastasis of B16F10(cav-1) cells, and this effect was lost when AT2R was silenced. Additionally, AT2R activation reduced transendothelial migration of A375 human melanoma cells expressing CAV1. The relevance of AT2R was further underscored by showing that overexpression of the AT2R in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased migration. Moreover, AT2R activation increased non-receptor protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity, decreased phosphorylation of CAV1 on -14 as well as Rab5/Rac1 activity, and reduced lung metastasis of B16F10(cav-1) cells in C57BL/6 mice. Thus, AT2R activation reduces migration, invasion, and metastasis of  cells by PTP1B-mediated CAV1 dephosphorylation and inhibition of the CAV1/Rab5/Rac-1 pathway. In doing so, these observations open up interesting, novel therapeutic opportunities to treat metastatic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342230>Metformin as an anti- agent: actions and mechanisms targeting  stem cells.</a></h2><p>Metformin, a first line medication for type II diabetes, initially entered the spotlight as a promising anti- agent due to epidemiologic reports that found reduced  risk and improved clinical outcomes in diabetic patients taking metformin. To uncover the anti- mechanisms of metformin, preclinical studies determined that metformin impairs cellular metabolism and suppresses oncogenic signaling pathways, including receptor  kinase, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR pathways. Recently, the anti- potential of metformin has gained increasing interest due to its inhibitory effects on  stem cells (CSCs), which are associated with tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Studies using various  models, including breast, pancreatic, prostate, and , have demonstrated the potency of metformin in attenuating CSCs through the targeting of specific pathways involved in cell differentiation, renewal, metastasis, and metabolism. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the anti- actions and mechanisms of metformin, including the regulation of CSCs and related pathways. We also discuss the potential anti- applications of metformin as mono- or combination therapies.© The Author 2017.

This study aims to investigate whether erlotinib inhibits distant metastasis of  by regulating TrkB and ERK signaling pathway. Human  adenocarcinoma cell lines (SW480 and Caco-2) pretreated with exogenous C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) were used to assess the suppressive effect of erlotinib on tumor metastasis, including anoikis, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), migration, and invasion. Through TrkB overexpression, Akt suppression, and ERK suppression, the roles of TrkB, Akt, and ERK in erlotinib-induced metastasis inhibition of  cells were explored. The results showed that erlotinib alleviated CXCL8-induced metastasis of the  cells. Overexpression of TrkB in  cells eliminated the effect of erlotinib on anoikis, inhibition of EMT, migration, and invasion, and downregulation of p-ERK and p-Akt. Furthermore, the inhibition of ERK activation instead of Akt activation was found to participate in erlotinib-mediated metastasis resistance, including anoikis, inhibition of EMT, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, erlotinib inhibits  cell anoikis resistance, EMT, migration, and invasion by inactivating TrkB-dependent ERK signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29620050>Pharmacokinetics and disposition of anlotinib, an oral  kinase inhibitor, in experimental animal species.</a></h2><p>Anlotinib is a new oral  kinase inhibitor; this study was designed to characterize its pharmacokinetics and disposition. Anlotinib was evaluated in rats, tumor-bearing mice, and dogs and also assessed in vitro to characterize its pharmacokinetics and disposition and drug interaction potential. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Anlotinib, having good membrane permeability, was rapidly absorbed with oral bioavailability of 28%-58% in rats and 41%-77% in dogs. Terminal half-life of anlotinib in dogs (22.8±11.0 h) was longer than that in rats (5.1±1.6 h). This difference appeared to be mainly associated with an interspecies difference in total plasma clearance (rats, 5.35±1.31 L·h·kg; dogs, 0.40±0.06 L·h/kg). Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism was probably the major elimination pathway. Human CYP3A had the greatest metabolic capability with other human P450s playing minor roles. Anlotinib exhibited large apparent volumes of distribution in rats (27.6±3.1 L/kg) and dogs (6.6±2.5 L/kg) and was highly bound in rat (97%), dog (96%), and human plasma (93%). In human plasma, anlotinib was predominantly bound to albumin and lipoproteins, rather than to α-acid glycoprotein or γ-globulins. Concentrations of anlotinib in various tissue homogenates of rat and in those of tumor-bearing mouse were significantly higher than the associated plasma concentrations. Anlotinib exhibited limited in vitro potency to inhibit many human P450s, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and transporters, except for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 (in vitro half maximum inhibitory concentrations, <1 μmol/L). Based on early reported human pharmacokinetics, drug interaction indices were 0.16 for CYP3A4 and 0.02 for CYP2C9, suggesting that anlotinib had a low propensity to precipitate drug interactions on these enzymes. Anlotinib exhibits many pharmacokinetic characteristics similar to other  kinase inhibitors, except for terminal half-life, interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and plasma protein binding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297055>Targeting the Eph/Ephrin System as Anti-Inflammatory Strategy in IBD.</a></h2><p>Besides their long-known critical role in embryonic growth and in  development and progression, erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma type B (EphB) receptor  kinases and their ephrin-B ligands are involved in the modulation of immune responses and in remodeling and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial layer. These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory-based disorders of the gut, like inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated inflammatory responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the . Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal inflammatory disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972278>SHP2 inhibition triggers anti-tumor immunity and synergizes with PD-1 blockade.</a></h2><p> phosphatase SHP2 is a promising drug target in  immunotherapy due to its bidirectional role in both tumor growth promotion and T-cell inactivation.

To address this, a CT-26  xenograft model was established in mice since this cell line is insensitive to SHP099. Consequently, SHP099 minimally affected CT-26 tumor growth in immuno-deficient nude mice, but significantly decreased the tumor burden in CT-26 tumor-bearing mice with intact immune system. SHP099 augmented anti-tumor immunity, as shown by the elevated proportion of CD8IFN-  T cells and the upregulation of cytotoxic T-cell related genes including , which decreased the tumor load. In addition, tumor growth in mice with SHP2-deficient T-cells was markedly slowed down because of enhanced anti-tumor responses. Finally, the combination of SHP099 and anti-PD-1 antibody showed a higher therapeutic efficacy than either monotherapy in controlling tumor growth in two  xenograft models, indicating that these agents complement each other.

Osimertinib was started as seventh-line therapy. Follow-up computed tomography on the 97th day after osimertinib administration incidentally demonstrated intra-mural air in the transverse , as well as intrahepatic portal vein gas. Pneumatosis intestinalis and portal vein gas improved by fasting and temporary interruption of osimertinib.

SAP-1 is known to maintain the balance of phosphorylation of proteins together with protein kinases; however, its biological function and impact on pharmacokinetics in the intestine remain unclear. The present study, therefore, aimed at clarifying the relationship between SAP-1 and the intestinal absorption behaviors of typical transporter substrates and macromolecules. The endogenous levels of glucose and total cholesterol in the blood were similar between wild-type and SAP-1-deficient mice (Sap1), suggesting no contribution of SAP-1 to biogenic influx. Moreover, in vitro transport study with everted ileal sacs demonstrated that there was no difference in the absorption of breast  resistance protein, P-glycoprotein, and peptide transporter substrates between both mice. However, absorptive clearance of macromolecular model dextrans (FD-4 and FD-10) in Sap1 mice was significantly higher than that in wild-type mice, and this was confirmed by the trend of increased FD-4 absorption from  loops of Sap1 mice. Therefore, the results of this study suggest the partial contribution of SAP-1 to the regulated transport of hydrophilic macromolecules through paracellular tight junctions.Copyright © 2017 American Pharmacists Association®.

However, few genetic or epigenetic alterations have been found in TAFs during the progression of solid tumors. Employing a tumor-stromal cell co-injection model, we adapted here retroviral-insertional mutagenesis to stromal cells to identify novel tumor-associated genes in TAFs. We successfully identified 20 gene candidates that might modulate tumor growth if altered in TAFs at genomic level. To validate our finding, the function of one of the candidate genes, tubulin  ligase (), was further studied in TAFs from fibrosarcoma, , breast and hepatocarcinoma. We demonstrated that down-regulated  expression in TAFs indeed promoted tumor growth in mice. Interestingly, decreased expression of  in tumor stromal cells also correlated with poor outcome in human  carcinoma.

PTPH1 expression was upregulated in 58.21% (39/67) and downregulated in the rest of tumor specimens, and it correlated with ER, PR, and HER2/neu statuses with p values of <0.0001, 0.0113, and 0.0448, respectively. Additionally, we found that the 2 kb region upstream of PTPH1 gene harbored CpG sites within, and was ubiquitously methylated in breast  (n = 13),  tissue (n = 1), uterine  tissue (n = 1), normal breast tissue (n = 1) in addition to Hela and MCF7 cell lines. In conclusion, our data showed a strong correlation of the PTPH1 status with the ER and ubiquitous nature of PTPH1 promoter methylation at specific CpG sites irrespective of  types and protein expression. Our findings underscore the clinical relevance of PTPH1 expression in Indian patients and warrant additional studies to explore the importance of ubiquitously methylated promoter at specific CpG sites in upstream of the PTPH1 gene.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327152>TRIM8 restores p53 tumour suppressor function by blunting N-MYC activity in chemo-resistant tumours.</a></h2><p>TRIM8 plays a key role in controlling the p53 molecular switch that sustains the transcriptional activation of cell cycle arrest genes and response to chemotherapeutic drugs. The mechanisms that regulate TRIM8, especially in cancers like clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) and colorectal  (CRC) where it is low expressed, are still unknown. However, recent studies suggest the potential involvement of some microRNAs belonging to miR-17-92 and its paralogous clusters, which could include TRIM8 in a more complex pathway.We used RCC and CRC cell models for in-vitro experiments, and ccRCC patients and xenograft transplanted mice for in vivo assessments. To measure microRNAs levels we performed RT-qPCR, while steady-states of TRIM8, p53, p21 and N-MYC were quantified at protein level by Western Blotting as well as at transcript level by RT-qPCR. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess the interaction between TRIM8 and specific miRNAs, and the potential effects of this interaction on TRIM8 expression. Moreover, we treated our cell models with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or  kinase inhibitors, and measured their response in terms of cell proliferation by MTT and colony suppression assays.We showed that TRIM8 is a target of miR-17-5p and miR-106b-5p, whose expression is promoted by N-MYC, and that alterations of their levels affect cell proliferation, acting on the TRIM8 transcripts stability, as confirmed in ccRCC patients and cell lines. In addition, reducing the levels of miR-17-5p/miR-106b-5p, we increased the chemo-sensitivity of RCC/CRC-derived cells to anti-tumour drugs used in the clinic. Intriguingly, this occurs, on one hand, by recovering the p53 tumour suppressor activity in a TRIM8-dependent fashion and, on the other hand, by promoting the transcription of miR-34a that turns off the oncogenic action of N-MYC. This ultimately leads to cell proliferation reduction or block, observed also in  xenografts overexpressing TRIM8.In this paper we provided evidence that TRIM8 and its regulators miR-17-5p and miR-106b-5 participate to a feedback loop controlling cell proliferation through the reciprocal modulation of p53, miR-34a and N-MYC. Our experiments pointed out that this axis is pivotal in defining drug responsiveness of cancers such ccRCC and CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523434>The calcium-sensing receptor: A novel target for treatment and prophylaxis of neratinib-induced diarrhea.</a></h2><p>Diarrhea is one of the most commonly reported adverse effect of hemotherapy and targeted  therapies, such as  kinase inhibitors (TKI), which often significantly impact patient quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-HER  kinase inhibitor, which is clinically active in HER2-positive breast . Diarrhea is the most common side effect of this potent anticancer drug and the reasons for this adverse effect are still largely unclear. We have recently shown that activation of the calcium-sensing Receptor (CaSR) can inhibit secretagogue-induced diarrhea in the , therefore we hypothesized that CaSR activation may also mitigate neratinib-induced diarrhea. Using an established ex vivo model of isolated intestinal segments, we investigated neratinib-induced fluid secretion and the ability of CaSR activation to abate the secretion. In our study, individual segments of the rat intestine (proximal, middle, distal small intestine, and ) were procured and perfused intraluminally with various concentrations of neratinib (10, 50, 100 nmol L). In a second set of comparison experiments, intraluminal calcium concentration was modulated (from 1.0 to 5.0 or 7.0 mmol L), both pre- and during neratinib exposure. In a separate series of experiments R-568, a known calcimimetic was used CaSR activation and effect was compared to elevated Ca concentration (5.0 and 7.0 mmol L). As a result, CaSR activation with elevated Ca concentration (5.0 and 7.0 mmol L) or R-568 markedly reduced neratinib-induced fluid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-exposure to elevated luminal calcium solutions (5.0 and 7.0 mmol L) also prevented neratinib-induced fluid secretion. In conclusion, exposure to luminal neratinib resulted in a pronounced elevation in fluid secretion in the rat intestine. Increasing luminal calcium inhibits the neratinib-associated fluid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that CaSR activation may be a potent therapeutic target to reduce chemotherapy-associated diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28854418>A Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Erinacine A's Inhibition of Gastric  Cell Viability and Invasiveness.</a></h2><p>Background / Aims: Erinacine A, isolated from the ethanol extract of the Hericium erinaceus mycelium, has been demonstrated as a new alternative anticancer medicine. Drawing upon current research, this study presents an investigation of the molecular mechanism of erinacine A inhibition associated with gastric  cell growth.Cell viability was determined by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and migration using a Boyden chamber assay to determine the effects of erinacine A treatment on the proliferation capacity and invasiveness of gastric  cells. A proteomic assay provided information that was used to identify the differentially-expressed proteins following erinacine A treatment, as well as the mechanism of its targets in the apoptotic induction of erinacine A.Our results demonstrate that erinacine A treatment of TSGH 9201 cells increased cytotoxicity and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as decreased the invasiveness. Treatment of TSGH 9201 cells with erinacine A resulted in the activation of caspases and the expression of TRAIL. Erinacine A induction of apoptosis was accompanied by sustained phosphorylation of FAK/AKT/p70S6K and the PAK1 pathways, as well as the generation of ROS. Furthermore, the induction of apoptosis and anti-invasion properties by erinacine A could involve the differential expression of the 14-3-3 sigma protein (1433S) and microtubule-associated tumor suppressor candidate 2 (MTUS2), with the activation of the FAK/AKT/p70S6K and PAK1 signaling pathways.These results lead us to speculate that erinacine A may generate an apoptotic cascade in TSGH 9201 cells by activating the FAK/AKT/p70S6K/PAK1 pathway and upregulating proteins 1433S and MTUS2, providing a new mechanism underlying the anti- effects of erinacine A in human gastric  cells.© 2017 The Author(s).

Few than 250 cases have been reported in the urinary bladder till January 2019. In this paper, a case series of unusual gastrointestinal carcinomas with plasmacytoid morphology was included. Only one similar case of the stomach was previously published and no such cases were found in .We present the complex immunoprofile, using a panel of 39 biomarkers, of the largest group of primary gastrointestinal carcinomas with plasmacytoid morphology reported in literature (one from upper rectum and six from stomach).All of the seven cases showed lymph node metastases and only one survived over 25 weeks after surgical excision. The indicators of aggressivity were age (over 60), advanced stage (from IIIA to IV), E-cadherin negativity, and vimentin positivity. The immunoprofile indicated unfavorable prognosis for mesenchymal-type carcinomas (negativity for E-cadherin and positivity for vimentin, with membrane to nuclear translocation or negativity of -catenin). The survivor showed an "epithelial-type adenocarcinoma with plasmacytoid dedifferentiation", with membrane positivity for E-cadherin and -catenin and vimentin negativity. All of the cases expressed c-MET and were negative for HER-2.Primary carcinoma with plasmacytoid morphology is a dedifferentiated variant of adenocarcinoma or poorly cohesive carcinomas. Vimentin positive dedifferentiated-poorly cohesive carcinomas should be considered as mesenchymal-type highly malignant carcinomas.

However, further clarification is required to determine if SphK1 promotes the metastasis of colorectal  by inducing epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to detect protein expression in normal  mucosa tissues and colorectal  tissues. Cells were transfected to overexpress SphK1, downregulate SphK1 or downregulate FAK. An MTT assay was used to detect the drug toxicity to cells. Transwell and wound healing assays were used to detect cell migration ability. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of mRNA and protein, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the microvilli and pseudopodia of the cells. The analysis of protein expression in 114 human colorectal  tissues demonstrated that the expressions of SphK1, FAK, phosphorylated (p)‑FAK, E‑cadherin and vimentin were associated with the metastasis of colorectal . Furthermore, the patients with colorectal  with SphK1‑positive  demonstrated poorer prognosis compared with SphK1‑negative . FAK knockdown and SphK1 knockdown of human  RKO cells inhibited the EMT and migrational potency, along with the expression of p‑FAK, p‑protein kinase B (AKT) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9. In contrast, SphK1 overexpression promoted EMT, migrational potency, and the expression of p‑FAK, p‑AKT and MMP2/9 in HT29 cells. Additionally, the EMT and migrational potency of SphK1‑overexpressing HT29 cells was suppressed by a FAK inhibitor, and the expression of p‑FAK, p‑AKT and MMP2/9 was suppressed by blocking the FAK pathway. In conclusion, SphK1 promoted the migration and metastasis of  by inducing EMT mediated by the FAK/AKT/MMPs axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30319552>The Anti-tumoral Properties of Orexin/Hypocretin Hypothalamic Neuropeptides: An Unexpected Therapeutic Role.</a></h2><p>Orexins (OxA and OxB) also termed hypocretins are hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in central nervous system (CNS) to control the sleep/wake process which is mediated by two G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, OX1R, and OX2R. Beside these central effects, orexins also play a role in various peripheral organs such as the intestine, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidney, adipose tissue and reproductive tract.In the past few years, an unexpected anti-tumoral role of orexins mediated by a new signaling pathway involving the presence of two immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in both orexin receptors subtypes, the recruitment of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis has been elucidated.

Originally identified as a gene upregulated in , it was later shown to regulate planar cell polarity (PCP) and directional cell movement. PTK7 is a Wnt co-receptor; however, its role in Wnt signaling remains controversial. Here, we find evidence that places PTK7 at the intersection of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways. In presence of canonical Wnt ligands PTK7 is subject to caveolin-mediated endocytosis, while it is unaffected by non-canonical Wnt ligands. PTK7 endocytosis is dependent on the presence of the PTK7 co-receptor Fz7 (also known as Fzd7) and results in lysosomal degradation of PTK7. As we previously observed that PTK7 activates non-canonical PCP Wnt signaling but inhibits canonical Wnt signaling, our data suggest a mutual inhibition of canonical and PTK7 Wnt signaling. PTK7 likely suppresses canonical Wnt signaling by binding canonical Wnt ligands thereby preventing their interaction with Wnt receptors that would otherwise support canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, if canonical Wnt proteins interact with the PTK7 receptor, they induce its internalization and degradation.© 2017.

Analysis of diverse drug data on ~990  cell lines revealed enhanced sensitivity of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/ Insulin Receptor (IGF-1R/IR)  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in  cells. Interestingly, β-catenin/TCF(T cell factor)-responsive promoter activity exhibited a significant positive association with IGF-1R/IR TKI response, while the mutational status of direct upstream genes, such as CTNNB1 and APC, was not significantly associated with the response. The β-catenin/TCF activity high cell lines express components of IGF-1R/IR signaling more than the low cell lines explaining their enhanced sensitivity against IGF-1R/IR TKI. Reinforcing β-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity by introducing CTNNB1 gain-of-function mutations into IGF-1R/IR TKI-resistant cells increased the expression and activity of IGF-1R/IR signaling components and also sensitized the cells to IGF-1R/IR TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of TCGA data revealed that the stronger β-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity was associated with higher IGF-1R and IGF2 transcription in human  specimens as well. Collectively, compared to the mutational status of upstream genes, β-catenin/TCF responsive promoter activity has potential to be a stronger predictive positive biomarker for IGF-1R/IR TKI responses in  cells. The present study highlights the potential of transcriptional activity as therapeutic biomarkers for targeted therapies, overcoming the limited ability of upstream genetic mutations to predict responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28437395>Global survey of the immunomodulatory potential of common drugs.</a></h2><p>Small-molecule drugs may complement antibody-based therapies in an immune-oncology setting, yet systematic methods for the identification and characterization of the immunomodulatory properties of these entities are lacking. We surveyed the immumomodulatory potential of 1,402 small chemical molecules, as defined by their ability to alter the cell-cell interactions among peripheral mononuclear leukocytes ex vivo, using automated microscopy and population-wide single-cell image analysis. Unexpectedly, ∼10% of the agents tested affected these cell-cell interactions differentially. The results accurately recapitulated known immunomodulatory drug classes and revealed several clinically approved drugs that unexpectedly harbor the ability to modulate the immune system, which could potentially contribute to their physiological mechanism of action. For instance, the kinase inhibitor crizotinib promoted T cell interactions with monocytes, as well as with  cells, through inhibition of the receptor  kinase MSTR1 and subsequent upregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules.

In the present study, we propose that paroxetine can be used as a potent anticancer drug. Paroxetine, one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been widely prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Recently, SSRIs have been reported to have anticancer activity in various types of  cells; however, the underlying mechanisms of their action are not yet known. In this study, we investigated the potential anticancer effect of paroxetine in human colorectal  cells, HCT116 and HT-29. Treatment with paroxetine reduced cell viability, which was associated with marked increase in apoptosis, in both the cell lines. Also, paroxetine effectively inhibited colony formation and 3D spheroid formation. We speculated that the mode of action of paroxetine might be through the inhibition of two major receptor  kinases - MET and ERBB3 - leading to the suppression of AKT, ERK and p38 activation and induction of JNK and caspase-3 pathways.

In this study, we revealed the mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of panitumumab/TAS-102 combination using preclinical models. Panitumumab/FTD cotreatment showed additive antiproliferative effects in LIM1215 and synergistic antiproliferative effects in SW48  cells. Consistent with the in vitro effects, panitumumab/TAS-102 combination caused tumor regression in LIM1215 and COL-01-JCK  patient-derived xenograft models. In LIM1215 cells, FTD induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/protein kinase B (AKT)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and subsequent serine/threonine phosphorylation of EGFR, while it had no effects on EGFR  phosphorylation. Panitumumab and the  kinase inhibitor erlotinib reduced the basal level of EGFR  phosphorylation and reversed FTD-induced ERK/AKT/STAT3 and EGFR serine/threonine phosphorylation. These results suggested that FTD in combination with the basal activity of EGFR  kinase induced downstream prosurvival signaling through ERK/AKT/STAT3 phosphorylation. Collectively, we propose that panitumumab interacts with FTD by targeting EGFR-mediated adaptive responses, thereby exerting anticancer effects when used in combination with TAS-102.

The membrane-associated, intracellular protein  phosphatase PTP4A3 is overexpressed in human colorectal  and contributes to cell migration and invasion. To interrogate further the role of PTP4A3 in colorectal  cell migration and invasion, we deleted the Ptp4a3 gene from murine colorectal tumor cells.

Eleven extracts were tested: red (RG) and purple grape, purple sweet potato, purple carrot, black and purple bean, black lentil (BL), black peanut, sorghum (SH), black rice, and blue wheat. HCT-116 and HT-29 inhibition correlated with total phenolics (r=0.87 and 0.77, respectively), delphinidin-3-O-glucoside concentration with HT-29 inhibition (r=0.69). The concentration inhibition fifty (IC) for BL, SH, RG on HT-29 and HCT-116 cell proliferation ranged 0.9-2.0mg/mL. Extracts decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (survivin, cIAP-2, XIAP), induced apoptosis, and arrested cells in G1. Anthocyanins exhibited  kinase inhibitory potential in silico and biochemically; cyanidin-3-O-glucoside had one of the highest binding affinities with all kinases, especially ABL1 (-8.5kcal/mol). Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside inhibited EGFR (IC=0.10 and 2.37µM, respectively). Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was the most potent anthocyanin on kinase inhibition.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Results and Method: While the pyrazolo hybrid compounds (14a-f) showed good activity against HEPG-2, MCF- 7 and HCT-116 cell lines (IC50 = 3.65 - 39.98, 1.45 - 54.19 and 2.00 - 50.6 µM respectively) in comparison with doxorubicin (IC50 = 5.66, 2.60 and 8.48 µM respectively), the triazolo derivatives (17, 19) showed considerable potency (IC50 = 22.20 - 54.61, 14.98 - 88.78, and 10.79 - 53.40 µM respectively), the oxadiazolo hybrid compound (16, IC50 = 149.91, 115.89 and 110.07 µM respectively) and phthalimido hybrid compound (20, IC50 = 96.02, 131.19 and 120.36 µM respectively) showed low potency. The pyrazolo derivative (14d, IC50 = 3.65, 1.45 and 2.00 µM) was the most potent among all compounds against HEPG-2, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines respectively. Also, the hybrid pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives were evaluated for their inhibitory activity to epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase (EGFR-TK) and they showed a good inhibitory activity (IC50 = 8.27 - 19.03 µM). With the exception of the pyrazolo derivative (14c, IC50 = 18.82 µM), the inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK was consistent with the in vitro cytotoxic activity against HEPG-2, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines.The newly synthesized compounds showed good activity against HEPG-2, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines in comparison with the reference drug doxorubicin.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171197>Molecular characterization of cancers with NTRK gene fusions.</a></h2><p>Targeted inhibitors of neurotropic  kinases are highly effective in selected patients with gene fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3. These fusions are consistently detected in rare  types (e.g., secretory breast carcinoma and congenital infantile fibrosarcoma), but the occurrence of NTRK fusions in common cancers and their relationship to other therapy biomarkers are largely unexplored. Tissue samples from 11,502 patients were analyzed for 53 gene fusions and sequencing of 592 genes, along with an immunohistochemical evaluation of TrkA/B/C and PD-L1. Thirty-one cases (0.27% of the entire cohort) had NTRK fusions. The most common fusions were ETV6:NTRK3 (n = 10) and TPM3:NTRK1 (n = 6). Gliomas had the highest number of NTRK fusions (14/982, 1.4%), most commonly involving NTRK2 (n = 9). Seventeen non-glioma cases with NTRK fusions included carcinomas of the lungs, thyroid, breast, cervix, , nasal cavity,  of unknown primary and soft tissue sarcomas. Strong and uniform Trk expression detected with a pan-Trk immunohistochemistry characterized 7/8 NTRK1 fusion cases and 8/9 NTRK2 fusion cases, while NTRK3 fused cases were positive in 6/11 (55%) of cases. 29% of NTRK fusion cases had no other pathogenic genomic alteration. PD-L1 expression was observed in 23% of NTRK fused cases while high tumor DNA microsatellite instability was detected in two cases. We confirm the rarity of NTRK genes fusions outside the brain malignancies. NTRK inhibitors alone or combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors may be a therapeutic option for a substantial proportion of these patients. Strategies for detection of the NTRK fusion-driven cancers may include immunohistochemistry, but gene fusion detection remains the most reliable tool.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581735>Reverting doxorubicin resistance in  by targeting a key signaling protein, steroid receptor coactivator.</a></h2><p>Although there have been notable improvements in treatments against , further research is required. In , nearly all patients eventually experience drug resistance and stop responding to the approved drugs, making treatment difficult. Steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) is an oncogenic nuclear receptor coactivator that serves an important role in drug resistance. The present study generated a doxorubicin-resistant  cell line, in which the upregulation/activation of SRC was responsible for drug resistance, which in turn activated AKT. Overexpression of receptor  kinase-like epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor also induced SRC expression. It was observed that doxorubicin resistance in  also induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a decrease in expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and an increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers, including N-cadherin and vimentin. Additionally, the present study indicated that SRC acts as a common signaling node, and inhibiting SRC in combination with doxorubicin treatment in doxorubicin-resistant cells aids in reversing the resistance. Thus, the present study suggests that activation of SRC is responsible for doxorubicin resistance in . However, further research is required to understand the complete mechanism of how drug resistance occurs and how it may be tackled to treat patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29552223>Yellow and green pigments from  L. seed oil induce cell death in  and lung  cells.</a></h2><p>Natural compounds have been candidates for anticancer medicine over the last 20 years. During the process of isolating seed oil from  L., yellow and green pigments containing multiple compounds with an aromatic structure were identified. High-performance liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of these pigments revealed that the compounds present were identical, but the concentration of the compounds was different. Treatment with the pigments was able to induce the death of DLD-1 human  cells and increase the percentage of the cells in the sub-G and sub-G/M phases in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the pigments were able to exhibit cytotoxic activity on A549 and H1975 human non-small cell lung  (NSCLC) cell lines at 24 h, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC) values of 0.1206 and 0.0676%, respectively for green pigments, and 0.0434 and 0.0501%, respectively for yellow pigments. Furthermore, a decrease in IC value was associated with an increase in the duration of treatment. However, a sharp decrease in IC value of the yellow pigment was observed for H1975 cells at 48 h and for A549 cells at 72 h compared with no change in IC value for the green pigment with time, suggesting that the pigments function and induce cell death differently in the two cell lines. An investigation was performed into the synergistic effect of the green pigment and gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839), which is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor- kinase inhibitor to block growth factor-mediated cell proliferation. The combination of the green pigment and gefitinib resulted in an enhancement of the decrease in viability of A549 and H1975 cells compared with treatment with gefitinib alone, which suggested that treatment with the green pigments was able to enhance the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to gefitinib. In conclusion, these pigments may be considered for development as anti- agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231806>Imatinib increases oxygen delivery in extracellular matrix-rich but not in matrix-poor experimental carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Imatinib causes increased turnover of stromal collagen, reduces collagen fibril diameter, enhances extracellular fluid turnover and lowers interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in the human  carcinoma KAT-4/HT-29 (KAT-4) xenograft model.We compared the effects of imatinib on oxygen levels, vascular morphology and IFP in three experimental tumor models differing in their content of a collagenous extracellular matrix.Neither the KAT4 and CT-26  carcinoma models, nor B16BB melanoma expressed PDGF β-receptors in the malignant cells. KAT-4 tumors exhibited a well-developed ECM in contrast to the other two model systems. The collagen content was substantially higher in KAT-4 than in CT-26, while collagen was not detectable in B16BB tumors. The pO was on average 5.4, 13.9 and 19.3 mmHg in KAT-4, CT-26 and B16BB tumors, respectively. Treatment with imatinib resulted in similar pO-levels in all three tumor models but only in KAT-4 tumors did the increase reach statistical significance. It is likely that after imatinib treatment the increase in pO in KAT-4 tumors is caused by increased blood flow due to reduced vascular resistance. This notion is supported by the significant reduction observed in IFP in KAT-4 tumors after imatinib treatment. Vessel area varied between 4.5 and 7% in the three tumor models and was not affected by imatinib treatment. Imatinib had no effect on the fraction of proliferating cells, whereas the fraction of apoptotic cells increased to a similar degree in all three tumor models.Our data suggest that the effects of imatinib on pO-levels depend on a well-developed ECM and provide further support to the suggestion that imatinib acts by causing interstitial stroma cells to produce a less dense ECM, which would in turn allow for an increased blood flow. The potential of imatinib treatment to render solid tumors more accessible to conventional treatments would therefore depend on the degree of tumor desmoplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032643>Lenvatinib: A Promising Molecular Targeted Agent for Multiple Cancers.</a></h2><p>Lenvatinib is a small-molecule  kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and rearranged during transfection (RET). These receptors are important for tumor angiogenesis, and lenvatinib inhibits tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting function of these receptors.

Lenvatinib is a promising drug that has shown therapeutic effects against various solid tumors. Adverse events, such as hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, and delayed wound healing, can occur with lenvatinib treatment. Managing these adverse events is also important for the use of lenvatinib.

During a screen for new actionable targets in drug-resistant tumours we recently identified p65BTK - a novel oncogenic isoform of Bruton's  kinase. Studying three different cohorts of patients here we show that p65BTK expression correlates with histotype and  progression. Using drug-resistant TP53-null  cells as a model we demonstrated that p65BTK silencing or chemical inhibition overcame the 5-fluorouracil resistance of CRC cell lines and patient-derived organoids and significantly reduced the growth of xenografted tumours. Mechanistically, we show that blocking p65BTK in drug-resistant cells abolished a 5-FU-elicited TGFB1 protective response and triggered E2F-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that targeting p65BTK restores the apoptotic response to chemotherapy of drug-resistant CRCs and gives a proof-of-concept for suggesting the use of BTK inhibitors in combination with 5-FU as a novel therapeutic approach in CRC patients.

Three cascades that contribute to oncogenic potential are those mediated by Wnt proteins and the receptor Frizzled (FZD), growth factor receptor  kinases (RTKs), and heterotrimeric G proteins and associated GPCRs. Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the G protein G Daple also binds to FZD and the Wnt/FZD mediator Dishevelled (Dvl), and it enhances β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling in response to Wnt5a-FZD7 signaling. We identified Daple as a substrate of multiple RTKs and non-RTKs and, hence, as a point of convergence for the three cascades. We found that phosphorylation near the Dvl-binding motif in Daple by both RTKs and non-RTKs caused Daple/Dvl complex dissociation and augmented the ability of Daple to bind to and activate G, which potentiated β-catenin-independent Wnt signals and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) similarly to Wnt5a/FZD7 signaling. Although Daple acts as a tumor suppressor in the healthy , the concurrent increased abundance of Daple and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal tumors was associated with poor patient prognosis. Thus, the Daple-dependent activation of G and the Daple-dependent enhancement of β-catenin-independent Wnt signals are not only stimulated by Wnt5a/FZD7 to suppress tumorigenesis but also hijacked by growth factor-activated RTKs to enhance tumor progression. These findings identify a cross-talk paradigm among growth factor RTKs, heterotrimeric G proteins, and the Wnt/FZD pathway in .Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Although fluorescence dyes or genetically encoded biosensors have been developed, CL is still used due to its high sensitivity, ease of use, and low cost. While initially established and used to measure high levels of ROS in phagocytic cells, CL assays are not ideal for measuring low levels of ROS. Here, we developed a newly modified CL assay using a chemiluminescent imaging system for measuring low concentrations of ROS in nonphagocytic cells. We found that dissolving luminol in NaOH, rather than DMSO, increased the HO-induced CL signal and that the addition of 4-iodophenylboronic acid (4IPBA) further increased CL intensity. Our new system also increased the rate and intensity of the CL signal in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) treated HT-29  cells compared to those in luminol only. We were able to quantify ROS levels from both cells and media in parallel using an HO standard. A significant benefit to our system is that we can easily measure stimulus-induced ROS formation in a real-time manner and also investigate intracellular signaling pathways from a single sample simultaneously. We found that PMA induced  phosphorylation of protein  kinases (PTKs), such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein  kinase 2 (Pyk2), and Src, and increased actin stress fiber formation in a ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) reduced the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of these PTKs, implicating a potential role in cellular ROS signaling. Thus, our newly optimized CL assay using 4IPBA and a chemiluminescent imaging method provides a simple, real-time, and low-cost method for the quantification of low levels of ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290648>Relation of the IGF/IGF1R system to autophagy in colitis and colorectal .</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS), as a chronic inflammatory disorder has a potential role in the development of inflammatory and cancerous complications of the  tissue. The interaction of DNA damage and inflammation is affected by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway. The IGF1R pathway has been reported to regulate autophagy, as well, but sometimes through a bidirectional context. Targeting the IGF1R-autophagy crosstalk could represent a promising strategy for the development of new antiinflammatory and anticancer therapies, and may help for subjects suffering from MetS who are at increased risk of colorectal . However, therapeutic responses to targeted therapies are often shortlived, since a signaling crosstalk of IGF1R with other receptor  kinases or autophagy exists, leading to acquired cellular resistance to therapy. From a pharmacological point of view, it is attractive to speculate that synergistic beneﬁts could be achieved by inhibition of one of the key effectors of the IGF1R pathway, in parallel with the pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy machinery, but cautiousness is also required, because pharmacologic IGF1R modulation can initiate additional, sometimes unfavorable biologic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101300>Pharmacoproteomic characterisation of human  and rectal .</a></h2><p>Most molecular  therapies act on protein targets but data on the proteome status of patients and cellular models for proteome-guided pre-clinical drug sensitivity studies are only beginning to emerge.

Integration with proteomes of 90 CRC patients and matched transcriptomics data defined integrated CRC subtypes, highlighting cell lines representative of each tumour subtype. Modelling the responses of 52 CRC cell lines to 577 drugs as a function of proteome profiles enabled predicting drug sensitivity for cell lines and patients. Among many novel associations, MERTK was identified as a predictive marker for resistance towards MEK1/2 inhibitors and immunohistochemistry of 1,074 CRC tumours confirmed MERTK as a prognostic survival marker. We provide the proteomic and pharmacological data as a resource to the community to, for example, facilitate the design of innovative prospective clinical trials.© 2017 The Authors.

This triggers downstream signaling related to proliferation and apoptosis resistance as well as other physiological processes. Many molecular alterations of the receptor and its ligands, specially FGF19, have been reported in several types of , with special relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, these have also been detected in other solid malignancies, including lung, breast, or , among others.This review covers patent literature on specific FGFR4 inhibitors and their applications, published from 2007 to June 2018.FGFR4 inhibition has gained relevance in oncology. A considerable number of patents disclosing different approaches to inhibit this receptor have been reported, displaying promising preclinical results for different  models. Currently, the safety and preliminary efficacy of several small molecule inhibitors targeting FGFR4 are under early phase clinical assessment, mainly in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

However, the C604Y mutation has been linked to acquired resistance. Recently, three potential small-molecule inhibitors of Mps1 (i.e., reversine, NMS-P715, and its derivative Cpd-5) were reported for the C604Y mutation that exhibit significant resistance to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5, but retain affinity for reversine. In this study, classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, accelerated MD (aMD) simulations, and umbrella sampling (US) simulations were performed to illustrate the resistance mechanisms of inhibitors to Mps1. The classical MD simulations combined with free energy calculations revealed that reversine features similar binding affinity characteristics to both Mps1 and Mps1, but both NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 feature much higher binding affinities to Mps1 than to Mps1. The major variations were shown to be controlled by electrostatic energy and the conformational change of A-loop-induced entropy increased. The large conformational changes of Mps1 bound to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 were also observed in aMD simulations. The US simulation results further suggest that reversine and Cpd-5 both exhibit similar dissociation processes from both Mps1 and Mps1, but Cpd-5 and NMS-P715 were found to dissociate more easily from Mps1 than from Mps1, thus a reduced residence time was responsible for the inhibitors resistance to the C604Y mutation. The physical principles provided by the present study may provide important clues for the discovery and rational design of novel inhibitors to combat the C604Y mutation of Mps1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857489>NSC 95397 Suppresses Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in  Cells through MKP-1 and the ERK1/2 Pathway.</a></h2><p>NSC 95397, a quinone-based small molecule compound, has been identified as an inhibitor for dual-specificity phosphatases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). MKP-1 is known to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases by dephosphorylating both of their threonine and  residues. Moreover, owing to their participation in tumorigenesis and drug resistance in  cells, MKP-1 is an attractive therapeutic target for  treatment. We therefore investigated the inhibitory activity of NSC 95397 against three  cell lines including SW480, SW620, and DLD-1, and their underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated that NSC 95397 reduced cell viability and anchorage-independent growth of all the three  cell lines through inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis via regulating cell-cycle-related proteins, including p21, cyclin-dependent kinases, and caspases. Besides, by using mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor U0126, we provided mechanistic evidence that the antineoplastic effects of NSC 95397 were achieved via inhibiting MKP-1 activity followed by ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Conclusively, our results indicated that NSC 95397 might serve as an effective therapeutic intervention for  through regulating MKP-1 and ERK1/2 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754471>How to train your inhibitor: Design strategies to overcome resistance to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) stands out as a key player in the development of many cancers. Its dysregulation is associated with a vast number of tumors such as non-small-cell lung , , head-and-neck , breast and ovarian . Being implicated in the development of a number of the most lethal cancers worldwide, EGFR has long been considered as a focal target for  therapies, ever since the FDA approval of "Gefitinib" in 2003 and up to the last FDA approved small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitor "Osimertinib" in 2015. Studies are still going on to find more efficient EGFR inhibitors due to the continuous emergence of resistance to the current inhibitors. Cancerous cells resist EGFR  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) through various mechanisms, the most commonly reported ones are the T790M mutation and HER2 amplification. Therefore, tackling EGFR TKIs-resistant tumors through a multi-targeting approach comprising a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor that is also capable of inhibiting the mutant T790M EGFR is anticipated to overcome drug resistance. In this review, we will survey the structural aspects of EGFR family and the structure-activity relationship of representative dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. To follow, we will discuss the structural aspects of the mutation-driven resistance and various design strategies to overcome it. Finally, we will review the SAR of exemplary irreversible dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors that can overcome the mutation-driven resistance.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We have shown that the oncoprotein gankyrin is critical for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis in the . Although the in vitro function of gankyrin is well known, its role in vivo remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of gankyrin in the tumor microenvironment of mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Alb-Cre;gankyrin ) and gankyrin deletion both in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells (Mx1-Cre;gankyrin ). Gankyrin upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor cells. Gankyrin binds to Src homology 2 domain-containing protein  phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), mainly expressed in liver non-parenchymal cells, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Gankyrin deficiency in non-parenchymal cells, but not in parenchymal cells, reduced STAT3 activity, interleukin (IL)-6 production, and  stem cell marker (Bmi1 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]) expression, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. Chronic inflammation enhances gankyrin expression in the human liver. Gankyrin expression in the tumor microenvironment is negatively correlated with progression-free survival in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for HCC. Thus, gankyrin appears to play a critical oncogenic function in tumor microenvironment and may be a potential target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against HCC.© 2017 The Authors.

However, many  cells are resistant to TRAIL due to defects in apoptosis signaling or activation of survival pathways. We hypothesized that a disruption of pro-survival signaling cascades with the multi- kinase inhibitor sunitinib and would be an effective strategy to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that sunitinib significantly augments the anticancer activity of TRAIL in models of . The therapeutic benefit of the TRAIL/sunitinib combination was associated with increased apoptosis marked by enhanced caspase-3 cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) in HCT116 cells reduced TRAIL/sunitinib-mediated apoptosis, further supporting that sunitinib enhances the anticancer activity of TRAIL via augmented apoptosis. Analysis of pro-survival factors identified that the combination of TRAIL and sunitinib significantly downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated mechanism. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of JNK confirmed its key role in the regulation of sensitivity to this combination as cells with suppressed JNK expression exhibited significantly reduced TRAIL/sunitinib-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, the therapeutic benefit of the TRAIL/sunitinib combination was validated in the HCT116-Luc and HCT15  xenograft models, which both demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in response to combination treatment. Collectively, our data demonstrate that sunitinib enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by heightened JNK activation, diminished XIAP levels, and augmented apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29808006>SHP2 is required for growth of KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung  in vivo.</a></h2><p>RAS mutations are frequent in human , especially in pancreatic, colorectal and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Inhibition of the RAS oncoproteins has proven difficult, and attempts to target downstream effectors have been hampered by the activation of compensatory resistance mechanisms. It is also well established that KRAS-mutant tumors are insensitive to inhibition of upstream growth factor receptor signaling. Thus, epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy is only effective in KRAS wild-type  cancers. Consistently, inhibition of SHP2 (also known as PTPN11), which links receptor  kinase signaling to the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant or BRAF-mutant  cell lines. Our data also indicate that SHP2 inhibition in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells under normal cell culture conditions has little effect. By contrast, SHP2 inhibition under growth factor-limiting conditions in vitro results in a senescence response. In vivo, inhibition of SHP2 in KRAS-mutant NSCLC also provokes a senescence response, which is exacerbated by MEK inhibition. Our data identify SHP2 inhibition as an unexpected vulnerability of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells that remains undetected in cell culture and can be exploited therapeutically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101717>Novel Tetrahydrobenzo [b] Thiophene Compounds Exhibit Anticancer Activity through Enhancing Apoptosis and Inhibiting  Kinase.</a></h2><p>Developing new chemotherapeutic agents with molecular targets, larger margin of safety against normal cells and low cost is the target many scientists try to achieve.The present study was undertaken to investigate the anticancer activity of a novel series of thiophene compounds and the molecular mechanisms associated.A series of novel heterocyclic compounds including pyrimidine derivatives (2, 3, 4, 5 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15), thiophene derivatives (6, 7, and 10) and oxoisothiazolidine derivative (9) was synthesized from 4,5,6,7- tetrahydrobenzo[b] thiophene (1). The newly synthesized derivatives along with the parent compound were evaluated for their anticancer activity against human HepG2, MCF7 and HCT116 cell lines and compared to doxorubicin as a reference drug.Compound 7 was very selective in targeting only the  cells. Compounds 1, 5, and 12 showed strong cytotoxic activities against the 3 cell lines at 6-16 µM without any apparent toxicity to the normal fibroblasts WI-38. They had DNA affinity at 29-36 µM. The three compounds enhanced apoptosis to varying degrees elevating the expression of Bax, caspase 9 and caspase 3 in HepG2. Compound 5 was the most potent analogue and was superior to the standard drug used in upregulating the apoptotic genes and inhibiting  kinase at 1 µM. The IC50 value for compound 5 against TK was 296 nM.Taken together, this study presents some thiophene scaffolds as auspicious hits for further optimization as specific antiproliferative agents against  cells and promising  kinase inhibitors at nanomolar concentrations.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30912128>Importance of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of colorectal .</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) remains one of the most common and deadly cancers. Intestinal gut microflora is important to maintain and contributes to several intestinal functions, including the development of the mucosal immune system, absorption of complex macromolecules, synthesis of amino acids/vitamins and the protection against pathogenic microorganisms. It is well known that the gut microbiota changes or dysbiosis may have an essential impact in the initiation and promotion of chronic inflammatory pathways and also have a profound different genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to dysplasia, clonal expansion, and malignant transformation. Probiotic bacteria has antitumor activity with various mechanisms such as nonspecific physiological and immunological mechanisms. This review evaluates the effects of microbiota and probiotics in clinical trials, in vitro and animal model studies that have explored how probiotic against  development and also discusses the possible immunomodulatory mechanisms. Several mechanisms alteration of the intestinal microflora; inactivation of cancerogenic compounds; competition with putrefactive and pathogenic microbiota; improvement of the host's immune response; antiproliferative effects via regulation of apoptosis and cell differentiation; fermentation of undigested food; inhibition of  kinase; reduces the enteropathogenic complications before and after  surgery and improve diarrhea and it's have been able to create the integrity of gut mucosal and have stimulatory effects on the systemic immune system and prevent the CRC metastasis.

To achieve these goals, we designed a recombinant asymmetric triblock polypeptide (ATBP) that self-assembles into rod-shaped nanoparticles, and which can be used to conjugate diverse hydrophilic molecules, including chemotherapeutics, into their core. These ATBPs consist of three segments: a biodegradable elastin-like polypeptide, a hydrophobic -rich segment, and a short Cysteine-rich segment, that spontaneously self-assemble into rod-shaped micelles. Covalent conjugation of a structurally diverse set of hydrophilic small molecules, including a hydrophilic chemotherapeutic -gemcitabine- to the Cysteine residues also leads to formation of nanoparticles over a range of ATBP concentrations. Gemcitabine-loaded ATBP nanoparticles have significantly better tumor regression compared to free drug in a murine  model. This simple strategy of encapsulation of hydrophilic small molecules by conjugation to an ATBP can be used to effectively deliver a range of water-soluble drugs and imaging agents in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29038547>A novel Fer/FerT targeting compound selectively evokes metabolic stress and necrotic death in malignant cells.</a></h2><p>Disruption of the reprogrammed energy management system of malignant cells is a prioritized goal of targeted  therapy. Two regulators of this system are the Fer kinase, and its  cell specific variant, FerT, both residing in subcellular compartments including the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Here, we show that a newly developed inhibitor of Fer and FerT, E260, selectively evokes metabolic stress in  cells by imposing mitochondrial dysfunction and deformation, and onset of energy-consuming autophagy which decreases the cellular ATP level. Notably, Fer was also found to associate with PARP-1 and E260 disrupted this association thereby leading to PARP-1 activation. The cooperative intervention with these metabolic pathways leads to energy crisis and necrotic death in malignant, but not in normal human cells, and to the suppression of tumors growth in vivo. Thus, E260 is a new anti- agent which imposes metabolic stress and cellular death in  cells.The -kinases Fer/FerT associate with the mitochondrial electron transport chain in  cells supporting their metabolic reprogramming.

In this study, we investigated the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC since gankyrin is overexpressed in sporadic colorectal cancers. We analyzed gene expression of  tissues obtained from 344 patients with IBD and CAC and found that expression of gankyrin was much higher in  mucosa of patients with refractory IBD than in those with IBD in remission. Expression of gankyrin was upregulated in inflammatory cells as well as tumor cells in  mucosa of patients with CAC. Over-expressing studies utilizing tagged ganlyrin-cDNA identified physical interaction between ganlyrin and Src homology 2-containing protein  phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). Importantly, the interaction between ganlyrin and SHP-1 leads to inhibition of STAT3 activation and to enhancement of TNF-α and IL-17 in inflammatory cells. To further address the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC, we created mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Vil-Cre;Gankyrinf/f) and deletion of gankyrin in myeloid and epithelial cells (Mx1-Cre;Gankyrinf/f). Gankyrin deficiency in myeloid cells, but not in epithelial cells, reduced the activity of mitogen activated protein kinase and the expression of stem cell markers, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. These findings provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CAC and suggest that gankyrin is a promising target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against CAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29257266>Wee1 inhibition can suppress tumor proliferation and sensitize p53 mutant   cells to the anticancer effect of irinotecan.</a></h2><p>Wee1 is an oncogenic nuclear kinase, which can regulate the cell cycle as a crucial G2M checkpoint. Overexpression of Wee1 can be observed in various  types, which may lead to a poor prognosis, but the potential therapeutic value of Wee1 in colorectal  has not been fully studied. In the present study, the role of Wee1 in   was investigated. Wee1 inhibition by small interfering RNA was demonstrated to significantly restrain  cell proliferation and sensitize the p53 mutant   cell lines HT29 and SW480 to the effect of treatment with ionizing radiation. The anticancer effect of the Wee1 inhibitor MK1775 was investigated in these two   cell lines. MK1775 was demonstrated to induce significant DNA damage, suppress cell viability and induce apoptosis. In addition, MK1775 sensitized HT29 and SW480 cells to the effect of irinotecan. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that combination therapy can induce increased apoptosis compared with MK1775 or irinotecan monotherapy. The results of western blot analysis also indicated increased expression of the DNA damage marker histone H2AX, and apoptosis‑associated protein cleaved caspase 3, in HT29 and SW480 cells.

Although several studies have attempted to overcome resistance of  cells to anti- drugs, key determinants of resistance remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate whether microRNAs might play a role in the acquisition of resistance. Human colorectal  HCT-116 cell lines were transduced with a lentivirus library containing 578 precursor microRNAs (miRNAs) to establish cell lines resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Specific miRNAs were identified from four different resistant clones and a miR-195-expressing resistant clone (HCT-116_lenti-miR-195) was further investigated. The HCT-116_lenti-miR-195 cells showed resistant phenotype. These cells grew faster after 5-FU treatment compared to control cells (HCT-116_lenti-control). Check point kinase 1 (CHK1) and G2 check point kinase WEE1 were found to be direct targets of miR-195. Downregulation of miR-195 sensitized HCT-116 cells after 5-FU treatment.

In most cases of CRC, patients develop resistance to anticancer drugs. Cetuximab does not show many of the side effects of other anticancer drugs and improves the survival of patients with metastatic CRC. However, the molecular mechanism of cetuximab resistance is not fully understood. : EPHB3-mediated cetuximab resistance was confirmed by  western blotting, colony-forming assays, WST-1 colorimetric assay, and  xenograft models (n = 7 per group). RNA-seq analysis and receptor  kinase assays were performed to identify the cetuximab resistance mechanism of EPHB3. All statistical tests were two-sided. : The expression of , which upregulates the EPHB3 receptor, was shown to be increased via microarray analysis. When resistance to cetuximab was acquired, EPHB3 protein levels increased. Hedgehog signaling,  stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling proteins were also increased in the cetuximab-resistant human  cell line SW48R. Despite cells acquiring resistance to cetuximab, STAT3 was still responsive to EGF and cetuximab treatment. Moreover, inhibition of EPHB3 was associated with decreased STAT3 activity. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that EGFR and EPHB3 bind to each other and this binding increases upon resistance acquisition, suggesting that STAT3 is activated by the binding between EGFR and EPHB3. Protein levels of GLI-1, SOX2, and Vimentin, which are affected by STAT3, also increased. Similar results were obtained in samples from patients with CRC. : EPHB3 expression is associated with anticancer drug resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29114736>Association of Warfarin Use With Lower Overall  Incidence Among Patients Older Than 50 Years.</a></h2><p>In  models, warfarin inhibits AXL receptor  kinase-dependent tumorigenesis and enhances antitumor immune responses at doses not reaching anticoagulation levels. This study investigates the association between warfarin use and  incidence in a large, unselected population-based cohort.To examine the association between warfarin use and  incidence.This population-based cohort study with subgroup analysis used the Norwegian National Registry coupled with the Norwegian Prescription Database and the  Registry of Norway. The cohort comprised all persons (N = 1 256 725) born between January 1, 1924, and December 31, 1954, who were residing in Norway from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012. The cohort was divided into 2 groups-warfarin users and nonusers; persons taking warfarin for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter were the subgroup. Data were collected from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2012. Data analysis was conducted from October 15, 2016, to January 31, 2017.Warfarin use was defined as taking at least 6 months of a prescription and at least 2 years from first prescription to any  diagnosis. If warfarin treatment started after January 1, 2006, each person contributed person-time in the nonuser group until the warfarin user criteria were fulfilled. diagnosis of any type during the 7-year observation period (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012).Of the 1 256 725 persons in the cohort, 607 350 (48.3%) were male, 649 375 (51.7%) were female, 132 687 (10.6%) had , 92 942 (7.4%) were classified as warfarin users, and 1 163 783 (92.6%) were classified as nonusers.

It has been suggested that reactive oxygen species [ROS] derived from NOX1 contribute to DNA damage and neoplastic transformation in the , particularly during chronic inflammatory stress. However, the mechanism(s) underlying increased NOX1 expression in malignant tumors or chronic inflammatory states involving the intestine are poorly characterized. We examined the effects of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, on the regulation of NOX1. NOX1 expression was increased 4- to 5-fold in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by both cytokines in human  cell lines when a functional Type II IL-4 receptor was present. Increased NOX1 transcription following IL-4/IL-13 exposure was mediated by JAK1/STAT6 signaling, was associated with a ROS-related inhibition of protein  phosphatase activity, and was dependent upon activation and specific binding of GATA3 to the NOX1 promoter. NOX1-mediated ROS production increased cell cycle progression through S-phase leading to a significant increase in cellular proliferation. Evaluation of twenty pairs of surgically-resected  cancers and their associated uninvolved adjacent  epithelium demonstrated a significant increase in the active form of NOX1, NOX1-L, in tumors compared to normal tissues, and a significant correlation between the expression levels of NOX1 and the Type II IL-4 receptor in tumor and the uninvolved .

In addition to in vivo studies, in vitro experiments were also conducted in  specimens using l-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), a metabolic product of MPTP. Gastric emptying,  motility, nitrergic relaxation, and western blot experiments were performed as reported.MPTP-induced PD mice showed decreased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and its target phase II genes in gastric and  neuromuscular tissues. Decreased levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH, a critical cofactor for nNOS dimerization) associated with uncoupling of nNOS in gastric and  tissues exposed to MPTP. Impaired enteric nitrergic system led to delayed gastric emptying and slower  motility compared to the control mice.

In vitro exposure to L-NAME [N(w)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester], a NOS synthase inhibitor, reduced protein expression of TH in  tissue homogenates.Loss of Nrf2/BH/nNOS expression in PD impairs antioxidant gene expression, which deregulates NO synthesis, thereby contributing to the development of GI dysmotility and constipation.

In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of an innovative methodology, Needle Trap Microextraction (NTME), combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the establishment of the urinary volatomic biosignature from breast (BC), and  (CC)  patients as well as healthy individuals (CTL). To achieve this, 40 mL of the headspace of acidified urine (4 mL, 20% NaCl, pH = 2), equilibrated at 50 °C during 40 min, were loaded through the DVB/Car1000/CarX sorbent inside the NTD, and subjected to a GC-MS analysis. This allowed the identification of 130 VOMs from different chemical families that were further processed using discriminant analysis through the partial least squares method (PLS-DA). Several pathways are over activated in  patients, being phenylalanine pathway in BC and limonene and pinene degradation pathway in CC the most relevant. Butanoate metabolism is also highly activated in both cancers, as well as  metabolism in a lesser extension. In BC the xenobiotics metabolism by cytochrome P450 and fatty acid biosynthesis are also differentially activated. Different clusters corresponding to the groups recruited allowed to define sets of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs fingerprints) that exhibit high classification rates, sensitivity and specificity in the discrimination of the selected cancers. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that NTME is used for isolation urinary volatile metabolites, being the obtained results very promising.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

One of these receptor  kinases could be MET, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We investigated how MET signaling, and its interaction with CD44 (a putative MET coreceptor regulated by Wnt signaling and highly expressed by intestinal stem cells [ISCs] and adenomas) affects intestinal homeostasis, regeneration, and adenoma formation in mini-gut organoids and mice.We established organoid cultures from ISCs stimulated with HGF or EGF and assessed intestinal differentiation by immunohistochemistry. Mice with total epithelial disruption of MET (Ah/Met/LacZ) or ISC-specific disruption of MET (Lgr5/Met/LacZ) and control mice (Ah/Met/LacZ, Lgr5/Met/LacZ) were exposed to 10 Gy total body irradiation; intestinal tissues were collected, and homeostasis and regeneration were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We investigated adenoma organoid expansion stimulated by HGF or EGF using adenomas derived from Lgr5/Met/Apc and Lgr5/Met/Apc mice. The same mice were evaluated for adenoma prevalence and size. We also quantified adenomas in Ah/Met/Apc mice compared with Ah/Met/Apc control mice. We studied expansion of organoids generated from crypts and adenomas, stimulated by HGF or EGF, that were derived from mice expressing different CD44 splice variants (Cd44, Cd44, Cd44, or Cd44 mice).Crypts incubated with EGF or HGF expanded into self-organizing mini-guts with similar levels of efficacy and contained all differentiated cell lineages. MET-deficient mice did not have defects in intestinal homeostasis. Total body irradiation reduced numbers of proliferating crypts in Ah/Met/LacZ mice. Lgr5/Met/LacZ mice had impaired regeneration of MET-deficient ISCs. Adenoma organoids stimulated with EGF or HGF expanded to almost twice the size of nonstimulated organoids. MET-deficient adenoma organoids did not respond to HGF stimulation, but did respond to EGF. ISC-specific disruption of Met (Lgr5/Met/Apc mice) caused a twofold increase in apoptosis in microadenomas, resulting in an approximately 50% reduction of microadenoma numbers and significantly reduced average adenoma size. Total epithelial disruption of Met (Ah/Met/Apc mice) resulted in an approximate 50% reduction in (micro)adenoma numbers. Intestinal crypts from Cd44 mice did not expand to the same extent as crypts from Cd44 mice on stimulation with HGF, but had the same response to EGF. The negative effect on HGF-mediated growth was overcome by expression of CD44v4-10, but not by CD44s. Similarly, HGF-mediated expansion of adenoma organoids required CD44v4-10.In studies of intestinal organoid cultures and mice with inducible deletion of MET, we found HGF receptor signaling to regulate intestinal homeostasis and regeneration, as well as adenoma formation. These activities of MET are promoted by the stem cell CD44 isoform CD44v4-10. Our findings provide rationale for targeting signaling via MET and CD44 during anti-EGF receptor therapy of patients with colorectal  or in patients resistant to EGF receptor inhibitors.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

Recently, research has focused on improving its efficacy at lower doses in order to minimize its well-known toxicities. In this study, we investigated the possibility of improving the antitumor effect of capecitabine against CRC by destabilizing focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling.Optimal dosages for capecitabine and lactate calcium salt (LCS) were determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide MTT assay. The viability of CRC cells was investigated by MTT and clonogenic assays after single or combination treatment with capecitabine and LCS. Western blot analyses were used to determine changes in the expression of components of the FAK and AKT signaling cascade, and this information was used to elucidate the underlying mechanism. A xenograft model was established to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the combination treatment, as well as its necrotic effect and organ toxicity.The addition of LCS to capecitabine treatment led to an increase in the proteolysis of the FAK signaling cascade components, including SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor  kinase; AKT serine/threonine kinase 1; and nuclear factor-kappa B, resulting in a decrease in the viability and clonogenic ability of CRC cells. In vivo antitumor efficacy, including tumor necrosis, was significantly increased with the combination treatment relative to both single treatments, and no organ toxicity was found in any experimental group.The addition of LCS increased the anticancer efficacy of capecitabine at a lower dose than is currently used in human patients.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

We developed site-specific and phosphorylation-status-specific antibodies against Girdin at -1798 (pY1798) and found pY1798 immunostaining of mouse jejunum clearly depicted epithelial cells closely resembling TCs. This study aimed to validate pY1798 as a TC-marker. Double-fluorescence staining of intestines was performed with pY1798 and known TC-markers, for example, hematopoietic-prostaglandin-D-synthase (HPGDS), or doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from cell counts to determine whether two markers were attracting (OR<1) or repelling (OR>1). In consequence, pY1798 signals strongly attracted those of known TC-markers. ORs for HPGDS in mouse stomach, small intestine, and  were 0 for all, and 0.08 for DCLK1 in human small intestine. pY1798-positive cells in jejunum were distinct from other minor epithelial cells, including goblet, Paneth, and neuroendocrine cells. Thus, pY1798 was validated as a TC-marker. Interestingly, apoptosis inducers significantly increased relative TC frequencies despite the absence of proliferation at baseline. In conclusion, pY1798 is a novel TC-marker. Selective  phosphorylation and possible resistance to apoptosis inducers implied the activation of certain kinase(s) in TCs, which may become a clue to elucidate the enigmatic roles of TCs. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317190>Impact of sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 overexpression on different  cell types.</a></h2><p>-associated glycan structures can be both tumor markers and engines of disease progression. The structure Siaα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAc (Sia6LacNAc), synthesized by sialyltransferase ST6GAL1, is a -associated glycan. Although ST6GAL1/Sia6LacNAc are often overexpressed in colorectal  (CRC), their biological and clinical significance remains unclear. To get insights into the clinical relevance of ST6GAL1 expression in CRC, we interrogated The  Genome Atlas with mRNA expression data of hundreds of clinically characterized CRC and normal samples. We found an association of low ST6GAL1 expression with microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF mutations and mucinous phenotype but not with stage, response to therapy and survival. To investigate the impact of ST6GAL1 expression in experimental systems, we analyzed the transcriptome and the phenotype of the CRC cell lines SW948 and SW48 after retroviral transduction with ST6GAL1 cDNA. The two cell lines display the two main pathways of CRC transformation: chromosomal instability and MSI, respectively. Constitutive ST6GAL1 expression induced much deeper transcriptomic changes in SW948 than in SW48 and affected different genes in the two cell lines. ST6GAL1 expression affected differentially the  phosphorylation induced by hepatocyte growth factor, the ability to grow in soft agar, to heal a scratch wound and to invade Matrigel in the two cell lines.

We studied its efficacy and tolerability in persistent or recurrent cervical  patients.Eligible patients had at least one prior cytotoxic regimen for recurrence and with measurable disease. Brivanib 800mg was administered orally every day (1cycle=28days) until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) >6months and objective tumor response.Of 28 eligible and evaluable women enrolled, 11 (39%) had primary surgery and 25 (89%) had prior radiation. Eighteen (64%) received one prior cytotoxic treatment and 10 (36%) had 2 prior regimens. Twelve (43%) had >2cycles of brivanib with 4 (14%) receiving >10cycles (range: 1-20). Seven (25%) patients had PFS >6months (90% CI: 7.3%-33.9%). Two (7%) (90% CI: 1.3%-20.8%) patients had partial tumor response with duration of 8 and 22months and 12 (43%) had stable disease. The median PFS was 3.2months (90% CI: 2.1-4.4). The median overall survival was 7.9months (90% CI: 6.1-11.7). More common grade 3 adverse events were hypertension, anemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, elevated liver enzymes, nausea, headache, and  hemorrhage. Grade 4 adverse events included sepsis and hypertension.Based on early results of this phase II trial, brivanib was well tolerated and demonstrated sufficient activity after first stage but trial was stopped due to lack of drug availability.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2017.

Of the 7008 tumors screened for NTRK expression using a pan-Trk antibody, 16 (0.23%) had Trk immunoreactivity. ArcherDx assay detected TPM3-NTRK1 (n=9), LMNA-NTRK1 (n=3), TPR-NTRK1 (n=2) and EML4-NTRK3 (n=1) fusion transcripts in 15 cases with sufficient RNA quality. Patients were predominantly women (median age: 63 y). The tumors involved the right (n=12) and left  unequally and were either stage T3 (n=12) or T4. Local lymph node and distant metastases were seen at presentation in 6 and 1 patients, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion was present in all cases. Histologically, tumors showed moderate to poor (n=11) differentiation with a partly or entirely solid pattern (n=5) and mucinous component (n=10), including 1 case with sheets of signet ring cells. DNA mismatch repair-deficient phenotype was seen in 13 cases. Tumor-infiltrating CD4/CD8 lymphocytes were prominent in 9 cases. Programmed death-ligand 1 positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells and focal tumor cell positivity were seen in the majority of cases. CDX2 expression and loss of CK20 and MUC2 expression were frequent. CK7 was expressed in 5 cases. No mutations in BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA were identified. However, other genes of the PI3K-AKT/MTOR pathway were mutated. In several cases, components of Wnt/β-catenin (APC, AMER1, CTNNB1), p53, and TGFβ (ACVR2A, TGFBR2) pathways were mutated. However, no SMAD4 mutations were found. Two tumors harbored FBXW7 tumor suppressor gene mutations.

Over the past two decades, several agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) is a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of mCRC in 2012. This agent is a novel oral diphenylurea-based multikinase inhibitor that is active against several angiogenic receptor  kinases (RTKs; VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, TIE-2), oncogenic RTKs (c-KIT, RET), stromal RTKs (PDGFR-B, FGFR-1), and intracellular signaling kinases (c-RAF/RAF-1, BRAF, BRAF). Preclinical studies have documented its broad-spectrum activity against different solid tumor types including CRC. Phase I studies showed that it had an acceptable safety profile in advanced refractory mCRC. A subsequent Phase III trial (CORRECT) demonstrated significant clinical efficacy of regorafenib in patients with refractory or advanced mCRC, which eventually led to its FDA approval for the treatment of mCRC in September 2012. However, the drug was associated with significant toxicity in clinical practice when administered at the approved doses, which necessitated a thorough reassessment of its dosing schedule and toxicity profile. This review summarizes the development of regorafenib from the initial preclinical studies to the Phase III trials and critically examines the current clinical space occupied by regorafenib in the treatment of mCRC, at 5 years after its initial FDA approval.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29532881>VEGF pathway-targeting drugs induce evasive adaptation by activation of neuropilin-1/cMet in  cells.</a></h2><p>Anti-angiogenic therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGF-R) are important treatments for a number of human malignancies, including colorectal cancers. However, there is increasing evidence that VEGF/VEGF-R inhibitors promote the adaptive and evasive resistance of tumor cells to the therapies. The mechanism by which the  cells become resistant remains unclear. One potential mechanism is that VEGF/VEGF-R blockers directly act on tumor cells independently of anti-angiogenic effects. In this study, the direct effects of an anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab) and a VEGF-R  kinase inhibitor (sunitinib) on the evasive adaptation of  cells were compared. HCT116 and RKO human  cell lines were chronically exposed (3 months) to bevacizumab or sunitinib in vitro to establish bevacizumab- and sunitinib-adapted cells, respectively. Transwell migration and invasion assays, western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, co-immunoprecipitation analysis, cell survival assays and ELISAs were conducted to analyze the adapted cells. Compared with the control vehicle-treated cells, the two cell models exhibited increased migration and invasion activities to different degrees and through different mechanisms. The bevacizumab-adapted cells, but not in the sunitinib-adapted cells, exhibited redundantly increased expression levels of VEGF/VEGF-R family members, including VEGF-A, placental growth factor, VEGF-C, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R3. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R3 were increased in the bevacizumab-adapted cells compared with the control cells. Thus, the inhibition of VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R3 decreased the evasive activities of the cells, suggesting that they remained dependent on redundant VEGF/VEGF-R signaling. By contrast, the sunitinib-adapted cells exhibited increased neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expression levels compared with the control cells. In the sunitinib-adapted cells, NRP1 interacted with phosphorylated cMet, and the cMet activation was dependent on NRP1. Thus, NRP1 or cMet blockade suppressed the evasive activation of the sunitinib-adapted cells. These results suggest that the sunitinib-adapted cells switched from a VEGF-R-dependent pathway to an alternative NRP1/cMet-dependent one. The findings of the present study indicate that VEGF/VEGF-R inhibitors directly act on  cells and activate their evasive adaptation via different mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30628725>FAK alternative splice mRNA variants expression pattern in colorectal .</a></h2><p>The Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic -kinase promoting tumor progression and metastasis processes by acting in  cells and their tumor microenvironment partners. FAK overexpression in primary  tumors and their metastasis is associated to poor colorectal  (CRC) patients' outcome. Eight FAK mRNA alternative splice variants have been described and contribute to additional level of FAK activity regulation, some of them corresponding to overactivated FAK isoforms. To date, FAK mRNA alternative splice variants expression and implication in CRC processes remain unknown. Here, using different human CRC cells lines displaying differential invasive capacities in an in vivo murine model recapitulating the different steps of CRC development from primary tumors to liver and lung metastasis, we identified three out of the eight mRNA variants (namely FAK , FAK and FAK ) differentially expressed along the CRC process and the tumor sites. Our results highlight an association between FAK and FAK expressions and the metastatic potential of the most aggressive cell lines HT29 and HCT116, suggesting that FAK and FAK could represent aggressiveness markers in CRC. Our findings also suggest a more specific role for FAK in the interactions between the tumors cells and their microenvironment. In conclusion, targeting FAK , the common form of FAK, might not be a good strategy based on the numerous roles of this kinase in physiological processes. In contrast, FAK or FAK splice variants, or their corresponding protein isoforms, may putatively represent future therapeutic target candidates in the development of CRC primary tumors and metastasis.© 2019 The Authors.

Ponatinib blocks a variety of  kinases including ABL and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and the BET bromodomain (BRD) antagonists JQ1 and dBET1 impede MYC oncogene expression. Both drugs have demonstrated substantial anti- efficacy against several hematological malignancies. Solid tumors, on the other hand, although frequently driven by FGFR and/or MYC, are often unresponsive to these drugs. This is due, at least in part, to compensatory feedback-loops in the kinome and transcription network of these tumors, which are activated in response to drug exposure. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of the multi-kinase inhibitor ponatinib with transcription modulators such as JQ1 or dBET1 might overcome this therapeutic recalcitrance. Using H-thymidine uptake, cell cycle analysis, and caspase-3 or Annexin V labeling, we demonstrate that single drugs induce moderate dose-dependent growth-inhibition and/or apoptosis in  (HCT116, HT29), breast (MCF-7, SKBR3) and ovarian (A2780, SKOV3)  cells. Ponatinib elicited primarily apoptosis, while JQ1 and dBET1 caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and very mild cell death. Phospho-FGFR and MYC, major targets of ponatinib and BET inhibitors, were downregulated after treatment with single drugs. Remarkably, ponatinib was found to sensitize cells to BET antagonists by enhancing apoptotic cell death, and this effect was associated with downregulation of MYC. In summary, our data shows that ponatinib sensitizes , breast, and ovarian  cells to BET bromodomain inhibitors. Further studies are warranted to determine the clinical value of this phenomenon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846365>Phase II Study of Tivantinib and Cetuximab in Patients With KRAS Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal  With Acquired Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors and Emergence of MET Overexpression: Lesson Learned for Future Trials With EGFR/MET Dual Inhibition.</a></h2><p>MET overexpression/amplification has been associated with resistance to anti- epidermal growth factor receptor therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal  (mCRC). Combining tivantinib, an inhibitor of the MET receptor  kinase, and cetuximab may be effective in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-resistant MET-high mCRC.This multicenter, single-arm, Simon 2-stage, phase II study enrolled patients with MET-high, KRAS wild-type mCRC, who were treated with ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy, with at least stable disease on the last treatment regimen containing cetuximab or panitumumab. Patients were enrolled if they presented tumor progression on cetuximab or panitumumab within 3 months before enrollment. Patients received tivantinib (360 mg twice daily) plus cetuximab (500 mg intravenously every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was objective response rate; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The treatment would be considered effective if ≥ 5 confirmed partial responses were observed among 41 patients.In total, 41 patients were evaluated, 4 patients (9.8%) achieved an objective response, the median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.2 months), and the median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval, 7.1-15.1 months). Among 13 patients with tested MET amplification, 2 responding patients had MET amplification compared with none of the nonresponding patients. The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (14.6%), skin toxicity (12.2%), and fatigue (9.8%).Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, efficacy results suggest some activity of the tested combination, with almost 10% of patients achieving objective response in a difficult-to-treat setting. Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of tivantinib and cetuximab.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of combination therapy with erythropoietin β (Epo) and LFM-A13 (Btk inhibitor) on  in in vitro and in vivo models.DLD-1 and HT-29 human  adenocarcinoma cells were cultured with Epo and LFM-A13. Cell number and viability, and mRNA and protein levels of Epo receptors, Btk and Akt were assessed. Nude mice were inoculated with adenocarcinoma cells and treated with Epo and LFM-A13.The combination of Epo and LFM-A13 mostly exerted a synergistic inhibitory effect on  cell growth. The therapeutic scheme used effectively killed the  cells and attenuated the Btk signalling pathways. Epo + LFM-A13 also prevented the normal process of microtubule assembly during mitosis by down-regulating the expression of Polo-like kinase 1. The combination of Epo and LFM-A13 significantly reduced the growth rate of tumour cells, while it showed high safety profile, inducing no nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity or changes in the haematological parameters.Epo significantly enhances the antitumour activity of LFM-A13, indicating that a combination of Epo and LFM-A13 has potential as an effective therapeutic approach for patients with colorectal .© 2017 The Authors.

MDM2 can ligate the p53 protein via its E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the ubiquitinated p53 can be transferred to the cytoplasm and degraded by proteasomes. Therefore, MDM2 can maintain the stability of p53 signaling pathway.  amplification has been detected in many human malignancies, including lung ,  and other malignancies. MDM2 overexpression is associated with chemotherapeutic resistance in human malignancies. The mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance by MDM2 overexpression mainly include the p53-MDM2 loop-dependent and p53-MDM2 loop-independent pathways. But the role of MDM2 overexpression in  kinase inhibitors resistance remains to be further study. This paper reviews the possible mechanisms of therapeutic resistance of malignancies induced by  amplification and overexpression, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted agents and hyperprogressive disease of immunotherapy.

Dacomitinib-induced diarrhoea has not previously been investigated and the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to develop an in-vitro and in-vivo model of dacomitinib-induced diarrhoea to investigate underlying mechanisms. T84 cells were treated with 1-4 μM dacomitinib and resistance and viability were measured using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and XTT assays. Rats were treated with 7.5 mg/kg dacomitinib daily via oral gavage for 7 or 21 days (n = 6/group). Weights, and diarrhoea incidence were recorded daily. Rats were administered FITC-dextran 2 hr before cull, and serum levels of FITC-dextran were measured and serum biochemistry analysis was conducted. Detailed histopathological analysis was conducted throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal expression of ErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB4 was analysed using RT-PCR. The ileum and the  were analysed using multiplex for expression of various cytokines. T84 cells treated with dacomitinib showed no alteration in TEER or cell viability. Rats treated with dacomitinib developed severe diarrhoea, and had significantly lower weight gain. Further, dacomitinib treatment led to severe histopathological injury localised to the ileum. This damage coincided with increased levels of MCP1 in the ileum, and preferential expression of ErbB1 in this region compared to all other regions. This study showed dacomitinib induces severe ileal damage accompanied by increased MCP1 expression, and gastrointestinal permeability in rats. The histological changes were most pronounced in the ileum, which was also the region with the highest relative expression of ErbB1.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28958502>Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung  (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.</a></h2><p>Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR  kinase inhibitor. We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR  kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung  (NSCLC).In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years or ≥20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met. Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number , and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225). Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22·1 months (95% CI 20·3-23·9). Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14·7 months (95% CI 11·1-16·6) in the dacomitinib group and 9·2 months (9·1-11·0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0·59, 95% CI 0·47-0·74; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid  diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While canonical, β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling is well studied and has been linked to many forms of , much less is known about the role of non-canonical, β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling. Here, we aimed at identifying a β-catenin-independent Wnt target gene signature in order to understand the functional significance of non-canonical signaling in  cells. Gene expression profiling was performed after silencing of key components of Wnt signaling pathway and an iterative signature algorithm was applied to predict pathway-dependent gene signatures. Independent experiments confirmed several target genes, including PLOD2, HADH, LCOR and REEP1 as non-canonical target genes in various  cells. Moreover, non-canonical Wnt target genes are regulated via RoR2, Dvl2, ATF2 and ATF4. Furthermore, we show that the ligands Wnt5a/b are upstream regulators of the non-canonical signature and moreover regulate proliferation of  cells in a β-catenin-independent manner. Our experiments indicate that  cells are dependent on both β-catenin-dependent and -independent Wnt signaling routes for growth and proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28730258>Morphology with immunohistochemical and genetic profiling of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of  - a case report with review of literature.</a></h2><p>Here we present a challenging case of a hepatic flexure  tumor of 61-year-old woman with no primary lesion of lung .

Fetal calf serum (FCS) is the most commonly used media supplement worldwide. FCS contains a mixture of largely undefined growth factors and cytokines, which support cell proliferation. This undefined nature of FCS is a source of experimental variation, undesired immune responses, possible contaminations, and because of its way of production an ethical concern. Thus, alternative, defined, valid, and reliable media supplements should be characterized in a large number of experiments. Human platelet lysate (hPL) is increasingly appreciated as an alternative to FCS. Since it is unclear whether cells respond differentially to clinically relevant chemotherapeutics inducing replicative stress and DNA damage (Hydroxyurea, Irinotecan), induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the  kinase inhibitor (TKi) Imatinib, and novel epigenetic modifiers belonging to the group of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), we investigated these issues. Here we show that  cells derived from leukemia and  grow very similarly in culture media with FCS or outdated hPL. Notably, cells have practically identical proteomes under both culture conditions. Moreover, cells grown with FCS or hPL respond equally to all types of drugs and stress conditions that we have tested. In addition, the transfection of blood cells by electroporation can be achieved under both conditions. Furthermore, we reveal that class I HDACs, but not HDAC6, are required for the expression of the pan-leukemic marker WT1 under various culture conditions. Hence, hPL is a moderately priced substitute for FCS in various experimental settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28482095>PRL-3 promotes telomere deprotection and chromosomal instability.</a></h2><p>Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL-3) promotes cell invasiveness, but its role in genomic integrity remains unknown. We report here that shelterin component RAP1 mediates association between PRL-3 and TRF2. In addition, TRF2 and RAP1 assist recruitment of PRL-3 to telomeric DNA. Silencing of PRL-3 in  cells does not affect telomere integrity or chromosomal stability, but induces reactive oxygen species-dependent DNA damage response and senescence. However, overexpression of PRL-3 in  cells and primary fibroblasts promotes structural abnormalities of telomeres, telomere deprotection, DNA damage response, chromosomal instability and senescence. Furthermore, PRL-3 dissociates RAP1 and TRF2 from telomeric DNA in vitro and in cells. PRL-3-promoted telomere deprotection, DNA damage response and senescence are counteracted by disruption of PRL-3-RAP1 complex or expression of ectopic TRF2. Examination of clinical samples showed that PRL-3 status positively correlates with telomere deprotection and senescence. PRL-3 transgenic mice exhibit hallmarks of telomere deprotection and senescence and are susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced  malignancy.

The transmembrane receptor  kinase EphA2, a member of the A class of the Eph receptor family, has been reported to be highly overexpressed in several tumor types including breast, lung, brain, prostate, and  and is considered amongst the most promising cell membrane-associated tumor antigens by the NIH. Another member of the Eph receptor family belonging to the B class, EphB4, has also been found to be upregulated in multiple  types. In this study, EphA2 and EphB4 are evaluated as targets for IGOS of colorectal  by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of 168 pairs of tumor and normal tissue. The IHC sections were scored for staining intensity and percentage of cells stained. The results show a significantly enhanced staining intensity and more widespread distribution in tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue for EphA2 as well as EphB4.

Syndecan-2 is located at the cell surface, and we previously reported that it induces matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) expression in  cells. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that overexpression of syndecan-2 in HT-29  cells increases the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK in parallel with up-regulated MMP-7 expression, but a syndecan-2 mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain showed significant reductions in these effects. Consistent with this observation, FAK inhibition via FAK-related non-kinase expression or inhibition of ERK with the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 diminished the syndecan-2-mediated up-regulation of MMP-7. Activation of PKC enhanced syndecan-2-mediated MMP-7 expression, whereas inhibition of PKC had the opposite effect. Of note, the exogenous expression of syndecan-2 triggered localization of PKCγ to the membrane. Expression of syndecan-2 harboring a phosphomimetic (S198E) mutation of the variable region of the cytoplasmic domain enhanced MMP-7 expression and FAK phosphorylation. Finally, experimental suppression of shedding of the syndecan-2 extracellular domain did not significantly affect the syndecan-2-mediated up-regulation of MMP-7 in the early period after syndecan-2 overexpression. Taken together, these findings suggest that syndecan-2's cytoplasmic domain up-regulates MMP-7 expression in  cells via PKCγ-mediated activation of FAK/ERK signaling.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399411>Inhibition of Hematopoietic Cell Kinase Activity Suppresses Myeloid Cell-Mediated  Progression.</a></h2><p>Aberrant activation of the SRC family kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) triggers hematological malignancies as a tumor cell-intrinsic oncogene.

Furthermore, tumor-associated macrophages of the corresponding tumors show a pronounced alternatively activated endotype, which occurs independently of mature lymphocytes or of Stat6-dependent Th2 cytokine signaling.

Src activation has been associated with a more aggressive neoplastic phenotype and induces resistance to platinum agents in preclinical models. The aim of our study was to assess the prognostic and/or predictive value of Src activation in patients with stage II-III . pSrc expression was assessed in paraffin-embedded tumor samples by immunohistochemistry (phospho-Y418, ab4816; Abcam). Cases were classified by staining intensity in 4 categories: no staining (0), weak (1+), moderate (2+), and intense (3+) staining. A total of 487 patients were evaluated (240 stage II, 247 stage III), of whom 298 (61%) had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Staining was absent in 78 (16%), weak in 262 (54%), moderate in 103 (21%), and intense in 44 (9%). High pSrc expression was significantly associated with decreased 5-year disease-free survival (39% versus 63% for patients with high versus low pSrc expression; hazard ratio, 0.56; P=.005) and overall survival (58% versus 74%; hazard ratio, 0.55; P=.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed pSrc expression as a significant prognostic factor both for disease-free survival and overall survival, independent of age, sex, tumor stage, bowel obstruction/perforation, or adjuvant chemotherapy. These findings illustrate the relevance of Src activation in  biology, conferring a poor prognosis to patients with early stage  regardless of adjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings may help improve prognostic stratification of patients for clinical decisions and open new avenues for potential pharmacologic manipulation that may eventually improve patients' outcomes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against 60 human tumor cell lines by NCI (USA). Five compounds: 3d, 3e, 3f, 3o and 3q exhibited significant to potent anticancer activity at low concentrations. Compound 3q showed the most prominent broad-spectrum anticancer activity against 34 tumor cell lines, with mean growth inhibition percent of 45.80%. It exerted the highest potency against  HT-29 cell line, with cell growth inhibition 86.86%. All leukemia cell lines were highly sensitive to compound 3q. Additionally, compound 3q demonstrated lethal activity to MDA-MB-435 belonging melanoma. Compound 3e exhibited the highest anticancer activity against leukemic CCRF-CEM and HL-60(TB) cell lines, with cell growth inhibition 86.69% and 86.42%, respectively. Moreover, it exerted marked potency against ovarian OVCAR-3  cell line, with cell growth inhibition 78.24%. Four compounds: 3d, 3e, 3f and 3q were further studied through determination of IC values against the most sensitive  cell lines. The four compounds exhibited highly potent anticancer activity against ovarian  OVCAR-3 and leukemia HL-60 (TB) cell lines, with IC values in nano-molar range between 25 and 130 nM. They showed 18-2.3 folds more potent anticancer activity than doxorubicin. The most prominent compound was 3e, (IC values 29 and 25 nM against OVCAR-3 and HL-60 (TB) cell lines, respectively), representing 10 and 18 folds more potency than doxorubicin. The anti-proliferative activity of these four compounds appeared to correlate well with their ability to inhibit FAK at nano-molar range between 44.6 and 80.75 nM. Compound 3e was a potent, inhibitor of FAK and Pyk2 activity with IC values of 44.6 and 70.19 nM, respectively. It was 1.6 fold less potent for Pyk2 than FAK. Additionally, it displayed inhibition in cell based assay measuring phosphorylated-FAK (IC = 32.72 nM). Inhibition of FAK enzyme led to a significant increase in the level of active caspase-3, compared to control (11.35 folds), accumulation of cells in pre-G1 phase and annexin-V and propidium iodide staining in addition to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase indicating that cell death proceeded through an apoptotic mechanism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study was conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in primary tumor tissues of rectal carcinoma (RC) that may be associated with heterochrony hepatic metastasis (HHM). Samples were collected exclusively from patients with RC but not  (CC); Next-generation high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools were used to profile and analyze small RNAs and their corresponding targets in primary tumor tissues with HHM (n=2) or without metastases (non-metastatic, NM; n=2). A total of 24 known miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed (P<0.01; absolute value of log-fold change ≥1). Hsa-let-7e-5p exhibited the most significant elevation in tissues with HHM (log-fold change=2.62). By combining online informatics resources and previous mRNA sequencing data, it was identified that 54 validated target genes of let-7e were downregulated in primary tumor tissues with HHM. A number of these target genes have been demonstrated to be directly involved in tumor metastasis (including MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor, high-mobility group AT-Hook 2, peptidase inhibitor 3, KIT proto-oncogene receptor  kinase, Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit and ribonuclease T2), or have physiological associations to immunity (including C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 and cluster of differentiation 40 ligand) and cellular metabolism (including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, coactivator 1 α). Next, 14 target genes were selected for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in non-sequenced samples, and the downregulation of 10 target genes in RC samples with HHM was confirmed.

Thus, miRNAs with dysregulated expression are potential biomarkers for cervical  diagnosis and prognosis. In the present study, expression levels of miR‑485 were detected in cervical  tissues and cell lines. The effects of miR‑485 overexpression on the proliferation and invasion of cervical  cells were determined with Cell Counting kit‑8 and Transwell invasion assays. The mechanisms underlying the action of miR‑485 in cervical  were investigated using bioinformatics analysis, a luciferase reporter assay, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. In addition, the association between miR‑485 and metastasis associated in ‑1 (MACC1) in cervical  tissues was examined. The present study demonstrated that miR‑485 expression was significantly downregulated in cervical  tissues and cell lines. Reduced miR‑485 expression in patients with cervical  was correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, restored expression of miR‑485 significantly reduced cervical  cell proliferation and invasion. MACC1 was identified as a direct target gene of miR‑485 in cervical . MACC1 expression was significantly upregulated in cervical  specimens and was inversely correlated with miR‑485 expression. Additionally, the restored expression of MACC1 eliminated the suppressive effects of miR‑485 overexpression on the proliferation and invasion of cervical  cells. Notably, the upregulation of miR‑485 suppressed the MET proto‑oncogene, receptor  kinase (Met)/RAC‑α serine/threonine‑protein kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that miR‑485 may perform its tumor suppressive function in cervical  by directly targeting MACC1 and inhibiting the Met/AKT signaling pathway.

A hypoxic microenvironment is a hallmark for solid tumors. The hypoxia-induced signal transduction is transcriptionally mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Three major HIF isoforms, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α, are present in the intestine. Our previous work demonstrates that HIF-2α is essential for CRC growth and progression. However, the mechanisms mediating cell proliferation after hypoxia or HIF-2α activation in CRC are unclear. Data mining of RNA-Seq experiments with mouse models of intestinal HIF-2α or Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) overexpression indicates a significant overlap of genes in these conditions. YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo signaling pathway, and YAP1-induced transcriptional responses are essential in  cell proliferation. Here, we report that HIF-2α robustly increases YAP1 expression and activity in CRC-derived cell lines and in mouse models. The potentiation of YAP1 activity by HIF-2α was not via canonical signaling mechanisms such as Src (non-receptor  kinase), PI3K, ERK, or MAPK pathways. Moreover, we detected no direct interaction of HIF-2α with YAP1. Of note, YAP1 activation was critical for  cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings indicate that HIF-2α increases  cell growth by up-regulating YAP1 activity, suggesting that this pathway might be targeted in potential anti- approaches for treating CRC patients.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28086832>Norcantharidin Inhibits cell growth by suppressing the expression and phosphorylation of both EGFR and c-Met in human  cells.</a></h2><p>Norcantharidin (NCTD) is a Chinese FDA approved, chemically synthesized drug for  treatment.

Moreover, EGFR expression could be mostly restored by co-treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. In addition, NCTD-induced cell death was comparable to that of the anti- drug gefitinib, a  kinase inhibitor for EGFR, based on the immunoblot analysis of the expressed proteins after the drug treatment.NCTD might be a useful and inexpensive drug candidate to substitute for gefitinib to serve the treatment needs of  patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28957395>High mRNA expression of splice variant SYK short correlates with hepatic disease progression in chemonaive lymph node negative  patients.</a></h2><p>Overall and splice specific expression of Spleen  Kinase (SYK) has been posed as a marker predicting both poor and favorable outcome in various epithelial malignancies. However, its role in colorectal  is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic role of SYK in three cohorts of  patients.Total messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of SYK, SYK(T), and mRNA expression of its two splice variants SYK short (S) and SYK long (L) were measured using quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT-qPCR) in 240 primary  patients (n = 160 patients with chemonaive lymph node negative [LNN] and n = 80 patients with adjuvant treated lymph node positive [LNP] ) and related to microsatellite instability (MSI), known colorectal  mutations, and disease-free (DFS), hepatic metastasis-free (HFS) and overall survival (OS). Two independent cohorts of patients with respectively 48 and 118 chemonaive LNN  were used for validation.Expression of SYK and its splice variants was significantly lower in tumors with MSI, and in KRAS wild type, BRAF mutant and PTEN mutant tumors. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, as a continuous variable, increasing SYK(S) mRNA expression was associated with worse HFS (Hazard Ratio[HR] = 1.83; 95% Confidence Interval[CI] = 1.08-3.12; p = 0.026) in the LNN group, indicating a prognostic role for SYK(S) mRNA in patients with chemonaive LNN .

Furthermore, the irreversible EGFR inhibitor PD168393 also activated Src while the reversible EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed the opposite effect, indicating that MHYs are the irreversible EGFR inhibitor.

Drug development efforts have been focused on kinases in this pathway, most notably on RAF and MEK. We show here that MEK inhibition activates JNK-JUN signaling through suppression of DUSP4, leading to activation of HER Receptor  Kinases. This stimulates the MAPK pathway in the presence of drug, thereby blunting the effect of MEK inhibition. Cancers that have lost MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 fail to activate JNK-JUN. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations in either MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 confer sensitivity to MEK inhibition by disabling JNK-JUN-mediated feedback loop upon MEK inhibition. In a panel of 168 Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) tumors, MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutation status is a strong predictor of response to MEK inhibition. Our findings suggest that cancers having mutations in MAP3K1 or MAP2K4, which are frequent in tumors of breast, prostate and , may respond to MEK inhibitors. Our findings also suggest that MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 are potential drug targets in combination with MEK inhibitors, in spite of the fact that they are encoded by tumor suppressor genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30275180>Hotspot Mutations Detectable by Next-generation Sequencing in Exhaled Breath Condensates from Patients with Lung .</a></h2><p>Genetic alterations occurring in lung  are the basis for defining molecular subtypes and essential for targeted therapies.

The detailed regulation mechanism of DYRK2 in CRC remains unclear.miR-622 and DYRK2 expression levels were detected at tissue and cellular level respectively by using real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemical staining. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between miR-622 and DYRK2. Transwell assay was applied to measure the effect of miR-622 on migration and invasion of SW1116 and SW480. We used dual luciferase reporter assay to confirm the targeted binding effect of miR-622 and DYRK2 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). An antisense experiment was executed to further confirm the role miR-622 had played with regard to migration and invasion by targeting regulation of DYRK2 pathway in CRC cells.In our research, we found that the expression of miR-622 was elevated in CRC tissues and cell lines compared to that of nonCRC tissues and the normal human  epithelial cell line NCM460. Correspondingly, the expression of DYRK2 in CRC tissues and cell lines showed a contrary tendency. The different expression level of DYRK2 was closely correlated with clinicopathological characteristics of CRC patients. We demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-622 could inhibit the ability of migration and invasion of CRC cell lines SW1116 and SW480. Also, we confirmed that DYRK2 was negatively regulated by miR-622 via a specific targeted binding site within the 3'UTR. We finally verified that the migration and invasion ability of CRC cells in the conducted DYRK2 3'UTR defect plasmid transfection group were lower compared to miR-622 and cotransfection group.The findings of this study indicate that a decrease of miR-622 expression could suppress migration and invasion by targeting regulation of DYRK2 and miR-622/DYRK2 could be a potential molecular treating target of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28811071>Biological evaluation of 2-pyrazolinyl-1-carbothioamide derivatives against HCT116 human colorectal  cell lines and elucidation on QSAR and molecular binding modes.</a></h2><p>In the search of compounds exhibiting anticancer activity, 37 derivatives of 2-pyrazolinyl-1-carbothioamide were designed and synthesized.

Oncogenes can dysregulate circadian-regulated genes to disrupt the cell cycle, promoting tumor cell proliferation. As a regulator of G2/M arrest in response to DNA damage, the circadian gene Timeless Circadian Clock (TIMELESS) coordinates this connection and is a potential locus for oncogenic manipulation. TIMELESS expression was evaluated using RNASeq data from TCGA and by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis in a panel of  cell lines. TIMELESS expression following ERK inhibition was examined via western blot. Cell metabolic capacity, propidium iodide, and CFSE staining were used to evaluate the effect of TIMELESS depletion on  cell survival and proliferation. Cell metabolic capacity following TIMELESS depletion in combination with Wee1 or CHK1 inhibition was assessed. TIMELESS is overexpressed in  and required for increased  cell proliferation. ERK activation promotes TIMELESS expression. TIMELESS depletion increases γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, and triggers G2/M arrest via increased CHK1 and CDK1 phosphorylation. TIMELESS depletion in combination with Wee1 or CHK1 inhibition causes an additive decrease in  cell metabolic capacity with limited effects in non-transformed human  epithelial cells. The data show that ERK activation contributes to the overexpression of TIMELESS in . Depletion of TIMELESS increases γH2AX and causes G2/M arrest, limiting cell proliferation.

Due to their stunning genetic, histological, and clinical variability, diagnosis and treatment of NETs are challenging. In addition, low incidence and high variability hamper the implementation of high evidence trials. Therefore, guidelines do not cover the complexity of NETs and, frequently, treatment decisions are taken by interdisciplinary tumor conferences at comprehensive  centers. Treatment aims are (i) control of tumor growth, (ii) symptom control, as well as (iii) the improvement of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Here, we discuss high evidence trials facilitating the achievement of these treatment aims. The majority of the evidence exists for treatment with somatostatin analogue, everolimus, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with Lu-DOTATATE, sunitinib, and telotristat. Among those, PRRT is the only treatment option that has the potential to control symptoms, stop tumor growth, and to improve PFS and OS. In contrast, only a low level of evidence exists for treatment with cytotoxic drugs such as streptozotocin and doxorubicine. Finally, we discuss novel treatment options by a combination of cytotoxic drugs, Lu-DOTATATE, and  kinase inhibitors to be tested in randomized prospective trials in the future. In addition, the application of innovative isotopes, such as Ac, for PRRT is discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30123970>Randomized, double-blind, phase two study of ruxolitinib plus regorafenib in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic colorectal .</a></h2><p>The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway plays a key role in the systemic inflammatory response in many cancers, including colorectal  (CRC). This study evaluated the addition of ruxolitinib, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, to regorafenib in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic CRC.In this two-part, multicenter, phase 2 study, eligible adult patients had metastatic adenocarcinoma of the  or rectum; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2; received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (if no contraindication); and if KRAS wild-type (and no contraindication), an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy; and progressed following the last administration of approved therapy. Patients who received previous treatment with regorafenib, had an established cardiac or gastrointestinal disease, or had an active infection requiring treatment were excluded. The study was conducted in 95 sites in North America, European Union, Asia Pacific, and Israel. After an open-label, safety run-in phase (part 1; ruxolitinib 20 mg twice daily [BID] plus regorafenib 160 mg once daily [QD]), the double-blind, randomized phase (part 2) was conducted wherein patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ruxolitinib 15 mg BID plus regorafenib 160 mg QD [ruxolitinib group] or placebo plus regorafenib 160 mg QD [placebo group]. Part 2 included substudy 1 (patients with high systemic inflammation, ie, C-reactive protein [CRP] >10 mg/L) and substudy 2 (patients with low systemic inflammation, ie, CRP ≤10 mg/L); the primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).The study was terminated early; substudy 1 was terminated for futility at interim analysis and substudy 2 was terminated per sponsor decision. Ruxolitinib 20 mg BID was well tolerated in the safety run-in (n = 11). Overall, 396 patients were randomized (substudy 1: n = 175 [ruxolitinib group, n = 87; placebo group, n = 88]; substudy 2: n = 221 [ruxolitinib group, n = 110; placebo group, n = 111]). There was no significant difference in OS or progression-free survival (PFS) between treatments in substudy 1 (OS: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.040 [95% confidence interval: 0.725-1.492]; PFS: HR = 1.004 [0.724-1.391]) and substudy 2 (OS: HR = 0.767 [0.478-1.231]; PFS: HR = 0.787 [0.576-1.074]). The most common hematologic adverse event was anemia. No new safety signals with ruxolitinib were identified.Although addition of ruxolitinib to regorafenib did not show increased safety concerns in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic CRC, this combination did not improve OS/PFS vs. regorafenib plus placebo.© 2018 The Authors.

LMTK2 is less studied and little is known about its function. Here we demonstrate that LMTK2 modulates NF-κB activity and functions to promote  tumorigenesis. We found that LMTK2 protein was abundant in  cells and LMTK2 knockdown (LMTK2-KD) inhibited proliferation of  cells through inactivating NF-κB. In unstimulated condition, LMTK2 modulated NF-κB through inhibiting phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468. Mechanistically, LMTK2 phosphorylated protein phosphatase 1A (PP1A) to prevent PP1A from dephosphorylating p-GSK3β(Ser9). The p-GSK3β(Ser9) could not phosphorylate p65 at Ser468, which maintained the basal NF-κB activity. LMTK2 also modulated TNFα-activated NF-κB. LMTK2-KD repressed TNFα-induced IKKβ phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, implying that LMTK2 modulates TNFα-activated NF-κB via IKK. These results suggest that LMTK2 modulates basal and TNFα-induced NF-κB activities in different mechanisms. Animal studies show that LMTK2-KD suppressed  cell xenograft growth, decreased PP1A phosphorylation and increased p-p65(Ser468). Our results reveal the role and underlying mechanism of LMTK2 in  tumorigenesis and suggest that LMTK2 may serve as a potential target for chemotherapy of .Copyright © 2019.

However, in contrast to its striking efficacy in -mutant melanomas, BRAF inhibitor monotherapy is ineffective in -mutant colorectal . Although many studies on BRAF inhibitor resistance in colorectal  have focused on mechanisms underlying the reactivation of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, the current study focuses on identifying novel adaptive signaling mechanisms, a fresh angle on colorectal  resistance to BRAF inhibition. We found that treatment with BRAF inhibitors (both current and next-generation BRAF inhibitors) upregulated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in -mutant colorectal  cell lines through activating the cytoplasmic  kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The results showed that FAK activation upon BRAF inhibitor treatment did not require EGFR or ERK1/2 activation, implying that BRAF inhibitor treatment-induced hyperactivation of Wnt signaling is "pathway reactivation"-independent. BRAF inhibition-induced Wnt pathway activation was further validated in preclinical models of -mutant colorectal , including cell line xenograft model and a patient-derived xenograft model. Combined inhibition of BRAF/Wnt pathways or BRAF/FAK pathways exerted strong synergistic antitumor effects in cell culture model and mouse xenograft model. Overall, the current study has identified activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a novel fundamental cause of  resistance to BRAF inhibition. Our results suggest that although complete vertical pathway blockade is pivotal for effective and durable control of -mutant colorectal , cotargeting parallel adaptive signaling-the Wnt/β-catenin pathway-is also essential. .©2017 American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28949782>Divergent Anticancer Activity of Free and Formulated Camel Milk α-Lactalbumin.</a></h2><p>Alpha-lactalbumin (α-LA), a small milk calcium-binding globular protein, is known to possess noticeable anticancer activity, which is determined by the ability of this protein to form complexes with oleic acid (OA). To date, in addition to human and bovine α-LA, the ability to form such anti-tumor complexes with OA was described for goat and camel α-LA. Although the mechanisms of the anticancer activity of human and bovine α-LA are already well-studied, little is currently known about the anticancer action of this camel protein. The goal of this study was to fill this gap and to analyze the anticancer and pro-apoptotic activities of camel α-LA in its free form (α-cLA) and as an OA-containing complex (OA-α-cLA) using four human  cell lines, including Caco-2  cells, PC-3 prostate  cells, HepG-2 hepatoma cells, and MCF-7 breast  cells as targets. The anti-tumor activities of OA-α-cLA and α-cLA were analyzed using MTT test, annexin/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, nuclear staining, and  kinase (TK) inhibition methods. We show here that the OA-α-cLA complex does not affect normal cells but has noticeable anti- activity, especially against MCF-7 cells, thus boosting the anticancer activity of α-cLA and improving the selectivity of OA. The OA-α-cLA complex mediated  cell death via selective induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at lower IC than that of free α-cLA by more than two folds. However, OA induced apoptosis at higher extent than OA-α-cLA and α-cLA. OA also caused unselective apoptosis-dependent cell death in both normal and  cells to a similar degree. The apoptosis and cell-cycle arresting effect of OA-α-cLA may be attributed to the TK inhibition activity of OA. Therefore, OA-α-cLA serves as efficient anticancer complex with two functional components, α-cLA and OA, possessing different activities. This study declared the effectiveness of OA-α-cLA complex as a promising entity with anticancer activity, and these formulated OA-camel protein complexes constitute an auspicious approach for  remedy, particularly for breast .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30582224>Morin-dependent inhibition of low molecular weight protein  phosphatase (LMW-PTP) restores sensitivity to apoptosis during  carcinogenesis: Studies in vitro and in vivo, in an Apc-driven model of .</a></h2><p>LMW-PTP has been associated with the development of colorectal  (CRC) and with the resistance to chemotherapy in  cells. To clarify its role in vivo, we studied LMW-PTP expression in Pirc rats (F344/NTac-Apc  ), genetically prone to CRC and resistant to apoptosis. In the morphologically normal mucosa (NM) of Pirc rats, a dramatic over-expression of LMW-PTP was found compared to wt rats (about 60 times higher). Moreover, LMW-PTP levels further increase in spontaneously developed Pirc  tumors. To understand if and how LMW-PTP affects resistance to apoptosis, we studied CRC cell lines, sensitive (HT29 and HCT-116), or resistant (HT29R, HCT116R) to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU): resistant cells over-express LMW-PTP. When resistant cells were challenged with morin, a polyphenol inhibiting LMW-PTP, a fast and dose-related down-regulation of LMW-PTP was observed. 5-FU and morin co-treatment dramatically decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and significantly impaired self-renewal ability of all the  cell lines we have studied. Similarly, we observed that, in Pirc rats, one-week morin administration (50 mg/kg) down-regulated LMW-PTP and restored the apoptotic response to 5-FU in the NM. Finally, administration of morin for a longer period led to a significant reduction in  precancerous lesions, together with a down-regulation of LMW-PTP. Taken together, these results document the involvement of LMW-PTP in the process of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Morin treatment may be envisaged as a system to increase the sensitivity to chemotherapy and to prevent carcinogenesis.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28100259>Antitumor activity of miR-34a in peritoneal mesothelioma relies on c-MET and AXL inhibition: persistent activation of ERK and AKT signaling as a possible cytoprotective mechanism.</a></h2><p>The value of microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel targets for  therapy is now widely recognized. However, no information is currently available on the expression/functional role of miRNAs in diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM), a rapidly lethal disease, poorly responsive to conventional treatments, for which the development of new therapeutic strategies is urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the expression and biological effects of miR-34a-one of the most widely deregulated miRNAs in  and for which a lipid-formulated mimic is already clinically available-in a large cohort of DMPM clinical samples and a unique collection of in house-developed preclinical models, with the aim to assess the potential of a miR-34a-based approach for disease treatment.miR-34a expression was determined by qRT-PCR in 45 DMPM and 7 normal peritoneum specimens as well as in 5 DMPM cell lines. Following transfection with miR-34a mimic, the effects on DMPM cell phenotype, in terms of proliferative potential, apoptotic rate, invasion ability, and cell cycle distribution, were assessed. In addition, three subcutaneous and orthotopic DMPM xenograft models were used to examine the effect of miR-34a on tumorigenicity. The expression of miRNA targets and the activation status of relevant pathways were investigated by western blot.miR-34a was found to be down-regulated in DMPM clinical specimens and cell lines compared to normal peritoneal samples. miR-34a reconstitution in DMPM cells significantly inhibited proliferation and tumorigenicity, induced an apoptotic response, and declined invasion ability, mainly through the down-regulation of c-MET and AXL and the interference with the activation of downstream signaling. Interestingly, a persistent activation of ERK1/2 and AKT in miR-34a-reconstituted cells was found to counteract the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of miRNA, yet not affecting its anti-invasive activity.Our preclinical data showing impressive inhibitory effects induced by miR-34a on DMPM cell proliferation, invasion, and growth in immunodeficient mice strongly suggest the potential clinical utility of a miR-34a-replacement therapy for the treatment of such a still incurable disease. On the other hand, we provide the first evidence of a potential cytoprotective/resistance mechanism that may arise towards miRNA-based therapies through the persistent activation of RTK downstream signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29175316>Inhibition of tumor growth by mouse ROR1 specific antibody in a syngeneic mouse tumor model.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) is a potentially powerful approach to eradicate tumor cells. The receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) plays a crucial role for survival of tumor cells and is overexpressed in various malignancies. In the present study, we developed a syngeneic mouse tumor model to assess anti-tumor effect of mouse ROR1 specific polyclonal antibody (pAb) in vivo.Mouse ROR1 specific antibody was produced in rabbit using recombinant ROR1 protein. Tow mouse tumor cell lines, (4T1 and CT26), were transfected with full length mouse ROR1 construct and stable clones were selected and characterized by immunocytochemistry, Western blot and flow cytometry. In vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities of anti-ROR1 antibody were assessed by XTT and syngeneic BALB/c mouse model, respectively.We successfully established two mouse ROR1-overexpressing tumor cell lines. The in vitro results indicate that the ROR1pAb did not significantly inhibit growth of ROR1+ cell lines. One of these cell lines (CT26-ROR1) was implanted in syngeneic BALB/c mice to assess anti-ROR1 tumor inhibitory activity in vivo. The tumor size was significantly reduced in mice treated with ROR1 specific pAb.Our results demonstrated for the first time tumor inhibitory effect of mouse ROR1 specific antibody in a syngeneic mouse tumor model. This model is a promising tool for preclinical assessment of ROR1 therapeutics and investigation of the underling molecular mechanisms.Copyright © 2017 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Tumor angiogenesis is based on a sequence of interactions between the tumor and surrounding cells and the extracellular matrix. It is widely known that a tumor can influence and control its surroundings to create favorable conditions for further growth. To investigate the influence of various tumor types on endothelial cells (ECs), an in vitro rat cell model was used and rat liver EC52 cells were co‑cultured with conditioned medium derived from breast  MCR86, osteosarcoma ROS‑1,  CC531 and rhabdomyosarcoma R1H cell lines. In a distinct tumor‑type‑dependent manner, the EC52 cells exhibited changes in their function and gene expression. In all functional cell culture assays (proliferation, migration, transmigration, invasion and tube formation) the breast  cells exerted a significant effect on the angiogenic abilities of the ECs. When comparing the various tumor cell types, only the breast and  cells led to a significant stimulation of the EC migration and invasion. Proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation were not or only hardly influenced by the osteosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Similarly, the breast and  cells exhibited the strongest influence on the upregulation of EC angiogenic genes, including the ones encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A, platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, fibroblast growth factor 2, Von Willebrand factor, C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12 and  kinase with immunoglobulin‑like and EGF‑like domains 1. Therefore, it is hypothesized that tumor cells enhance the angiogenic properties of ECs, including proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation in a tumor‑type‑dependent manner. This is likely based on the upregulation of pro‑angiogenic genes in ECs induced by varying cytokine secretion signatures of tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28778796>Filamin A upregulation correlates with Snail-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell adhesion but its inhibition increases the migration of  adenocarcinoma HT29 cells.</a></h2><p>Filamin A (FLNA) is actin filament cross-linking protein involved in  progression. Its importance in regulating cell motility is directly related to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells. However, little is known about the mechanism of action of FLNA at this early stage of  invasion. Using immunochemical methods, we evaluated the levels and localization of FLNA, pFLNA[Ser2152], β1 integrin, pβ1 integrin[Thr788/9], FAK, pFAK[Y379], and talin in stably transfected HT29 adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing Snail and looked for the effect of Snail in adhesion and migration assays on fibronectin-coated surfaces before and after FLNA silencing. Our findings indicate that FLNA upregulation correlates with Snail-induced EMT in colorectal carcinoma. FLNA localizes in the cytoplasm and at the sites of focal adhesion (FA) of invasive cells. Silencing of FLNA inhibits Snail-induced cell adhesion, reduces the size of FA sites, induces the relocalization of talin from the cytoplasm to the membrane area and augments cell migratory properties. Our findings suggest that FLNA may not act as a classic integrin inhibitor in invasive carcinoma cells, but is involved in other pro-invasive pathways. FLNA upregulation, which correlates with cell metastatic properties, maybe an additional target for combination therapy in colorectal carcinoma tumor progression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition exerts a therapeutic effect, but resistance invariably develops through undefined mechanisms. In this study, we determined that colorectal  progression specimens invariably harbored lesions in elements of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Genetic amplification of wild-type RAS was a recurrent mechanism of resistance in colorectal  patients that was not seen in similarly resistant melanomas. We show that wild-type RAS amplification increases receptor  kinase-dependent activation of RAS more potently in colorectal  than in melanoma and causes resistance only in the former. Currently approved RAF inhibitors inhibit RAF monomers but not dimers. All the drug-resistant lesions we identified activate BRAF V600E dimerization directly or by elevating RAS-GTP.

Using in vitro and xenograft-based models, previous studies demonstrated that miR-489 acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA by targeting various oncogenic pathways. It has been demonstrated that miR-489 directly targets HER2 and inhibits the HER2 signaling pathway; however, its role in mammary gland development and HER2-induced tumor initiation hasn't been studied. To dissect the role of miR-489, we sorted different populations of mammary epithelial cells and determined that miR-489 was highly expressed in mammary stem cells. MMTV-miR-489 mice that overexpressed miR-489 in mammary epithelial cells were developed and these mice exhibited an inhibition of mammary gland development in early ages with a specific impact on highly proliferative cells. Double transgenic MMTV-Her2-miR489 mice were then generated to observe how miR-489 overexpression affects HER2-induced tumorigenesis. miR-489 overexpression delayed HER2-induced tumor initiation significantly. Moreover, miR-489 overexpression inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis. miR-489 overexpression reduced mammary progenitor cell population significantly in preneoplastic mammary glands of MMTV-Her2 mice which showed a putative transformed population in HER2-induced tumorigenesis. The miR-489 overexpression reduced CD49fCD61 populations in tumors that have stem-like properties, and miR-489 overexpression altered the HER2 signaling pathway in mammary tumors.

EZH2 directly interacted with H2B and promoted H2B in  cells using ATP as a phosphate donor. Moreover, EZH2 levated  cell autophagy in starvation condition. H2B was required for EZH2-elevated  cell autophagy under starvation condition. The EZH2-H2B axis elevated  cell autophagy possibly via activating transcriptional regulation of ATG genes.

Finally, we have explored the role of ASAH1 in response and resistance mechanisms to oxaliplatin (OXA) in HCT 116  cells.

Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation between ASAH1 expression and p53 functional activity. Obtained data revealed that ASAH1 was involved in HCT 116 cell response to OXA and that anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-migratory and anti-clonogenic effects of OXA could be significantly increased by combination treatment with ASAH1 inhibitor carmofur. Increased OXA sensitivity was associated with downregulation of signalling involved in acquired resistance to OXA in , in particular transglutaminase 2 and β1 integrin/FAK, which resulted in the suppression of NF-κB and Akt.

Inhibiting either focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Akt1 can block this pathway, but risks interfering with the diverse other functions of each kinase. However, the mechanotransduced signal pathway involves a novel Akt1-FAK interaction not required for most FAK or Akt1 function, so modeling and blocking this interaction seems a desirable target. Building upon previous work suggesting that FAK-Akt1 binding is mediated by the FAK F1 lobe, we demonstrated that independently expressing the F1 domain in human Caco-2 or murine CT-26  cells by transient or stable inducible plasmid expression respectively prevents the stimulation of  cell adhesion by increased extracellular pressure. Serial further truncation of the FAK F1 lobe identified shorter regions capable of pulling down Akt1 on a glutathione S-transferase (GST) - conjugated column. Ultimately, we identified a 33 residue segment (residues 94-126) at the C-terminal of the F1 lobe as sufficient to pull down Akt1.

These changes are associated with the induction of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs, mainly HIF1α) and increased expression of target genes, including Caveolin-1 (CAV1). Results from our group have shown that CAV1 expression in metastatic  cells promotes cell migration/invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo in a manner dependent on -14 phosphorylation by src family kinases. Here, we evaluated whether hypoxia-induced expression of CAV1 was required for hypoxia-dependent migration and invasion in  cells.B16-F10 murine melanoma and HT29(US)  adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to hypoxia (1% O2). CAV1 expression was evaluated by western blotting. Endogenous CAV1 and HIF1α were knocked-down using different shRNA constructs. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated in Boyden Chamber and Matrigel assays, respectively.We observed that hypoxia increased CAV1 protein levels in a HIF1 α- dependent manner, in B16-F10 and HT29(US) cells. Importantly, hypoxia-dependent migration of both tumor cell lines was blocked upon CAV1 knock-down. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of HIF prevented hypoxia-induced migration and invasion in B16-F10 cells. Finally, hypoxia-induced migration was also blocked by the src-family kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo3,4-dpyrimidine (PP2), an inhibitor of CAV1 phosphorylation.Hypoxia induced migration and invasion of metastatic  cells require HIF1α-dependent induction of CAV1 expression and src family kinase activation.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28169277>Investigation of the role of  kinase receptor EPHA3 in colorectal .</a></h2><p>EPH signaling deregulation has been shown to be important for colorectal carcinogenesis and genome-wide sequencing efforts have identified EPHA3 as one of the most frequently mutated genes in these tumors. However, the role of EPHA3 in colorectal  has not been thoroughly investigated. We show here that ectopic expression of wild type EPHA3 in  cells did not affect their growth, motility/invasion or metastatic potential in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of mutant EPHA3 or deletion of the endogenous mutant EPHA3 in  cells did not affect their growth or motility. EPHA3 inactivation in mice did not initiate the tumorigenic process in their intestine, and had no effects on tumor size/multiplicity after tumor initiation either genetically or pharmacologically. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of EPHA3 tumor levels did not reveal associations with survival or clinicopathological features of colorectal  patients. In conclusion, we show that EPHA3 does not play a major role in colorectal tumorigenesis. These results significantly contribute to our understanding of the role of EPH signaling during colorectal carcinogenesis, and highlighting the need for detailed functional studies to confirm the relevance of putative  driver genes identified in sequencing efforts of the  genome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28073775>Dasatinib Changes Immune Cell Profiles Concomitant with Reduced Tumor Growth in Several Murine Solid Tumor Models.</a></h2><p>Dasatinib, a broad-range  kinase inhibitor, induces rapid mobilization of lymphocytes and clonal expansion of cytotoxic cells in leukemia patients. Here, we investigated whether dasatinib could induce beneficial immunomodulatory effects in solid tumor models. The effects on tumor growth and on the immune system were studied in four different syngeneic mouse models (B16.OVA melanoma, 1956 sarcoma, MC38 , and 4T1 breast carcinoma). Both peripheral blood (PB) and tumor samples were immunophenotyped during treatment. Although in vitro dasatinib displayed no direct cytotoxicity to B16 melanoma cells, a significant decrease in tumor growth was observed in dasatinib-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated group. Further, dasatinib-treated melanoma-bearing mice had an increased proportion of CD8 T cells in PB, together with a higher amount of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Dasatinib-mediated antitumor efficacy was abolished when CD4 and CD8 T cells were depleted with antibodies. Results were confirmed in sarcoma, , and breast  models, and in all cases mice treated daily with dasatinib had a significant decrease in tumor growth. Detailed immunophenotyping of tumor tissues with CyTOF indicated that dasatinib had reduced the number of intratumoral regulatory T cells in all tumor types. To conclude, dasatinib is able to slow down the tumor growth of various solid tumor models, which is associated with the favorable blood/tumor T-cell immunomodulation. The assessment of synergistic combinatorial therapies with other immunomodulatory drugs or targeted small-molecule oncokinase inhibitors is warranted in future clinical trials.

Dysregulation of miRNAs have been increasingly reported to contribute to colorectal . However, the detailed biological function and potential mechanisms of miR‑1273g‑3p in colorectal  remain poorly understood. The expression levels of miR‑1273g‑3p in human colorectal  LoVo cell lines were detected via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The target genes of miR‑1273g‑3p were predicted by bioinformatics and verified by a luciferase reporter assay, RT‑qPCR and western blotting. The MTT, wound‑healing and Transwell assays were used to examine the biological functions of miR‑1273g‑3p in LoVo cells. The potential molecular mechanisms of miR‑1273g‑3p on LoVo cell proliferation, migration and invasion was detected by western blotting. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑1273g‑3p expression was extensively upregulated in LoVo cells compared with the normal  epithelial NCM460 cell line. Further studies indicated that miR‑1273g‑3p inhibitor significantly suppressed LoVo cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared with inhibitor control. Following this, the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR‑1273g‑3p. Knockdown of CNR1 restored the phenotypes of LoVo cells transfected with miR‑1273g‑3p inhibitor. Furthermore, the potential molecular mechanism of miR‑1273g‑3p on LoVo cell proliferation, migration and invasion may be mediated by activating the Erb‑B2 receptor  kinase 4 (ERBB4)/phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase 2 (S6K2) signaling pathway. These observations indicated that miR‑1273g‑3p promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of LoVo cells via CNR1, and this may have occurred through activation of the ERBB4/PIK3R3/mTOR/S6K2 signaling pathway, suggesting that miR‑1273g‑3p may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the effective treatment of colorectal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28551086>HMGB1-RAGE pathway drives peroxynitrite signaling-induced IBD-like inflammation in murine nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Recent clinical studies found a strong association of  inflammation and Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like phenotype with NonAlcoholic Fatty liver Disease (NAFLD) yet the mechanisms remain unknown. The present study identifies high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a key mediator of intestinal inflammation in NAFLD and outlines a detailed redox signaling mechanism for such a pathway. NAFLD mice showed liver damage and release of elevated HMGB1 in systemic circulation and increased intestinal  nitration that was dependent on NADPH oxidase. Intestines from NAFLD mice showed higher Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, an outcome strongly dependent on the existence of NAFLD pathology and NADPH oxidase. Mechanistically intestinal epithelial cells showed the HMGB1 activation of TLR-4 was both NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite dependent with the latter being formed by the activation of NADPH oxidase. Proinflammatory cytokine production was significantly blocked by the specific peroxynitrite scavenger phenyl boronic acid (FBA), AKT inhibition and NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin suggesting NADPH oxidase-dependent peroxynitrite is a key mediator in TLR-4 activation and cytokine release via an AKT dependent pathway. Studies to ascertain the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated NADPH oxidase activation showed a distinct role of Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) as the use of inhibitors targeted against RAGE or use of deformed HMGB1 protein prevented NADPH oxidase activation, peroxynitrite formation, TLR4 activation and finally cytokine release. Thus, in conclusion the present study identifies a novel role of HMGB1 mediated inflammatory pathway that is RAGE and redox signaling dependent and helps promote ectopic intestinal inflammation in NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, it is relatively insensitive, and often requires long treatment courses to achieve gross physical tumor destruction. As alternatives, several non-invasive imaging methods such as bioluminescence imaging (BLI), fluorescence imaging (FLI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed for more accurate measurement. As tumors have elevated glucose metabolism, 18F-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) has become a sensitive PET imaging tracer for  detection, diagnosis, and efficacy assessment by measuring alterations in glucose metabolism. In particular, the ability of 18F-FDG imaging to detect drug-induced effects on tumor metabolism at a very early phase has dramatically improved the speed of decision-making regarding treatment efficacy. Here we demonstrated an approach with FLI that offers not only comparable performance to PET imaging, but also provides additional benefits, including ease of use, imaging throughput, probe stability, and the potential for multiplex imaging. In this report, we used sorafenib, a  kinase inhibitor clinically approved for  therapy, for treatment of a mouse tumor xenograft model. The drug is known to block several key signaling pathways involved in tumor metabolism. We first identified an appropriate sorafenib dose, 40 mg/kg (daily on days 0-4 and 7-10), that retained ultimate therapeutic efficacy yet provided a 2-3 day window post-treatment for imaging early, subtle metabolic changes prior to gross tumor regression. We then used 18F-FDG PET as the gold standard for assessing the effects of sorafenib treatment on tumor metabolism and compared this to results obtained by measurement of tumor size, tumor BLI, and tumor FLI changes. PET imaging showed ~55-60% inhibition of tumor uptake of 18F-FDG as early as days 2 and 3 post-treatment, without noticeable changes in tumor size. For comparison, two FLI probes, BombesinRSense™ 680 (BRS-680) and Transferrin-Vivo™ 750 (TfV-750), were assessed for their potential in metabolic imaging. Metabolically active  cells are known to have elevated bombesin and transferrin receptor levels on the surface. In excellent agreement with PET imaging, the BRS-680 imaging showed 40% and 79% inhibition on days 2 and 3, respectively, and the TfV-750 imaging showed 65% inhibition on day 3. In both cases, no significant reduction in tumor volume or BLI signal was observed during the first 3 days of treatment. These results suggest that metabolic FLI has potential preclinical application as an additional method for detecting drug-induced metabolic changes in tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096835>New 2-Oxoindolin Phosphonates as Novel Agents to Treat : A Green Synthesis and Molecular Modeling.</a></h2><p>The work reports the facile synthesis of novel α-aminophosphonate derivatives coupled with indole-2,3-dione moieties, namely the diethyl(substituted phenyl/heteroaryl)(2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)hydrazinyl)methylphosphonates derivatives (⁻). One-pot three component Kabachnik-Fields reactions were used to synthesize these derivatives. The reaction was carried out at room temperature by stirring in presence of ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) as a green catalyst. The structures of the synthesized compounds were established by spectral studies. The synthesized derivatives (⁻) were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against six human  cell lines by the SRB assay method. The  cell lines used in this research work are SK-MEL-2 (melanoma), MCF-7 (breast ), IMR-32 (neuroblastoma) MG-63 (human osteosarcoma), HT-29 (human ) and Hep-G2 (human hepatoma). All the synthesized derivatives inhibited the cell proliferation. Importantly, all the target compounds showed no cytotoxicity towards normal tissue cells (GI > 250 µM). A docking study was performed to predict the mode of action. Docking results indicate that the compounds have good binding with the enzyme  kinase as well as with microtubules, which makes them dual inhibitors. The result of in-silico bioavailability studies suggests that the compounds from the present series have good oral drug-like properties and are non-toxic in nature. In vivo acute oral toxicity study results indicate that the compounds can be considered safe, and therefore could be developed in the future as good anticancer agents or as leads for the design and synthesis of novel anticancer agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173891>Role of Csk in intestinal epithelial barrier function and protection against colitis.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the integrity and barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. Dysfunctions of IECs are thought to participate in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, resulting in gastrointestinal diseases, such as colitis and colorectal . Here we show that IEC-specific COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-deficient mice (Csk CKO mice) manifested the increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model of inflammatory bowel disease. DSS-treated Csk CKO mice also exhibited the significantly elevated intestinal permeability. Following DSS treatment, Csk CKO mice exhibited the higher proliferative activity of  epithelial cells and the increased number of apoptotic cells in the  compared with that apparent for control mice. Moreover, the abundance of the tight junction protein occludin, which regulates cell-cell adhesion as well as epithelial permeability, was markedly reduced in the  of DSS-treated Csk CKO mice. These results thus suggest that Csk in IECs plays important roles in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier function and protection against colitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, the green beet contains apigenin, vitexin, vitexin-2-O-xyloside and vitexin-2-O-rhamnoside, while the red beetroot is a source of betaxanthins and betacyanins. These phytochemicals show considerable antioxidant activity, as well as antiinflammatory and antiproliferative activities. Vitexin-2-O-xyloside, in combination with betaxanthins and betacyanins, exerts antiproliferative activity in breast, liver,  and bladder  cell lines, through the induction of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. A significant body of evidence also points to the role of these phytochemicals in the downregulation of the pro-survival genes, baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 and catenin beta-1, as well as the genes controlling angiogenesis, hypoxia inducible factor 1A and vascular endothelial growth factor A. The multi-target action of these phytochemicals enhances their anticancer activity. Vitexin-2-O-xyloside, betaxanthins and betacyanins can be used in combination with conventional anticancer drugs to reduce their toxicity and overcome the multidrug resistance of  cells.

However, the crosstalk of these two signaling pathways in human colorectal  cells remains unclear. Here we detected the changes of mRNA profile in human colorectal  cell SW620 exposed to FVIIa. Microarray showed that mRNA levels of EGFR ligands were significantly upregulated. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of EGFR ligands and the phosphorylation of EGFR at -845 in colorectal  cells exposed to FVIIa. However, knockdown of TF by RNAi could block the upregulation of EGFR ligands induced by FVIIa stimulation. On the other hand, the expression of components of TF/FVIIa signaling was significantly upregulated in LoVo cells stimulated by EGF. However, the crosstalk between the two signaling pathways could not be detected in HT-29  cells bearing wild-type KRAS. Taken together, our study suggest that the crosstalk between TF/FVIIa and EGFR signaling pathways in  cells depends on KRAS mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28879546>The Btk-dependent PIP5K1γ lipid kinase activation by Fas counteracts FasL-induced cell death.</a></h2><p>The Fas/FasL system plays a critical role in death by apoptosis and immune escape of  cells. The Fas receptor being ubiquitously expressed in tissues, its apoptotic-inducing function, initiated upon FasL binding, is tightly regulated by several negative regulatory mechanisms to prevent inappropriate cell death. One of them, involving the non-receptor  kinase Btk, was reported mainly in B cells and only poorly described. We report here that Btk negatively regulates, through its  kinase activity, the FasL-mediated cell death in epithelial cell lines from  origin. More importantly, we show that Btk interacts not only with Fas but also with the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, PIP5K1γ, which, upon stimulation by Fas ligand, is responsible of a rapid and transient synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P). This production requires both the presence and the  kinase activity of Btk, and participates in the negative regulation of FasL-mediated cell death since knocking down PIP5K1γ expression significantly strengthens the apoptotic signal upon FasL engagement. Altogether, our data demonstrate the cooperative role of Btk and PIP5K1γ in a FasL-induced PI(4,5)P production, both proteins participating to the threshold setting of FasL-induced apoptotic commitment in colorectal cell lines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31435270>10-Gingerol as an inducer of apoptosis through HTR1A in cumulus cells:  and  studies.</a></h2><p>Cumulus cells play a crucial role as essential mediators in the maturation of ova. Ginger contains 10-gingerol, which induces apoptosis in  cells. Based on this hypothesis, this study aimed to determine whether 10-gingerol is able to induce apoptosis in normal cells, namely, cumulus cells.This study used an  analysis by culturing Cumulus cells in M199 containing 10-gingerol in various concentrations (12, 16, and 20 μM) and later detected early apoptotic activity using an Annexin V-FITC detection kit.The  data revealed that the number of apoptosis cells increased along with the period of incubation as follows: 12 μM (63.71% ± 2.192%); 16 μM (74.51% ± 4.596%); and 20 μM (78.795% ± 1.435%).

Outcome measurements of metabolic responses, inflammatory markers and gut bacterial composition were analysed at the end of each 42-day supplementation period.Both IPE and inulin supplementation improved insulin resistance compared with cellulose supplementation, measured by homeostatic model assessment 2 (mean±SEM 1.23±0.17 IPE vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.001; 1.17±0.15 inulin vs 1.59±0.17 cellulose, p=0.009), with no differences between IPE and inulin (p=0.272). Fasting insulin was only associated positively with plasma  and negatively with plasma glycine following inulin supplementation. IPE supplementation decreased proinflammatory interleukin-8 levels compared with cellulose, while inulin had no impact on the systemic inflammatory markers studied. Inulin promoted changes in gut bacterial populations at the class level (increased Actinobacteria and decreased Clostridia) and order level (decreased Clostridiales) compared with cellulose, with small differences at the species level observed between IPE and cellulose.These data demonstrate a distinctive physiological impact of raising  propionate delivery in humans, as improvements in insulin sensitivity promoted by IPE and inulin were accompanied with different effects on the plasma metabolome, gut bacterial populations and markers of systemic inflammation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Therefore, treatments targeting these factors might be a promising strategy to prevent the development of colorectal . Among a number of functional foods, various phytochemicals, including tea catechins, which have anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity properties, and medicinal agents that ameliorate metabolic disorders, might also be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal .

Understanding the functional significance of aberrant methylation in tumors remains challenging, due in part to the lack of suitable tools to actively modify methylation patterns. DNA demethylation caused by mammalian DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is transient and replication-dependent, whereas that induced by TET enzymes involves oxidized 5mC derivatives that perform poorly understood regulatory functions. Unlike animals, plants possess enzymes that directly excise unoxidized 5mC from DNA, allowing restoration of unmethylated C through base excision repair. Here, we show that expression of Arabidopsis 5mC DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME) in  cells demethylates and reactivates hypermethylated silenced loci. Interestingly, DME expression causes genome-wide changes that include both DNA methylation losses and gains, and partially restores the methylation pattern observed in normal tissue. Furthermore, such methylome reprogramming is accompanied by altered cell cycle responses and increased sensibility to anti-tumor drugs, decreased ability to form colonospheres, and tumor growth impairment in vivo. Our study shows that it is possible to reprogram a human  DNA methylome by expression of a plant DNA demethylase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426807>Improving the anticancer effect of afatinib and microRNA by using lipid polymeric nanoparticles conjugated with dual pH-responsive and targeting peptides.</a></h2><p>The emergence of resistance to chemotherapy or target therapy, tumor metastasis, and systemic toxicity caused by available anticancer drugs hamper the successful colorectal  (CRC) treatment. The rise in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; human epidermal growth factor receptor 1; HER1) expression and enhanced phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3 are associated with tumor resistance, metastasis and invasion, thus resulting in poor outcome of anti-CRC therapy. The use of afatinib, a pan-HER inhibitor, is a potential therapeutic approach for resistant CRC. Additionally, miR-139 has been reported to be negatively correlated with chemoresistance, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC. Hence, we develop a nanoparticle formulation consisting of a polymer core to carry afatinib or miR-139, which is surrounded by lipids modified with a targeting ligand and a pH-sensitive penetrating peptide to improve the anticancer effect of cargos against CRC cells.Our findings show that this formulation displays a spherical shape with core/shell structure, homogeneous particle size distribution and negative zeta potential. The prepared formulations demonstrate a pH-sensitive release profile and an enhanced uptake of cargos into human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells in response to the acidic pH. This nanoparticle formulation incorporating afatinib and miR-139 exhibits low toxicity to normal cells but shows a better inhibitory effect on Caco-2 cells than other formulations. Moreover, the encapsulation of afatinib and miR-139 in peptide-modified nanoparticles remarkably induces apoptosis and inhibits migration and resistance of Caco-2 cells via suppression of pan-HER  kinase/multidrug resistance/metastasis pathways.This study proposes a multifunctional nanoparticle formulation for targeted modulation of apoptosis/EGFR/HER/EMT/resistance/progression pathways to increase the sensitivity of  cells to afatinib.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772447>Imatinib inhibits the regrowth of human  cells after treatment with 5-FU and cooperates with vitamin D analogue PRI-2191 in the downregulation of expression of stemness-related genes in 5-FU refractory cells.</a></h2><p>Conventional cytotoxic drugs preferentially eliminate differentiated  cells but spare relatively more resistant stem-like  cells capable to initiate recurrence. Due to  cell plasticity, the stem-like phenotype can be also acquired by  cells refractory to treatment with cytotoxic drugs. We investigated whether drugs inhibiting receptor  kinases could be used to target human  cells initiating  regrowth following conventional cytotoxic treatment. The moderately differentiated cell line HT-29 and poorly differentiated cell line HCT-116 were exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cells that resisted the exposure to 5-FU were subsequently treated with imatinib or sunitinib. Both drugs reduced clonogenicity of 5-FU-refractory cells under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. The expression of numerous stemness-related genes was upregulated in  cells following the exposure to 5-FU, and remained at a high level in 5-FU-refractory cells undergoing renewal under normoxia, but decreased spontaneously under hypoxia. Imatinib downregulated the expression of stemness-related genes in cells undergoing renewal under normoxia. A combination of imatinib with PRI-2191, an analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, downregulated stemness-related genes in HCT-116/5-FU cells more efficiently than imatinib alone. A synthetic analogue of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (PRI-1906) abolished the effect of imatinib on gene expression in HCT-116/5-FU cells undergoing renewal under normoxia. Sunitinib promoted shift of phenotype of HT-29/5-FU cells undergoing renewal toward stem-like one. It suggests that the phenotype shift toward stemness induced by sequential sunitinib treatment following 5-FU treatment could increase a risk of  recurrence. In contrast to sunitinib, imatinib could be used both to interfere with  regrowth after conventional chemotherapy and to downregulate the expression of stemness-related genes in residual  cells capable to initiate  recurrence. The findings suggest that imatinib could also be combined with vitamin D analogue PRI-2191 to prevent recurrence more efficiently than imatinib alone and to compensate for vitamin D deficiency resulting from imatinib treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TC-PTP locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in patients. To further understand how TC-PTP is related to IBDs, we investigated the role of TC-PTP in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using an in vivo genetic approach. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of TC-PTP was achieved in a mouse model at steady state and in the context of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Knockout (KO) of TC-PTP in IECs did not result in an altered intestinal barrier. However, upon DSS treatment, IEC-specific TC-PTP KO mice displayed a more severe colitis phenotype with a corresponding increase in the immune response and inflammatory cytokine profile. The absence of TC-PTP caused an altered turnover of IECs, which is further explained by the role of the  phosphatase in  stem cell (CoSC) proliferation. Our results suggest a novel role for TC-PTP in regulating the homeostasis of CoSC proliferation. This supports the protective function of TC-PTP against IBDs, independently of its previously demonstrated role in intestinal immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29844931>Dasatinib reduces 5-Fu-triggered apoptosis in  carcinoma by directly modulating Src-dependent caspase-9 phosphorylation.</a></h2><p>Preclinical data have revealed the inhibitory effect of dasatinib on .

This study was designed to explore whether dasatinib disturbed 5-Fu-triggered apoptosis in  carcinoma. As a result, we established that Src was able to directly phosphorylate caspase-9 at  251, leading to elevated caspase-9 activity. Dasatinib dramatically decreased 5-Fu triggered apoptosis in  carcinoma via suppression of Src activation.

The coexistence of the T790M resistance mutation with another EGFR mutation in treatment-naive patients has been associated with a shorter progression-free survival to EGFR inhibition than in the absence of the T790M mutation. To test this hypothesis clinically, we developed a proof-of-concept study, in which patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC were treated with the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, stratified by the presence of the pretreatment T790M mutation.BELIEF was an international, multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial done at 29 centres in eight European countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had treatment-naive, pathologically confirmed stage IIIB or stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with a confirmed, activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation). Patients received oral erlotinib 150 mg per day and intravenous bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days and were tested centrally for the pretreatment T790M resistance mutation with a peptide nucleic acid probe-based real-time PCR. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The primary efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and was stratified into two parallel substudies according to the centrally confirmed pretreatment T790M mutation status of enrolled patients (T790M positive or negative).

Metastasis‑associated in ‑1 (MACC‑1) has been demonstrated to be significantly expressed in cases of NSCLC and promotes tumor cell migration and metastasis through transactivation of the metastasis‑inducing hepatocyte growth factor/MET proto‑gene, receptor  kinase (HGF/MET) signaling pathway. The present study constructed a chimeric antibody (Chanti‑MACC‑1) targeting MACC‑1 and investigated its potential as a molecular therapeutic target in the treatment of NSCLC therapy. The expression of MACC‑1 was detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in lung  cell lines and tissues. MTT assay was used to detect proliferation of A549 cells treated by Chanti‑MACC‑1, whereas the functional and regulatory effects of Chanti‑MACC‑1 in the migration and metastasis of NSCLC cells was investigated by a cell invasion assay. The therapeutic effect and survival time was observed in animal models. The results demonstrated that MACC‑1 expression was increased and overexpression of MACC‑1 promoted the progression of the cell cycle, significantly promoted NSCLC cell growth and enhanced tumor migration and invasion through the HGF/MET signaling pathway. It was further demonstrated that Chanti‑MACC‑1 efficiently suppressed MACC‑1 expression and significantly inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by blocking the HGF/MET signaling pathway. The data revealed that Chanti‑MACC‑1 was not only beneficial for tumor remission, however additionally contributed to the long‑term survival of NSCLC ‑bearing mice. The findings of the present study indicated that MACC‑1 was significantly upregulated and promoted tumor cell growth and migration in NSCLC cells and tissues via transactivation of the metastasis‑inducing HGF/MET signaling pathway. However, Chanti‑MACC‑1significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, which suggested that MACC‑1 may be essential for tumor initiation and progression by negatively regulating tumor suppressors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28331317>Cyclic RGD peptide-modified liposomal drug delivery system for targeted oral apatinib administration: enhanced cellular uptake and improved therapeutic effects.</a></h2><p>Apatinib is an oral  kinase inhibitor, which selectively targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and has the potential to treat many tumors therapeutically. Cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (cRGD)- and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified liposomes (cRGD-Lipo-PEG) were constructed to act as a targeted delivery system for the delivery of apatinib to the human   cell line, HCT116. These cRGD-modified liposomes specifically recognized integrin αβ and exhibited greater uptake efficiency with respect to delivering liposomes into HCT116 cells when compared to nontargeted liposomes (Lipo-PEG), as well as greater death of tumor cells and apoptosis. The mechanism by which cRGD-Lipo-PEG targets cells was elucidated further with competition assays. To determine the anticancer efficacy in vivo, nude mice were implanted with HCT116 xenografts and treated with apatinib-loaded liposomes or free apatinib intravenously or via intragastric administration. The active and passive targeting of cRGD-Lipo-PEG led to significant tumor treatment targeting ability, better inhibition of tumor growth, and less toxicity when compared with treatments using uncombined apatinib.

It is a common malignancy in China with obvious reginal distribution. NPC is a polygenic disease that is affected by numerous factors. Protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 12 (PTPN12) regulates multiple tumor proliferation and development, including breast  and . However, the role of PTPN12 in NPC occurrence and development has not been elucidated.NPC cell line CNE2 was cultured in vitro and divided into three groups, including control, empty plasmid, and PTPN12 groups.

Cell migration was determined by wound healing assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by caspase 3 activity detection. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression was assessed by Western blot.PTPN12 plasmid transfection increased PTPN12 mRNA and protein expressions, suppressed cell proliferation and migration, reduced EGFR level, and enhanced caspase 3 activity compared with control and empty plasmid groups (p < 0.05).PTPN12 regulates NPC proliferation and migration through negative regulating EGFR.

Until now, the specific ceRNA regulatory mechanism of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA in colorectal  (CRC) still remains unclear.RNA sequencing data of 478  adenocarcinoma cases and 41 controls as well as 166 rectum adenocarcinoma cases and 10 controls were obtained from The  Genome Atlas (TCGA) to investigate the significant changes of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in colorectal carcinogenesis. The target lncRNAs and mRNAs of miRNAs were predicted by miRWalk. Functional and enrichment analyses were conducted by DAVID database. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape.We constructed ceRNA regulatory networks including 22 up-regulated lncRNAs, 12 down-regulated miRNAs and 122 up-regulated mRNAs, as well as 8 down-regulated lncRNAs, 43 up-regulated miRNAs and 139 down-regulated mRNAs. The GO enrichment showed that up-regulated genes mainly enriched in biological process including organic anion transport, collagen catabolic process, wound healing, Wnt receptor signalling and in pathways of  metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, melanogenesis and phenylalanine metabolism. For down-regulated genes, significant enrichment was found in biological process of metal ion homeostasis, transmission of nerve impulse, cell-cell signalling, transmembrane transport and in pathways of ABC transporters, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, retinol metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis.We identified significantly altered lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in colorectal carcinogenesis, which might serve as potential biomarkers for tumorigenesis of CRC. In addition, the ceRNA regulatory network of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA was constructed, which would elucidate novel molecular mechanisms involved in initiation and progression of CRC, thus providing promising clues for clinical diagnosis and therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28195169>Untargeted metabolomics of  digests reveals kynurenine pathway metabolites, dityrosine and 3-dehydroxycarnitine as red versus white meat discriminating metabolites.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological research has demonstrated that the consumption of red meat is an important risk factor for the development of colorectal  (CRC), diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. However, there is no holistic insight in the (by-) products of meat digestion that may contribute to disease development. To address this hiatus, an untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics approach was used to create red versus white meat associated metabolic fingerprints following in vitro  digestion using the fecal inocula of ten healthy volunteers. Twenty-two metabolites were unequivocally associated with simulated  digestion of red meat. Several of these metabolites could mechanistically be linked to red meat-associated pathways including N'-formylkynurenine, kynurenine and kynurenic acid (all involved in tryptophan metabolism), the oxidative stress marker dityrosine, and 3-dehydroxycarnitine.

Eph family receptor-interacting proteins (Ephrins) are ligands for those receptors. Eph/ephrin system is responsible for the cytoskeleton activity, cell adhesion, intercellular connection, cellular shape as well as cell motility. It affects neuron development and functioning, bone and glucose homeostasis, immune system and correct function of enterocytes. Moreover Eph/ephrin system is one of the crucial ones in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. With such a wide range of impact it is clear that disturbed function of this system leads to pathology. Eph/ephrin system is involved in carcinogenesis and  progression. Although the idea of participation of ephrin in carcinogenesis is obvious, the exact way remains unclear because of complex bi-directional signaling and cross-talks with other pathways.

Translational activation of proto-oncogenes through loss-of-uORF mutations has been demonstrated, yet a systematic search for -associated genetic alterations in uORFs is lacking. Here, we applied a PCR-based, multiplex identifier-tagged deep sequencing approach to screen 404 uORF translation initiation sites of 83 human  kinases and 49 other proto-oncogenes in 308 human malignancies. We identified loss-of-function uORF mutations in EPHB1 in two samples derived from breast and , and in MAP2K6 in a sample of  adenocarcinoma. Both mutations were associated with enhanced translation, suggesting that loss-of-uORF-mediated translational induction of the downstream main protein coding sequence may have contributed to carcinogenesis. Computational analysis of whole exome sequencing datasets of 464  adenocarcinomas subsequently revealed another 53 non-recurrent somatic mutations functionally deleting 22 uORF initiation and 31 uORF termination codons, respectively. These data provide evidence for somatic mutations affecting uORF initiation and termination codons in human .

Because many medical conditions progress asymptomatically over extended periods of time, their timely diagnosis remains difficult, and this adversely affects patient prognosis. Focusing on hypercalcemia associated with , we aimed to develop a synthetic biology-inspired biomedical tattoo using engineered cells that would (i) monitor long-term blood calcium concentration, (ii) detect onset of mild hypercalcemia, and (iii) respond via subcutaneous accumulation of the black pigment melanin to form a visible tattoo. For this purpose, we designed cells containing an ectopically expressed calcium-sensing receptor rewired to a synthetic signaling cascade that activates expression of transgenic tyrosinase, which produces melanin in response to persistently increased blood Ca We confirmed that the melanin-generated color change produced by this biomedical tattoo could be detected with the naked eye and optically quantified. The system was validated in wild-type mice bearing subcutaneously implanted encapsulated engineered cells. All animals inoculated with hypercalcemic breast and  adenocarcinoma cells developed tattoos, whereas no tattoos were seen in animals inoculated with normocalcemic tumor cells. All tumor-bearing animals remained asymptomatic throughout the 38-day experimental period.

Whereas its function is largely characterized in hematopoietic cells, its role in epithelial cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), is not well known. Here, we generated mice with an IEC-specific knockout of  (Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1; ). We showed that the loss of epithelial  leads to an intestinalomegaly that is associated with an increase in epithelial cell proliferation and size. Histologic analysis demonstrates significant perturbation of the crypt-villus architecture with an apparent increase in the number of goblet and Paneth cells and increased expression of their respective markers { (mucin 2), α, and  [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9]}. Expansion of intermediate cells-common progenitors of goblet and Paneth cell lineages-is also observed in  mice. Although sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is observed,  mice fail to develop any intestinal tumors after 15 mo; however, the loss of  in IECs markedly enhances tumor load  mice.

To understand the contrasting roles of PTK7 in tumorigenesis, we analyzed the tumorigenic characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells with low levels of endogenous PTK7 expression (TE-5 and TE-14 cells) and high levels of expression (TE-6 and TE-10 cells) after transfections with a PTK7 expression vector. PTK7 overexpression increased the proliferation of TE-5 and TE-14 cells but decreased the proliferation of TE-6 and TE-10 cells. In the ESCC cells, proliferation, migration, and invasion were initially increased and then decreased according to PTK7 expression levels, which were mirrored by initial increases and then decreases in the  phosphorylation of cellular proteins and phosphorylation of Src, Akt, and ERK. In ESCC patients included in The  Genome Atlas database, those with higher PTK7 mRNA levels had a longer overall survival and lower relative risk than those with lower PTK7 mRNA levels.

Particularly, Chk1 phosphorylation is related to  prognosis and therapeutic resistance. Some receptor  kinases participate in the regulation of Chk1 phosphorylation; however, the effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on Chk1 phosphorylation is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that HGF moderately activated Chk1 phosphorylation in  cells by upregulating TopBP1 and RAD51, and promoting TopBP1-ATR complex formation. Furthermore, AKT activity, which was promoted by HGF, served as an important mediator linking HGF/MET signaling and Chk1 phosphorylation. Depleting AKT activity attenuated basal expression of p-Chk1 and HGF-induced Chk1 activation. Moreover, AKT activity directly regulated TopBP1 and RAD51 expression. AKT inhibition suppressed HGF-induced upregulation of TopBP1 and RAD51, and enhanced TopBP1/ATR complex formation. Our results show that HGF was involved in regulating Chk1 phosphorylation, and further demonstrate that AKT activity was responsible for this HGF-induced Chk1 phosphorylation.

Multiple specimens were collected and analyzed for staining intensity and percentage of tumor cells positive for p65BTK. Prognostic impact was tested by univariate Cox regression analysis.After a median follow-up of 82.59 months, median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 11.67 months and 31.33 months, respectively. Interestingly, 10% of patients did not express p65BTK. For the immunohistochemistry IHC intensity 1, the best cutoff point was 1% of p65BTK positivity; for IHC intensity 2, it was 50%; and for IHC intensity 3, it was 80%. Through univariate analysis, patients with highly expressed p65BTK (IHC intensity 3 and ≥80%) were shown to have the worst prognosis in terms of DFS (HR: 6.23;  = 0.005; 95% C.I. 1.75-22.79) and OS (HR: 2.54;  = 0.025; 95% C.I. 1.12-5.76).p65BTK is frequently expressed in CRC and, if highly expressed, is an unfavourable prognostic factor.

Targeted therapies have more efficacy and less toxicity than standard treatments. One of the most relevant -specific actionable targets are receptor  kinases (RTKs) whose role in CC need to be better investigated.We have analysed 37 CC patients using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Comprehensive  Panel (CCP). We have confirmed the somatic nature of RET variants through Sanger sequencing and assessed RET activation status and protein expression by immunofluorescence and western-blot analyses. We have used RET mutant expression vectors to evaluate the effect of selected mutations in HEK293 cells by performing proliferation, migration and clonogenic assays.Among the 409 -related genes included in the CCP we have focused on the RTKs. Overall, we have observed 101 different potentially damaging variants distributed across 31 RTK genes in 28 patients. The most frequently mutated RTKs were FLT4, ROS1, EPH7, ERBB2, EGFR, RET, FGFR3 and FGFR4. In particular, we have identified 4 different somatic variants in 10% of CC patients in RET proto-oncogene. Among them, we have demonstrated that the G533C variant was able to activate RET by promoting dimer formation and enhancing Y1062 phosphorylation. Moreover, we have demonstrated that RET G533C variant was able to stimulate anchorage-dependent proliferation, migration and clonogenic cell survival.

Key to this process is the identification of signaling pathways (or receptors) specific to (or overexpressed in) disease cells. In this context, fragment-based ligand discovery (FBLD) has significantly expanded our view of the ligandable proteome and affords tool compounds for biological inquiry. To date, such covalent ligand discovery has almost exclusively employed cysteine-reactive small-molecule fragments. However, functional cysteine residues in proteins are often redox-sensitive and can undergo oxidation in cells. Such reactions are particularly relevant in diseases, like , which are linked to excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Once oxidized, the sulfur atom of cysteine is much less reactive toward electrophilic groups used in the traditional FBLD paradigm. To address this limitation, we recently developed a novel library of diverse carbon-based nucleophile fragments that react selectively with cysteine sulfenic acid formed in proteins via oxidation or hydrolysis reactions. Here, we report analysis of sulfenic acid-reactive C-nucleophile fragments screened against a  cell proteome. Covalent ligands were identified for >1280 S-sulfenylated cysteines present in "druggable" proteins and orphan targets, revealing disparate reactivity profiles and target preferences.

These included HCT116, HCT116.p53 mutant, RKO, and RKO.p53 lines (all from  cancers) as well as breast  cell lines MCF7 and 1001 (MCF7-p53 mutant clone). HeLa cell line was used as a positive control for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). AXL expression was determined by Western blotting using rabbit monoclonal antibody clone C89E7. AXL siRNA silencing was performed and followed by collagen invasion assay. Cell viability analysis using the sulforhodamine B assay and the invasion assay were performed after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin for breast  cells; 5FU or irinotecan for  cells).We showed that the introduction of p53 mutations or knockout increased expression levels of AXL in isogenic cells compared to the matching p53 wild-type parental cells. Overall, we found a trend for correlation between the potential EMT candidate AXL, p53 alterations, and EMT markers in colorectal and breast cancers. The expression of AXL in RKO cells, a rare  cell line with inactive Wnt signaling, suggests that the AXL oncogene might provide an alternative genetic pathway for colorectal carcinogenesis in the absence of Wnt signaling activation and  mutation. AXL silencing in the  mutant isogenic cell lines 1001, HCT116.p53 mutant and RKO.P53 was > 95% efficient and the silenced cells were less invasive compared to the parental  wild-type cells. AXL silencing showed a subtle trend to restore  cell sensitivity to 5FU or irinotecan. Importantly, AXL expressing cells developed more invasive potential after exposure to chemotherapy compared to the AXL-silenced cells.AXL is influenced by p53 status and could cause the emergence of aggressive clones after exposure to chemotherapy. These findings could have applications in  management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29684854>The role of Her2-Nrf2 axis in induction of oxaliplatin resistance in  cells.</a></h2><p>Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a pivotal role in promoting chemoresistance by regulation of antioxidants and detoxification enzymes. Her2 is a member of  kinase receptor family with a key function in resistance of  cells to chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible cross talk between Nrf2 and Her2 mediated signaling pathways in development of oxaliplatin resistance in  cells. We first generated oxaliplatin-resistant LS174T and SW480  cells with different Her2 expression levels by employing IC50 concentrations followed by a resting period. We evaluated the viability and apoptosis of the cells by MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Nrf2 and Her2 gene expression levels were examined by qRT-PCR. The morphology analysis and combination index calculation were performed using the ImagJ and CompuSyn softwares, respectively. Development of resistant cells revealed a marked increase in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value from 3.95 ± 0.92 μM to 29.27 ± 3.13 μM in SW480 cells and 377 ± 46 nM to 9.59 ± 0.76 μM in LS174T cells with a significant change in morphology of the cells from elongated to small round shape (p < 0.05). Her2 expression level was increased in both types of resistant cells, but the Nrf2 expression was increased in LS174T resistant (LS174T/Res) cells and decreased in SW480/Res cells which were consistent with the level of resistance in these cells (25 fold increase in IC50 value in LS174T/Res cells versus 7 fold increase in this value in SW480/Res cells). Inhibition of either Nrf2 or Her2 alone and in combination caused a significant increase in oxaliplatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis with maximum effects in SW480/Res cells with low Her2 and Nrf2 expression levels. Altogether, our results suggest that inhibition of Nrf2 signaling in  patients with Her2 overexpression can be considered as an important strategy to overcome oxaliplatin resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

PTPRK dephosphorylates CD133, which is a stem cell marker; phosphorylated CD133 accelerates xenograft tumor growth of  cells through the activation of AKT, but the functional significance of this has remained elusive. In this study, we have demonstrated that knockdown of PTPRK potentiates the pro-oncogenic CD133-AKT pathway in  cells. Intriguingly, depletion of PTPRK significantly reduced sensitivity to the anti- drug oxaliplatin and was accompanied by up-regulation of phosphorylation of Bad, a downstream target of AKT. Together, our present observations strongly suggest that the CD133-PTPRK axis plays a pivotal role in the regulation of  progression as well as drug resistance.© 2019 The Authors.

Clinically approved multi-kinase inhibitors, such as nilotinib, inhibit DDR1-mediated tumor growth in xenograft models, suggesting DDR1 might be a potential target for  treatments. Here, we employed an antibody-based strategy with a novel anti-DDR1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for  carcinoma treatment. We developed T H -DM4, an ADC targeting DDR1 which carries the tubulin inhibitor payload DM4. Immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray containing 100  specimens revealed that DDR1 was highly expressed in 81% of tumor tissues. Meanwhile, high expression of DDR1 was associated with poor survival in patients. In vitro, T H -DM4 exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ) values in the nanomolar range in a panel of  cell lines. In vivo, the antitumor efficacy of T H -DM4 was evaluated in three  cell lines expressing different levels of DDR1. T H -DM4 achieved complete tumor regression at doses of 5 and 10 mg·kg in HT-29 and HCT116 tumor models. Moreover, a correlation between in vivo efficacy of T H -DM4 and the levels of DDR1 expression on the cell surface was observed. Tumor cell proliferation was caused by the induction of mitotic arrest, indicating that the antitumor effect in vivo was mediated by DM4. In addition, T H -DM4 was efficacious in oxaliplatin-resistant  models. In exploratory safety studies, T H -DM4 exhibited no overt toxicities when multi-doses were administered at 10 mg·kg into BALB/c nude mice or when a single dose up to 50 mg·kg was administered into BALB/c mice. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of DDR1-targeted ADC and may facilitate the development of a new effective therapeutic strategy for .© 2019 The Authors.

Preclinical studies indicate that several FGFR -kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as AZD4547, have in vitro activity against the -amplified colorectal cell line, NCI-H716. The efficacy of these inhibitors is currently under investigation in clinical trials for breast and gastric . Thus, better characterizing colorectal tumors for  amplification could identify a subset of patients who may benefit from FGFR TKI therapies. Here, we describe a novel  amplification identified by clinical next-generation sequencing in a primary colorectal . Further characterization of the tumor by immunohistochemistry showed neuroendocrine differentiation, similar to the reported properties of the NCI-H716 cell line. These findings demonstrate that the spectrum of potentially clinically actionable mutations detected by targeted clinical sequencing panels is not limited to only single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions but also to copy-number alterations.© 2017 Carter et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620204>Placenta-specific protein 8 promotes the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their tolerance to an epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor by activating the ERK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Placenta-specific protein 8 (PLAC8) is a conserved protein with a molecular weight of 12.5 kDa. The specific function of this protein has not been fully elucidated, however, PLAC8 has been found to play an important tumor regulatory role in certain types of , including , pancreatic and liver . PLAC8 also participates in the regulation of the cell cycle, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and other cellular functions, indicating its potential as a molecular target worth further investigation. The present study investigated the effect of PLAC8 on the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their sensitivity to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor  kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). It was found that the inhibition of PLAC8 expression in PC-9 cells resulted in significantly decreased proliferation, whereas overexpression of PLAC8 significantly increased the proliferation (P<0.05) of PC-9 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLAC8 expression resulted in decreased activity of the ERK signaling pathway, while PLAC8 overexpression increased activity of this pathway. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway with U0126 reversed the effects induced by inhibiting or overexpressing PLAC8 on cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of PLAC8 significantly decreased the sensitivity of PC-9 cells to gefitinib, and this effect was reversed by U0126. Overall, these results suggest that PLAC8 is involved in the regulation of proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and impacts their sensitivity to an EGFR-TKI. Thus, PLAC8 is a potential novel target in lung adenocarcinoma for future studies.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784162>Csk-homologous kinase (Chk) is an efficient inhibitor of Src-family kinases but a poor catalyst of phosphorylation of their C-terminal regulatory .</a></h2><p>C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and Csk-homologous kinase (Chk) are the major endogenous inhibitors of Src-family kinases (SFKs). They employ two mechanisms to inhibit SFKs. First, they phosphorylate the C-terminal tail  which stabilizes SFKs in a closed inactive conformation by engaging the SH2 domain in cis. Second, they employ a non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism involving direct binding of Csk and Chk to the active forms of SFKs that is independent of phosphorylation of their C-terminal tail. Csk and Chk are co-expressed in many cell types. Contributions of the two mechanisms towards the inhibitory activity of Csk and Chk are not fully clear. Furthermore, the determinants in Csk and Chk governing their inhibition of SFKs by the non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism are yet to be defined.We determined the contributions of the two mechanisms towards the inhibitory activity of Csk and Chk both in vitro and in transduced colorectal  cells. Specifically, we assayed the catalytic activities of Csk and Chk in phosphorylating a specific peptide substrate and a recombinant SFK member Src. We employed surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to measure the kinetic parameters of binding of Csk, Chk and their mutants to a constitutively active mutant of the SFK member Hck. Finally, we determined the effects of expression of recombinant Chk on anchorage-independent growth and SFK catalytic activity in Chk-deficient colorectal  cells.Our results revealed Csk as a robust enzyme catalysing phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail  of SFKs but a weak non-catalytic inhibitor of SFKs. In contrast, Chk is a poor catalyst of SFK tail phosphorylation but binds SFKs with high affinity, enabling it to efficiently inhibit SFKs with the non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism both in vitro and in transduced colorectal  cells. Further analyses mapped some of the determinants governing this non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism of Chk to its kinase domain.SFKs are activated by different upstream signals to adopt multiple active conformations in cells. SFKs adopting these conformations can effectively be constrained by the two complementary inhibitory mechanisms of Csk and Chk. Furthermore, the lack of this non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism accounts for SFK overactivation in the Chk-deficient colorectal  cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30294327>Functional Inhibitory Siglec-6 Is Upregulated in Human Colorectal -Associated Mast Cells.</a></h2><p>Mast cells (MC) accumulate in colorectal  (CRC) and the relationship between MC density and  progression has been well recognized. MC can be either pro-tumor or anti-tumor players, depending on the local factors present in the tumor microenvironment. Upon malignant transformation,  cells express high levels of sialic acids on cell membrane or by secretion. Siglecs are a family of immunoglobulin-like receptors that bind sialic acids and each subtype has a distinct pattern of expression on immune cells. Among them, Siglec-6 is expressed predominately by MC. However, the function of Siglec-6 in MC is largely unexplored and whether it is expressed by CRC-associated MC remains unknown. In this study, we explored the function of Siglec-6 in CD34 derived human MC. MC activation was initiated by IgE crosslinking with or without preincubation of anti-Siglec-6 Ab. Siglec-6 engagement significantly attenuated IgE-dependent MC degranulation as measured by ß-hexosaminidase release and CD63 expression. Interestingly, the production of GM-CSF was also shown reduced upon Siglec-6 engagement. To mimic the milieu of CRC, we cultured primary human MC with  cells or under hypoxia and Siglec-6 was then measured on these conditioned MC. Coculture with  cells (HT29 and Caco2) induced upregulation of Siglec-6 on MC. In comparison, normal  cells (CCD841) had no effect. Also, a time-dependent increase of Siglec-6 by MC was observed under 1% O. Immunohistochemistry of CRC tissue showed expression of Siglec-6 by MC in submucosa. Lectin immunochemistry revealed the presence of actual ligands for Siglec-6 in human CRC tissues. Together, our findings illustrate that Siglec-6 is a functionally inhibitory receptor on MC and suggest that Siglec-6 expression may be relevant for MC activity in the tumor microenvironment of CRC.</p></html>
