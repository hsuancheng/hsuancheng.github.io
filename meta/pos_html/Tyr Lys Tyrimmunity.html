Because granulocytes play an important role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, the effects of this drug on the functional activities of these cells were investigated. MMF stimulated polarization and elastase release, and enhanced the intracellular killing of bacteria by granulocytes. This compound suppressed the formyl-Met-Nle-Phe (FMLP)-stimulated respiratory burst in these cells. MMF and dimethylfumarate but not its stereoisomer dimethylmaleate, fumaric acid, or dimethylmalate stimulated polarization of and elastase release by granulocytes, indicating that methylated fumarate derivatives interact with granulocytes in a specific fashion. MMF did not affect the binding of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle--fluorescein isothiocyanate to the FMLP receptor on granulocytes. This compound induced an increase in the intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) and cyclic adenosine monophsphate concentration. The agonistic effects of MMF on granulocytes are thought to be mediated by the rise in the [Ca++]i and the antagonistic effects by the increase in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration. These effects of MMF on granulocytes may in part explain the beneficial action of methylated fumarate derivatives on psoriatic skin lesions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2691283>Solid phase enzyme immunoassay of human interleukin 2 utilizing antibodies against synthetic IL-2 peptides.</a></h1><p>In the present study, solid phase enzyme immunoassay utilizing antibodies against synthetic IL-2 peptides was used for quantitative measurements of human recombinant and lymphoid IL-2 preparations. The 27-peptide MCF-III-6 (Leu-Glu-His-Leu-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Gln-Met-Ile-Leu-Asn-Gly-Ile-Asn-Asn-- -Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu-Thr-Arg-Met-Leu) that comprises the region 14-40 from the IL-2 amino acid sequence was synthesized and used for immunization of rabbits. Resulting anti-MCF-III-6 polyvalent rabbit antibodies reacted specifically in EIA up to dilution of 10(-7) with the MCF-III-6 peptide used for immunization as well as with 16-peptide I-16 (Cys-Nle-Gly-Ile-Asn-Asn--Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu-Thr-Arg-Met-Leu) that comprises the region 27-40 from the IL-2 amino acid sequence. The anti-MCF-III-6 antibody reacted also with human recombinant IL-2 preparations obtained from three producers (Cetus, Riga and Amersham), to the concentration of 0.1 ng/ml, and with various human lymphoid IL-2 preparations. Direct correlation was observed between quantitative measurements of human lymphoid IL-2 by EIA and by CTLL bioassay. It can be concluded that utilization of synthetic IL-2 peptides provides a suitable and comparatively unexpensive immunogen for the production of IL-2 antibodies and that the solid phase EIA using such antibodies can be employed as a rapid, reproducible, and sensitive method for quantitative examination of both recombinant and lymphoid IL-2 preparations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2444471>Localization of a receptor binding site on the IL-2 molecule.</a></h1><p>The present study was performed to localize in the IL-2 molecule the active site responsible for interaction with the IL-2 receptor. To predict the receptor binding site on the IL-2 molecule, a computer programme based on the hypothesis that the active site will contain parts of the protein molecule having a high tendency to form a bend was utilized. The tendency to form a bend was evaluated by assessing the probability of beta-turn occurrence; the highest probability was found in the tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu, occupying the positions 33-36 of the IL-2 molecule. Accordingly, the hexadecapeptide H-Cys-Nle-Gly-Ile-Asn-Asn--Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu-Thr-Arg-Met-Leu-NH2 that spans over the predicted tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Lys-Leu and comprises the region 27-40 from the IL-2 amino acid sequence was synthesized. This synthetic (I-16) peptide was found to selectively inhibit the IL-2-dependent uptake of 3H-TDR by CTLL cells, apparently by competing with IL-2 for the IL-2 receptor. The synthetic I-16 hexadecapeptide was conjugated to carrier (BSA) protein and used for immunization of rabbits. Resulting I-16 antibodies were capable of binding specifically to the I-16 hexadecapeptide in indirect ELISA test; they reacted substantially with IL-2-producing but not with IL-2-non-producing Jurkat cells in indirect cell membrane immunofluorescence, and inhibited activation of killer spleen cells with human recombinant IL-2 as detected by 51Cr microcytotoxicity assay. Taken together, these results suggest that at least one of the receptor contact sites of the IL-2 is localized within the N-terminal part of the molecule in the region defined by amino acids 27-40 and coded for by the exon 1 and 2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7734243>Imaging the spatial distribution of membrane receptors during neutrophil phagocytosis.</a></h1><p>Optical microscopy and image processing have been employed to study the distribution of several cell surface receptors on living human neutrophils during opsonin-dependent and opsonin-independent phagocytosis. Receptors were labeled using fluorescein-, rhodamine-, or AMCA-conjugated F(ab')2 fragments of anti-Fc gamma RIIIB (CD16), anti-CR3 (CD11b/CD18), and anti-uPAR (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) antibodies, intact phycoerythrin-labeled interleukin 8, and fluorescein- or rhodamine-labeled Con A (concanavalin A), Boc-PLPLP (tert-butyl-oxycarbonyl-Phe(D)-Leu-Phe(D)-Leu-Phe-OH), and N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-. Labeled neutrophils were observed during the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes and nonopsonized latex beads, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. To quantitate receptor distribution, cells were divided into four quadrants with the first being the point of attachment and the fourth being opposite the point of attachment. Ligated formyl peptide receptors, and to a lesser extent CR3, accumulated at the sites of target internalization for all forms of phagocytosis examined. However, Fc gamma RIIIB, uPAR, IL-8, Con A, and the FPR antagonist FBoc-PLPLP were not polarized on cells during phagocytosis. These data suggest that agonist-labeled formyl peptide receptors may play a broader role in leukocyte function than previously suggested, including possible participation in phagocytosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2413110>Fine specificity of antigen recognition by T cell hybridoma clones specific for poly-18: a synthetic polypeptide antigen of defined sequence and conformation.</a></h1><p>Antigen-specific T cell blasts to poly-18, a polypeptide antigen of defined sequence and conformation, were generated from lymph nodes of antigen-primed BALB/cCr mice. These blasts were fused with the BW5147 thymoma to obtain anti-poly-18-reactive T cell hybridomas. All of the hybridomas were IAd-restricted and secreted IL2 in the presence of IAd/poly-18. On the basis of fine specificity analysis, these hybridomas were classified into two groups. Group A hybridomas recognized a minimal peptide sequence of Glu--(Glu--Ala)3-Glu-, whereas Group B needed the sequence Glu--Ala-(Glu--Ala)3-Glu-/Ala for activation. Three critical residues were identified in Group A hybridomas: the alanine residue at position 9, the carboxy terminal lysine, and the lysine at position 3. In Group B hybridomas, the alanine at position 3 was found to be the critical residue. We suggest that the amino acid residue at position 3 (lysine/alanine) is the T cell receptor contact residue on the poly-18 antigen in BALB/cCr mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15769541>Directed cell migration via chemoattractants released from degradable microspheres.</a></h1><p>Chemotaxis, cell migration directed by spatial concentration gradients of chemoattractant molecules, is critical for proper function of the immune system. Materials capable of generating defined chemoattractant gradients via controlled release may be useful for the design of improved vaccines and immunotherapies that draw specific cells to an immunization site. To this end, we encapsulated formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle- (fN'LFN'YK) peptides or macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha or CCL20) in degradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres that provided sustained release for more than 2 weeks in vitro. fN'LFN'YK and MIP-3alpha chemoattract dendritic cells (DCs), the key antigen-presenting cells involved in generation of primary immune responses, and their precursors, monocytes. Using an in vitro videomicroscopy migration assay, we detected strong chemotaxis of human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs through 3D collagen gels toward microspheres releasing fN'LFN'YK. Similarly, microparticles releasing MIP-3alpha were able to attract mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Strikingly, prolonged attraction of DCs from distances up to 500 microm from the source to the point of contact with individual microspheres was observed. Such microspheres could be of general interest for the design of vaccines that promote adaptive  and as a platform for studying the biology of chemotaxis in vitro and in vivo.</p></html>
