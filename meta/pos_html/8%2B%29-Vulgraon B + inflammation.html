Advanced liver fibrosis was created in rats by means of carbon tetrachloride injections over an 8-week period. In 17 rats with liver fibrosis and eight control rats, dynamic gadoxetate-enhanced MR images of the liver were obtained during 1 hour after injection of 0.025 mmol gadoxetate per kilogram of body weight. Enhancement parameters (maximum enhancement [Emax], time to peak [Tmax], and elimination half-life) were measured on enhancement-versus-time curves, and pharmacokinetic parameters (hepatic extraction fraction [HEF] and mean residence time [MRT]) were obtained by means of deconvolution analysis of the concentration-versus-time curves in the liver and the portal vein. The parameters were correlated at simple and multiple regression analysis with the expression of the hepatic anion uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A1 (Oatp1a1), the hepatobiliary transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), and the backflux transporter Mrp4, as determined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.In rats with advanced liver fibrosis, the Emax, Tmax, HEF, and MRT decreased significantly relative to those in control rats, whereas the elimination half-life increased significantly. The enhancement and pharmacokinetic parameters correlated significantly with the expression of the transporters at simple regression analysis. At multiple regression analysis, HEF was the only parameter that was significantly associated with the expression of Oatp1a1 and Mrp2 (P < .001, r = 0.74 and P < .001, r = 0.70, respectively).The pharmacokinetic parameter HEF at dynamic gadoxetate-enhanced MR imaging is independently correlated with hepatic organic anion transporter expression.© RSNA, 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29322599>Non-invasive evaluation of portal hypertension using shear-wave elastography: analysis of two algorithms combining liver and spleen stiffness in 191 patients with cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Two algorithms based on sequential measurements of liver and spleen stiffness using two-dimensional shearwave elastography (2D-SWE) have been recently proposed to estimate clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] ≥10 mm Hg) in patients with cirrhosis, with excellent diagnostic accuracy.To validate externally these algorithms in a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis.One hundred and ninety-one patients with stable cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A 39%,  29% and C 31%) who underwent liver and spleen stiffness measurements using 2D-SWE at the time of HVPG measurement were included. Diagnostic accuracy of the 2 algorithms was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values.The first algorithm, using liver stiffness <16.0 kilopascals (kPa) and then spleen stiffness <26.6 kPa, was used to rule-out HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. In our population, its sensitivity and negative predictive value were 95% and 63% respectively. The second algorithm, using liver stiffness >38.0 kPa, or liver stiffness ≤38.0 kPa but spleen stiffness >27.9 kPa, was used to rule-in HVPG ≥10 mm Hg. In our population, its specificity and positive predictive value were 52% and 83% respectively. Restricting the analyses to the 74 patients without any history of decompensation of cirrhosis or to the 65 patients with highly reliable liver stiffness measurement did not improve the results.In our population, diagnostic accuracies of non-invasive algorithms based on sequential measurements of liver and spleen stiffness using 2D-SWE were acceptable, but not good enough to replace HVPG measurement or to base clinical decisions.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18581382>Chronic hepatitis: role of diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and .</a></h2><p>To determine the diagnostic performance of liver apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured with conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (CDI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and .Breathhold single-shot echo-planar imaging CDI and DTI with -values of 0 and 500 second/mm(2) was performed in 31 patients with chronic liver disease and 13 normal volunteers. Liver biopsy was performed in all patients with liver disease with a median delay of two days from MRI. Fibrosis and  were scored on a 5-point scale (0-4). Liver ADCs obtained with CDI and DTI were compared between patients stratified by fibrosis stage and  grade. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to evaluate the utility of the ADC measures for prediction of fibrosis and .Patients with liver fibrosis and  had significantly lower liver ADC than subjects without fibrosis or  with CDI and DTI. For prediction of fibrosis stage > or = 1 and stage > or = 2, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.848 and 0.783, sensitivity of 88.5% to 73.7%, and specificity of 73.3% to 72.7% were obtained, for ADC < or =1.40 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second and < or =1.30 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second (using CDI), respectively. For prediction of  grade > or = 1, AUC of 0.825, sensitivity of 75.0%, and specificity of 78.6% were obtained using ADC < or = 1.30 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second (using CDI). CDI performed better than DTI for diagnosis of fibrosis and .Liver ADC can be used to predict liver fibrosis and  with acceptable sensitivity and specificity.(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p></html>
