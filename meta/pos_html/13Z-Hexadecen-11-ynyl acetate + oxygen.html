We evaluated whether a perioperative multi-system optimization protocol can reduce postoperative complications in these patients.Immediately after diagnosis of hip fracture, patients ≥ 60 yr were randomized to an intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group were admitted to our postanesthesia care unit where they were treated with goal-directed hemodynamic management, optimized pain therapy,  therapy, and optimized nutrition. Patients in the control group were managed according to our usual standard of care on a regular ward. Postoperative complications during hospital stay included pre-determined cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, renal, or surgical events.The incidence of at least one postoperative complication (primary outcome) was seen in 32 of 65 (49%) controls compared with 24 of 62 (39%) in the intervention group (relative risk [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 1.17; P = 0.23). The secondary unadjusted outcomes showed that patients in the intervention group received more Ringer's  compared with controls (median difference, 1.3 L; 95% CI, 0.6 to 2.1 L; P < 0.001), had more frequently a mean arterial pressure > 70 mmHg (57% control vs 75% intervention; median percentage difference, 16%; 95% CI, 7 to 25%; P = 0.001), better pain control (numeric rating scale < 4 at all postoperative measurements; 25% control vs 81% intervention; RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.43; P < 0.001), and possibly a lower incidence of acute renal failure (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.98; P = 0.04).The implementation of a perioperative multi-system optimization protocol algorithm did not significantly reduce the risk of postoperative complications. Nevertheless, we likely over-estimated the potential treatment effect in our study design and thus were under-powered to show an effect.Clinicaltrials.gov ().

Turkey is the world's largest hazelnut producer and also ranks fifth in tea production, so a mixture of hazelnut shell, tea bush and hazelnut knot was selected as the biomass sample, and vanadium pentoxide (VO) was also used as a catalyst. Considering the biomass mixture and catalyst used, this research is unique for the literature. Bio-oils, which are obtained by catalytic and non-catalytic processes and collected in two sub-fractions, were characterised. The sub-fractions of toluene and ethyl , there was a significant increase in calorific values compared with the mixture without catalyst, because of the decrease in the amount of  and increase in the amount of carbon. The increase in this calorific value in the toluene sub-fraction is about 76% higher than the raw material mixture. In the sub-fractions of toluene and ethyl  produced by catalytic pyrolysis, an increase in carbon content was observed when compared with non-catalytic products, while the amounts of  decreased. Considering the results, the toluene sub-fraction is generally composed of phenolic structures. Generally, the ethyl  sub-fraction comprises the carbonyl group - containing ketone and aldehyde structures as well as aromatic and phenolic compounds. The resulting bio-oil has the potential to be used as a liquid fuel both in terms of calorific values and in terms of the H/C and O/C ratio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448864>Elucidating the Mechanism of Working SnO Gas Sensors Using Combined Operando UV/Vis, Raman, and IR Spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>SnO is the most widely used metal oxide gas-sensing material but a detailed understanding of its functioning is still lacking despite its relevance for applications. To gain new mechanistic insight into SnO gas sensors under working conditions, we have developed an operando approach based on combined UV/Vis, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy, allowing us for the first time to relate the sensor response to the concentration of  vacancies in the metal oxide, the nature of the adsorbates, and the gas-phase composition. We demonstrate with the example of ethanol gas sensing that the sensor resistance is directly correlated with the number of surface  vacancies and the presence of surface species, in particular,  and hydroxy groups. Our operando results enable an assessment of mechanistic models proposed in the literature to explain gas sensor operation. Owing to their fundamental nature, our findings are of direct relevance also for other metal oxide gas sensors.© 2019 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It seems that OS and associated events are crucial mechanisms of lead-induced renal dysfunction. The current study aimed to explore the potential protective effects of glycine against renal injury caused by lead in mice.Mature male mice (n=32) were allocated into four groups. The following treatment regimens were the control (vehicle-treated); Pb- (20 mg/kg/day, gavage); Pb- + glycine (500 mg/kg/day, IP); and Pb- + glycine (1,000 mg/kg/day, IP). Pb- + glycine was administered for 14 consecutive days, Pb- was given first and then glycine at least 6 hours later. On day 15, the subjects were anesthetized, and samples were collected. Serum biomarkers such as BUN and serum creatinine were monitored along with formation of reactive  species, lipid peroxidation, kidney GSH level, and histopathological changes.Based on the results, BUN and serum creatinine levels significantly increased following exposure to lead. Glycine supplementation (500 and 1,000 mg/kg, IP) decreased BUN and creatinine serum levels (<0.001). Biomarkers of OS were also reduced in renal tissue following glycine therapy in Pb-exposed mice (<0.001). Histopathological changes were observed in mice treated with lead as tubular dilation, protein cast, vacuolization, and inflammation. In this regard, glycine inhibited histopathological alterations in kidney caused by lead exposure.It was found that glycine treatment significantly mitigated Pb-induced renal injury most likely through alleviating OS and the associated deleterious outcomes on the kidney tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879129>Heparin prevents oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in human decidualized endometrial stromal cells.</a></h2><p>Clinical trials have shown that administering heparin during the luteal phase has beneficial effects on implantation and live birth rates. Heparin exerts direct effects on decidual human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), which are independent of its anticoagulant effect. However, the accurate effects of heparin on the decidualization process remain unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that HESCs become dramatically resistant to oxidative stress upon decidualization, and we hypothesize a possible direct action of heparin on the decidualization of HESCs, which would lead to improved implantation. To test this hypothesis, we established primary HESC cultures and propagated them, and then we decidualized confluent cultures with 8-bromo-cAMP, with medroxyprogesterone , and with or without heparin. We treated the cells with hydrogen peroxide (HO) as a source of reactive  species (ROS). Adding heparin to decidualized HESCs induced prolactin secretion. Decidualized HESCs treated with heparin were prevented from undergoing apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. Heparin induced nuclear accumulation of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 and expression of its downstream target, the ROS scavenger superoxide dismutase 2. These results demonstrate that heparin-treated decidualized HESCs acquired further resistance to oxidative stress, suggesting that heparin may improve the implantation environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575304>Inhibitory effects of 4-hydroperoxy-2-decenoic acid ethyl ester on phorbol ester- and TGF-β1-induced MMPs expression.</a></h2><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), zinc-containing proteinases, play a critical role in tumour progression by degrading extracellular matrix components. MMP2 and MMP9 are secreted from tumour-associated macrophages as well as tumour cells and have been implicated in the formation of the tumour microenvironment. Therefore, the inhibition of these MMPs may suppress tumour progression and metastasis. 4-Hydroperoxy-2-decenoic acid ethyl ester (HPO-DAEE) is known to cause apoptosis in the human lung cancer cell line A549 by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the effects of HPO-DAEE on tumour progression remain unclear. HPO-DAEE pre-treatment significantly suppressed phorbol 12-myristate 13- (TPA)-triggered MMP activation in human monocytic THP-1 cells. It also enhanced the expression of haem oxygenase-1, an antioxidant enzyme, and suppressed the TPA-triggered intracellular accumulation of reactive  species (ROS). Furthermore, HPO-DAEE suppressed transforming growth factor-β1-triggered human prostate cancer PC3 cell migration and this was accompanied by the inhibition of MMP expression and activities. The present results indicate that HPO-DAEE may exert inhibitory effects on tumour progression by suppressing MMP expression and activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461832>Hypoglycemic, Antiglycation, and Cytoprotective Properties of a Phenol-Rich Extract From Waste Peel of  L. var. Dente di Cavallo DC2.</a></h2><p>Pomegranate peel is a natural source of phenolics, claimed to possess healing properties, among which are antioxidant and antidiabetic. In the present study, an ethyl  extract, obtained by Soxhlet from the peel of Dente di Cavallo DC2 pomegranate (PGE) and characterized to contain 4% / of ellagic acid, has been evaluated for its hypoglycemic, antiglycation, and antioxidative cytoprotective properties, in order to provide possible evidence for future nutraceutical applications. The α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition, interference with advanced glycation end-products (AGE) formation, and metal chelating abilities were studied. Moreover, the possible antioxidant cytoprotective properties of PGE under hyperglycemic conditions were assayed. Phenolic profile of the extract was characterized by integrated chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods. PGE resulted able to strongly inhibit the tested enzymes, especially α-glucosidase, and exerted chelating and antiglycation properties. Also, it counteracted the intracellular oxidative stress under hyperglycemic conditions, by reducing the levels of reactive  species and total glutathione. Among the identified phenolics, rutin was the most abundant flavonoid (about 4 % /). Present results suggest PGE to be a possible remedy for hyperglycemia management and encourage further studies to exploit its promising properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30935903>Antigrowth activity and induction of apoptosis in human melanoma cells by Drymis winteri forst extract and its active components.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a highly invasive cancer that resists most conventional treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify alternative anticancer agents able to affect new molecular targets. Drimys winteri (Winteraceae) is a medicinal plant, employed in Brazil and many countries, in folk medicine against a variety of ailments, especially for the treatment of fevers, ulcers, pains, affections of respiratory tract and cancers. Previous phytochemical studies have isolated and identified the presence of diverse classes of secondary metabolites in this plant such as sesquiterpenes. In an ongoing to identify new natural anticancer compounds for the treatment and/or prevention of melanoma, we study the effects of Drimys winteri bark ethyl  extract and its sesquiterpenes drimenol, nordrimenone, isonordrimenone and polygodial on human melanoma cells. The treatment of melanoma cells with extract, drimenol, isordrimenone and polygodial resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability. But, polygodial showed the highest inhibitory growth activity. In addition, we reported an apoptotic response after treatment with drimenol, isordrimenone and polygodial that probably involves the reduction of Hsp70 expression and reactive  species production. Alternatively, the inhibition of caspase cascade at higher concentrations, correlated with additional reactive  species increase, probably switches natural product-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis. Therefore, this evidence provides a scientific support for the anticancer employ of Drimys winteri in traditional medicinal and suggests that active molecules can be considered potential candidates to be tested also in in vivo models, alone or in combination with chemotherapy agents, for the management of melanoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By reasonably controlling the initial nitrate concentration and anoxic time, partial denitrification was realized. The carbon and nitrogen removal characteristics under different initial COD and NO-N concentrations were investigated. The results showed that, using sodium  as the carbon source, the partial denitrification process in No.1 SBR and No.2 SBR sludge successfully began in 21 d and 20 d, respectively. The accumulation of NO-N and nitrite accumulation rate (NAR) in reactors were maintained at high levels (12.61 mg·L, 79.76% and 13.85 mg·L, 87.60%, respectively). When the initial NO-N concentration of No.2 SBR was 20 mg·L and the initial COD concentration increased from 60 mg·L to 140 mg·L, the operation time for achieving the highest NO-N accumulation in the system was shortened from 160 min to 6 min. The NO-N ratio of the denitrification rate (in VSS) increased from 3.84 mg·(g·h) to 7.35 mg·(g·h). Increased initial COD concentration was beneficial to the accumulation of NO-N during partial denitrification. When the initial COD concentration of No.2 SBR was 100 mg·L and the initial NO-N concentration increased from 20 mg·L to 30 mg·L, NAR was maintained above 90% and up to 100% (the initial NO-N concentration was 25 mg·L). When the initial NO-N concentration was ≥ 35 mg·L, insufficient COD caused NO-N to be completely reduced to NO-N. Under different initial COD concentrations (80, 100, or 120 mg·L) and different initial NO-N concentrations (20, 25, 30, or 40 mg·L), the nitrogen and carbon removal and partial denitrification performance of the No.2 SBR was better than that of No.1 SBR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841648>The Extracts of  L.

Here, we prepared .  ethanol extract (AAEE) and its subfractions including petroleum ether (AAEE-Pe) and ethyl  (AAEE-Ea) and investigated their antitumor effect on human hepatoma BEL-7404 cells and mouse hepatoma H22 cells. The cell viability of hepatoma cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis, cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and reactive  species (ROS) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of proteins in the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways were detected by Western blot. AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea exhibited potent cytotoxicity for both BEL-7404 cells and H22 cells through the induction of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea significantly reduced Δψm, increased the release of cytochrome c, and promoted the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in BEL-7404 and H22 cells. AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea significantly upregulated the levels of ROS and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Further, AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea significantly inhibited tumor growth in the H22 tumor mouse model and improved the survival of tumor mice without side effects. These results suggest that AAEE, AAEE-Pe, and AAEE-Ea inhibited the growth of hepatoma cells through induction of apoptosis, which might be mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial-dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632627>Extracts from cultures of  induce defensive patterns of gene expression and enzyme activity while depressing visible injury and reactive  species in  challenged with pathogenic .</a></h2><p>We evaluated the ability of metabolic elicitors extracted from  N21.4 to induce systemic resistance (ISR) in  against the pathogen  DC3000. Metabolic elicitors were obtained from bacteria-free culture medium with -hexane, ethyl  and -butanol in three consecutive extractions. Each extract showed plant protection activity.

However, there are no studies on the biological treatment of selenate-containing saline wastewater. A sequencing batch reactor inoculated with activated sludge was applied to treat selenate in the presence of 3% (w/v) NaCl. Start-up of the sequencing batch reactor with a 7-day cycle duration and excessive  as the sole carbon source succeeded in removing above 98% and 72% soluble and solid selenium, respectively, under -limiting conditions. Further selenium removal experiments with a shorter cycle duration of 3 days and a stepwise decrease of  addition achieved soluble and total selenium removal efficiencies in most batches above 96% and 80%, respectively. Mass balance analysis revealed that selenate was converted into elemental selenium, most of which was accumulated in the sludge. Microscopic analyses also found that elemental selenium particles were primarily present as approximately 2 μm large rods, with some extremely large particles above 10 μm. Although the bacterial populations responsible for selenium removal, especially selenate reduction, could not be identified by microbial community analysis, this study reported for the first time that selenate could be biologically treated in the presence of considerable salinity, offering implications for the practical treatment of selenium in certain industrial wastewaters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC)-null genotype is predominant in sub-Saharan African ancestry populations and is the major genetic determinant of benign ethnic neutropenia which has been associated with increased risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 acquisition and mother-to-child transmission. However, the impact of DARC-null-linked neutropenia on HIV disease progression remains controversial. While the DARC-null genotype is associated with low numbers of circulating neutrophils, the effects of the polymorphism on neutrophil functions is unknown. We investigated the impact of the DARC-null trait and lower absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) on key neutrophil effector functions [proteolytic activity within the phagosome following Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, reactive  species (ROS) production, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation] in 20 HIV negative and 22 HIV-1 chronically infected black South Africans. Phagosome maturation was measured by flow cytometry following Fc-mediated uptake of IgG opsonized beads; ROS production was measured by chemi-luminescence after activation of neutrophils with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Activated neutrophils were also visualized by fluorescent microscopy for NET quantification. Study subjects were genotyped for the DARC trait using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays and ANCs were measured by full blood count. As expected, the DARC-null polymorphism was highly prevalent in our participant cohort (69%) and was strongly associated with lower ANCs in uninfected ( = 0.0007) and HIV-1 infected ( = 0.03) subjects. We observed enhanced proteolytic activity within the phagosome in the absence of DARC at 10 min ( = 0.05 and  = 0.009) and 60 min ( = 0.05 and  = 0.07) in uninfected and HIV-1 infected subjects, respectively. ROS was unaffected by DARC trait irrespective of HIV status. Furthermore, formation of NETs was reduced in neutrophils from DARC-null subjects ( = 0.04) following prolonged  stimulation, but only in HIV-1 infected subjects. The data indicate differential neutrophil function in the absence of DARC that may be moderately modulated by HIV-1 infection but overall, the data suggest that DARC-null trait is not deleterious to neutrophil effector functions in African populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621303>High-Spin Mn(V)-Oxo Intermediate in Nonheme Manganese Complex-Catalyzed Alkane Hydroxylation Reaction: Experimental and Theoretical Approach.</a></h2><p>Mononuclear nonheme manganese complexes are highly efficient catalysts in the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of carboxylic acids. Although high-valent Mn(V)-oxo complexes have been proposed as the active oxidants that afford high regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivities in the catalytic oxidation reactions, the importance of the spin state (e.g.,  = 0 or 1) of the proposed Mn(V)-oxo species is an area that requires further study. In the present study, we have theoretically demonstrated that a mononuclear nonheme Mn(V)-oxo species with an  = 1 ground spin state is the active oxidant that effects the stereo- and enantioselective alkane hydroxylation reaction; it is noted that synthetic octahedral Mn(V)-oxo complexes, characterized spectroscopically and/or structurally, possess an  = 0 spin state and are sluggish oxidants. In an experimental approach, we have investigated the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes by a mononuclear nonheme Mn(II) complex, [(-PMB)Mn], and HO in the presence of carboxylic acids; alcohol is the major product with high stereo- and enantioselectivities. A synthetic Mn(IV)-oxo complex, [(-PMB)Mn(O)], is inactive in C-H bond activation reactions, ruling out the Mn(IV)-oxo species as an active oxidant. DFT calculations have shown that a Mn(V)-oxo species with an  = 1 spin state, [(-PMB)Mn(O)(OAc)], is highly reactive and capable of oxygenating the C-H bond via  rebound mechanism; we propose that the triplet spin state of the Mn(V)-oxo species results from the consequence of breaking the equatorial symmetry due to the binding of an equatorial  from an  ligand. Thus, the present study reports that, different from the previously reported  = 0 Mn(V)-oxo species, Mn(V)-oxo species with a triplet ground spin state are highly reactive oxidants that are responsible for the regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectivities in the catalytic hydroxylation of alkanes by mononuclear nonheme manganese complexes and terminal oxidants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30660710>Chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the essential oils from male and female specimens of Baccharis punctulata (Asteraceae).</a></h2><p>Baccharis punctulata (Asteraceae), popularly known as "Chíllka saru saru" in Bolivia, has been used by rural communities in Bustillo Province of the Potosi Department for treatment of asthma, luxations and contusions.To analyze the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from leaves of female (BPF) and male (BPM) specimens and evaluate their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Chemical composition analyses of Baccharis punctulata essential oils isolated by hidrodistillation from leaves of male and female specimens were performed by GC-FID-MS. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using the model of TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-) induced ear edema, and the polymorphonuclear cell migration was evaluated by mieloperoxidase (MPO) and analyzed histologically. To measure the reactive  species (ROS) in the inflamed tissue, the DCFH-DA fluorescent probe was used. The chemical in vitro antioxidant activity of essential oils was determined using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical assay.The chemical analysis showed high proportion of sesquiterpenes in the volatiles samples obtained from BPM, such as δ-elemene (14.29%), germacrene D (11.29%) and bicyclogermacrene (10.90%), and in the sample from BPF, bicyclogermacrene (42.44%), germacrene D (21.18%) and β-caryophyllene (14.06%). A statistical difference (p < 0.05) on chemical composition between both essential oils was observed. Topical administration of both BPM and BPF essential oils was able to inhibit the formation of TPA-induced edema in the treated groups. Isolated administration of TPA promoted an increase in MPO enzyme activity, and inhibition of the increase of MPO activity was observed when animals were treated with BFP at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ear (13.69 ± 0.20%), 0.3 mg/ear (22.35 ± 0.11%), and 1.0 mg/ear (44.98 ± 0.27%). Topical treatment with BPM was able to inhibit MPO activity at 22.40 ± 0.29% (0.1 mg/ear), 36.49 ± 0.07% (0.3 mg/ear) and 52.19 ± 0.28% (1.0 mg/ear). The positive control of dexamethasone (DEXA, 0.1 mg/ear) was able to revert the increase in the enzymatic activity of MPO caused by TPA (65.16%). Histological analysis showed that topical application of TPA promoted intense cellular infiltration. This inflammatory parameter was reduced with the topical application of the BPF and BPM oil samples as well as with DEXA. The results observed in the ROS and DPPH tests suggest that both samples were able to reduce the inflammatory cells influx and have in vitro antioxidant properties, respectively.This study presents, for the first time, the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from leaves of male and female specimens of Baccharis punctulata, and their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The results presented by the volatile samples in our biotests support traditional uses of this plant species.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

But only a limited number of azole groups are used clinically in treatment of (CNS) diseases which are on increase and could not be cured permanently. Due to increased incidence of more challenging new CNS diseases, there is need for synthesis of more potent CNS drugs.Hence, literatures were searched for identification of common pathways for synthesis of the three groups of the compounds, their CNS properties and possibility of modifying them to potent CNS drugs.Findings have shown that gloxal with formaldehyde in the presence of ammonia can be converted to imidazole, imidazothiazole and benzimidazole via distillation, condensation, alkylation, acylation, oxidation, cyclization, sulphation and amidation. However, agents such as phosphorus pentoxide, ethanolic potassium hydroxide, sodium hypochlorite, sodium hexafluroaluminate, aniline, calcium , calcium benzoate, sodium hydroxide, aromatic aldehydes, bromoketones, alpha dicarbonyl compounds among others are used as reagents. The furan ring(s) may have strong ability of penetrating CNS for treatment of neurological disorders. The products from the three groups have agonistic, antagonistic, mixed agonistic and mixed antagonistic depressant and stimulant activities due to presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen,  and Sulphur.

It was suggested that citrate be included in PASs to prevent spontaneous aggregation. Reports in cell lines and cord blood have demonstrated that concentrations of citrate present in PAS formulations (10 mM) cause apoptosis. We evaluated whether the removal of citrate from PAS-III could improve platelet storage.Study 1 evaluated the effects of a citrate dose response on the storage of platelets in 65% PAS containing sodium chloride, sodium , and phosphate. Study 2 compared the cell quality and function of platelets stored in 65% citrate-free PAS-III or PAS-III containing 10 mM of citrate. Measurements included cell count, blood gases, flow cytometry analysis of surface activation markers, and aggregation.Study 1 identified that inclusion of citrate in PAS resulted in a dose-dependent increase in glucose utilization, lactate formation, P-selectin expression, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, and reactive  species (ROS) formation. Study 2 showed similar results in which platelets stored in citrate-free PAS-III benefited through better maintenance of glucose utilization with less lactate production, P-selectin expression, PS exposure, and ROS formation compared to citrate-containing PAS-III. Platelets stored in citrate-free PAS-III had aggregation responses that were at least 10% greater than those platelets stored in PAS-III.Storage of apheresis platelets in citrate-free PAS-III improved multiple storage parameters including glucose utilization, lactate production, P-selection expression, PS exposure, and ROS formation and resulted in a modest increase in aggregation.© 2019 AABB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30733748>Effect of vitamins and cell constructions on the activity of microbial fuel cell battery.</a></h2><p>Construction of efficient performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) requires certain practical considerations. In the single chamber microbial fuel cell, there is no border between the anode and the cathode, thus the diffusion of the dissolved  has a contrary effect on the anodic respiration and this leads to the inhibition of the direct electron transfer from the biofilm to the anodic surface. Here, a fed-batch single chambered microbial fuel cells are constructed with different distances 3 and 6 cm (anode- cathode spacing), while keeping the working volume is constant. The performance of each MFC is individually evaluated under the effects of vitamins & minerals with  as a fed load. The maximum open circuit potential during testing the 3 and 6 cm microbial fuel cells is about 946 and 791 mV respectively. By decreasing the distance between the anode and the cathode from 6 to 3 cm, the power density is decreased from 108.3 mW m to 24.5 mW m. Thus, the short distance in membrane-less MFC weakened the cathode and inhibited the anodic respiration which affects the overall performance of the MFC efficiency. The system is displayed a maximum potential of 564 and 791 mV in absence & presence of vitamins respectively. Eventually, the overall functions of the  single chamber microbial fuel cell can be improved by the addition of vitamins & minerals and increasing the distance between the cathode and the anode.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30793529>Neutrophils Derived from Genetically Modified Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Circulate and Phagocytose Bacteria In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Bacterial and fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients. Donor-derived neutrophil transfusions have been used for prophylaxis or treatment for infection in neutropenic patients. However, the short half-life and the limited availability of large numbers of donor-derived neutrophils for transfusion remain a significant hurdle in the implementation of neutrophil transfusion therapy. Here, we investigate the in vitro and in vivo activity of neutrophils generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), a potentially unlimited resource to produce neutrophils for transfusion. Phenotypic analysis of iPSC-derived neutrophils reveal reactive  species production at similar or slightly higher than normal peripheral blood neutrophils, but have an ∼50%-70% reduced Escherichia coli phagocytosis and phorbol 12-myristate 13- induced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Signaling of granulocytic precursors identified impaired AKT activation, but not ERK or STAT3, in agonist-stimulated iPSC-derived neutrophils. Expression of a constitutively activated AKT in iPSC-derived neutrophils restores most phagocytic activity and NET formation. In a model of bacterial induced peritonitis in immunodeficient mice, iPSC-derived neutrophils, with or without corrected AKT activation, migrate similarly to the peritoneal fluid as peripheral blood neutrophils, whereas the expression of activated AKT significantly improves their phagocytic activity in vivo.

The molecular structure of the complex shows a distorted tetragonal antiprism CdNO coordination geometry around the cadmium atom, resulting in coordination by four nitrogen atoms from two 5,5'-dmbipy ligands and four  atoms from two  anions. The interaction of this complex to FS-DNA (fish sperm DNA) has also been studied by electronic absorption, fluorescence and gel electrophoresis techniques. Binding constant (K), Stern-Volmer constant (K), number of binding sites (n) and bimolecular quenching rate constant (k) have been calculated from these spectroscopic data. These results have revealed that the metal complex can bind effectively to FS-DNA via groove binding. The calculated thermodynamic parameters (ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°) show that hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces have an important function in the Cd(II) complex-DNA interaction. The antibacterial effects of the synthesized cadmium complex have also been examined in vitro against standard bacterial strains: one Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 25923) and one Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, ATCC 25922) bacteria, using disk diffusion and macro-dilution broth methods. The obtained results show that the Cd(II) complex exhibits a marked antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those observed for its free ligand and metal salt for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, this metal complex is a more potent antibacterial agent against the Gram-positive than that of the Gram-negative bacteria. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aim was to investigate the impact of lignin structural diversity on film performance. It was confirmed that lignin's distribution in the films was dependent on the polarity of solvents used for fractionation (acetone > methanol > ethanol > ethyl ) and influenced the optical properties of the films. The ⁻OH group content and molecular weight of lignin were positively related to film density. In general, the addition of lignin fractions led to decrease in thermal stability and increase in Young's modulus of the composite films. The modulus of the films was found to decrease as the molecular weight of lignin increased, and a higher amount of carboxyl and phenolic ⁻OH groups in the lignin fraction resulted in films with higher stiffness. The thermal analysis showed higher char content formation for lignin-containing films in a nitrogen atmosphere with increased molecular weight. In an  atmosphere, the phenol content, saturated side chains and short chain structures of lignin had impacts on the maximum decomposition temperature of the films, confirming the relationship between the chemical structure of lignin and thermo-oxidative stability of the corresponding film. This study addresses the importance of lignin diversities on composite film performance, which could be helpful for tailoring lignin's applications in bio-based materials based on their specific characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412628>The Neuroprotective Role of Coenzyme Q10 Against Lead -Induced Neurotoxicity Is Mediated by Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory and Anti-Apoptotic Activities.</a></h2><p>Heavy metal exposure, in lead (Pb) particularly, is associated with severe neuronal impairment though oxidative stress mediated by reactive  species, and antioxidants may be used to abolish these adverse effects. This study investigated the potential neuroprotective role of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) against lead  (PbAc)-induced neurotoxicity. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups ( = 7) and treated as follows: the control group was injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl); the CoQ group was injected with CoQ (10 mg/kg); PbAc group was injected with PbAc (20 mg/kg); PbAc + CoQ group was injected first with PbAc, and after 1 h with CoQ. All groups were injected intraperitoneally for seven days. PbAc significantly increased cortical lipid peroxidation, nitrate/nitrite levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and decreased glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase activity and mRNA expression, as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and homoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. PbAc also promoted the secretion of interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibited interleukin-10 production, triggered the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and suppressed anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, PbAc increased the cortical levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate, and decreased the level of ATP. However, treatment with CoQ rescued cortical neurons from PbAc-induced neurotoxicity by restoring the balance between oxidants and antioxidants, activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suppressing inflammation, inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, and modulating cortical neurotransmission and energy metabolism. Altogether, our findings indicate that CoQ has beneficial effects against PbAc-induced neuronal damage through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuromodulatory activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937452>NOX4 is a major regulator of cord blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells which promotes postischaemic revascularisation.</a></h2><p>Cord blood-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (CB-ECFCs) are a defined progenitor population with established roles in vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis, which possess low immunogenicity and high potential for allogeneic therapy, and are highly sensitive to regulation by reactive  species (ROS). The aim of this study was to define the precise role of the major ROS-producing enzyme, NOX4 NADPH oxidase, in CB-ECFC vasoreparative function.In vitro CB-ECFC migration (scratch-wound assay) and tubulogenesis (tube length, branch number) was enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced superoxide in a NOX-dependent manner. CB-ECFCs highly-expressed NOX4 which was further induced by PMA, whilst NOX4 siRNA and plasmid overexpression reduced and potentiated in vitro function, respectively. Increased ROS generation in NOX4-overexpressing CB-ECFCs (DCF fluorescence, flow cytometry) was specifically reduced by superoxide dismutase, highlighting induction of ROS-specific signalling. Laser Doppler imaging of mouse ischaemic hindlimbs at 7 days indicated that NOX4-knockdown CB-ECFCs inhibited blood flow recovery which was enhanced by NOX4-overexpressing CB-ECFCs. Tissue analysis at 14 days revealed consistent alterations in vascular density (lectin expression) and eNOS protein despite clearance of injected CB-ECFCs, suggesting NOX4-mediated modulation of host tissue. Indeed, proteome array analysis indicated that NOX4-knockdown CB-ECFCs largely suppressed tissue angiogenesis, whilst NOX4-overexpressing CB-ECFCs upregulated a number of pro-angiogenic factors specifically-linked with eNOS signalling, in parallel with equivalent modulation of NOX-dependent ROS generation, suggesting that CB-ECFC NOX4 signalling may promote host vascular repair.Taken together, these findings indicate a key role for NOX4 in CB-ECFCs, thereby highlighting its potential as a target for enhancing their reparative function through therapeutic priming to support creation of a pro-reparative microenvironment and effective postischaemic revascularisation.© The Author(s) 2019.

We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate,  consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and  rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty acid remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic metabolism during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Seedlings.</a></h2><p>Green leaf volatiles play vital roles in plant biotic stress; however, their functions in plant responses to abiotic stress have not been determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of (Z)-3-hexeny-1-yl  (Z-3-HAC), a kind of green leaf volatile, in alleviating the salinity stress of peanut () seedlings and the underlying physiological mechanisms governing this effect. One salt-sensitive and one salt-tolerant peanut genotype were primed with 200 μM Z-3-HAC at the 4-week-old stage before they were exposed to salinity stress. Physiological measurements showed that the primed seedlings possessed higher relative water content, net photosynthetic rate, maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, activities of the antioxidant enzymes, and osmolyte accumulation under salinity conditions. Furthermore, the reactive  species, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content in the third fully expanded leaves were significantly lower than in nonprimed plants. Additionally, we found that application of Z-3-HAC increased the total length, surface area, and volume of the peanut roots under salinity stress. These results indicated that the green leaf volatile Z-3-HAC protects peanut seedlings against damage from salinity stress through priming for modifications of photosynthetic apparatus, antioxidant systems, osmoregulation, and root morphology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103897>Dehydrodieugenol B derivatives as antiparasitic agents: Synthesis and biological activity against Trypanosoma cruzi.</a></h2><p>Chagas disease is a neglected protozoan disease that affects more than eight million people in developing countries. Due to the limited number and toxicity profiles of therapies in current use, new drugs are urgently needed. In previous studies, we reported the isolation of two related antitrypanosomal neolignans from Nectandra leucantha (Lauraceae). In this work, a semi-synthetic library of twenty-three neolignan derivatives was prepared to explore synthetically accessible structure activity relationships (SAR) against Trypanosoma cruzi. Five compounds demonstrated activity against trypomastigotes (IC values from 8 to 64 μM) and eight showed activity against intracellular amastigotes (IC values from 7 to 16 μM). Eighteen derivatives demonstrated no mammalian cytotoxicity up to 200 μM. The phenolic  derivative of natural dehydrodieugenol B was effective against both parasite forms and eliminated 100% of amastigotes inside macrophages. This compound caused rapid and intense depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, with decreased levels of intracellular reactive  species being observed. Fluorescence assays demonstrated that this derivative affected neither the permeability nor the electric potential of the parasitic plasma membrane, an effect also corroborated by scanning electron microscopy studies. Structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) demonstrated that the presence of at least one allyl side chain on the biaryl ether core was important for antitrypanosomal activity, and that the free phenol is not essential. This set of neolignan derivatives represents a promising starting point for future Chagas disease drug discovery studies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

All of the children received volume therapy with infusion of sodium  Ringer solution intravenously upon anesthesia induction. The volume of infusion was calculated according to the "4-2-1" formula (group A, the rehydration volume was 4 mL×kg×h for the first 10 kg body weight, 2 mL×kg×h for the second 10 kg, and 1 mL×kg×h for the third 10 kg and above), and the volume was increased by 50% or 100% in groups B and C, respectively. The intravenous infusion lasted for 30 minutes in all the three groups. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed before and 30 minutes after infusion to observe the acid-base status and electrolyte level. Pulse  saturation (SpO), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) before and 10, 20, 30 minutes after infusion, central venous pressure (CVP) at 30 minutes after infusion were recorded, as well as adverse events occurred after infusion.Twenty-six children with cyanotic CHD, 17 male and 9 female, aged from 1 to 36 months, body weight 3.6 to 16.0 kg, and America Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) level of III or IV, were enrolled in the study. The pH value in group B at 30 minutes after infusion was significantly higher than that before infusion (7.35±0.05 vs. 7.32±0.06, P < 0.05), while no significant changes were found before and after infusion in the other two groups. The hematocrits (Hct) after infusion in three groups were significantly lower than those before infusion (0.433±0.141 vs. 0.473±0.146 in group A, 0.324±0.054 vs. 0.372±0.063 in group B, 0.363±0.097 vs. 0.418±0.111 in group C, all P < 0.01), indicating that all the children in the three groups achieved effective hemodilution. However, there was no significant difference in blood gas analysis before and after infusion among the three groups. The level of blood lactic acid (Lac) in all CHD children was decreased from (1.33±0.63) mmol/L to (0.98±0.36) mmol/L after infusion of sodium  Ringer solution, the serum Ca concentration was decreased from (1.22±0.06) mmol/L to (1.19±0.06) mmol/L, and the serum Cl concentration was increased from (108.74±2.70) mmol/L to (109.77±2.54) mmol/L with the statistically significant differences (all P < 0.01). However, no significant difference was found in Lac or electrolyte levels before and after infusion among the three groups. There was no significant difference in vital signs before and after infusion among the three groups, but the period of infusion had an effect on SpO (F = 5.998, P < 0.01), HR (F = 34.279, P < 0.01) and SBP (F = 4.345, P < 0.05). HR in groups A and C were significantly lower than those before infusion, and SBP in group A was decreased gradually with the prolongation of infusion time. The CVP value at 30 minutes after infusion in group B was higher than that in group A. No adverse reactions such as rash or anaphylactic shock occurred after infusion of sodium  Ringer solution in all children.The perioperative volume therapy with sodium  Ringer solution in children with cyanotic CHD can effectively prevent the increase in Lac level and does not aggravate metabolic acidosis. The volume of infusion was well tolerated by all the children without disturbing the hemodynamic parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668822>Algal Protein Kinase, Triacylglycerol Accumulation Regulator 1, Modulates Cell Viability and Gametogenesis in Carbon/Nitrogen-Imbalanced Conditions.</a></h2><p>Nutrient-deprived microalgae accumulate triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets. A dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, TAG accumulation regulator 1 (TAR1) has been shown to be required for -dependent TAG accumulation and the degradation of chlorophyll and photosynthesis-related proteins in photomixotrophic nitrogen (N)-deficient conditions (Kajikawa etï¿½al. 2015). However, this previous report only examined particular condition. Here, we report that in photoautotrophic N-deficient conditions, tar1-1 cells, with a mutation in the TAR1 gene, maintained higher levels of cell viability and lower levels of hydrogen peroxide generation and accumulated higher levels of TAG and starch compared with those of wild type (WT) cells with bubbling of air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that genes involved in the scavenging of reactive  species are not repressed in tar1-1 cells. In contrast, the mating efficiency and mRNA levels of key regulatory genes for gametogenesis, MID, MTD and FUS, were suppressed in tar1-1 cells. Among the TAR1-dependent phosphopeptides deduced by phosphoproteomic analysis, protein kinases and enzymes related to N assimilation and carbon (C) metabolism are of particular interest. Characterization of these putative downstream factors may elucidate the molecular pathway whereby TAR1 mediates cellular propagation and C and N metabolism in C/N-imbalanced stress conditions.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

In the present study, two methods of electricity generation using raw algae (RA) and RA +  (AC) as co-substrate were analyzed in single chamber air cathode MFCs. MFCs supplemented with RA and RA + AC clearly showed higher power density, greater current generation, and improved COD (chemical  demand) removal, which demonstrated the feasibility of using AC as substrate for MFC. The MFC-RA + AC (0.48 mA) generated 28% higher current relative to that generated by MFC with RA alone. Notably, the maximum power densities generated by MFC-RA and MFC-RA + AC were 230 and 410 mW/m, respectively.

Here we operated four membrane biofilm reactors (MBfRs) fed with nitrate, nitrite,  at a relatively low rate, and  at a relatively high rate, respectively, to study if they can support methane bioconversion to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the associated microbiological features. All tested electron acceptors facilitated methane bioconversion to SCFAs (ranging from 1.1 to 36.7 mg  L d, or 3.4 to 114.6 mg  d m of biofilm).

This type of infection is inherently difficult to treat because of a reduced metabolic activity of biofilm-embedded cells and the protective nature of a surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). However, little is known about  biofilm physiology and the proteinaceous composition of the ECM. Thus, we cultivated  biofilms in a flow system and comprehensively profiled intracellular and extracellular (ECM and flow-through (FT)) biofilm proteomes, as well as the extracellular metabolome compared with planktonic cultures. Our analyses revealed the expression of many pathogenicity factors within  biofilms as indicated by a high abundance of capsule biosynthesis proteins along with various secreted virulence factors, including hemolysins, leukotoxins, and lipases as a part of the ECM. The activity of ECM virulence factors was confirmed in a hemolysis assay and a  pathogenicity model. In addition, we uncovered a so far unacknowledged moonlighting function of secreted virulence factors and ribosomal proteins trapped in the ECM: namely their contribution to biofilm integrity. Mechanistically, it was revealed that this stabilizing effect is mediated by the strong positive charge of alkaline virulence factors and ribosomal proteins in an acidic ECM environment, which is caused by the release of fermentation products like formate, lactate, and  because of  limitation in biofilms. The strong positive charge of these proteins most likely mediates electrostatic interactions with anionic cell surface components, eDNA, and anionic metabolites. In consequence, this leads to strong cell aggregation and biofilm stabilization. Collectively, our study identified a new molecular mechanism during  biofilm formation and thus significantly widens the understanding of biofilm-associated  infections - an essential prerequisite for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies.© 2019 Graf et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959388>Electrons transfer determined greenhouse gas emissions in enhanced nitrogen-removal constructed wetlands with different carbon sources and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios.</a></h2><p>A constructed wetland (CW) was established to explore the influence of carbon addition (glucose or sodium ) on nitrogen removal and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at chemical  demand to nitrogen ratios (COD/Ns) of 0, 4, 7. Results showed that the type of carbon source and COD/N significantly influenced the CW performance, in which the electrons transfer determined the regulation of denitrification, methanogenesis and respiration. Higher NO emissions were consistent with higher nitrite accumulation at low COD/N because of electrons competition. The residual carbon source after near-complete denitrification could be further utilized by methanogenesis. Sodium  was superior to glucose in promoting denitrification and reducing global warming potential (GWP). In addition, bacteria sequencing and functional genes confirmed the important role of the type of carbon source on controlling nitrogen removal, carbon consumption and GHG emissions in microbial communities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the interactive effect of carbon source with COD/N on nitrogen removal and microbial community structure in subsurface flow constructed wetlands, glucose (CHO) and sodium  (CHNaO) were used to determine five COD/N ratios in nine groups of constructed wetlands divided into glucose constructed wetlands and sodium  constructed wetlands. Results showed that efficiency in COD removal increased with COD/N, and peak value reached 92.7%. Interactive effect of carbon source with COD/N on system pH and ammonium removal was notably significant. Differences in ammonium removal performance between treatments were achieved by the variation of influent COD/N ratio and the change of system pH resulted from different carbon sources, and the result suggested that glucose was a better choice at high COD/N ratio. System microbial community structure was significantly affected by carbon source, influent COD/N ratio and their interaction. Microbial biomass in constructed wetlands significantly increased with increasing COD/N ratio. Higher density and diversity of fungus were observed in glucose constructed wetlands, particularly at COD/N ratio of 7 and 10.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

NADPH oxidase-derived O2- can inactivate nitric oxide and induce vascular injury.The crude ethanolic extract of Lysimachia christinae Hance were separated out 4 fractions of different olarities by petroleum ether, ethyl , n-butanol (NB), and aqueous. The endothelial integrity was appraised by vascular tension measurement. Dihydroethidium was utilized to observe the vascular reactive  species (ROS) production. Western-blot was adopted to detect protein expression.Among the 4 fractions of L. christinae Hance, the NB fraction showed the most potent capacity of promoting endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and inhibiting ROS formation in aortic rings, which were likely attributed by suppressing the expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunit (gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox) and enhancing the phosphorylation of endothelial NOS in vascular tone.These results suggest that the NB fraction possess the strongest vascular pharmacological activities among the crude ethanolic extract of L. christinae Hance, which may help us for purifying bioactive constituents and discovering new drugs from this herb in future.© 2019 S.

We previously identified isoquercitrin (IQ) as an active compound of Acer okamotoanum. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of the active ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction from A. okamotoanum and IQ on HFD and Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with HFD for 10 weeks and then Aβ25-35 was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.). The EtOAc fraction of A. okamotoanum and IQ were administered orally for 4 weeks at 100 and 10 mg kg-1 day-1, respectively. Learning and memory functions were evaluated using behavioral tests including T-maze, object recognition and Morris water maze tests. The HFD and Aβ25-35 injection significantly impaired cognitive and memory function. However, administration of A. okamotoanum and IQ improved spatial cognitive ability and object recognition ability in T-maze and novel object recognition tests. In addition, A. okamotoanum and IQ-administered groups showed enhanced learning and memory function compared with HFD and Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment mice in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, administration of A. okamotoanum and IQ attenuated oxidative stress in the brain via inhibition of reactive  species production, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide formation. Therefore, we suggest that A. okamotoanum and IQ improve HFD- and Aβ25-35-induced cognitive impairment by inhibition of oxidative stress, and A. okamotoanum and IQ might be potential candidates for prevention and treatment of obesity- and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31208986>Metabolic remodeling of cardiomyocytes identified in phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Metabolic remodeling plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). Many studies have shown that the disruption of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) caused severe and lethal HF; however, the metabolic pattern of PDK1 deletion remains ambiguous. H nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was applied to explore the altered metabolic pattern in deficient mice. Principle component analysis showed significant separation as early as 4 weeks of age, and dysfunction of metabolism precedes a morphological change in deficient mice. A time trajectory plot indicated that disturbed metabolic patterns were related to the pathological process of the HF in deficient mice, rather than the age of mice. Metabolic profiles demonstrated significantly increased levels of , glutamate, glutamine, and -phosphocholine in  deletion mice. Levels of lactate, alanine, glycine, taurine, choline, fumarate, IMP, AMP, and ATP were significantly decreased compared with controls. Furthermore, PDK1 knockdown decreased the  consumption rate in H9C2 cells as determined using a Seahorse XF96 Analyzer. These findings imply that the disruption of metabolism and impaired mitochondrial activity might be involved in the pathogenesis of HF with PDK1 deletion.© 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we have also tried to quantify intracellular superoxide with the help of a unique fluoroprobe MitoSOX based on fluorescence measurements in yeast MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wound healing property of successive extracts (ethyl , methanol and aqueous) of S. cordifolia against dexamethasone-induced retardation of wound healing in rats was studied. The various extracts of S. cordifolia were characterised by determining the various phytochemicals and quantifying the total phenolic content and flavonoidal content by High throughput assays. In order to know the probable mechanism of action of the successive fractionates, assessed the antioxidant activity both by in-vitro (DPPH-assay) and in-vivo methods in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY 4743 (WT) and knock-out strain (Δtrx2) against HO-induced stress mediated damages. The cell survival was evaluated after exposure to the oxidizing reagent (4 mM HO) by two methods which included the ability of cells to proliferate on solid or liquid medium. The cell membrane integrity/amount of mitochondrial ROS was determined by treating the strains with extract/standard in presence of HO and propidium iodide (PI)/MitoSOX Red RESULTS: During the preliminary in-vivo wound healing study, the period for complete re-epithelialization of the wound tissue was reduced significantly (pin the treatment groups as compared to the negative control group. The formulation HF containing aqueous extract of S. cordifolia (SCA) showed highest wound healing potential against dexamethasone-retarded wounds in rats which justifies its traditional use. In the growth curve assay, the HO-induced growth arrest was restored by aqueous extract of S. cordifolia (SCA) in a concentration-dependent(pmanner both in the WT and Δtrx2 strains similar to the standard (ascorbic acid), HO after 24 hours incubation which was also confirmed by the findings of CFU method. We got almost similar results of cell viability when stained with PI. The lower level of mitochondrial superoxide was indicated by a significant (preduction in the amount of MitoSOX stained cells, in the extract-treated group in contrast to the HO-stressed group.It was concluded that HF can be applied topically in hydrogel form in the case of delayed wound healing caused by the steroidal drug-dexamethasone, aptly justifying its traditional use. Regarding its mechanism of action, our findings report that the potent adaptive response of SCA-treated WT and Δtrx2 strains towards intracellular ROS specifically mitochondrial-ROS confirms its antioxidant potential. Moreover, as SCA was able to rescue the Δtrx2 strains from stress, it can be inferred that it might be able to induce the enzyme thioredoxin-II to restore redox homeostasis. The findings with the conditional mutant ∆trx2 are the first proof linking SCA action related to particular cellular pathways which may be because of the phenols and flavonoids and their synergistic effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The protein kinase C (PKC) family is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, however the role of PKCα in EPCs during angiogenesis is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PKCα in EPCs during angiogenesis. Phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA), a PKCα activator, significantly increased the activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -2 and -9 in human (late outgrowth) EPCs in vitro. The MMPs promoted the migratory function and vascular formation of EPCs, which then contributed to neovascularization in a mouse hindlimb-ischemia model. Reactive  species derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enhanced the expression of MMPs to increase the bioactivity of EPCs during angiogenesis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway was associated with the activation of NADPH oxidase. PMA extensively activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signal pathway to increase the expression of MMP-9. PMA also activated the p38, Erk, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signal pathways to increase the expression of MMP-2. PMA-stimulated EPCs enhanced neovascularization in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia via nuclear factor-κB translocation to up-regulation of the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. PMA could activate PKCα and promote the angiogenesis capacity of human EPCs via NADPH oxidase-mediated, redox-related, MMP-2 and MMP-9 pathways. The PKCα-activated, NADPH oxidase-mediated, redox-related MMP pathways could contribute to the function of human EPCs for ischemia-induced neovascularization, which may provide novel insights into the potential modification of EPCs for therapeutic angiogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539224>Electrochemiluminescence-Microscopy for microRNA Imaging in Single Cancer Cell Combined with Chemotherapy-Photothermal Therapy.</a></h2><p>In this work, a new technology using ECL as a microscopy to parallel image miRNA-21 in single cancer cell was built. Phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) loaded gold nanocages (Au NCs) was closed with DNA gate which could be recognized and opened by miRNA-21 in HeLa cell. PMA was then released and further induced HeLa cells to produce reactive  species (ROS; including O, •OH and HO etc.). With HO as coreactant and luminol as ECL active material, ECL imaging of intracellular miRNA-21 in single HeLa cell was obtained by EMCCD. Moreover, ROS therapy and photothermal therapy (PPT) of Au NCs@PMA probe were also motivated by in situ miRNA-21 marker instead of the external source. The combined therapy leads to dramatically enhanced ability for cancer cell killing. Au NCs@PMA probe alone could not only achieve a high sensitivity and high resolution ECL-microscopy for imaging of intracellular miRNA-21 for the first time, but also realize the integrated diagnosis like ROS induced tumor damage and photothermal-induced intelligent therapy. This multifunctional platform is believed to be capable of playing an important role in future oncotherapy by the synergistic effects between chemotherapy and photothermal therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630079>Galectin-1 modulation of neutrophil reactive  species production depends on the cell activation state.</a></h2><p>Here we report the effects of exogenous and endogenous galectin-1 (Gal-1) in modulating the functional responses of human and murine neutrophils at different stages of activation, i.e. naive, primed, and activated. Exposure to Gal-1 did not induce ROS production in either naive or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-primed (fMLP; 10 M) neutrophils. However, Gal-1 elicited a concentration-dependent ROS production in neutrophils activated with fMLP at concentrations ranging from 10 M to 10 M. Additional fMLP (10 M) stimulation of fMLP-activated neutrophils increased ROS production, whose intensity was inversely related to the fMLP concentration used in the first activation step (10 M to 10 M), and was not influenced by the presence of Gal-1. Naive neutrophils treated with Gal-1 and then exposed to fMLP (10 M) or phorbol-12-myristate-13- (10 M) produced less ROS, as compared to naive neutrophils not treated with Gal-1. Interestingly, these in vitro Gal-1 effects were associated with Gal-1 carbohydrate-binding activity and the ability to decrease FPR-1 (formyl peptide receptor 1) expression in naive human neutrophils. Conversely, positive ROS modulation by Gal-1 in activated neutrophils was not associated with FPR-1 expression but it was related to its carbohydrate recognition. In vitro, fMLP stimulation of Gal-1 mouse neutrophils produced more ROS than fMLP stimulation of Gal-1 neutrophils and this effect may be associated with increased FPR-1 expression. Exogenous Gal-1 induced ROS production in Gal-1 mouse neutrophils more effectively than in Gal-1 mouse neutrophils. Compared to Gal-1 mice, Gal-1 mice exhibited lower bacterial load in the peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood, thus indicating a greater bactericidal activity in vivo. These findings demonstrate that endogenous Gal-1 restricts ROS generation that correlates with bacterial killing capacity in inflammatory neutrophils. Thus, endogenous and exogenous Gal-1 may either positively or negatively modulate the effector functions of neutrophils according to the cell activation stage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy showed that site-isolated iridium was bonded to  atoms of the support. Electron densities on the iridium enveloped by each IL sheath/support combination were characterized by carbonyl infrared spectroscopy of the iridium -dicarbonyls and by X-ray absorption near-edge structure data. The electron-donor/acceptor tendencies of both the support and IL determine the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, with electron-rich iridium being selective for partial hydrogenation. The results resolve the effects of the IL and support as ligands; for example, the effect of the IL becomes dominant when the support has a weak electron-donor character.

Dry leaf extracts (standardized by LC-MS/MS and LC-PDA) and nine model activity markers (polyphenols), were tested in scavenging assays towards six in vivo-relevant oxidants (O, OH, NO, HO, ONOO, HClO). Ascorbic acid (AA) and Trolox (TX) were used as positive standards. The most active extracts were the diethyl ether and ethyl  fractions with activities in the range of 3.61-20.03 µmol AA equivalents/mg, depending on the assay. Among the model compounds, flavonoids were especially effective in OH scavenging, while flavan-3-ols were superior in O quenching. The most active constituents were quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidins B2 and C1 (3.94-24.16 µmol AA/mg), but considering their content in the extracts, isoquercitrin, (-)-epicatechin and chlorogenic acid were indicated as having the greatest influence on extract activity. The analysis of the synergistic effects between those three compounds in an O scavenging assay demonstrated that the combination of chlorogenic acid and isoquercitrin exerts the greatest influence. The results indicate that the extracts possess a strong and broad spectrum of antioxidant capacity and that their complex composition plays a key role, with various constituents acting complementarily and synergistically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678088>Evaluating the Toxic Impacts of Cadmium Selenide Nanoparticles on the Aquatic Plant Lemna minor.</a></h2><p>Cadmium selenide nanoparticles (CdSe NPs) were synthesized by an easy and simple method and their properties were assessed by XRD, TEM and SEM techniques.

These products are essential for lipid metabolism and carcinogenesis. In previous study, we identified an intronic variant rs2256368:A>G, whose G allele promotes exon 20 skipping in up to 43% of ACSL5 transcripts but its functional relevance is unclear. Here, we compared the expression of splice (Spl) and nonsplice (NSpl) ACSL5 variants and the effect on cell viability under culture conditions that force cells to metabolize fatty acids. We found that lymphoblastoid cell lines from 1000 Genomes Project, bearing Spl genotypes, showed a reduced expression of total ACSL5 protein due to an inefficient translation of the Spl RNA. These cells impaired growth in cultures with phorbol myristate -ionomycin (PMA-Io) or medium deprived of glucose, while production of reactive  species increased in PMA-Io. Specific ACSL5-isoform transfection in HEK239T (kidney), U87 (astroglioma), and HOG (oligodendrocyte) cells showed the Spl protein to be the causal factor of cell-growth inhibition, despite its reduced protein expression.

Natural products from plants consist of interesting biomolecules that may interfere with DNA or membrane integrity of the parasite and can possibly minimise the associated side effects. In the present study, various fractions of Euphorbia wallichii (EW) root extracts including n-hexane (EWNX), ethyl  (EWEA), chloroform (EWCH) and aqueous (EWAQ), were evaluated for their antileishmanial potential against Leishmania tropica followed by investigation of the possible mechanism of action via reactive  species (ROS) quantification, membrane permeability (via sytox green dye) and apoptotic assay (via AO/EB method) using fluorescent microscopy. Two of the fractions i.e. EWEA and EWAQ inhibited the growth of promastigotes (IC 7.8 and 10.2 μg/mL, respectively) and amastigotes (IC 9.9 and 13.3 μg/mL, respectively) forms almost at similar concentrations as found for the standard antileishmanial drugs, tartar emetic (TA) and Glucantime (IC 9.4 and 21.5 μg/mL, respectively). Both the active fractions remained non-toxic towards human blood erythrocytes and were able to cause membrane permeability and apoptotic induction (using Triton X-100 as a positive control) leading to death of Leishmania parasites. However, both the fractions could not triger significant and persistent ROS generation, compared to hydrogen peroxide used as a positive control. Antilesihmanial activity of the two active fractions might be attributed to the presence of high quantity of tannins and saponins.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Excess sludge (biomass) potentially is a low-cost electron donor generated internally to the MWTP, but it has to be made more bioavailable. Aerobic and anoxic biomasses were treated with ultrasound, and their supernatants were used as electron donors for stimulating denitrification. The supernatant from ultrasound-treated anoxic biomass achieved 54% faster nitrate-N removal than did supernatant from the treated aerobic biomass, and the supernatant of untreated biomass was ineffective as an electron donor. UV illumination of the supernatants further enhanced the rates, with increments of 19% and 14%, respectively for the aerobic and anoxic supernatants. Sodium  at a range of initial concentrations was compared as a readily bioavailable electron donor to gauge the acceleration impact of the supernatants as equivalent bioavailable chemical  demand (COD). The total chemical  demand (TCOD) of the supernatant harvested from anoxic biomass without UV illumination was 76% bioavailable, while its bioavailable TCOD was 78% after UV illumination. For the supernatant from the aerobic biomass, the bioavailable fractions were, respectively, 56% and 58% without and with UV illumination. The greatest impact for converting excess biomass into a source of bioavailable electron donor to drive denitrification came from ultrasound treatment of the biomass, which disrupted the biomass to form particulate chemical  demand (PCOD) that was bioavailable.

We investigated the potential of nanoparticles, which were modified with α2,8-linked sialic acid chains, to modulate NET release during phorbol myristate  stimulation. Interestingly, when these nanoparticles were applied, the formation of reactive  species was partly inhibited and the release of NET was counteracted. However, although the release of NET fibers was prevented, the nuclei still lost their characteristic segmented structure and became swollen, indicating that only the release, and not complete activation was suppressed. Intriguingly, coincubation of α2,8-sialylated particles with free sialic acid chains prevented the outlined inhibitory effects.

This naturally occurring molecule is present at high concentrations in several mammalian excitable tissues such as muscles and brain, while it can be found at low concentrations in a few invertebrates. Carnosine has been shown to be involved in different cellular defense mechanisms including the inhibition of protein cross-linking, reactive  and nitrogen species detoxification as well as the counteraction of inflammation. As a part of the immune response, macrophages are the primary cell type that is activated. These cells play a crucial role in many diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, carnosine was first tested for its ability to counteract oxidative stress. In our experimental model, represented by RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitors, carnosine was able to decrease the intracellular concentration of superoxide anions (O•) as well as the expression of Nox1 and Nox2 enzyme genes. This carnosine antioxidant activity was accompanied by the attenuation of the PMA-induced Akt phosphorylation, the down-regulation of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNAs, and the up-regulation of the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1. Additionally, when carnosine was used at the highest dose (20 mM), there was a generalized amelioration of the macrophage energy state, evaluated through the increase both in the total nucleoside triphosphate concentrations and the sum of the pool of intracellular nicotinic coenzymes. Finally, carnosine was able to decrease the oxidized (NADP)/reduced (NADPH) ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in a concentration dependent manner, indicating a strong inhibitory effect of this molecule towards the main source of reactive  species in macrophages.

The present study showed that except for parent EtFOSE, N-ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamide  (EtFOSAA), N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (EtFOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide  (FOSAA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and PFOS were detected in earthworms, with EtFOSAA as the primary biotransformation product. The biota-to-sand accumulation factor (BSAF) and uptake rate coefficient (k) of EtFOSE were 5.7 and 0.542/d, respectively. The elimination rate constants (k) decreased in the order EtFOSA (0.167/d) ∼ FOSAA (0.147/d) > FOSA (0.119/d) ∼ EtFOSAA (0.117/d) > EtFOSE (0.095/d) > PFOS (0.069/d). No significant effects were observed in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities between EtFOSE treatments and controls. EtFOSE could cause significant accumulation of reactive  species (ROS) in earthworms. Peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly activated by 41.4-74.3%, 37.2-44.4% and 32.4-52.3% from day 4-10, respectively, while 8-Hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were elevated by 47.7-70.3% from day 8-10, demonstrating that EtFOSE induced oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage in earthworms. Significant increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) with 41.6-62.8% activation (8-10 d) gave indirect evidence on the conjugation of EtFOSE or its corresponding metabolites during phase II of detoxication. This study provides important information on the fate and potential risks of EtFOSE to terrestrial invertebrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Current in the cells proved to be steady from 25 to 35 °C, significant decrease was, however, revealed in the current below 20 °C. Direct calculation of non-toxic biodegradable substrate concentration in water/wastewater from the current in MFCs is possible only in the non-saturated substrate concentration range due to the Monod-like dependence of the current. This range was determined by a fitted and verified Monod-based kinetic model. Half saturation constant (K) values were calculated at 30 °C applying different external resistance values (100 Ω, 600 Ω and 1000 Ω, respectively).

It is well established that citrullination of histones (e.g., CitH3) facilitates chromatin decondensation during NET formation (NETosis), particularly during calcium-induced NETosis that is independent of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activation. However, the importance of other forms of histone modifications in NETosis has not been established. We considered that acetylation of histones would also facilitate NETosis. To test this hypothesis, we induced NOX-dependent NETosis in human neutrophils with phorbol myristate  or lipopolysaccharide (from  0128), and NOX-independent NETosis with calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin (from  ) in the presence or absence of two pan histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), belinostat and panobinostat (within their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) range). The presence of these inhibitors increased histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) in neutrophils. Histone acetylation was sufficient to cause a significant increase (~20%) in NETosis in resting neutrophils above baseline values. When acetylation was promoted during NOX-dependent or -independent NETosis, the degree of NETosis additively increased (~15⁻30%). Reactive  species (ROS) production is essential for baseline NETosis (mediated either by NOX or mitochondria); however, HDACis did not promote ROS production. The chromatin decondensation step requires promoter melting and transcriptional firing in both types of NETosis; consistent with this point, suppression of transcription prevented the NETosis induced by the acetylation of histones. Collectively, this study establishes that histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) promotes NETosis at baseline, and when induced by both NOX-dependent or -independent pathway agonists, in human neutrophils. Therefore, we propose that acetylation of histone is a key component of NETosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31109517>Impact of turning waste on performance and energy balance in thermophilic solid-state anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste.</a></h2><p>Mixing is an important operation in solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) to improve the mass transfer of the solid phase. This study proposed simple turning by loader in common garage-type digester without commonly used mixer or percolation system (simplified SS-AD). In simplified-SS-AD, turning is conducted in open condition. Thus, oxidation of anaerobic sludge during turning would influence digestion performance. Therefore, in this study, the effect of turning wastes by mixing during digestion on a simplified SS-AD fed with rice straw and pig urine was investigated. Four different mixing frequency levels-no mixing (M0) and mixing once a day (M-1/1), once every 3 days (M-1/3) and once a week (M-1/7)-were conducted. Methane yields of M0, M-1/3 and M-1/7 were comparable with each other. Methane yield and lag period of M-1/1 were approximately 61% and 155% of M0 (351.2  mL/g VS and 4.7 days), respectively. Furthermore, the chemical  demand (COD) of  accumulated in the digestate of M-1/1 was comparable to the difference in the COD of methane production between M-1/1 and the other treatments. Mixing every day also resulted in a higher oxidation-reduction potential and carbon dioxide content. These findings suggest that methanogenesis was inhibited in M-1/1 by frequent mixing in the atmosphere. Net energy analysis of SS-AD plant operation showed that M0 can obtain the highest net energy gain, whereas net energy production of M-1/7 was reduced by rewarming after mixing. Therefore, no mixing is the most effective approach for the proposed simplified process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To enhance the production of PhLA from glucose using recombinant Escherichia coli, the effects of glucose concentration and  limitation on PhLA production are assessed in a fed-batch system using dissolved  (DO)-stat method. The highest titer of PhLA (7.3 g L ) is observed with a high concentration of glucose and under -limited conditions (DO = 0 ppm). Under  limitation, cell growth and the formation of  and l-phenylalanine (Phe) by-products after 72 h of cultivation are reduced by 30%, 70%, and 81%, respectively, as compared to that under high DO conditions (DO = 5 ppm). Gene expression levels are compared between low and high DO conditions by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Several genes in the glycolysis (gapA and pykA), pentose phosphate (tktA), and early shikimate pathways for PhLA biosynthesis (aroF, aroG, and aroH) are upregulated under  limitation. The results suggest that  limitation affects metabolism in the shikimate pathway at both metabolic and transcriptional levels and that controlling the DO level is critical for enhanced production of a variety of aromatic compounds through the shikimate pathway.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Merr. & Perry (Myrtaceae), commonly known as clove, originally found in the Muluku Islands in East Indonesia, is widely used as a spice and has numerous medicinal properties.This study investigated the antioxidant potential of S. aromaticum aqueous extract (SAAE) in vitro and its protective effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation in mice.Neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors and reactive  species (ROS) generation was measured by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. Superoxide anion generation was detected by cytochrome c reduction assay. HO was detected by DCFH fluorescence assay. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was mesured by tetramethyl benzidine oxidation method. To study the anti-inflammatory activity of SAAE, lung inflammation was induced in mice (BALB/c) by intra-tracheal instillation of lypopolysaccharide (5 µg/mouse), and SAAE (200 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally prior to LPS administration. Bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue were collected to assess inflammatory cells count and total protein content. Metalloproteinases activity was detected by zymography technique.SAAE inhibited luminol-amplified chemiluminescence of resting neutrophils and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine- or phorbol myristate -stimulated neutrophils, with an inhibitory effect starting at a concentration as low as 0.5 µg/mL. Moreover, SAAE reduced significantly MPO activity and it exhibits a dose-dependent action (IC = 0.5 µg/mL). In vivo results showed that SAAE decreased markedly neutrophil count (From 61% to 15%) and proteins leakage into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Gelatin zymography assay showed that S. aromaticum inhibited MMP-2 (15%) and MMP-9 (18%) activity in lung homogenates.Our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of SAAE, in vivo, is due to the inhibition of ROS production and metalloproteinases activity via its action on MPO. According to these findings, SAAE could be a potential source of new compounds with anti-inflammatory activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724050>Immunomodulation of Zerumbone via Decreasing the Production of Reactive  Species from Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>Zerumbone has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer and anti-hyperglycemic effects but the specific mechanism through which zerumbone exerts its anti-inflammatory action through inhibiting reactive  species was not well studied. Hence, this paper studied the zerumbone capacity to inhibit intracellular and extracellular Reactive  Species (ROS) produced by whole blood cell, polymorphoneutrophil (PMNs) and macrophage cells due to the zymogen and phorbolmyristerate  (PMA) oxidant effect.Zymogen and PMA based chemiluminescence assay were used to determine the immunomodulatory effect of zerumbone at concentrations (100, 10 and 1 μg mL-1) toward production of Reactive  Species (ROS) from whole blood, PMNs and macrophage.Zerumbone significantly inhibited intracellular and extracellular ROS production by the zymosan/PMA-activated phagocyte cells with IC50 values of (16.3±0.1, 23.7±0.1 and 4.97±0.1 μg mL-1) against whole blood, PMNs and macrophage respectively.The anti-inflammatory activity of zerumbone was so much significant that even strong oxidant (zymogen and PMA) were not able to produce reactive  species when incubated together in phagocytic cells, thus suppress production of ROS. Therefore, it is highly used in herbal medicine as a potent immunomodulatory therapy in various inflammation associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30629548>Proof of concept of wastewater treatment via passive aeration SND using a novel zeolite amended biofilm reactor.</a></h2><p>The current paper describes a novel passive aeration simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (PASND) zeolite amended biofilm reactor that removes organic carbon and nitrogen from wastewater with low-energy consumption. Next to the ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB), this reactor contained naturally enriched glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) and zeolite powder to initially adsorb BOD () and ammonium (NH-N) from synthetic wastewater under anaerobic conditions. Draining of the treated wastewater exposed the biofilm directly to air enabling low-energy  supply by passive aeration. This allowed the adsorbed ammonium to be oxidized by the AOB and the produced nitrite and nitrate to be reduced simultaneously by the GAOs using the adsorbed BOD (stored as PHAs) as carbon source. Overall, with an operation mode of 1 h anaerobic and 4 h aerobic phase, the nutrient removal efficiency after single treatment was about 94.3% for BOD and 72.2% for nitrogen (NH-N). As high-energy aeration of the bulk solution for  supply is completely avoided, the energy requirement of the proposed PASND biofilm reactor can be theoretically cut down to more than 50% compared to the traditional activated sludge process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699248>Impact of carbon source and COD/N on the concurrent operation of partial denitrification and anammox.</a></h2><p>In this study, concurrent operation of anammox and partial denitrification within a nonacclimated mixed culture system was proposed. The impact of carbon sources (, glycerol, methanol, and ethanol) and COD/NO3 -N ratio on partial denitrification selection under both short- and long-term operations was investigated. Results from short-term testing showed that all carbon sources supported partial denitrification. However,  and glycerol were preferred due to their display of efficient partial denitrification selection, which may be related to their different electron transport pathways in comparison with methanol. Long-term operation confirmed results of batch tests by showing the contribution of partial denitrification to nitrate removal above 90% after acclimation in both  and glycerol reactors. In contrast, methanol showed challenges of maintaining efficient partial denitrification. COD/NO3 -N ratio mainly controlled the rate of nitrate reduction and not directly partial denitrification selection; thus, it should be used to balance between denitrification rate and anammox rate. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The authors aimed to investigate the impact of carbon sources and COD/NO3-N ratio on partial denitrification selection. All the carbon sources supported partial denitrification as long as the nitrite sink was available. 90% partial denitrification could be achieved with both  and glycerol in long-term operations. COD/NO3-N ratio did not directly control partial denitrification but can be used to balance between denitrification rate and anammox rate.© 2018 Water Environment Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401196>NMDA receptor modulation of glutamate release in activated neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil depletion improves neurologic outcomes in experimental sepsis/brain injury. We hypothesized that neutrophils may exacerbate neuronal injury through the release of neurotoxic quantities of the neurotransmitter glutamate.Real-time glutamate release by primary human neutrophils was determined using enzymatic biosensors. Bacterial and direct protein-kinase C (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-; PMA) activation of neutrophils in human whole blood, isolated neutrophils or human cell lines were compared in the presence/absence of N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. Bacterial and direct activation of neutrophils from wild-type and transgenic murine neutrophils deficient in NMDAR-scaffolding proteins were compared using flow cytometry (phagocytosis, reactive  species (ROS) generation) and real-time respirometry ( consumption).Both glutamate and the NMDAR co-agonist d-serine are rapidly released by neutrophils in response to bacterial and PMA-induced activation. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade reduced both the autocrine release of glutamate, d-serine and the respiratory burst by activated primary human neutrophils. A highly specific small-molecule inhibitor ZL006 that limits NMDAR-mediated neuronal injury also reduced ROS by activated neutrophils in a murine model of peritonitis, via uncoupling of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit from its' scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). Genetic ablation of PSD-95 reduced ROS production by activated murine neutrophils. Pharmacological blockade of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit reduced primary human neutrophil activation induced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, a glutamate-secreting Gram-negative bacillus closely related to pathogens that cause hospital-acquired infections.These data suggest that release of glutamate by activated neutrophils augments ROS production in an autocrine manner via actions on NMDAR expressed by these cells.

Although fluorescence dyes or genetically encoded biosensors have been developed, CL is still used due to its high sensitivity, ease of use, and low cost. While initially established and used to measure high levels of ROS in phagocytic cells, CL assays are not ideal for measuring low levels of ROS. Here, we developed a newly modified CL assay using a chemiluminescent imaging system for measuring low concentrations of ROS in nonphagocytic cells. We found that dissolving luminol in NaOH, rather than DMSO, increased the HO-induced CL signal and that the addition of 4-iodophenylboronic acid (4IPBA) further increased CL intensity. Our new system also increased the rate and intensity of the CL signal in phorbol 12-myristate 13-- (PMA-) treated HT-29 colon cancer cells compared to those in luminol only. We were able to quantify ROS levels from both cells and media in parallel using an HO standard. A significant benefit to our system is that we can easily measure stimulus-induced ROS formation in a real-time manner and also investigate intracellular signaling pathways from a single sample simultaneously. We found that PMA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), protein tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), and Src, and increased actin stress fiber formation in a ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, treatment with either N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) reduced the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of these PTKs, implicating a potential role in cellular ROS signaling. Thus, our newly optimized CL assay using 4IPBA and a chemiluminescent imaging method provides a simple, real-time, and low-cost method for the quantification of low levels of ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654847>A novel Cu(II) distorted cubane complex containing CuO core as the first tetranuclear catalyst for temperature dependent oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butyl catechol and in interaction with DNA & protein (BSA).</a></h2><p>The tri-dentate Schiff base ligand 3-(2-hydroxyethylimino)-1-phenylbut-1-en-1-ol (L) produced the tetra-nuclear Cu(II) distorted cubane complex which contain CuO core, upon reaction with Cu(II).HO. The complex was structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and found that, in this tetrameric and tetra-nuclear distorted cubane structure, each two-fold deprotonated Schiff base ligand coordinated to a Cu(II) center with their alcoholic oxygens and imine nitrogens and formed six and five-membered chelate rings. At the same time, each ligand bridged to a neighboring Cu(II) atom by its alcoholic , thus the metal centers became penta-coordinated. The copper(II) complex with μ-ɳ-hydroxo bridges and Cu….Cu distance about 3 Å was structurally similar to the active site of natural catechol oxidase enzyme and exhibited excellent catecholase activity in aerobic oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butyl catechol to its o-quinone. The kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of 3, 5-DTBCH catalyzed by [CuL] complex, were studied at four different temperatures from 283 to 313K by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Interaction of [CuL] complex with FS-DNA was investigated by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry (CV), circular dichroism (CD) and agarose gel electrophoresis. The main mode of binding of the complexes with DNA was intercalation. The interaction between [CuL] complex and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied by UV-Vis, fluorescence and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated a high binding affinity of the complex to BSA. In vitro anticancer activity of the complex was evaluated against A549, Jurkat and Ragi cell lines by MTT assay. The complex was remarkably active against the cell lines and can be a good candidate for an anticancer drug.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the antioral cancer ability of ethyl  extract of  (EANV). The preferential killing ability of EANV was determined by MTS-based cell viability assays. The bioactive effects were further screened by flow cytometry for apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. At 24 h treatment, EANV dose dependently decreased six types of oral cancer cells, but the normal oral cells (HGF-1) kept a 90% viability. EANV also showed chronic antiproliferative effects and inhibited 3D sphere formation ability of oral cancer cells. Ca9-22 and CAL 27 oral cancer cells with high response to EANV increased subG1 populations and enhanced Annexin V- and pancaspase-detected apoptosis in these cells. EANV also induced the generation of reactive  species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide and the dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the oxidative DNA damage level such as 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine was increased in EANV-treated oral cancer cells.

Among them, organic acids such as l-lactic and succinic acids are the most important ones. It is known that the wild-type  grows well in the temperature range between 25 and 37 °C. Above 40 °C, the biomass growth usually abruptly stops; however, the bacteria remain metabolically active. High temperature affects the metabolic activity of  cells and can lead to changes in the composition and quantity of the fermentation products. Therefore, in a series of subsequent selection steps, we tried to obtain prototrophic strains capable of growing at 44 °C from the culture of homoserine auxotroph  ATCC 13287. During selection, we used complex and mineral media containing succinic and citric acids. As a result, we obtained 47 clones able to grow at elevated temperature. Moreover, the estimated optimal growth temperature for several of them was about 40 °C or higher. Under  limitation conditions,  strains produce organic acids. Regardless of the tested clone, l-lactic acid was the main product. However, its concentration was the highest in the cultures performed at 44 °C. The elevated temperature also affected the biosynthesis of other organic acids. Compared to the parental strain, the concentration of acetic acid increased, and of succinic acid decreased in the cultures of thermotolerant strains. Strain RCG44.3 exhibited interesting properties; it was able to synthesise 27.1 g/L l-lactic acid, with production yield of 0.57 g/g, during 24 h of fermentation at 44 °C.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31368568>Phenolic components rich ethyl  fraction of Orostachys japonicus inhibits lipid accumulation by regulating reactive  species generation in adipogenesis.</a></h2><p>In this study, Orostachys japonicus was extracted with ethyl alcohol and fractionated by a serial of organic solvents.

The gene expression of enzymes involved in the antioxidant system increased in O. japonicus-treated cells. messeanger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of the pro-oxidant enzymes such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen oxidase4 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase suppressed in O. japonicus-treated cells. O. japonicus also inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of adipogenic transcription factors (including proliferator activated receptor-γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α) and their target gene (adipocyte protein 2). These results suggest that O. japonicus inhibits adipogenesis by controlling pro-/anti-oxidant enzyme responses and adipogenic transcription factors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ROS generation is markedly related to the pathogenesis and development of metabolic disorders. Treatment with O. japonicus inhibited ROS generation and lipid accumulation during adipogenesis.

However, large scale bioprocess performance can be affected by presence of physical and chemical gradients in bioreactors which are a consequence of imperfect mixing and limited  transfer. Hence, upscaling comes along with local and time dependent fluctuations of cultivation conditions. This study emphasizes on scale-up related effects of microbial 1,4-butanediol production by comprehensive bioprocess characterization in lab scale. Due to metabolic network constraints 1,4-butanediol formation takes place under  limited microaerobic conditions, which can be hardly realized in large scale bioreactor. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which substrate and  availability influence the productivity. It was found, that the substrate specific product yield and the production rate are higher under substrate excess than under substrate limitation. Furthermore, the level of  supply within microaerobic conditions revealed strong effects on product and by-product formation. Under strong  deprivation nearly 30% of the consumed carbon is converted into 1,4-butanediol, whereas an increase in  supply results in 1,4-butanediol reduction of 77%. Strikingly, increasing  availability leads to strong increase of main by-product  as well as doubled carbon dioxide formation. The study provides clear evidence that scale-up of microaerobic bioprocesses constitute a substantial challenge. Although  is strictly required for product formation, the data give clear evidence that terms of anaerobic and especially aerobic conditions strongly interfere with 1,4-butanediol production.

The enriched MMC was able to accumulate PHA up to 72.6% of cell dry weight (CDW) with pulse addition of  controlled by the dissolved  (DO) concentration in the reactor. In a batch accumulation experiment with , the PHA content achieved (28.5% CDW) was less than that of the pulse feeding strategy with the same amount of  (~2000 mg C/L). Using anaerobically treated and acidified brewery wastewater fed in pulses, the maximum PHA accumulated by the enriched MMC was similar for both wastewaters (45% CDW), in spite of the higher volatile fatty acid concentration in acidified brewery wastewater. The pulse feed addition controlled by the DO concentration was difficult to implement for wastewater as compared to  because the difference in DO concentration between substrate availability and depletion was low. For the batch addition of acidified wastewater, a slightly lower PHA content (39% CDW) was obtained. These results show that both brewery wastewaters can be utilized for PHA production with a similar maximum PHA storage capacity.Copyright © 2018.

Therefore, it is necessary to optimize parameters influencing cell growth and expression of recombinant protein.In the present study, the optimal culture conditions for expression of reteplase by  ( BL21 (DE3) in a bench-top bioreactor was determined. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design was used to evaluate the effect of three variables (., temperature, shaking speed and pH) and their interactions with cellular growth and protein production. The obtained data were analyzed by Design Expert software.Based on results of 15 experiments, a response surface quadratic model was developed which was used to explain the relation between production of reteplase and three investigated variables. The high value of "R-Squared" (0.9894) and F-value of 51.99 confirmed the accuracy of this model. According to the developed model, the optimum fermentation conditions for reteplase expression were temperature of 32, shaking speed of 210 , and pH of 8.4. This predicted condition was applied for the production of reteplase in the bioreactor leading to a protein yield of 188 .Our results indicate the significant role of culture conditions (., pH, temperature and  supply) in protein expression at large scale and confirm the need for optimization. The proposed strategy here can also be applied to experimental set-up of optimization for fermentation of other proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018580> Induces Apoptosis and Suppresses Migration in Cancer Cells: Role of Reactive  Species.</a></h2><p>Although over 100 species of Curcuma are reported, only  is extensively studied. , a poorly studied species, is most commonly distributed in the Kerala state of India. For the first time, we examined the efficacy of different fractions (acetone, hexane, and ethyl ) of  against glioma, cervical, and breast cancer cell lines. As determined by mitochondrial reductase activity assay, the viability of cancer cells was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by the three fractions. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC-50) values after the treatment of C-6 glioma cells for 48 h was found to be 32.97 µg/mL (acetone extract), 40.63 µg/mL (hexane extract), and 51.65 µg/mL (ethyl  extract). Of the three fractions, the acetone fraction was more effective. The long-term colony formation of cancer cells was significantly suppressed by the acetone fraction. Analyses using DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, AO/PI (acridine orange/propidium iodide) staining, DNA laddering, and sub-G1 population revealed that the acetone extract induced apoptosis in glioma cells. The extract induced reactive  species generation and suppressed the expression of cell survival proteins. The migration of cancer cells was also suppressed by the acetone extract. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicated that tetracontane, dotriacontane, hexatriacontane, pentacosane, hexacosane, and eicosane are the major components in the acetone extract. Collectively, the extract from  exhibited anti-carcinogenic activities in cancer cells.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for such an effect, we compared two cytotoxic treatments able to induce the viral lytic cycle, named 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- (TPA) (T) in combination with sodium butyrate (B) and bortezomib (BZ), with two cytotoxic treatments that did not activate this process, named metformin (MET) and quercetin (Q). Our results indicated that TB and bortezomib increased levels of  reactive species (ROS) while metformin and quercetin reduced them. The finding that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a reactive oxigen species (ROS) scavenger, counteracted K-bZIP expression induced by TB or bortezomib, confirmed that an ROS increase played a role in KSHV lytic cycle activation. Moreover, we found that TB and bortezomib up-regulated p62/Sequestosome1(p62/SQSTM1) protein, while metformin and quercetin down-regulated it. p62/SQSTM1 silencing or the inhibition of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) or Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), that mediate p62/SQSTM1 transcription, also reduced KSHV lytic antigen expression induced by TB or bortezomib. Interestingly, such combination treatments further increased intracellular ROS and cytotoxicity induced by the single TB or bortezomib treatment, suggesting that NRF2, HSF1 and p62/SQSTM1 keep the ROS level under control, allowing primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells to continue to survive and KSHV to replicate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581036>Integrative isotopic and molecular approach for the diagnosis and implementation of an efficient in-situ enhanced biological reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes.</a></h2><p>Based on the previously observed intrinsic bioremediation potential of a site originally contaminated with perchloroethene (PCE), field-derived lactate-amended microcosms were performed to test different lactate isomers and concentrations, and find clearer isotopic and molecular parameters proving the feasibility of an in-situ enhanced reductive dechlorination (ERD) from PCE-to-ethene (ETH). According to these laboratory results, which confirmed the presence of Dehalococcoides sp. and the vcrA gene, an in-situ ERD pilot test consisting of a single injection of lactate in a monitoring well was performed and monitored for 190 days. The parameters used to follow the performance of the ERD comprised the analysis of i) hydrochemistry, including redox potential (Eh), and the concentrations of redox sensitive species, chlorinated ethenes (CEs), lactate, and ; ii) stable isotope composition of carbon of CEs, and sulphur and  of sulphate; and iii) 16S rRNA gene sequencing from groundwater samples. Thus, it was proved that the injection of lactate promoted sulphate-reducing conditions, with the subsequent decrease in Eh, which allowed for the full reductive dechlorination of PCE to ETH in the injection well. The biodegradation of CEs was also confirmed by the enrichment in C and carbon isotopic mass balances. The metagenomic results evidenced the shift in the composition of the microbial population towards the predominance of fermentative bacteria. Given the success of the in-situ pilot test, a full-scale ERD with lactate was then implemented at the site. After one year of treatment, PCE and trichloroethene were mostly depleted, whereas vinyl chloride (VC) and ETH were the predominant metabolites. Most importantly, the shift of the carbon isotopic mass balances towards more positive values confirmed the complete reductive dechlorination, including the VC-to-ETH reaction step. The combination of techniques used here provides complementary lines of evidence for the diagnosis of the intrinsic biodegradation potential of a polluted site, but also to monitor the progress, identify potential difficulties, and evaluate the success of ERD at the field scale.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of the same reactor configuration, inoculum, substrate, temperature, and pH, MFCs produced different current and power density. To understand which factor(s) affected electricity generation, here, we analyzed a complex microbial community in an anodic biofilm and fermentation broth using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and metabolomics.Microbial biomass on the anode was lower in MFCs generating more electricity (0.09-0.16 mg cm-anode) than in those generating less electricity (0.60-2.80 mg cm-anode), while being equal (3890-4196 mg L-broth) in the fermentation broth over the same operational period. Chemical  demand removal and  concentration were also similar in fermentation broths. MFCs generating more electricity had relatively more exoelectrogenic bacteria, such as  sp., but fewer -utilizing  sp. and/or  sp. in anodic biofilms. Accordingly, anodic biofilms generating more electricity presented higher levels of most intracellular metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and a higher intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, but a lower intracellular NADH/NAD ratio. Moreover, the level of intracellular glutamate, an essential metabolite for microbial anabolic reactions, correlated negatively with current density.Microbial growth on the anode and intracellular glutamate levels negatively affect electricity generation by MFCs. Reduced formation of anodic biofilm, in which intracellular glutamate concentration is 33.9 μmol g-cell or less, favors the growth of -utilizing  sp. on the anode and improves current generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273993>Photoactive Hexanuclear Molybdenum Nanoclusters Embedded in Molecular Organogels.</a></h2><p>Hexanuclear molybdenum clusters are attractive species because of their outstanding photonic properties, and in the past they have been attached to a variety of supports such as organic polymers and inorganic nanoparticles, as described in the recent literature. Here, a cluster of the formula TBA[MoIAc] (TBA = tetrabutylammonium; Ac = ) has been supported on molecular organogels for the first time, resulting in a new soft material with remarkable photoactivity. Electron and confocal microscopic analyses showed the alignment of the nanoclusters to 1D self-assembled fibers formed by the organic gelator, and emission spectroscopy corroborated the interaction of the emissive clusters with such fibrillary structures. The new hybrid system is a deep-red emissive material (phosphorescence maximum at ca. 680 nm), with chromatic coordinates  = 0.725 and  = 0.274, capable of efficiently generating singlet  (O) upon illumination with white light, as demonstrated by the photooxygenation of 9,10-dimethylanthracene and 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene.

A modified anaerobic digestion model No. 1 (ADM1) was proposed to characterize the mesophilic two-phase anaerobic digestion at the feedstock ratios of waste activated sludge to corn silage 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of the modified ADM1 was operated on the platform AQUASIM 2.0 while the kinetic parameter estimation and simulation was implemented on the platform MATLAB 7.0. The Monod maximum specific uptake rate for  (k) was calibrated to 29.0 d, and the half-saturation value for  (k) 0.40 kgCOD/m in the acidification phase while k 35.0 d, Monod maximum specific uptake rate for hydrogen (k) 23.0 d and k 0.70 kgCOD/m in the methanogenic phase in the modified ADM1. The results from the batch tests showed the optimal feedstock ratio of waste activated sludge to corn silage was 2:1. Under this condition, chemical  demand could reach the largest removal at around 51.0%, while Ammonia-nitrogen and total phosphorous increased by the maximal 192.0% and 71.5%. Besides, volatile fatty acids were lowest at about 0.27 kgCOD/m, and the biogas flow was highest at about 47.6 mL/d. The pH values were always maintained at 6.8-7.2. Good agreements could be achieved between the measured data and the simulation with the modified ADM1. Therefore, the optimal and preferable operating factors during two-phase anaerobic digestion of co-substrates could be obtained from the simulation. The modified model will contribute to further investigating and predicting the characteristics of the process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of pulsed carbon feeding for promoting the co-degradation of indigenous pharmaceuticals from pre-treated wastewater in a fixed-bed porous biofilm reactor (slow sand filter). The addition of  (carbon source) resulted in three different enhancement/limitation effects, which were compound dependent: 1) atenolol and iohexol experienced enhanced co-degradation followed by constant ( independent) degradation; 2) metoprolol, iomeprol, diclofenac, propranolol and sulfamethizole co-degradation dependent on aerobic turnover, but inhibited at higher  concentrations (60-300 mg C/L); 3) sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were removed independently of  and  concentration.

Modified or controlled atmospheres (MAs or CAs) with higher or lower concentrations of atmospheric gases, mainly  (O), carbon dioxide (CO), ozone (O), and nitric oxide (NO), provide a cost-effective method to kill target pests and protect stored products. In this review, the most recent discoveries in the field of MAs are discussed, with a focus on pest control as well as current MA technologies. Although MAs have been used for more than 30 years in pest control and play a role in storage pest management, the specific mechanisms by which insects are affected by and adapt to low O (hypoxia) and high carbon CO (hypercapnia) are not completely understood. Insect tolerance to hypoxia/anoxia and hypercapnia involves a decrease in aerobic metabolism, including decreased NADPH enzyme activity, and subsequently, decreases in glutathione production and catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, as well as increases in carboxyl esterase and phosphatase activities. In addition, hypoxia induces energy and nutrient production, and in adapted insects, glycolysis and pyruvate carboxylase fluxes are downregulated, accompanied with O consumption and  production. Consequently, genes encoding various signal transduction pathway components, including epidermal growth factor, insulin, Notch, and Toll/Imd signaling, are downregulated. We review the changes in insect energy and nutrient sources, metabolic enzymes, and molecular pathways in response to modified O, CO, NO, and O concentrations, as well as the role of MAs in pest control. This knowledge will be useful for applying MAs in combination with temperature control for pest control in stored food products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971060>4'-O-β-D-Glucosyl-5-O-Methylvisamminol Attenuates Pro-Inflammatory Responses and Protects against Oxidative Damages.</a></h2><p>We attempted to examine anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects of 4'-O-β-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol (GOMV), the first epigenetic inhibitor of histone phosphorylation at Ser10. While GOMV did not affect the viability of murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, it significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced generation of prostaglandin E (PGE) and nitric oxide (NO) through transcriptional inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

Ethyl  fraction of 80% ethanol extract of  stem (PN3) containing polyphenols had a higher  reporter gene activity as monitored by the activity of the NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway in cells in comparison to extracts from other species and under other conditions. The Nrf2 was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to PN3, followed by induction of the Nrf2 target gene expression, including , , and  in HepG2 cells. Phosphorylation of Nrf2 in HepG2 cells was enhanced in PN3, which was mediated by PKCδ, ERK, and p38 MAPK. Consequently, PN3 inhibited arachidonic acid (AA) + iron-induced reactive  species generation and glutathione depletion, and, thus, highlighted their role in cytotoxicity. Treatment with major polyphenols of PN3, including catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and -coumaric acid, also improved AA + iron-mediated oxidative stress and, thus, improved cell viability. Treatment with phenylhydrazine in mice, i.e., the iron overload liver injury model, increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels and changed histological features in mice-a response that was almost completely blocked by PN3 administration. Moreover, PN3 extract mitigated phenylhydrazine-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Conclusively, PN3 can exert a hepatoprotective effect against iron overload-induced acute liver damage due to its antioxidant properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520996>Fabrication of CuO-Ag nanocomposites with enhanced durability and bactericidal activity.</a></h2><p>Hybrid Cuprous oxide-silver (CuO-Ag) have attracted tremendous attention due to their various applications in photocatalysis, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and optical features. Here we expanded the application to exhibit excellent chemical stability and synergistic bactericidal. We prepared CuO-Ag heterostructure through thermally decomposing Ag- to deposit Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) onto CuO surface. CuO-Ag heterostructure bears exceptional stability while exposing to , water, and light, owing to the physical coating of Ag NPs and transferring the electrons and holes inside the CuO to the surface through a Schottky barrier to prevent photocorrosion. The deposition of Ag NPs also improved the intensity and time of oxidative stress reaction of CuO, proved by reactive  species (ROS) examination. Ag NPs distributed on the surface of CuO particles formed a large of ion release channel, resulting in excellent sustained release of copper ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the mechanism of photocatalysis and ROS generation. The constructed CuO-Ag heterostructure exhibit highly long-term sterilization activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) which were maintained around 70% and 80% and were increased by 40% and 50% compared with free CuO after being immersed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solutions within 14 days.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A potential shortcut is assessing the antimicrobial activity of already approved drugs. Intrudingly, the antibacterial action of glatiramer  (GA) has recently been discovered. GA is a well-known and safe immunomodulatory drug particular effective against Gram-negative bacteria, which disrupts biological membranes by resembling the activity of antimicrobial peptides. Thus, GA can potentially be included in treatment strategies used to combat infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negatives. One potential application is chronic respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however the safety of GA inhalation has never been assessed. Here, the safety of inhaling nebulized GA is evaluated in a preclinical pig model. The potential side effects, i.e., bronchoconstriction, respiratory tract symptoms and systemic- and local inflammation were assessed by ventilator monitoring, clinical observation, biochemistry, flowcytometry, and histopathology. No signs of bronchoconstriction assessed by increased airway peak pressure, Ppeak, or decreased  pressure were observed. Also, there were no signs of local inflammation in the final histopathology examination of the pulmonary tissue. As we did not observe any potential pulmonary side effects of inhaled GA, our preliminary results suggest that GA inhalation is safe and potentially can be a part of the treatment strategy targeting chronic lung infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266224>Antiproliferation for Breast Cancer Cells by Ethyl  Extract of  x ( x ).</a></h2><p>Extracts from the Nepenthes plant have anti-microorganism and anti-inflammation effects. However, the anticancer effect of the Nepenthes plant is rarely reported, especially for breast cancer cells. Here, we evaluate the antitumor effects of the ethyl  extract of   x ( x ) (EANT) against breast cancer cells. Cell viability and flow cytometric analyses were used to analyze apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. EANT exhibits a higher antiproliferation ability to two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and SKBR3) as compared to normal breast cells (M10). A mechanistic study demonstrates that EANT induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells with evidence of subG1 accumulation and annexin V increment. EANT also induces glutathione (GSH) depletion, resulting in dramatic accumulations of reactive  species (ROS) and mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX), as well as the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). These oxidative stresses attack DNA, respectively leading to DNA double strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage in γH2AX and 8-oxo-2'deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) assays. Overall these findings clearly revealed that EANT induced changes were suppressed by the ROS inhibitor. In conclusion, our results have shown that the ROS-modulating natural product (EANT) has antiproliferation activity against breast cancer cells through apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068919>Effect of Respiratory Growth on the Metabolite Production and Stress Robustness of  N87 Cultivated in Cheese Whey Permeate Medium.</a></h2><p>Cheese whey permeate (WP) is a low-cost feedstock used for the production of biomass and metabolites from several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains. In this study,  N87 was cultivated in an optimized WP medium (WPM) to evaluate the effect of anaerobic and respiratory conditions on the growth performances (kinetics, biomass yield), consumption of sugars (lactose, galactose, glucose) and citrate, metabolite production [organic acids, volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] and stress survival (oxidative, heat, freezing, freeze-drying). The transcription of genes involved in the main pathways for pyruvate conversion was quantified through Real Time-PCR to elucidate the metabolic shifts due to respiratory state. Cultivation in WPM induced a diauxic growth in both anaerobic and respiratory conditions, and  N87 effectively consumed the lactose and galactose present in WPM. Genomic information suggested that membrane PTS system and tagatose-6-P pathway mediated the metabolism of lactose and galactose in  N87. Respiration did not affect specific growth rate and biomass production, but significantly altered the pyruvate conversion pathways, reducing lactate accumulation and promoting the formation of , acetoin and diacetyl to ensure the redox balance. Ethanol was not produced under either cultivation. Pyruvate oxidase (),  kinase (), α-acetolactate decarboxylase (), acetolactate synthase () and oxaloacetate decarboxylase () genes were up-regulated under respiration, while L-lactate dehydrogenase (), pyruvate formate lyase (), pyruvate carboxylase (), and phosphate acetyltransferase () were down regulated by . Transcription analysis was consistent with metabolite production, confirming that POX-ACK and ALS-ALD were the alternative pathways activated under aerobic cultivation. Respiratory growth affected the production of volatile compounds useful for the development of aroma profile in several fermented foods, and promoted the survival of  N87 to oxidative stresses and long-term storage. This study confirmed that the respiration-based technology coupled with cultivation on low-cost medium may be effectively exploited to produce competitive and functional starter and/or adjunct cultures. Our results, additionally, provided further information on the activation and regulation of metabolic pathways in homofermentative LAB grown under respiratory promoting conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31482528>The effect of ferulic acid against lead-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in kidney and testes of rats.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants which leads to reactive  species (ROS) production in cells. Reactive  species contains  radicals that easily react with other molecules in the biological system. For decades, lead  (Pb(CHO2)) is used as an additive for many widely used chemical products such as insecticides, hair dyes, and cosmetics; however, contact with lead  may irritate skin, eyes, and mucous membranes.In the present study, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of using ferulic acid to inhibit lead -induced toxicity in rats is investigated. Lead  was orally given at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight for 10 days, either alone or with ferulic acid at dose 25 mg/kg. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH), total testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured. Also, reactive  species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and catalase (CAT) activities were determined. In addition, histopathological changes of testes and kidney were examined. Results showed that administration of lead  induced oxidative stress through attenuation of luteinizing hormone, total testosterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in serum. Moreover, the kidney and testes of lead -treated animals exhibited elevation of ROS level, lipid peroxide levels, as well as lysosomal enzyme activity such acid phosphatase and N-acetyl-β-glucosminidase. DNA fragmentation and histological changes were also observed in lead -treated group. In contrast, ferulic acid treatment reduced the deleterious effects induced by lead  in both testes and kidney tissues. These results illustrated that ferulic acid has a protective action against toxicity caused by lead  in rats. In conclusions, ferulic acid may have future therapeutic relevance in the prevention of lead -induced testicular and renal toxicity in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701573>Anti-β2GPI/β2GPI induces human neutrophils to generate NETs by relying on ROS.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils participate in the regulation of pathogens by phagocytosis as well as by generating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Antiphospholipid antibodies, particularly those targeting beta-2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI), stimulate monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells with prothrombotic participation. This study aimed to explore NET generation in response to anti-β2GPI/β2GPI. A series of experiments involving the separation of primary human leukocytes, NETosis quantification using propidium iodide, exploration of NETosis by fluorescence microscopy, western blotting, examination of free Zn using FluoZin-3, and reactive  species (ROS) examination with dihydrorhodamine 123 were performed in this study. We found that anti-β2GPI/β2GPI triggered NETosis, resembling phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-induced NETosis in magnitude and morphology. The anti-β GPI/β GPI complex in isolation stimulated NETs without relying on p38, protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2, and zinc signals. NET generation was unaffected by the NADPH oxidase suppressor DP1. The anti-β GPI/β GPI complex stimulated ROS generation without relying on NADPH oxidase, which may participate in NET generation triggered via the anti-β GPI/β GPI complex. In summary, our results indicate that the anti-β GPI/β GPI complex reinforced NET generation by relying on ROS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PAPER IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: Neutrophils as one of the first lines of defence and essential in the response to pathogen invasion. They eradicate bacteria via phagocytosis or by releasing antimicrobial proteins in degranulation. In this study, we explored the capability of anti-β GPI/β GPI to stimulate NETosis, demonstrating that anti-β GPI/β GPI is a promising method for triggering NET. Anti-β GPI/β GPI induced ROS generation without relying on NADPH oxidase, which contributes to NETosis independently of ERK1/2, Zn , or AKT. Our results showed that anti-β2GPI/β2GPI triggered NETosis, resembling PMA-induced NETosis in magnitude as well as morphology. The anti-β GPI/β GPI complex in isolation stimulated NETs without relying on p38, AKT, ERK1/2, or zinc signals. The anti-β GPI/β GPI complex stimulated ROS generation without relying on NADPH oxidase, which may participate in NET generation triggered via the anti-β GPI/β GPI complex.© 2019 The Authors Cell Biochemistry and Function Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293694>Fluorine-containing substituents: metabolism of the α,α-difluoroethyl thioether motif.</a></h2><p>We report the metabolism of the recently introduced α,α-difluoroethyl thioether motif to explore further its potential as a substituent for bioactives discovery chemistry. Incubation of two aryl-SCFCH ethers with the model yeast organism  indicates that the sulfur of the thioether is rapidly converted to the corresponding sulfoxide, and then significantly more slowly to the sulfone. When the substrate was (OMe)PhSCFCH, then the resultant (demethylated) phenol sulfoxide had an enantiomeric excess of 60%, and when the substrate was the β-substituted-SCFCH naphthalene, then the enantiomeric excess of the resultant sulfoxide was 54%. There was no evidence of defluorination, unlike the corresponding  ether (OMe)PhOCFCH, which was converted to the (demethylated) phenol  ester during  incubation. We conclude that the aryl-S-CFCH motif is metabolised in a similar manner to aryl-SCF, a motif that is being widely explored in discovery chemistry. It is however, significantly less lipophilic than aryl-SCF which may offer a practical advantage in tuning overall pharmacokinetic profiles of molecules in development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352786> Restrains Reactive  Species-Associated Pulmonary Fibrosis via Targeting Nrf2-Nox4 Redox Balance.</a></h2><p>Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by myofibroblast activation, which can be triggered by oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the antifibrotic effect of the ethyl  extract of  (EASM) on PF and examined the underlying molecular mechanism. EASM suppressed myofibroblast activation with reduced extracellular matrix deposition in the lungs of mice subjected to bleomycin (BLM) challenge, demonstrating the inhibitory effects on PF. EASM positively alleviated oxidative stress by upregulating nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and concomitantly downregulating NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. This effect was also observed in an  model of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1)-stimulated fibroblast activation. EASM reduced reactive  species (ROS) generation in fibroblasts by stabilizing Nrf2 protein with promoting kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) degradation. Nrf2 knockdown in the lungs of BLM-treated mice diminished the inhibitory effects of EASM on fibrosis, providing evidence  to address the unique role of Nrf2. Additionally, EASM inhibited TGF-1/Smad3 signaling by downregulating protein kinase C delta (PKC- and Smad3 phosphorylation (p-Smad3), which led to suppression of the TGF-1-induced fibrogenic response. These results indicate that EASM exhibits potent antifibrotic activity  and , which might be associated with activation of Nrf2 pathway and inhibition of TGF-1/Smad3 pathway. Our findings support that EASM may act as an effective antifibrotic remedy for PF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027821>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by biocontrol yeasts.</a></h2><p>The Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by biocontrol yeast strains which belong to the Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Aureobasidium pullulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae species were identified by solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Alcohols (ethyl alcohol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and phenylethyl alcohol) and esters (ethyl  and isoamyl ) were found to be the main VOCs emitted by the yeast strains, which had different production rate over a 16-day period. In addition, the tested yeast strains showed a remarkable ability to consume  and to produce high percentages of carbon dioxide over a 5 days incubation period in a model system. The yeast strains, which were proven to very efficiently suppress in vivo the growth of postharvest fungal by VOCs, also quickly produced high percentages of ethyl  and carbon dioxide. . For all these reasons, we believe that the level of yeast biocontrol efficacy through the production of volatiles could be the result of a synergistic effect between VOCs and carbon dioxide in the packaging environment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of the alkaloids EPI and EPIIS in human neutrophils and mechanical hyperalgesia in mice.Neutrophils (5 × 10  cells/ml) incubated with EPI and EPIIS and stimulated by the addition of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or phorbol 12-myristate-13-. The release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), reactive  species (ROS) production, calcium influx, gene expression of NF-κB and pro-inflammatory cytokines production were evaluated. It was also investigated the effect these alkaloids on carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia model in mice.We demonstrated that both EPI and EPIIS inhibited the degranulation of activated neutrophils. This effect was accompanied by the reduction in ROS, the prevention of the increase in intracellular Ca and decrease in the density of cytosolic NF-κB, and inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 production. Evaluating hypernociception in mice, EPI and EPIIS inhibited carrageenan-induced inflammatory hypernociception and reduced MPO levels.The results obtained suggest EPI and EPIIS not only inhibit neutrophils functions in vitro, but also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in vivo, acting through the modulation of the activation and/or accumulation of neutrophils in the inflammatory focus. Thus, EPI and EPIIS possess promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822598>Using discrete and online ATP measurements to evaluate regrowth potential following ozonation and (non)biological drinking water treatment.</a></h2><p>Water utilities must control microbial regrowth in the distribution system to protect public health. In this study, an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based biomass production potential test using indigenous bacterial communities were used to evaluate regrowth potential following ozonation with either biofiltration (BF) or sustained chlorination (SCl). Two full-scale water treatment plants with different upstream processes (i.e., WTP-BF: ozonation, coagulation/flocculation, biofiltration, UV irradiation, chlorination; and WTP-SCl: ozonation, chlorination, coagulation/flocculation, filtration, chlorination) were compared. Characterization of indigenous bacteria using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and cellular ATP (cATP) showed microbial diversity changes across treatment, biomass sloughing from biofilters (effluent cATP = 30 ± 1 ng/L), and disinfection by chlorine (cATP < 1 ng/L). For both WTPs, 14-day cumulative biomass production (CBP =  ∑t=0tATP(t)×Δt) was highest for ozonated water samples (CBP = 1.2 × 10-3.0 × 10 d ngATP/L). CBP further increased with increasing ozone dose due to production of more biodegradable carbon. Growth promotion by carbon was confirmed from the consumption of ozonation byproducts (carboxylic acids, aldehydes) and the increase in CBP (9.5 × 10-2.9 × 10 d ngATP/L) after addition of 50-300 μgC/L . Ozone followed by sustained chlorination (WTP-SCl) effectively controlled biomass growth across the treatment process (CBP <10 d ngATP/L). In contrast, ozone followed by biofiltration (WTP-BF) reduced regrowth potential by 30% (biofilter influent CBP = 1.3 × 10 d ngATP/L; biofilter effluent CBP = 9.3 × 10 d ngATP/L). After adding chlorine to the biofilter effluent, CBP was reduced to <10 d ngATP/L. Lastly, online ATP measurements confirmed the discrete measurements and improved identification of the cATP peak and growth phases of indigenous bacteria.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

It is an efficient procedure for planning experiments, so the data obtained can be analyzed to yield a valid and objective conclusion. This approach has been used as an important tool in the optimization of different analytical approaches. A D-optimal experimental design was used here, for the first time, to optimize the experimental conditions for the detection of reactive  species (ROS) produced by human blood from healthy donors, a biological matrix that better resembles the physiologic environment, following stimulation by a potent inflammatory mediator, phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA). For that purpose, different fluorescent probes were used, as 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), 2-[6-(4'-amino)-phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl] benzoic acid (APF), and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (amplex red). The variables tested were the human blood dilution, and the fluorescent probe and PMA concentrations. The experiments were evaluated using the Response Surface Methodology and the method was validated using specific compounds. This model allowed the search for optimal conditions for a set of responses simultaneously, enabling, from a small number of experiments, the evaluation of the interaction between the variables under study.

The phyto-components of the extract aided the reduction and the formation of nanoparticles. The purified ZnONPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, SEM, EDS, XRD, BET, and FTIR techniques. A sharp absorption maximum at 360 nm in the UV-Vis data affirmed the formation of ZnONPs. SEM image revealed the nanoflower morphology and EDS showed strong signals for zinc and  elements. XRD spectrum confirmed the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure of size 13.33 nm. A significant large surface area of 16.27 m/g with mesopores, was affirmed using BET analysis. FTIR substantiated the existence of the characteristic zinc and  bonding vibrations at 557 cm, 511 cm and 433 cm. The photocatalytic activity of the ZnONPs was examined using the pollutant dye, Rhodamine B. A remarkable degradation efficiency of 98% within 200 min was achieved under sunlight irradiation and a degradation constant of 0.017 min was obtained. Therefore, ZnONPs synthesized using a cheap and abundant source - the leaf extract of C.ramiflora possibly will play a promising part in the degradation of toxic dyes present in the wastewater.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Reactive  species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species in cell-free systems were measured using a multi-well fluorometer or a spectrophotometer. A psoriasis-like skin inflammation was induced in mice using the IMQ cream.KLHTT suppressed superoxide anion generation, ROS production, CD11b expression, and adhesion in activated human neutrophils. In contrast, KLHTT failed to alter elastase release in activated human neutrophils. Additionally, KLHTT had an ROS-scavenging effect in the AAPH assay, but it did not scavenge superoxide anions directly in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. Protein kinase C (PKC)-induced NET formation most commonly occurs through ROS-dependent mechanisms. KLHTT significantly inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-, a PKC activator, inducing NET formation. Furthermore, topical KLHTT treatment reduced the area affected by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and ameliorated neutrophil infiltration in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice.Our data show that KLHTT has anti-neutrophilic inflammatory effects in inhibiting ROS generation and cell adhesion. KLHTT also mitigated NET formation, mainly via an ROS-dependent pathway. In addition, KLHTT reduced neutrophil infiltration and improved the severity of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice. Therefore, KLHTT may prove to be a safe and effective psoriasis therapy in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

While mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood, most models rely on the viability of transplanted microbes. We hypothesised that protocols commonly used in the preparation of faecal transplants will substantially reduce the number, diversity and functional potential of viable microbes.Stools from eight screened donors were processed under strict anaerobic conditions, in ambient air, and freeze-thawed. Propidium monoazide (PMA) sample treatment was combined with quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis to define the viable microbiota composition and functional potential.Approximately 50% of bacterial content of stool processed immediately under strict anaerobic conditions was non-viable. Homogenisation in ambient air or freeze-thaw reduced viability to 19% and 23% respectively. Processing of samples in ambient air resulted in up to 12-fold reductions in the abundance of important commensal taxa, including the highly butyrogenic species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Subdoligranulum variable, and Eubacterium hallii. The adverse impact of atmospheric  exposure on the capacity of the transplanted microbiota to support SCFA biosynthesis was demonstrated by significantly reduced butyrate and  production by faecal slurries processed in ambient air. In contrast, while reducing overall levels of viable bacteria, freeze-thaw did not significantly alter viable microbiota composition.The practice of preparing material for faecal transplantation in ambient air profoundly affects viable microbial content, disproportionately reducing the abundance of anaerobic commensals and the capacity for biosynthesis of important anti-inflammatory metabolites.

The subject of this study is to evaluate the antiproliferation effects on oral cancer cells by Nepenthes plants using ethyl  extract of Nepenthes adrianii x clipeata (EANA). Cell viability was detected using MTS assay. Its detailed mechanisms including cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage were explored by flow cytometry or western blotting. For 24 hours EANA treatment, five kinds of oral cancer cells (CAL 27, Ca9-22, OECM-1, HSC-3, and SCC9) show IC values of cell viability ranging from 8 to 17 μg/mL but the viability of normal oral cells (HGF-1) remains over 80%. Subsequently, CAL 27 and Ca9-22 cells with high sensitivity to EANA were chosen to investigate the detailed mechanism. EANA displays the time course and concentration effects for inducing apoptosis based on flow cytometry (subG1 and annexin V analyses) and western blotting [cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP)]. Oxidative stress and DNA damage were induced by EANA treatments in oral cancer cells through reactive  species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, mitochondrial superoxide, and γH2AX. All these changes of EANA treatments in oral cancer cells were reverted by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine pretreatment.

To better understand how S. agalactiae are pathogenic in fish, we investigated interactions between isolates from fish and terrestrial hosts and the cellular immune system of Queensland grouper Epinephelus lanceolatus using flow cytometry. Adherent head-kidney leucocytes (HKL) from Queensland grouper displayed two main cell populations with distinct forward and side scatter by flow cytometry. The population of smaller and less complex cells (P1) was composed of monocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes, while the population of primarily larger and more complex cells (P2) comprised predominantly of macrophages and neutrophils. The cells in P2 had higher phagocytic index and capacity when incubated with fluorescent latex beads. HKL were activated by phorbol myristate  (PMA) but were unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PTG), suggesting the absence of specific receptors on the surface of these cells for these ligands or a requirement for intermediates. In in vitro phagocytosis assays, all fish isolates of GBS activated a respiratory burst in P2 indicated by significant production of intracellular reactive  species (ROS). Similarly, dog and cat isolates of different serotype and sequence type also induced ROS production in grouper HKL. However, human, crocodile and bovine isolates of GBS did not elicit significant ROS in HKL although they coincided with the highest phagocytic index. This suggests that these strains are capable of quenching ROS production. Terrestrial isolates significantly increased mortality of Queensland grouper leucocytes in vitro, aligned with a more diverse repertoire of cellular toxins in these strains. Opsonisation of a marine strain and terrestrial strain of GBS with antiserum raised against the marine strain resulted in an increase in ROS production by HKL in both cases although there was low antigenic cross reactivity between the two strains by flow cytometry, reflecting their diverse serotypes (Ib vs III). However, pre-incubation of either strain with normal serum from grouper also increased ROS production of HKL suggesting other opsonins may be involved. Based on these results it appears that piscine and terrestrial GBS isolates have contrasting strategies when interacting with the cellular immune system of Queensland grouper; the former seemingly evading phagocytosis, whilst the latter are readily phagocytosed but counteract ROS production.Crown Copyright © 2019.

Various carbon sources including , succinate and methanol are utilized by  AM1 with the latter being a promising inexpensive substrate for use in the biotechnology industry. Itaconic acid (ITA) is a high-value building block widely used in various industries. Given that no wildtype methylotrophic bacteria are able to utilize methanol to produce ITA, we tested the potential of  AM1 as an engineered host for this purpose. In this study, we successfully engineered  AM1 to express a heterologous codon-optimized gene encoding aconitic acid decarboxylase. The engineered strain produced ITA using , succinate and methanol as the carbon feedstock. The highest ITA titer in batch culture with methanol as the carbon source was 31.6 ± 5.5 mg/L, while the titer and productivity were 5.4 ± 0.2 mg/L and 0.056 ± 0.002 mg/L/h, respectively, in a scaled-up fed-batch bioreactor under 60% dissolved  saturation. We attempted to enhance the carbon flux toward ITA production by impeding poly-β-hydroxybutyrate accumulation, which is used as carbon and energy storage, via mutation of the regulator gene . Unexpectedly, ITA production by the  mutant strain was not higher even though poly-β-hydroxybutyrate concentration was lower. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed that  mutation in the ITA-producing strain led to complex rewiring of gene transcription, which might result in a reduced carbon flux toward ITA production. Besides poly-β-hydroxybutyrate metabolism, we found evidence that PhaR might regulate the transcription of many other genes including those encoding other regulatory proteins, methanol dehydrogenases, formate dehydrogenases, malate:quinone oxidoreductase, and those synthesizing pyrroloquinoline quinone and thiamine co-factors. Overall,  AM1 was successfully engineered to produce ITA using , succinate and methanol as feedstock, further supporting this bacterium as a feasible host for use in the biotechnology industry. This study showed that PhaR could have a broader regulatory role than previously anticipated, and increased our knowledge of this regulator and its influence on the physiology of  AM1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30747265>Respirometry as a tool to quantify kinetic parameters of microalgal mixotrophic growth.</a></h2><p>Modeling microalgal mixotrophy is challenging, as the regulation of algal metabolism is affected by many environmental factors. A reliable tool to simulate microalgal behavior in complex systems, such as wastewaters, may help in setting the proper values of operative variables, provided that model parameters have been properly evaluated. In this work, a new respirometric protocol is proposed to quickly obtain the half-saturation constant values for several nutrients. The protocol was first verified for autotrophic exploitation of ammonium and phosphorus (Monod kinetics), as well as of light intensity (Haldane model), further elaborated on specific light supply basis. It was then applied to measure the kinetic parameters of heterotrophic growth. The half-saturation constants for nitrogen and phosphorus resulted comparable with autotrophic ones. The dependence on  and dissolved  concentration was assessed. Mixotrophy was modeled as the combination of autotrophic/heterotrophic reactions, implemented in AQUASIM, and validated on batch curves with/without bubbling, under nutrient limitation, and different light intensities. It was shown that the reliability of the proposed respirometric protocol is useful to measure kinetic parameters for nutrients, and therefore to perform bioprocess simulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31117291>Efficacy of Obcordata A from  on Kidney Stones by Inhibiting NOX4 Expression.</a></h2><p>Obcordata A (OA) is a polyoxypregnane glycoside derived from the Dai medicine  vines.

We incubated renal tubular cells with 28 μg·cm calcium oxalate crystals for 24 h with and without OA, GKT137831, phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA), and tocopherol. The MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, microscopic examination, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining revealed that calcium oxalate crystals decreased cell viability and elevated reactive  species (ROS) levels. OA, GKT137831, and tocopherol protected cells and decreased ROS levels. However, OA did not exhibit direct DPPH scavenging ability. In addition, immunoblotting illustrated that OA inhibited the NOX4 (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases 4) expression and downregulated the protein expression in the NOX4/ROS/p38 MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. The findings suggest that the cytoprotective and antioxidant effects of OA can be blocked by the NOX4 agonist PMA.

Here, we conduct a systematic study of the room-temperature photoluminescence of anhydrous ZnO nanocrystals, as synthesized in the gas phase and processed in water-free atmosphere, and of their colloidal derivatives in aqueous dispersions with varying amounts of organic salt admixtures. A free exciton band at hν = 3.3 eV is essentially absent in the anhydrous ZnO nanocrystal powders measured in vacuum or in  atmosphere. Surface hydration of the nanoparticles during colloid formation leads to the emergence of the free exciton band at hν = 3.3 eV and induces a small but significant release in lattice strain as detected by X-ray diffraction. Most importantly, admixture of  or citrate ions to the aqueous colloidal dispersions not only allows for the control of the ζ-potential but also affects the intensity of the free exciton emission in a correlated manner. The buildup of negative charge at the solid-liquid interface, as produced by citrate adsorption, increases the free exciton emission. This effect is attributed to the suppression of electron trapping in the near-surface region, which counteracts nonradiative exciton recombination. Using well-defined ZnO nanoparticles as model systems for interface chemistry studies, our findings highlight water-induced key effects that depend on the composition of the aqueous solution shell around the semiconducting metal oxide nanoparticles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263423>Lactic Acid Accumulation During Exhaustive Exercise Impairs Release of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Mice.</a></h2><p>Lactic acid (LA) is a sensitive indicator of exercise intensity and duration.

Consequently, the authors' aim was to modulate circulating 3-OHB levels in HFrEF patients and evaluate: (1) changes in cardiac output (CO); (2) a potential dose-response relationship between 3-OHB levels and CO; (3) the impact on myocardial external energy efficiency (MEE) and  consumption (MVO); and (4) whether the cardiovascular response differed between HFrEF patients and age-matched volunteers.Study 1: 16 chronic HFrEF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction: 37±3%) were randomized in a crossover design to 3-hour of 3-OHB or placebo infusion. Patients were monitored invasively with a Swan-Ganz catheter and with echocardiography. Study 2: In a dose-response study, 8 HFrEF patients were examined at increasing 3-OHB infusion rates. Study 3 to 4: 10 HFrEF patients and 10 age-matched volunteers were randomized in a crossover design to 3-hour 3-OHB or placebo infusion. MEE and MVO were evaluated using 11C- positron emission tomography.3-OHB infusion increased circulating levels of plasma 3-OHB from 0.4±0.3 to 3.3±0.4 mM ( P<0.001). CO rose by 2.0±0.2 L/min ( P<0.001) because of an increase in stroke volume of 20±2 mL ( P<0.001) and heart rate of 7±2 beats per minute (bpm) ( P<0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased 8±1% ( P<0.001) numerically. There was a dose-response relationship with a significant CO increase of 0.3 L/min already at plasma-3-OHB levels of 0.7 mM ( P<0.001). 3-OHB increased MVO without altering MEE. The response to 3-OHB infusion in terms of MEE and CO did not differ between HFrEF patents and age-matched volunteers.3-OHB has beneficial hemodynamic effects in HFrEF patients without impairing MEE. These beneficial effects are detectable in the physiological concentration range of circulating 3-OHB levels. The hemodynamic effects of 3-OHB were observed in both HFrEF patients and age-matched volunteers. 3-OHB may potentially constitute a novel treatment principle in HFrEF patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30675376>Cosmeceutical activities of ethanol extract and its ethyl  fraction from coffee silverskin.</a></h2><p>Coffee silverskin is a thin film that covers the raw coffee bean. In general, coffee silverskin, which detaches during the coffee roasting process, is disposed as firelighters or dispatched to landfills and can cause serious environmental pollution. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using coffee silverskin as a functional material in cosmetics by evaluating its bioactive ingredients, antioxidative activity, cytoprotective effect, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)-inhibiting effect, and anti-melanogenesis effect.To this end, a 50% ethanol (EtOH) extract and its ethyl  (EtOAc) fraction were prepared from coffee silverskin; caffeine was found to be the major compound in the extract. Both the 50% EtOH extract and its EtOAc fraction exhibited antioxidant activities. However, the EtOAc fraction showed a greater radical-scavenging activity and reducing power than that shown by the 50% EtOH extract. Furthermore, the EtOAc fraction increased cell viability in a UVB-irradiated human keratinocyte injury model and significantly suppressed UVB-induced MMP-1 expression and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-stimulated melanin production in HaCaT keratinocytes and B16F1 melanocytes, respectively. Interestingly, caffeine, the major component of the EtOAc fraction, did not show an inhibitory effect. Thus, the antioxidant capacity of the coffee silverskin extract may be attributable to some compounds that exhibit a high antioxidant capacity even at low concentrations or the total antioxidant capacity of various constituent phenolic compounds.Our findings indicate that coffee silverskin has the potential for application as a natural functional material in multifunctional cosmetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221160>Mining the deep Red-Sea brine pool microbial community for anticancer therapeutics.</a></h2><p>Microbial species in the brine pools of the Red Sea and the brine pool-seawater interfaces are exposed to high temperature, high salinity, low  levels and high concentrations of heavy metals. As adaptations to these harsh conditions require a large suite of secondary metabolites, these microbes have a huge potential as a source of novel anticancer molecules.A total of 60 ethyl- extracts of newly isolated strains from extreme environments of the Red-Sea were isolated and tested against several human cancer cell lines for potential cytotoxic and apoptotic activities.Isolates from the Erba brine-pool accounted for 50% of active bacterial extracts capable of inducing 30% or greater inhibition of cell growth. Among the 60 extracts screened, seven showed selectivity towards triple negative BT20 cells compared to normal fibroblasts.In this study, we identified several extracts able to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in various cancer cell lines.

Although several anti-inflammatory effects of intravenous anesthetics have been reported, it has not been investigated whether intravenous anesthetics influence NET formation.To compare the effects of four intravenous anesthetics (propofol, thiamylal sodium, midazolam, and ketamine) on phorbol myristate  (PMA)-induced NET formation and analyze the associated signaling pathways.PMA-stimulated NETs formed in the absence or presence of intravenous anesthetics were stained with SYTOX Green and then quantified. Inhibitors were applied to investigate the related mechanism, which was confirmed by western blotting, and ROS were detected.The neutrophils incubated with propofol showed the lowest degree of NET formation compared with those incubated with the other intravenous anesthetics. Propofol significantly reduced the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived HOCl but not that of superoxide. Aminopyrine, an MPO inhibitor, markedly decreased the number of PMA-induced NETs, indicating the involvement of HOCl in the inhibitory effect of propofol on NET formation. According to western blotting results, the level of p-ERK was reduced by propofol during PMA-induced NET formation. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 decreased NET formation but did not inhibit PMA-induced HOCl generation, and aminopyrine did not reduce ERK phosphorylation.Through this study, we define a new anti-inflammatory effect of intravenous anesthetics. Of the four intravenous anesthetics tested, propofol was the most potent inhibitor of NET formation. Moreover, propofol resulted in a decrease in PMA-induced NET formation by two independent mechanisms: inhibition of HOCl and p-ERK.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Key functional groups at the genus level identified by high-throughput sequencing were evaluated as well. The results showed that anaerobic feeding mode and  promoted the compact AGS formation with excellent total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency (averaging 91.7% ± 4.1%) at various dissolved  conditions. While the aerobic feeding mode led to a loose AGS structure with a vulnerable anaerobic core and poor TN removal efficiency (averaging 58.8% ± 7.4%). Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process played the dominant role in N removal in compact AGS over the alternating nitrification and denitrification process. High-concentration glucose undermined feast-famine condition with filamentous bacteria growth out of granule and decreased TN removal efficiency to 67.3% ± 15.2%. Lower food to microorganism ratio may result in a lower N removal rate attributed to the sharply increased biomass concentration fed by glucose. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, and denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms enriched during AGS granulation also contributed to the efficient N removal. The proposed strategy provided insights into the relationship between various factors and stable AGS formation, and systemic operation methods for various complicated wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Various β-O-4 phenoxyacetophenones that do not contain the hydroxymethyl substituent undergo oxidative cleavage upon exposure to aqueous oxalic acid in the presence of air, likely through concerted ring opening of a dioxetane intermediate to give the corresponding benzoic acid and phenyl formate. Importantly, detrimental side reactions arising from singlet  and hydroperoxy radicals (from both O2 and oxalic acid) are minimal when the cleavage is run under air compared to neat . When oxidised β-O-4 lignin model compounds bearing the hydroxymethyl group are cleaved by aqueous oxalic acid, the resulting diketone and phenol products arise from a redox neutral cleavage that is analogous to the formic acid-sodium formate mediated lignin cleavage process reported by Stahl. Aqueous oxalic acid also cleaves lignin itself, with oxidised milled wood lignin (MWLox) from Pinus radiata giving a 14% yield of ethyl  soluble aromatics with good selectivity for vanillin. Aqueous oxalic acid appears to be a promising lignin cleavage system given the benign, bio-based reagents, absence of metals and organic solvents and a simple extraction procedure that enables oxalic acid recycling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170585>Effects of ozone treatment on performance and microbial community composition in biofiltration systems treating ethyl  vapours.</a></h2><p>Ozone (O) treatment is an effective strategy in maintaining high efficiency and control of biomass accumulation in gas phase biofiltration. However, little is known about the long-term impact of O on the microbial communities. In the present study, two biofilters treating gaseous ethyl  were operated continuously for 230 days with inlet loads up to 180 g m∙h. A biofilter operated under continuous O addition (90 ppb) yielded consistently higher removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) compared to the control system. After 120 days of operation, a lower biomass content accompanied by a pH of 1.5 was observed in the ozonated biofilter, which was 2 units lower compared to the control reactor. Both reactors developed a distinct microbial community composition over the course of 230 days. The bacterial community was dominated in both biofilters by Beijerinckia and Gluconacetobacter, while Rhinocladiella similis, Trichosporon veenhuissi and Exophilia oligosperma were abundant in the fungal community.

At physiological temperatures, myohemerythrin favors a four-helix bundle motif and has a diiron oxo cofactor that binds . As the solution temperature is increased from ∼15 to 35 °C, some bound  dissociates; at ∼66 °C, the cofactor dissociates to produce populations of both folded and unfolded apoprotein. At higher temperatures (∼85 °C and above), the IMS-MS spectrum indicates that the folded apoprotein dominates, and provides evidence for stabilization of the structure by formation of a non-native disulfide bond. In total, we find evidence for 18 unique forms of myohemerythrin as well as information about the structures and stabilities of these states.

The MS, H and C NMR were applied to elucidate their structures. UPLC-PDA method was applied for the simultaneous quantification of major compounds of EAFVC. Furthermore, the protective effect of the EAFVC was determined using APAP-induced acute hepatotoxicity in mice and BRL-3A cells model, respectively. In addition, the hepatoprotective activity of two main compounds in EAFVC on relieving APAP-induced liver injury was further evaluated. Finally, we have some concerns about the protective mechanism of EAFVC via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reactive  species (ROS) detection, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), western blot analysis and molecular docking.Thirteen compounds were successfully identified using UPLC-PDA-ESI-MS for the first time. Meanwhile, other twelve compounds were separated from EAFVC. Eventually, twenty-five compounds were successfully identified from the EAFVC. Among these compounds, fourteen compounds (3, 8, 10, 14-17, 19-25) were separated from V.ciliata for the first time. In addition, UPLC-PDA analysis method was first to establish for simultaneous determination of the main compounds (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12). Further assay indicated that the liver injury in mice induced by APAP showed a significant reversal by EAFVC, as evidenced by reducing the activities of liver function enzymes, suppressing the lipid peroxidation as well as increasing the serum total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Pathological sections showed that the liver in the high dose has significant improvement in mice. In vitro experiment also showed that EAFVC elevate the viability, inhibiting the activities of liver function enzymes as well as the generation of ROS of BRL-3A cells. In addition, Catalposide and verproside could reverse the low cell viability of BRL-3A cells induced by APAP. The mechanism research in vitro demonstrated that EAFVC could promote the mRNA and protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P) H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO-1) and catalytic or modify subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC/GCLCM) via enhancing nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and p62/SQSTM1 (p62) expression in protein level. Molecular docking results demonstrated that catalposide and verproside have strong affinity to the kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1(Keap1) Kelch domain.This research is the first to clarify the substance basis of the hepatoprotective activity of the EAFVC and provide the further scientific data for the traditional use of this Tibetan Medicine.

CS-CAP films with varying ratios of nano ZnO reinforcement were prepared by solvent casting method. The thermal stability and barrier properties of the fabricated films increased with increasing amount of nano ZnO in the range of 2-7.5% (w/w). CS-CAP film loaded with 5% (w/w) nano ZnO showed the most optimal tensile strength and stiffness to be utilized as a food packaging material. Water contact angle measurements showed the prepared nano composite films to have low surface wettability and high contact angle value up to 90°. Biodegradability of the nano composite films ranged from 30 to 50% in 28 days. The CS-CAP film loaded with 5% (w/w) nano ZnO had extended the shelf life of black grape fruits up to 9 days.

This study demonstrates for the first time that a botulinum neurotoxin-producing  can withstand  during vegetative growth.  Botulinum neurotoxins, the causative agents of the potentially fatal disease of botulism, are produced by certain  strains during vegetative growth, usually in anaerobic environments. Our findings indicate that, contrary to current understanding, the growth of neurotoxigenic  strains and botulinum neurotoxin type E production can continue upon transfer from anaerobic to aerated conditions and that adaptation of strains to oxygenated environments requires global changes in proteomic and metabolic profiles. We hypothesize that aerotolerance might constitute an unappreciated factor conferring physiological advantages on some botulinum toxin-producing clostridial strains, allowing them to adapt to otherwise restrictive environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30789095>Activated neutrophil carbamylates albumin via the release of myeloperoxidase and reactive  species regardless of NETosis.</a></h2><p>An anti-carbamylated albumin antibody was detected in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and its presence was associated with serum myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, as we reported previously. Since MPO is a key enzyme for carbamylation and is released by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we aimed to demonstrate that NETosis induces carbamylation.Human neutrophils were isolated from a healthy donor, pre-treated with or without diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, an inhibitor for the generation of reactive  species (ROS)), Cl-amidine (a peptidylarginine deiminase inhibitor), 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH, an MPO inhibitor), or GW311616A (a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor), and incubated for 8 h with or without phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA). Proteins in the medium were collected and the carbamylation of albumin was evaluated by Western blotting.The carbamylation of albumin was detected in the culture medium of activated neutrophils. NETosis was observed under the stimulation by PMA. DPI and 4-ABAH inhibited the carbamylation of albumin and NETosis. GW311616A inhibited NETosis, but not carbamylation. Neither carbamylation nor NETosis was inhibited by Cl-amidine.Activated neutrophils may carbamylate ambient albumin, and this is dependent on ROS and MPO, but does not require NETosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032003>Enhancement of an organic-metallic hybrid charring agent on flame retardancy of ethylene-vinyl  copolymer.</a></h2><p>An organic triazine charring agent hybrid with zinc oxide (OTCA@ZnO) was prepared and well characterized through Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The flame retardancy and thermal behaviour of intumescent flame retardant ethylene-vinyl  (EVA) composites combining OTCA@ZnO and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were investigated using limited  index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning, cone calorimetry and TGA. The structure and morphology of chars were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR, laser Raman spectroscopy analysis (LRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results revealed that OTCA@ZnO exhibited excellent thermal stability and dispersity after hybridization. The flame retardancy and smoke suppression properties of EVA were significantly improved by introducing APP/OTCA@ZnO. TGA results indicated that APP/OTCA@ZnO presented an excellent synergistic effect and promoted the char formation of EVA composites. Residue analysis results showed more char with high quality connected by richer P-O-C, P-N and P-O-Si structures was formed in APP/OTCA@ZnO system than APP/HOTCA/ZnO system, which consequently suppressed more efficiently the combustion and smoke production due to the  catalytic carbonization effect of hybrid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31044195>Coordinative interaction between nitrogen oxides and iron-molybdenum POM MoFe.</a></h2><p>The process of adsorption of nitrogen monoxide and dioxide by the giant Keplerate nanocluster Mo72Fe30 was studied in detail under ambient conditions and air/argon atmosphere. The obtained Raman and IR spectra showed that the coordination of NOx to the Mo72Fe30 leads to the formation of nitrate ions by sharing the bridged or terminal  in FeO6 polyhedra with the adsorbed NO2 molecules. In accordance with elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the composition of the produced complex was found to be [POM-(NO2)x]·(NO2)y (where x = 6, y = 14 ± 3). The carried out thermal analysis revealed the significant influence of NOx coordination in the release of water molecules and decomposition of the constitutional  ligands for Mo72Fe30. Furthermore, the performed measurements of the temperature dependency of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra for the pure nanocluster and that treated with NO2 allowed us to draw up a conclusion about the delocalization of weak-bonded NO2 molecules in the pores of the Mo72Fe30 crystal at 25 °C. The opposite situation was observed under cryogenic temperatures. The localization of NO2 molecules occurs resulting in the distortion of FeO6 octahedra towards tetrahedral symmetry accompanied with the appearance of the signal at g-factor 4.3. The produced complex compound [POM-(NO2)x]·(NO2)y possesses sufficient NO2 capacity, water solubility and pH-dependant decomposition; these are important properties of a potential NOx donor, which can be hypothetically applied in biomedicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520814>Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses reveal  detoxification and mixotrophic potentials of an enriched anammox culture in a continuous stirred-tank reactor.</a></h2><p>The metabolisms of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria related to ammonia oxidation with nitrite reduction and autotrophic carbon fixation have been extensively observed. However, little is known about the specific metabolic pathways associated with  detoxification and organic carbon utilization. To this end, we obtained high abundance of anammox species (∼50%) in a lab-scale continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) at room temperature without strict anaerobic condition. The draft genome of the dominant anammox bacteria affiliated to Ca. Brocadia sp. was recovered. Its metabolic pathways and genes expression were reconstructed and examined through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses. Interestingly, the results suggested that this anammox lineage likely performs  detoxification with genes encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytochrome c peroxidase (Ccp). Moreover, the Ccp-activated hydrogen peroxide (intermediate of  detoxification) reduction might be energetically beneficial for the observed  conversion related to cell synthesis of Ca. Brocadia sp.

In this study, we investigated the antioral cancer properties using ethyl  extracts of the  hybrid ( x ), namely EANS. The bioactivity was detected by a MTS-based cell proliferation assay and flow cytometric or Western blot analysis for apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage.  Treatment for 24 hrs of EANS inhibited all three types of oral cancer cells that were tested (Ca9-22, CAL 27, and SCC9), with just a small difference to normal oral cells (HGF-1). This antiproliferation was inhibited by pretreatments with the reactive  species (ROS) scavenger -acetylcysteine (NAC), and the apoptosis inhibitor (Z-VAD). EANS treatment increased the subG1 population and it also dose- and time-dependently induced annexin V- and pancaspase-detected apoptosis as well as cleaved caspases 3 and 9 overexpressions in the oral cancer cells (Ca9-22). After EANS treatment of Ca9-22 cells, intracellular ROS and mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) were overexpressed and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was disrupted. Moreover, DNA damages such as γH2AX and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) were increased after EANS treatment to Ca9-22 cells. The EANS-induced effects (namely, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage) were suppressed by ROS scavenger.  Our findings demonstrated that EANS inhibits ROS-mediated proliferation against oral cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30600464>Parkia speciosa empty pod extract exerts anti-inflammatory properties by modulating NFκB and MAPK pathways in cardiomyocytes exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α.</a></h2><p>Parkia speciosa Hassk is a plant found abundantly in the Southeast Asia region. Its seeds, with or without pods, have been used in traditional medicine locally to treat cardiovascular problems. The pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases involves inflammation and oxidative stress. Based on this information, we sought to investigate the potential protective effects of Parkia speciosa empty pod extract (PSE) on inflammation in cardiomyocytes exposed to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). H9c2 cardiomyocytes were divided into four groups; negative control, TNF-α, PSE + TNF-α and quercetin + TNF-α. Groups 3 and 4 were pretreated with PSE ethyl  fraction of ethanol extract (500 µg/mL) or quercetin (1000 µM, positive control) for 1 h before inflammatory induction with TNF-α (12 ng/mL) for 24 h. TNF-α increased protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B cell (NFκB) p65, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 when compared to the negative control (p < 0.05). It also elevated iNOS activity, nitric oxide and reactive  species levels. These increases were significantly reduced with PSE and quercetin pretreatments. The effects of PSE were comparable to that of quercetin. PSE exhibited anti-inflammatory properties against TNF-α-induced inflammation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes by modulating the NFκB and p38 MAPK pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881588>Chlorpyrifos Suppresses Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Carp by Promoting Necroptosis and Inhibiting Respiratory Burst Caused by the PKC/MAPK Pathway.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are reticular structures formed by myeloperoxidase (MPO), histones, and neutrophil elastase (NE) that are released from neutrophils in response to pathogenic stimuli. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is wildly used as an organophosphorus pesticide that causes a range of toxicological and environmental problems. Exposure to CPF can increase the production of neutrophils in carps, and this increase can be considered a biomarker of water pollution. To explore a relationship between NETs and CPF and its mechanism of influence, we treated neutrophils from the blood of carp with 1 g/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), 0.325 mg/L CPF, or 20 M necrostatin-1 (Nec-1). The production of MPO and NETs was reduced in the CPF+PMA group compared with that in the PMA group. CPF can cause an increase in reactive  species (ROS), while inhibiting respiratory burst caused by PMA stimulation. We found that the expression levels of protein-coupled receptor 84 (gpr84), dystroglycan (DAG), proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (RAF), protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) in the CPF+PMA group were lower than those in the PMA group, indicating that the PKC-MAPK pathway was suppressed. The expression levels of cylindromatosis (CYLD), mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 1 (RIP1), and receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIP3) were increased, and the expression levels of caspase 8 were reduced by CPF, indicating that CPF may cause necroptosis. The addition of Nec-1 restored the number of NETs in the CPF+PMA group. The results indicate that CPF reduced the production of NETs by inhibiting respiratory burst and increasing necroptosis. The results contribute to the understanding of the immunotoxicological mechanism of CPF and provide a reference for comparative medical studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306929>Influence of inoculum variation on formation and stability of aerobic granules in oily wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>This study provides extensive information about oily wastewater treatment in aerobic granular reactors (AGR) using three different inoculums from sewage, refinery and brewery. Initially, sodium  was used for granule formation while AGR with brewery inoculum had maximum granule size (5.44 ± 0.05 mm) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS: 471.22 ± 2.0 mg/g VSS). But, during emulsified diesel exposure, refinery sludge granules achieved maximum granule size of 3.49 ± 0.01 mm and EPS of 204.85 ± 2.01 mg/g VSS with maximum 67.39 ± 0.15% oil removal efficiency. AGRs achieved 99.9 ± 0.05% chemical  demand (COD) and 91.67 ± 0.14% ammonia nitrogen (NH-N) removal efficiencies. Refinery granules remained stable at maximum 310 ± 10 mg/L diesel concentration whereas, the stability thresholds for sewage and brewery granules were 170 ± 15 and 250 ± 10 mg/L, respectively. Brevibacterium paucivorans strain SG001, Micrococcus aloeverae strain SG002 and Staphylococcus hominis strain SG003 were identified as the major pollutant degraders isolated from sewage, refinery and brewery sludge.

Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has long been used as a topical dosage form to treat acne. It has favorable effects in resolving inflammatory acne lesions not only by reducing Propioni bacterium acnes density, but also by directly inhibiting neutrophil chemotactic factors and reactive  species (ROS) production. Zinc, a metallic element has bacteriostatic activity against Propioni bacterium acnes. Combining zinc with antibiotic (erythromycin) can reduce antibiotic resistance and increase antibiotic absorption in-to the skin.In the present study, erythromycin (2% w/v) with zinc  (1.2% w/v) as 'topical gel' and erythromycin (2% w/v) gel alone were evaluated for treating mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris. This double-blind study was carried out on 102 patients 13-25 years of age, divided into two groups. The group A received erythromycin and group B received erythromycin with zinc  topical gels during 3 weeks. Acne grading and lesion counts for comedones, papules and pustules were performed during each visit zero, first, second and third weeks.Erythromycin treatment (with zinc ) gel showed to be more effective than erythromycin (alone) gel with respect to reducing the number of acne lesions and severity grade of acne.Number of lesions and severity of acne were significantly reduced at the end of 3rd week in both groups (p < .001).In conclusion, it can be stated that erythromycin with and without zinc  was clinically effective, and both formulations produced a significant reductions in acne grading as well as inflamed and noninflamed lesion counts (p < .000).

Previous studies of the effect of gradients in scale-down reactors with complex media disclosed an accumulation of several carboxylic acids and a parallel decrease of growth and product accumulation. This study, therefore, addresses the impact of carboxylic acids, for example,  and l-lactate, on the cultivation of the cadaverine producing strain C. glutamicum DM1945Δact3:P -ldcC and their potential role in scale up related performance losses. A fluctuating power input in shake flask and stirred tank cultivations with mineral salt was applied to mimic discontinuous  availability. Results demonstrate, whenever sufficient  was available, C. glutamicum recovered from previously occurring stressful conditions like an  limiting phase. Reassimilation of acids was detected simultaneously. In cultures, which were supplemented with either  or l-lactate, a rapid cometabolization of both acids in presence of glucose was observed, showing conversion rates of 7.8 and 3.8 mmol g  hr , respectively. Uptake of these acids was accompanied by increased  consumption. Proteins related to oxidative stress response, glycogen synthesis, and the main carbon metabolism were found in altered concentrations under oscillatory cultivation conditions. (Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD012760). Virtually no impact on growth or product formation was observed. We conclude that the reduced growth and product formation in scale-down cultivations when complex media was used is not caused by the accumulation of carboxylic acids.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30960953>A Geometry Effect of Carbon Nanomaterials on Flame Retardancy and Mechanical Properties of Ethylene-Vinyl /Magnesium Hydroxide Composites.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed at investigating the effects of carbon nanomaterials with different geometries on improving the flame retardancy of magnesium hydroxide⁻filled ethylene-vinyl  (EM). The thermal stability and flame retardancy were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), limiting  index (LOI), UL-94 test, and cone calorimeter test (CCT). The in situ temperature monitoring system and interrupted combustion offered direct evidence to link flame retardancy and composite structure. Results demonstrated that carbon nanomaterials enhanced the thermal stability and fire safety of EM. The geometry of carbon nanomaterials played a key role in synergistic flame retardancy of EM, with the flame-retardant order of carbon nanotube > nanoscale carbon black > graphene. Based on an online temperature monitoring system and interrupted combustion test, one-dimensional carbon nanotube was more inclined to form the network structure synergistically with magnesium hydroxide in ethylene-vinyl , which facilitated the generation of more continuous char structure during combustion. In parallel, the mechanical property was characterized by a tensile test and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).

Effluent from an anaerobic-aerobic system for treating synthetic natural rubber wastewater, which still contains high levels of ammonia, was used as nitrogen-rich wastewater. Experimental period was divided into four phases based whether a carbon source was fed to the DHS reactor. The highest nitrogen removal efficiency (59.5 ± 5.4%) was achieved during phase 4, when a sodium  solution was fed into bottom section of the DHS reactor. In the DHS reactor, the nitrification occurred in the upper and middle sections. Then, after adding the sodium  solution, denitrification occurred. The final chemical  demand, ammonia, and total inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the DHS reactor effluent were 37 ± 24 mg/L, 34 ± 5 mgN/L, and 42 ± 8 mgN/L, respectively. These concentrations were sufficient to meet the effluent standards of the Vietnamese natural rubber industry, which are the strictest in South-East Asia. The dominant bacteria in the sludge retained by the reactor's sponge media were the nitrifying bacteria Nitrosovibrio (0.2%) and Nitrospira (0.2-0.3%), the denitrifying bacteria Hylemonella (1.0-13.7%), Pseudoxanthomonas (1.2-2.1%), and Amaricoccus (2.4-3.5%), and the anammox bacterium Candidatus Brocadia (0.1-0.2%). Significant amounts of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Xanthobacter (11.2-14.8%) and the rubber-degrading bacterium Gordonia (11.0-28.6%) were also found in the DHS reactor. These bacteria were thus considered to be the key microbes for nitrogen removal in a DHS reactor fed with a carbon source for denitrification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activities of this enzyme by Fraxinus angustifolia extracts. The leaf organic phase of ethyl  (LFA) and its bark aqueous counterpart (BFA) showed the strongest anti-NADH oxidase activity in vitro (IC50 = 38.51 and 42.04 µg mL-1, respectively). They consequently suppressed superoxide generation both enzymatically (53% and 19%, respectively) and nonenzymatically (34% and 19%, respectively). These results were corroborated in vivo, with high antiNADH oxidase potential of the leaves and bark extracts (75.32% and 51.32%, respectively) concomitant with moderate hypouricemic activities (36.84% and 38.59%, respectively). Bio-guided fractionation led to the identification, by LC-DAD-MS/MS, of esculin and calcelarioside in bark and kaempferol glucoside in leaves as the main compounds responsible for the anti-NADH oxidase activity of XOR.

The immune system, vital in host defense and protection against environmental agents, is typically initiated and executed by innate effector immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils. Previous literature has reported the immune system as a major target of ENM toxicity; however, there is inconsistency regarding the immunotoxicity of ENM. This could be attributed to differences in ENM physicochemical properties, cellular models examined, biocorona formation, etc. Thus, the current study examined the toxicity and immunomodulatory effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNP), one of the most utilized ENM in consumer and medical products, in two key innate immune cell models, e.g. RAW 264.7 cells (macrophages) and differentiated MPRO 2.1 cells (promyelocytes/neutrophils). The results showed that despite a generation of reactive  species, exposure to 20 nm citrate-coated AgNP was not associated with major oxidative damage, inflammatory responses, nor cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, and most importantly, pre-exposure to the AgNP for 24 h enhanced RAW 264.7 cell phagocytic ability as well as the release of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In MPRO 2.1 cells, AgNP pre-exposure also resulted in enhanced phagocytic ability; however, these cells manifest reduced cell degranulation (elastase release) and oxidative burst in response to phorbol myristate  (PMA). Taken together, these findings indicated to us that exposure to AgNP, despite not being directly (cyto)toxic to these cells, had the potential to alter immune cell responses. The findings underscore the import of assessing immune cell function post-exposure to ENM beyond the standard endpoints such as oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. In addition, these findings further illustrate the importance of understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of ENM-cellular interactions, particularly in the immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30767167>Extra energy for hearts with a genetic defect: ENERGY trial.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation carriers have a decreased myocardial energy efficiency, which is thought to play a key role in the pathomechanism of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Results showed that the chemical  demand (COD) removal in the whole process remained above 90%. And the effluent concentrations of targeted pollutants were lower than 10 mg/L, other than para-toluic acid (PT, 38.09 mg/L). However, methane production significantly decreased compared to no salinity situation. This might be due to the inhibition of salinity on methanogens, which hindered the conversion of  to methane. Furthermore, the dominant genus in bacterial level changed from Tepidisphaera to Syntrophus, which facilitated the syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The prevailed archaea remained acetoclastic Methanothrix above 90%.

Native sulfur is formed when hydrocarbons come in contact with sulfate minerals in presence of liquid water. The prevailing model for native sulfur formation in such settings is that sulfide produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria is oxidized to zero-valent sulfur in presence of molecular  (O). Although possible, such a scenario is problematic because: (1) exposure to  would drastically decrease growth of microbial sulfate-reducing organisms, thereby slowing down sulfide production; (2) on geologic timescales, excess supply with  would convert sulfide into sulfate rather than native sulfur; and (3) to produce large native sulfur deposits, enormous amounts of oxygenated water would need to be brought in close proximity to environments in which ample hydrocarbon supply sustains sulfate reduction. However, sulfur stable isotope data from native sulfur deposits emplaced at a stage after the formation of the host rocks indicate that the sulfur was formed in a setting with little solute exchange with the ambient environment and little supply of dissolved . We deduce that there must be a process for the formation of native sulfur in absence of an external oxidant for sulfide. We hypothesize that in systems with little solute exchange, sulfate-reducing organisms, possibly in cooperation with other anaerobic microbial partners, drive the formation of native sulfur deposits. In order to cope with sulfide stress, microbes may shift from harmful sulfide production to non-hazardous native sulfur production. We propose four possible mechanisms as a means to form native sulfur: (1) a modified sulfate reduction process that produces sulfur compounds with an intermediate oxidation state, (2) coupling of sulfide oxidation to methanogenesis that utilizes methylated compounds,  or carbon dioxide, (3) ammonium oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction, and (4) sulfur comproportionation of sulfate and sulfide. We show these reactions are thermodynamically favorable and especially useful in environments with multiple stressors, such as salt and dissolved sulfide, and provide evidence that microbial species functioning in such environments produce native sulfur. Integrating these insights, we argue that microbes may form large native sulfur deposits in absence of light and external oxidants such as O, nitrate, and metal oxides. The existence of such a process would not only explain enigmatic occurrences of native sulfur in the geologic record, but also provide an explanation for cryptic sulfur and carbon cycling beneath the seabed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609494>Enhanced catalytic performance for VOCs oxidation on the CoAlO oxides by KMnO doped on facile synthesis.</a></h2><p>The MnO was immobilized on the CoAl mixed oxides (CoAlO) derived from hydrotalcites with various anions (CO, Cl, NO and SO) using the hydration and impregnation methods. The CoAlO oxides modified by KMnO were calcined in air at 300 °C to obtain stable oxides, which could be used as catalysts for VOCs (acetone and ethyl ) oxidation. CoAlO with CO and 30 h of hydration time (CoAlO-C-Mn-30) exhibited a promising catalytic activity (T = 173 °C for acetone oxidation; T = 175 °C for ethyl ), highly superior to CoAlO without KMnO modification. The improvement in acetone and ethyl  catalytic oxidation was ascribed to the Co and surface adsorbed  species. The increase of Co in the CoAlO-C-Mn-30 oxide thanked to the self-decomposition of KMnO and reducibility of Co in the CoAlO oxide during the hydration process. This was also confirmed by XRD and XPS characterization, which showed that Mn cations were enriched on the catalyst surface in the valences of +3 and +4. The catalytic activity of the catalyst remained unchanged in four cycles in the presence of 5.5 vol.% water vapor, which indicated a great potential for industrial application.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

No differences between polyethylene-glycolated carboxyhemoglobin and hydroxyethyl starch were observed (33 ± 7 mmHg vs. 29 ± 8 mmHg; mean difference, -5; 95% CI, -12 to 3; P = 0.387), but significantly less volume was administered (4.5 [3.3-6.2] vs. 8.5[7.7-11.4] ml; mean rank difference, 11.98; P = 0.387). Blood and diluted blood increased the plasma bioavailability of nitric oxide compared with hydroxyethyl starch (mean rank difference, -20.97; P = 0.004; and -17.13; P = 0.029, respectively). No changes in heme oxygenase 1 levels were observed. Polyethylene-glycolated carboxyhemoglobin limited tubular histologic damages compared with hydroxyethyl starch (mean rank difference, 60.12; P = 0.0012) with reduced neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (mean rank difference, 84.43; P < 0.0001) and tumor necrosis factor-α (mean rank difference, 49.67; P = 0.026) histologic scores.Polyethylene-glycolated carboxyhemoglobin resuscitation did not improve renal PO2 but limited tubular histologic damages and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin upregulation after hemorrhage compared with hydroxyethyl starch, whereas a lower volume was required to sustain macrocirculation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758963>Spatially Explicit Large-Scale Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceuticals in Surface Water in China.</a></h2><p>With improving healthcare and an aging population, the consumption of human pharmaceuticals in China has been increasing dramatically. Environmental risks posed by many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are still unknown. This study used a spatially explicit dilution-factor methodology to model predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) of 11 human-use APIs in surface water for a preliminary environmental risk assessment (ERA). Median PECs in surface water across China range between 0.01 and 8.0 × 10 ng/L for the different APIs, under a moderate patient use scenario. Higher environmental risks of APIs in surface water are in regions with high water stress, e.g., northern China. Levonorgestrel, estradiol, ethinyl estradiol and abiraterone  were predicted to potentially pose a high or moderate environmental risk in China if consumption levels reach those in Europe. Relative risks of these four APIs have the potential to be among those chemicals with the highest impact on surface water in China when compared to the risks associated with other regulated chemicals, including triclosan and some standard water quality parameters including BOD (5-day biological  demand), COD (chemical  demand), Cu, Zn, and Hg and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. This method could support the regulation of this category of chemicals and risk mitigation strategies in China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31158408>Genetic engineering of Bacillus sp. and fermentation process optimizing for diacetyl production.</a></h2><p>Diacetyl, an important flavor extensively used in the food industry, can be produced from the non-enzymatic oxidative decarboxylation of α-acetolactate in bacteria fermentation. In previous work, we obtained a strain of Bacillus sp. DL01-ΔalsD with low diacetyl accumulation. The strain was engineered and optimized for improving the production of diacetyl in this study. First, deletion of the gene encoding phosphotransacetylase (pta), by homologous recombination with high temperature sensitive shuttle plasmid vector pKS1, led to a reduction of  and 130% increase of diacetyl production in B. sp. DL01-ΔalsD-Δpta. Then overexpression of α-acetolactate synthase (ALS) from B. subtilis 168 in B. sp. DL01-ΔalsD-Δpta resulted in efficient diacetyl production with a titer of 5.43 g/L. To further increase diacetyl production, single factor and orthogonal experimental data were used to predict the optimal fermentation conditions by Back Propagation neural network. Optimal value of Ka (Dissolved  volume coefficient) was 12.4 h with fermentation parameters of aeration rate 0.66 vvm, agitation speed 179 rpm and temperature 35.7 ℃. A titer of 11.18 g/L diacetyl, the highest reported diacetyl production, was achieved by fed-batch fermentation at the optimal condition using the metabolic engineered strain of B. sp. DL01-ΔalsD-Δpta-als These results are of great importance as a new way for the efficient production of diacetyl by food-safety bacteria.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Conformation-specific electronic and IR spectroscopy combined with quantum chemistry calculations confirm the presence of only the cis conformer of phenyl  in the experiment. The cis conformer of phenyl  has n→π* interaction between the lone-pair electrons on the carbonyl  atom and the π* orbitals of the phenyl group. The n→π* interaction is absent in the trans conformer which has additional steric repulsion between the methyl group and phenyl ring. The trans conformer is higher in energy than the cis conformer by ≈3 kcal mol . We have found the effect of methyl substitution on the strength of the n→π* interaction, steric repulsion, and hyperconjugation in phenyl . The red-shift observed in the cis conformer of phenyl  with respect to the trans conformer is affected due to the influence of the methyl substituent on the strength of the n→π* interaction as well as hyperconjugation. The present result demonstrates that the introduction of a bulkier substituent can induce steric as well as electronic control to reduce conformational heterogeneity of a molecular system. Understanding the effect of bulkier substituents to promote defined conformations having specific non-covalent interactions may have implication in better perception of the optimum structure and function of biomolecules as well as recognition of drugs by biomolecules.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Perilla nutlets extracted by ethyl  (EA), 80% ethanol (Eth), and hot water (HW) sequentially were chemically characterized using high-resolution accurate liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with the main compounds detected assigned as rosmarinic acid and derivatives of the flavones apigenin and luteolin, with the more diverse chemical composition observed with the Eth extract. All extracts showed dose-dependent free-radical scavenging activity, with the Eth extract the most potent (IC  = 3.43 mg/ml for ABTS scavenging and 0.27 mg/ml for DPPH scavenging). The Eth extract also inhibited AAPH-induced hemolysis (IC  = 0.07 mg/ml) more potently than did the HW (IC  = 0.38 mg/ml) and EA extracts (IC  = 1.63 mg/ml). An MTT test revealed all the extracts were noncytotoxic at concentrations up to 200 μg/ml. Only the Eth and EA extracts showed protective effects against the generation of reactive  species and lipid peroxidation in FeCl -induced HuH7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest the Eth extract of Thai perilla nutlets, containing rosmarinic acid and flavones and their derivatives, may have potential to provide protection against oxidative stress in hepatic disorders.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408871>Effect of M2 Macrophages on Injury and Apoptosis of Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells Induced by Calcium Oxalate Crystals.</a></h2><p>M2 macrophages have important roles in diseases such as tumours, cardiovascular diseases and renal diseases. This study aimed to determine the effects and protective mechanism of M2 macrophages against oxidative stress injury and apoptosis induced by calcium oxalate crystals (CaOx) in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) under coculture conditions.THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into M2 macrophages by using phorbol-12-myristate-13-, IL-4 and IL-13. Morphological features were observed by microscopy. Phenotypic markers were identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HK-2 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/mL CaOx crystals and co-cultured with M2 macrophages or apocynin. The viability of HK-2 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of HK-2 cells was analysed using a microplate reader. The apoptosis of HK-2 cells was examined by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining. Reactive  species (ROS) expression and mitochondrial membrane potential in HK-2 cells were detected by a fluorescence microplate reader. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression of p47phox, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c, p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, Akt and phospho-Akt.The results of morphology, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and ELISA showed that THP-1 cells were successfully polarised to M2 macrophages. The results of co-culture suggested that M2 macrophages or apocynin significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the LDH activity and apoptosis rate after HK-2 cells were challenged with CaOx crystals. The expression of the p47phox protein and the concentration of ROS were reduced, the release of mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of the Bcl-2 protein were upregulated and the protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cytochrome c was downregulated. The expression of the phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK increased. Under coculture conditions with M2 macrophages, the Akt protein of HK-2 cells treated with CaOx crystals was dephosphorylated, but the phosphorylated form of Akt was not reduced by apocynin.M2 macrophages reduced the oxidative stress injury and apoptosis of HK-2 cells by downregulating the activation of NADPH oxidase, reducing the production of ROS, inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and enhancing the phosphorylation of Akt. We have revealed one of the possible mechanisms by which M2 macrophages reduce the formation of kidney stones.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

A hybrid TiO-assisted photo-ozonation (UV/TiO/O) process was set to address this issue. Subsequently, a comprehensive GC/MS method was developed for quantification of odor compounds. Finally, a complete overall cost analysis was incorporated with the findings of the study to demonstrate an economic analysis of the process. Descriptive results showed that the effluents had high pollution content in terms of color (0.374 IU; b = -0.06), COD (146 mg/L O) and turbidity (15.52 NTU). Moreover, dimethyl silanediol (DS, 34.3%), acetic acid (AA, 20.5%), and diisobutyl phthalate (DP, 32.5%) were determined as major odor compounds of the effluents. After UV/TiO/O process, DS, AA, and DP were reduced to 12.4%, 12.0%, and 8.4%, respectively under the operating conditions of ozone dose of 16 mg/L, initial pH of 7.5, reaction time of 25 min, and catalyst dose of 3 g/L TiO. At the same conditions removal efficiencies of color, COD and turbidity were obtained %99, %85, and 78%, respectively. These values demonstrated the accuracy of UV/TiO/O process in terms of removal of hazardous odor compounds and the other pollution parameters. Studies on reaction mechanism showed that main degradation mechanism occurred in three ways: formation of long-chained cyclic compounds from DS (1), formation of acetamide and ammonium  from AA (2), and formation of phthallic acid from DP (3). Finally, overall cost analysis showed that the current process costed 0.014 $ per 1 L of treated effluent and this value showed that the current process met the economic criteria in terms of feasibility.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The B16F10 cells viability after treatment with increasing concentrations of different extracts of the plant (0.2-200 μg/mL) was measured using resazurin. Essential oil composition was identified by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and inhibitory effect on synthesis of melanin, mushroom tyrosinase activity, cellular tyrosinase, and oxidative stress were evaluated by the colorimetric and fluorometric methods. The data showed extracts at concentrations 0.2-200 μg/mL, did not show significant toxicity on melanoma cells but concentrations of 200 μg/mL of essential oil had cytotoxic effect.  subsp.  could inhibit the mushroom tyrosinase activity. Also the amount of melanin in B16F10 cells declined. In addition, the ability of  subsp.  extracts in decreasing the amount of reactive  species in melanoma cells revealed remarkable antioxidant activity. In addition, all concentrations of essential oil had no significant effect in this study.

Under ambient conditions, irradiation for relatively short periods of time (10-20 s) selectively produces relatively small, narrowly size-dispersed (3.5 ± 0.7 nm) copper(I) oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) embedded in CuCN-polyacetonitrile polymers generated  by the laser. The CuO NPs become embedded in a CuCN-polyacetonitrile network as they form, stabilizing them and protecting the air-sensitive material from . Laser irradiation of acetonitrile causes fragmentation into transient radicals that initiate and terminate polymerization of acetonitrile. Control and mechanistic investigations reveal that HCN formed during laser irradiation reacts rapidly to reduce the Cu(II) centers in [Cu(OAc)], leading to the formation of CuCN or, in the presence of water, CuO nanoparticles that bind and cross-link CuCN-polyacetonitrile chains. The -bridged Cu(II) dimer unit is a required structural feature that functions to preorganize and direct the Cu(II) reduction and selective formation of CuCN and CuO nanoparticles. This study illustrates how rapid deposition of energy using shaped, ultrashort laser pulses can initiate multiple photolytic and thermal processes that lead to the selective formation of composite nanoparticle/polymer materials for applications in electronics and catalysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573583>Effects of biological buffer solutions on the peroxidase-like catalytic activity of FeO nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are frequently used in biomedical applications due to their magnetic properties and putative chemical stability. Nevertheless, their well-known ability to mimic some features of the peroxidase enzyme activity under specific conditions of pH and temperature could lead to the formation of potentially harmful free radical species. In addition to the intrinsic enzyme-like activity of IONPs, the buffer solution is an important external factor that can alter dramatically the IONP activity because the buffer species can interact with the surface of the particles. In our study, IONP activity was evaluated in different buffering solutions under different experimental conditions and predominant free radical species were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance using the spin-trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). The formation kinetics of the reactive  species were studied by UV-visible spectroscopy with TMB and DAB peroxidase substrates. We found that the highest catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrates and free radical generation were achieved in  buffer, while phosphate buffer inhibited the peroxidase-like activity of IONPs in a concentration dependent manner. When emulating the physiological conditions, a lower catalytic activity was observed at pH 7.4 when compared to that at pH 5.0. Also, in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), we observed an enhancement in the peroxidase substrate oxidation rate that was not accompanied by an increase in DMPO/adduct formation which could be related to a non-specific oxidation catalyzed by the chloride ion. Similar observations were found after the addition of a bicarbonate to HEPES buffer. TMB oxidation did not occur when the reaction was conducted with free iron ions from metal salts with the same concentration of the IONPs (0.33 Fe2+ and 0.66 Fe3+). However, we observed even higher catalytic activities than those when doubling the IONP concentration when they are combined with the free iron salts. These results indicate that biological buffering solutions need to be carefully considered when evaluating IONP catalytic activity and their potential toxicological effects since under physiological conditions of pH, salinity and buffering species, the peroxidase-like activity of IONPs is dramatically reduced.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981089>Atractyligenin, a terpenoid isolated from coffee silverskin, inhibits cutaneous photoaging.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure-induced photoaging of the skin is a multifactorial process involving both extrinsic and intrinsic cellular mechanisms. Several naturally occurring products are known to confer protection against UV light-induced skin damage. Our preliminary studies confirmed that the ethyl  fraction of coffee silverskin exhibits inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Furthermore, we previously isolated and identified atractyligenin, which has MMP-inhibitory activity, from the silverskin ethyl  fraction. The aim of this study was to elucidate the anti-photoaging effects of atractyligenin on human dermal fibroblasts and the underlying mechanism. Human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to 8 J/cm UVA radiation, and cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay. The fluorescent dye 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCF-DA) was used to measure the intracellular reactive  species (ROS) levels. Our study showed that atractyligenin significantly suppressed the expression of UVA-induced MMPs by inhibiting intracellular ROS production. Atractyligenin treatment reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and c-Fos expression by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway activated by UVA irradiation. Additionally, treatment with atractyligenin contributed to the homeostasis of collagen by restoring the loss of collagen absorption-related receptor Endo180 and altered fibroblast morphology induced by UVA irradiation. These results indicate that atractyligenin isolated from coffee silverskin inhibits multiple pathways in the human skin photoaging process and is thus a potential candidate for treatment or prevention of photoaging.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The neuroprotective effect was examined by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assays. As a result, AEEF reduced alcohol-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress.

Here, we describe the synthesis, physicochemical properties, and ROS-scavenging activities of one such derivative-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated manganese protoporphyrin (PEG-MnPP). Carboxyl groups of the protoporphyrin ring at the C6 and C7 positions were first conjugated with ethylenediamine to introduce amino groups into the protoporphyrin structure. The amino groups were then reacted with succinimidyl PEG, with an average molecular weight of 2000, to obtain pegylated protoporphyrin (PEG-PP).

Cobalt-substituted chlorophyll derivative (Co-Chl) in chloroplasts is first obtained by successively rinsing in hydrochloric acid and cobalt  solutions. After calcining in nitrogen to 800 °C, Co-Chl is transferred to CoNC; while other parts of chloroplasts adsorbed with Co ions are transferred to CoO retaining the microarchitecture of chloroplasts. The abundant active CoNC sites are protected by circumjacent biocarbon and CoO to avoid leakage and agglomeration, and at the same time can overcome the poor conductivity weakness of CoO by directly transporting electrons to the carbonaceous skeleton. This unique synergistic effect, together with efficient bioarchitecture, leads to good electrocatalytical performance for the ORR. The onset and half-wave potentials are 0.89 and 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with better durability and methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C.

Dioscin-6'-O- (DA), a novel natural steroidal saponin, was firstly isolated from the rhizomes of Dioscorea althaeoides R. Knuth. Until now, there were no studies on its pharmacological activities.Here, we investigated the growth inhibitory effect and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms of DA against lung cancer cells.NSCLC H460, H1299, H520 cells and SCLC H446 cells were treated with DA. To display the cytotoxic effects and possible mechanism of DA on these cells, MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis were carried out.Our results showed that DA exerted strong anti-proliferative activity against lung cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry demonstrated DA induced the cell cycle arrest at S-phase (NCI-H460, NCI-H1299, NCI-H520) or G1-phase (NCI-H446), caused cellular apoptosis, generation of reactive  species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blotting analysis showed DA treatment increased the levels of caspase 3, 8, 9, Bax, p21, p53, phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK and markedly decreased the expression of Bcl-2, p-ERK, p-PI3K, p-AKT and NF-κB. Blockade of caspases with Z-VAD-FMK converted apoptosis-related proteins. Suppression of p53 with pifithrin-α (PFT) attenuated cell cycle-related protein. Inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) adjusted apoptosis-related proteins and phosphorylated MAPK and PI3K, as well as NF-κB.Overall, our study indicated that DA suppressed lung cancer cells proliferation via inducing cell-cycle arrest and enhancing caspase-dependent apoptosis, at least partly, through ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The catalytic mechanisms of palladium  toward the conversion of HMF to furfuryl alcohol (FFA), 5-methylfurfural (5-MF) and 2,5-dihydroxymethyl furan (DHMF) have been theoretically investigated. The decarbonylation of HMF to FFA includes (i) migratory extrusion, (ii) metal--co-assisted deprotonation, (iii) decarbonylation, (iv) metal-assisted deprotonation, and (v) migratory extrusion and catalyst regeneration. Both hydrogenation and deoxidation of HMF with HCOOH as the H-source involve (i) migratory extrusion, (ii) oxidative addition, (iii) reductive elimination, (iv) metal-assisted deprotonation, and (v) migratory extrusion and catalyst regeneration. The C-H bond cleavage is the crucial reaction step, in which the metal--co-assisted deprotonation is kinetically more preferable than the oxidative addition. Both FFA and DHMF are kinetically superior to 5-MF. In terms of selectivity, increasing the temperature is beneficial to decarbonylation and decreasing the temperature is advantageous to hydrogenation. The present finding provides molecular-level insight into the functions of both the metal-center and coordinated-ligand in the Pd(OAc)2 catalyst, which may drive the novel design of catalytic systems toward both decarbonylation and hydrogenation reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776542>PMA-triggered PKCε activity enhances Nrf2-mediated antiviral response on fish rhabdovirus infection.</a></h2><p>Viral infection is often accompanied with alteration of intracellular redox state, especially an imbalance between reactive  species (ROS) production and antioxidant cellular defenses. The previous studies showed that an antioxidant cellular defense system, the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), played an important role against spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) infection in fish. To further reveal the mediated mechanism that Nrf2 active state was affected by protein kinase C (PKC), here we evaluated SVCV replication in host cells by treated with a strong activator of PKC phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) and an inhibitor staurosporine. Our results showed that PMA significantly repressed SVCV replication and viral-induced apoptosis in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell, suggesting that PKC may exhibit an anti-SVCV effect. Likewise, PMA resulted in a higher phosphorylation levels of PKCε rather than PKCα/β to participate in the activation of Nrf2, mainly involved in the activation of Nrf2 phosphorylation of Ser40 to favor Nrf2 translocation to nucleus. Furthermore, the data revealed that PMA up-regulated an antiviral response heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) gene expression that was confirmed as the key player against SVCV infection by HO1 specific siRNA. Overall, this study provided a new therapeutic target for the treatment of SVCV infection, and modulating PKC activity could be used for the prevention and treatment of SVCV.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study therefore aimed to uncover functional feed additives to help enhance livestock immunity and disease resistance, using Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruit extract (ASF).ASF was extracted with 70% EtOH, and total polyphenolic and catechin contents were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu and vanillin assay, respectively. The 3D4/31 porcine macrophage cells (MΦ) were activated by Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA), and cell survival and growth rate were measured with or without ASF treatment. Flow-cytometric analysis determined the lysosomal activity, reactive  species levels (ROS), and cell cycle distribution. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein expression levels were quantified by western blotting and densitometry analysis. Quantitative PCR was applied to measure the lipid metabolism-related genes expression level. Lastly, the antibacterial activity of 3D4/31 MΦ cells was evaluated by the colony forming unit assay.ASF upregulated the cell viability and growth rate of 3D4/31 MΦ, with or without PMA activation. Moreover, lysosomal activity and intracellular ROS levels were increased after ASF exposure. In addition, the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 expression levels were proportionately increased with ROS levels. Both ASF and PMA treatment resulted in upregulation of NF-κB protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α mRNA expression levels, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation metabolism. Interestingly, co-treatment of ASF with PMA resulted in recovery of NF-κB, TNFα, and lipid metabolism levels. Finally, ASF pretreatment enhanced the in vitro bactericidal activity of 3D4/31 MΦ against Escherichia coli.s: This study provides a novel insight into the regulation of NF-κB activity and lipid metabolism in MΦ, and we anticipate that ASF has the potential to be effective as a feed additive to enhance livestock immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894323>Differential induction of nuclear factor-like 2 signature genes with toll-like receptor stimulation.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is associated with production of reactive  species (ROS) and results in the induction of thioredoxin (TXN) and peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) and activation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2). In this study we have used the mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage and the human THP-1 monocyte cell line to investigate the pattern of expression of three Nrf2 target genes, PRDX1, TXN reductase (TXNRD1) and heme oxygenase (HMOX1), by activation of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found that, while the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces all three genes, the pattern of induction with agonists for TLR1/2, TLR3, TLR2/6 and TLR7/8 differs depending on the gene and the cell line. In all cases, the extent of induction was HMOX1>TXNRD1>PRDX1. Since LPS was a good inducer of all genes in both cell lines, we studied the mechanisms mediating LPS induction of the three genes using mouse RAW 264.7 cells. To assess the role of ROS we used the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Only LPS induction of HMOX1 was inhibited by NAC while that of TXNRD1 and PRDX1 was unaffected. These three genes were also induced by phorbol myristate  (PMA), a ROS-inducer acting by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibited the induction of all three genes by PMA but only that of HMOX1 by LPS. This indicates that activation of these genes by inflammatory agents is regulated by different mechanisms involving either ROS or protein kinases, or both.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Developing highly efficient non-noble multifunctional catalysts in the same electrolyte is an open challenge. Herein, efficient Co-N-C electrocatalysts with a mixed structure comprising Co-N moieties and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in a N-doped carbon layer were prepared via pyrolysis of a new structure of Co-coordinated bis(imino)pyridine polymer constructed by 2,6-diacetylpyridine and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. Results demonstrate that Co ion sources have a remarkable impact on the final Co-N-C performance. The Co-N-C catalyst prepared using cobalt  as a precursor displays remarkable overall multifunctional performance. It needs only a cell voltage of 1.66 V (obtained from the half-cell test) for the water-splitting reaction (HER/OER) to reach 10 mA·cm in 1.0 M KOH, and the overall  redox activity (OER/ORR) is 0.72 V in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming the reported nonprecious metal catalysts. The excellent activity is attributable to the synergistic effects between active sites with encapsulated metallic Co for HER and OER and Co-N moieties for ORR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31407759>Synthesis and characterization of novel 7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin substituted metallo phthalocyanines and investigation of their photophysical and photochemical properties.</a></h2><p>In this study, the synthesis of novel 7-hydroxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin (1), four respective phthalonitriles; 4-(7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin)phthalonitrile (2), 3-(7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin)phthalonitrile (3), 4-chloro-5-(7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin)phthalonitrile (4), and 4,5-bis(7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin)phthalonitrile (5) and their corresponding alpha tetra, beta tetra and beta octa 7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin and beta octa 4-chloro-5-(7-oxy-3-ethyl-6-hexyl-4-methylcoumarin) substituted Zn(ii) (6a-9a) and In(iii) Cl (6b-9b) phthalocyanines has been performed. The novel purified compounds were characterized by standard characterization techniques such as elemental analysis, thermal analysis, FT-IR, UV-vis, H-NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. All of the obtained phthalocyanines showed lipophilic behaviour with excellent solubility in organic solvents such as acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform, pyridine and ethyl . The fluorescence quenching behaviour was investigated using 1,4-benzoquinone and potassium iodide as quenchers. The photophysical (fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes) and photochemical (singlet  and photodegradation quantum yields) properties of these novel phthalocyanines (6a-9a and 6b-9b) were studied in DMF. They produced high singlet  (for example Φ = 0.99 for 7b) and showed appropriate photodegradation (in the order of 10) which is very important for photodynamic therapy (PDT), and thus these phthalocyanines can be used as Type II photosensitizers in PDT applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728952>Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Activity of the inner bark extracts obtained from  (Bertol) DC and  (JACQ) G.

In the photosynthetic water-oxidizing enzyme, photosystem II (PSII), protons from substrate water are transferred 35 Å from the MnCaO catalytic site to the chloroplast lumen. This process leads to acidification of the lumen and ATP synthesis. Water oxidation occurs in a flash-induced, five-step S  state cycle;  is a chloride-dependent inhibitor of the S to S step of this cycle. Here, we study the effect of  on a previous step of the cycle, the S to S transition, using reaction-induced infrared spectroscopy. PSII was isolated from spinach, and experiments were conducted at pH 7.5, using 532 nm laser flashes to advance the cycle from the dark-adapted state S to the S state. Isotope-editing of  reveals direct contributions to the S-minus-S infrared spectrum consistent with protonation of bound  in PSII. In the -derived S-minus-S PSII spectra, an accompanying decrease in the intensity of a 2830 cm band is observed when compared to the chloride control. The 2830 cm band has been assigned previously to a stretching vibration of an internal, hydrated hydronium ion, W . Density functional studies of a catalytic site model predict the spontaneous transfer of a proton from this internal hydronium ion to , when  is substituted at a chloride-binding site. Taken together, the results show that the mechanism of PSII proton transfer at pH 7.5 involves proton hopping through an internal, water-containing network.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590318>Ameliorative effect of Homalium zeylanicum against carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in rats.</a></h2><p>Objective is to evaluate the ameliorative effects of Homalium zeylanicum in carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in rats. To establish the nature of antioxidant principles in the bioactive ethyl  fractions of bark (HZEB) and leaf (HZEL);  radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and cell-based antioxidant protection in erythrocytes (CAP-e) assays were performed. From acute toxicity study, HZEB and HZEL at 200 and 300 mg/kg b.w., were relatively safe at their effective doses. The degree of protection was measured by using biochemical parameters such as serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB) and total protein (TP) contents. Hepatic markers e.g. thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated along with histopathological observations of liver tissues. Both fractions showed significant improvement in restoring SGOT, SGPT, ALP, TB and TP level. TBARS, SOD, CAT and GSH levels were significantly altered towards normal values. Both fractions at 300 mg/kg showed remarkable improvement in liver markers as compared to silymarin. Histopathological examinations showed reduction in hepatic necrosis and appeared normal hepatocellular architecture in HZEB and HZEL treated groups. In CAP-e assay, IC of HZEB (54.66 mg/mL) was higher than HZEL (60.88 mg/mL) and in ORAC assay, AUC of HZEB and HZEL were 33.46, 21.29 respectively and results were comparable with trolox. GC-MS and LC-MS analysis identified a total no. of 44 compounds. Few compounds were identified as bioactive compounds e.g. catechol (7.23%), tetraacetyl-d-xylonic nitrile (3%), oleic acid (0.49%), 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-phenol (3.71%), 3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenol (0.31%), and conifer alcohol (7.41%). The presence of antioxidant principles in both fractions were responsible for hepatoprotective activities, however, the presence of catechol (7.23%) in the bark part imparted better activities in protecting liver than leaf of H. zeylanicum.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The well-known mechanism of DCA action is through stimulating Krebs cycle (stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase via inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase). This prevents lactate formation (Warburg effect) depriving cancer cells of lactate-based benefits e.g. angiogenesis, chemoresistance and radioresistance. Here, we introduce novel evidence-based hypotheses to explain DCA-induced anticancer effects. On pharmacological and biochemical bases, we hypothesize that DCA is a structural antagonist of  competing with it for target enzymes and biological reactions.

Calcium oxide (CaO) loaded on porous support is promising for HgCl selective adsorption because of its porosity and alkaline nature. The main hypothesis investigated in this paper is if the capacity of CaO sorbent for HgCl selective adsorption is attributed to its basic sites, then this will be drastically impacted by the calcium precursors. We synthesized a suite of CaO/SiO sorbents from different precursors, including hydrated calcium oxide (CaO-HS), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (CaO-NS), and calcium  monohydrate (CaO-AcS), to investigate their performance on HgCl selective adsorption in a fixed-bed reactor. Compared with CaO-HS and CaO-NS, CaO-AcS was demonstrated to have the strongest affinity for HgCl and almost complete breakthrough for Hg. Advanced porosity and surface basicity of CaO-AcS were confirmed by characterization analysis. CaO (001) and CaO (011) facet as well as surface defects that have different unsaturated O sites were observed using the high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). Combined theoretical and experimental methods were used to study the interaction mechanisms between HgCl and basic sites on CaO-AcS surfaces. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated all CaO surfaces weakly interact with Hg, while four robust bonding states of HgCl were predicted on different basic sites with the intensity in increasing order: Monodentate < Tridendate < Bidentate < Bridging. This was consistent with HgCl-TPD experiments that demonstrated that the four HgCl adsorption configurations on CaO-AcS were attributed to different unsaturated O sites. The findings in this work highlight the application potential of CaO-AcS for gaseous Hg sampling and measurement from coal-fired flue gas.Copyright © 2018.

Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment.3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive  species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive  species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions.

The pathway can operate in the reductive and oxidative directions, enabling a wide range of metabolic processes. Here, we present a detailed analysis of 14 newly acquired, previously analysed, and publicly available genomic assemblies belonging to the candidate phylum Bipolaricaulota (candidate division OP1, and candidatus Acetothermia), where the occurrence of WL pathway appears to be universal. In silico analysis of predicted metabolic capabilities indicates that the pathway enables homoacetogenic fermentation of sugars and amino acids in all three Bipolaricaulota orders (RBG-16-55-9, UBA7950 and Bipolaricaulales).

While stiffer substrates are known to affect single endothelial cell morphology and migration, the effect of substrate stiffness on endothelial monolayer function is less understood. The objective of this study was to determine if substrate stiffness increased endothelial monolayer reactive  species (ROS) in response to protein kinase C (PKC) activation and if this oxidative stress then impacted adherens junction integrity. Porcine aortic endothelial cells were cultured on varied stiffness polyacrylamide gels and treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), which stimulates PKC and ROS without increasing actinomyosin contractility. PMA-treated endothelial cells on stiffer substrates increased ROS and adherens junction loss without increased contractility. ROS scavengers abrogated PMA effects on cell-cell junctions, with a more profound effect in cells on stiffer substrates. Finally, endothelial cells in aortae from elastin haploinsufficient mice (), which were stiffer than aortae from wild-type mice, showed decreased VE-cadherin colocalization with peripheral actin following PMA treatment. These data suggest that oxidative stress may be enhanced in endothelial cells in stiffer vessels, which could contribute to the association between arterial stiffness and cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528026>The role of edible bird's nest and mechanism of averting lead  toxicity effect on rat uterus.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of edible bird's nest (EBN) supplement on the uteri of rats exposed to lead  (LA) toxicity.Five treatment groups were established as follows: Group 1 (C), which was given distilled water; Group 2 (T0), which was administered with LA (10 mg/kg body weight [BW]); and Groups 3 (T1), 4 (T2), and 5 (T3), which were given LA (10 mg/kg BW) plus graded concentrations of 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg BW of EBN, respectively.

The ethyl  fraction exhibited the strongest hypoglycemic and antiglycation potential among the four fractions, and hence the isolation of active compounds is required to develop leads for new drugs to treat diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058865>Preserved Cerebral  Metabolism in Astrocytic Dysfunction: A Combination Study of O-Gas PET with C- Autoradiography.</a></h2><p>Fluorocitrate (FC) is a specific metabolic inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in astrocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether inhibition of the astrocyte TCA cycle by FC would affect the  metabolism in the rat brain. At 4 h after the intracranial FC injection, the rats ( = 9) were investigated by O-labeled gas PET to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF), the cerebral metabolic rate of  (CMRO),  extraction fraction (OEF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV). After the O-gas PET, the rats were given an intravenous injection of C- for autoradiography. O-gas PET showed no significant differences in any of the measured parameters between the ipsilateral and contralateral striatum (high dose group: CBF (54.4 ± 8.8 and 55.3 ± 11.6 mL/100mL/min), CMRO (7.0 ± 0.9 and 7.1 ± 1.2 mL/100mL/min), OEF (72.0 ± 8.9 and 70.8 ± 8.2%), and CBV (4.1 ± 0.8 and 4.2 ± 0.9 mL/100mL), respectively). In contrast, the C- autoradiography revealed a significant inhibition of the astrocyte metabolism in the ipsilateral striatum. The regional cerebral  consumption as well as the hemodynamic parameters were maintained even in the face of inhibition of the astrocyte TCA cycle metabolism in the rat brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636599>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps as a Drug Target to Counteract Chronic and Acute Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET), extruded decondensated chromatin entangled with neutrophil proteases, have been first identified in neutrophils stimulated with bacteria or phorbol myristate  (PMA) via activation of NADPH oxidase and the generation of reactive  species. Although the first findings demonstrated the beneficial role of NET formation by trapping the bacteria and limiting their dissemination, numerous studies in the recent decade revealed the multifunctional aspects of NET formation which manifests itself not only in the context of anti-microbial effect but also as a pathological trigger. Uncontrolled and exaggerated NET formation or inability to digest and remove NET have been reported in thrombosis, auto-immune diseases, cancer or even in infertility. Studies are ongoing to disclose the role of NET in different pathological situations and most importantly, NET regulation via compounds that either interfere with NET formation or target NET components such as DNA or neutrophil proteases. Although the final product of NET formation seems to be quite common i.e. DNA entangled with proteases, stimuli that induce NET have a wide range of varieties and the involved pathways are diverse too. Therefore, in every pathological condition, it is necessary to consider carefully the type of stimulus and the signaling pathways in order to target the disease more specifically. Here we briefly summarize some (out of many) NET triggers/pathways and discuss the potential interventions in the pathological situations.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583359>Evaluation of antioxidant activities of various solvent extract from Sargassum serratifolium and its major antioxidant components.</a></h2><p>Sargassum serratifolium has been known to contain a high level of meroterpenoids as antioxidant components. We investigated antioxidant activities and active components in various solvent extracts from S. serratifolium. Ethyl , ethanol, and methanol extracts showed relatively strong DPPH, ABTs, and superoxide radical scavenging activities. Hexane and ethyl  extract showed the strongest hydroxyl radical and reactive  species (ROS), respectively, scavenging activities. Sargahydroquinoic acid (SHQA), sargachromanol (SCM) and sargaquinoic acid (SQA) were main antioxidant components in S. serratifolium. Ethanol extract showed the highest levels of SHQA, SCM, and SQA which comprised to be 227 ± 6.31 mg/g. SHQA and SCM exhibited stronger antioxidant capacities than SQA based on lower IC values in ROS, DPPH, ABTs, and superoxide radical scavenging assays. The result showed that ethanol is the most efficient extracting solvent for the active components from S. serratifolium and the plant has the potential as a natural antioxidant.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The metabolic transition from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation has been regarded as a hallmark of neuronal differentiation. Understanding what triggers metabolism reprogramming and how glucose metabolism directs NSC differentiation may provide new insight into the regenerative potential of the brain. TP53 inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is an endogenous inhibitor of glycolysis and is highly expressed in mature neurons. However, its function in embryonic NSCs has not yet been explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the precise roles of TIGAR in NSCs and the possible involvement of metabolic reprogramming in the TIGAR regulatory network. We observed that TIGAR is significantly increased during brain development as neural differentiation proceeds, especially at the peak of NSC differentiation (E14.5-E16.5). In cultured NSCs, knockdown of TIGAR reduced the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ngn1, and NeuroD1, and enhanced the expression of REST, suggesting that TIGAR is an important regulator of NSC differentiation. Furthermore, TIGAR enhanced the expression of lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and the mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) markers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor (NRF1), and MitoNEET during NSC differentiation. TIGAR can decrease lactate production and accelerate  consumption and ATP generation to maintain a high rate of OXPHOS in differentiated NSCs. Interestingly, knockdown of TIGAR decreased the level of acetyl-CoA and H3K9 acetylation at the promoters of Ngn1, Neurod1, and Gfap. , a precursor of acetyl-CoA, increased the level of H3K9 acetylation and rescued the effect of TIGAR deficiency on NSC differentiation. Together, our data demonstrated that TIGAR promotes metabolic reprogramming and regulates NSC differentiation through an epigenetic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001279>Traumatic Injury and Exposure to Mitochondrial-Derived Damage Associated Molecular Patterns Suppresses Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation.</a></h2><p>Major traumatic injury induces significant remodeling of the circulating neutrophil pool and loss of bactericidal function. Although a well-described phenomenon, research to date has only analyzed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission, and the mechanisms that initiate compromised neutrophil function post-injury are therefore poorly understood. Here, we analyzed pre-hospital blood samples acquired from 62 adult trauma patients (mean age 44 years, range 19-95 years) within 1 h of injury (mean time to sample 39 min, range 13-59 min). We found an immediate impairment in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) stimulation, which persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4-72 h). Reduced NET generation was accompanied by reduced reactive  species production, impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and a reduction in neutrophil glucose uptake and metabolism to lactate. Pre-treating neutrophils from healthy subjects with mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), whose circulating levels were significantly increased in our trauma patients, reduced NET generation. This mtDAMP-induced impairment in NET formation was associated with an N-formyl peptide mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis and NET formation. Indeed, activation of AMPK via treatment with the AMP-mimetic AICAR significantly reduced neutrophil lactate production in response to PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that we also observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, the impairment in NET generation induced by mtDAMPs was partially ameliorated by pre-treating neutrophils with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken together, our data demonstrate an immediate trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil anti-microbial function and identify mtDAMP release as a potential initiator of acute post-injury neutrophil dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31517565>Ectoine production with indigenous  sp.

In the highly productive upwelling waters off the coast of Peru,  cells comprised 3-25% of the total microbial community at a near-shore station where sulfide concentrations exceeded 20 μM in bottom waters. From the chemocline where the  population exceeded 10 cells ml, and where high rates of denitrification (up to 6.5 ± 0.4 μM N d) and dark carbon fixation (2.8 ± 0.2 μM C d) were measured, we isolated a previously uncultivated  species -  (BCCM LMG-31510) Genomic analysis showed that  possesses genes encoding for sulfide oxidation and denitrification pathways, but lacks the ability to fix CO via autotrophic carbon fixation pathways. Genes encoding transporters for organic carbon compounds, however, were present in the  genome. Physiological experiments demonstrated that  grew best on a mix of sulfide, nitrate and . Isotope labeling experiments further verified that  completely reduced nitrate to N and assimilate , but did not fix CO, thus coupling heterotrophic growth to sulfide oxidation and denitrification. Single-cell nanoSIMS analysis of samples taken from shipboard isotope labeling experiments also confirmed that the  spp. population  did not substantially fix CO The efficient growth yield associated with the chemolithoheterotrophic metabolism of  may allow this  species to rapidly bloom in eutrophic and sulfide-rich waters off the coast of Peru.

The absorption and fluorescence spectra of EAEC were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. EAEC-induced reactive  species (ROS) production in HCT116 and SW620 cells was detected using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG). The photo- and dark toxicities of EAEC were estimated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cellular uptake and localization of EAEC were detected by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess apoptosis and autophagy. The antitumor activity of EAEC was confirmed in a xenograft model. Finally, effects on the PERK pathway were verified using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. EAEC displayed absorption and fluorescence emission peaks at 660 nm and 678 nm, respectively. EAEC induced ROS production in CRC cells. Assessment of dark toxicity showed that treatment with EAEC alone induced little cytotoxicity in CRC or normal cells but that EAEC-PDT induced significant photocytotoxicity in CRC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After cellular uptake, EAEC was located in the mitochondria. Treatment with EAEC-PDT reduced xenograft tumor size. Further evaluation suggested that activation of the PERK pathway mediates these effects, as the apoptotic rate and autophagy flux increased markedly after EAEC-PDT. EAEC, a natural photosensitizer extracted from , displays potential utility in PDT of CRC by targeting the PERK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527114> ethanol oxidation by AdhA in low  environments.</a></h2><p> has a broad metabolic repertoire that facilitates its co-existence with different microbes.

Considering our interest in efficient catalytic systems based on porphyrin (Por) and phthalocyanine (Pc) coordination polymers, we report here the synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of a new Pc coordination polymer (coined hereafter as Cu4CuPcSPy). The new Pc material was obtained in excellent yield, from the reaction of H2PcSPy with an excess amount of copper(ii) .

The comparison between the homogeneous (CuPcSPy) and the heterogeneous (Cu4CuPcSPy) catalytic systems showed a better performance for the Cu4CuPcSPy material, that can be recovered by filtration and reused, maintaining its activity roughly unchanged during three catalytic cycles.

High ethanol concentration may impact negatively wine flavor and can be associated with harmful effects on human health. In this study, we investigated a microbiological approach to reduce wine ethanol concentration, using three non-Saccharomyces yeast strains (Metschnikowia pulcherrima, Torulaspora delbrueckii and Zygosaccharomyces bailii) in sequential fermentations with S. cerevisiae under different aeration conditions. At the same time, we evaluated the volatile profile of the resulting reduced alcohol Chardonnay wines. Results showed that the non-Saccharomyces yeasts tested were able to reduce wine ethanol concentration when  was provided. Compared to S. cerevisiae wines, ethanol reduction was 1.6% v/v, 0.9% v/v and 1.0% v/v for M. pulcherrima, T. delbrueckii and Z. bailii sequential fermentations, respectively. Under the conditions evaluated here, aeration did not affect acetic acid production for any of the non-Saccharomyces strains tested. Although aeration affected wine volatile profiles, this was depended on yeast strain. Thus, wines produced with M. pulcherrima under aeration of 0.05 volume of air per volume of culture per minute (VVM) showed excessive ethyl  content, while Z. bailli wines produced with 0.05 VVM aeration had increased concentrations of higher alcohols and volatile acids. Increased concentrations of these compounds over their sensory thresholds, are likely to impact negatively on wine sensory profile. Contrarily, all three non-Saccharomyces strains under 0.025 VVM aeration conditions produced wines with reduced ethanol concentration and acceptable chemical volatile profiles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, PW has not been known for treating respiratory inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present in vitro analysis confirmed that PW root extract (PWRE) exerts anti‑inflammatory effects in phorbol myristate ‑ or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α)‑stimulated human lung epithelial NCI‑H292 cells by attenuating the expression of interleukin (IL)‑8, IL‑6 and Mucin A5 (MUC5AC), which are closely associated with the pulmonary inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COPD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of PWRE on pulmonary inflammation induced by cigarette smoke (CS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment with PWRE significantly reduced the quantity of neutrophils and the levels of inflammatory molecules and toxic molecules, including tumor TNF‑α, IL‑6, IL‑8, monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1, neutrophil elastase and reactive  species, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice with CS‑ and LPS‑induced pulmonary inflammation. PWRE also attenuated the influx of inflammatory cells in the lung tissues. Furthermore, PWRE downregulated the activation of nuclear factor‑κB and the expression of phosphodiesterase 4 in the lung tissues.
