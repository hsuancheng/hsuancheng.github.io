In addition, microRNA microarray analysis determined which microRNAs were affected by dioscin. The mechanisms underlying the actions of dioscin against pancreatic cancer were elucidated in terms of Akt1 and other proteins related to aopoptosis.Dioscin markedly induced apoptosis and significantly suppressed the tumour growth of ASPC-1 and PANC-1 cell xenografts, in nude mice. Total of 107 microRNAs with differential changes were found, in which miR-149-3P targeted with Akt1 was markedly up-regulated by dioscin. Further studies showed that dioscin significantly down-regulated Akt1 levels, and thus induced cell apoptosis by increasing the levels of Bax, Apaf-1, cleaved caspase-3/9, cleaved PARP, suppressing Bcl-2 levels, and causing cytochrome c release. The effects of an inhibitor of miR-149-3P and of siRNA of testicular Akt1 suggested that dioscin showed excellent activity against pancreatic cancer via miR- 149-3P-mediated inhibition of Akt1 signalling pathway.Collectively, these findings confirmed the potent effects of dioscin against pancreatic cancer and also provided novel insights into the mechanisms of the compound as a potential candidate for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744854>Effect of citronella essential oil fumigation on sprout suppression and quality of potato tubers during storage.</a></h1><p>Effect of citronella essential oil (CEO) fumigation on sprout suppression and quality of potato tubers during storage was investigated. Potato tubers were treated under conditions of single-phase (30 μL L, 0-10 d) and dual-phase (30 μL L, 0-10 d; 30 μL L, 35-90 d) fumigation. Changes in germination rate, weight loss, starch, reducing sugar, gibberellins (GA), and α-solanine were measured. The results showed that CEO fumigation could control sprouting and improve the quality of potato tubers during storage compared to the non-treated tubers. CEO treatments inhibited the degradation of starch and the increase of reducing sugar content. The production of gibberellins (GA) was suppressed, and the levels of α-solanine in the skin and flesh of potato tubers were decreased by CEO fumigation. Dual-phase CEO fumigation had a better effect on sprout suppression than single-phase fumigation, and possesses potential for postharvest application.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Autophagic flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscope. Apoptosis was observed by flow cytometry. All proteins expression was examined by western blotting.Autophagy induction was demonstrated by examination of autophagic flux including autophagosomes accumulation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation of autophagosomes. Moreover, blocking autophagy with inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), enhanced -induced apoptosis, indicating the protective effect of autophagy in -treated CML cells. Further study suggested that -induced autophagy and cytotoxicity were accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibition. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) administration, a scavenger agent of ROS, could down-regulate -induced autophagy via reversion of mTOR pathway inhibition.These results indicate that  obviously generates ROS and this oxidative pressure not only produces cytotoxic effect on CML cells but also induces autophagy.

Both types of receptors are activated by oxysterols, cholesterol metabolites with oxidized side chains. Restricting the movement of the oxysterol side chain to certain orientations may have profound effects in the activity profile, however this has not been explored so far. In a first attempt to obtain analogues of natural ligands of DAF-12 and LXR with restricted side chain mobility we introduced a 16,22-oxygen bridge in 26-hydroxycholesterol, a cholestenoic acid and a dafachronic acid (5-7).  was used as starting material, the key step to obtain the 16,22 epoxy functionality was the one pot formation and reduction of a cyclic hemiketal via the oxocarbenium ion using sodium cyanoborohydride. All new compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry and assayed as ceDAF-12 or LXR ligands in transactivation cell-based assays. The dafachronic acid analogue 7 behaved as a ceDAF-12 agonist.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, (3β, 25R)‑spirost‑5‑en‑3‑oxyl (2‑((2((2‑aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)ethyl) carbamate (DGP), a new synthetic  derivative incorporating primary amine was used to investigate its anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Pretreatment with DGP resulted in significant inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and down-regulation of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. In addition, DGP decreased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The inhibitory effects of DGP on these inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells were regulated by NF-κB signaling through blocking p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB p65/DNA binding activity. DGP also blocked the phosphorylation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). The NF-κB inhibitor JSH-23 and JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased NO production and IL-6 release in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells, respectively. The overall results demonstrate that DGP has anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via inhibition of NF-κB and JNK activation, suggesting that DGP is a potential prophylactic agent in various neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2018.

Therefore, the laxative effects of five candidates derived from L. platyphylla:  (DG), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), adenosine (AD), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and uridine (UD) were investigated by examining the alteration of G protein α (Gα) expression, protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation and inositol triphosphate (IP3) concentration levels in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5‑HT; serotonin) receptor signaling pathway. Primary rat intestine smooth muscle cells (pRISMCs), intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)‑18 and B35 cells were cotreated with Lop and the five compounds in order to screen the candidates. AEtLP, prucalopride (PCP) and bisacodyl (BS) served as positive controls. In pRISMCs, Gα expression levels were recovered in the majority of candidate‑treated groups, whereas PKC phosphorylation recovery was observed only in the DG, 5‑HMF and AD treatment groups. In IEC‑18 cells, the AD treatment group mimicked the effects of PCP on PKC phosphorylation levels, whereas the DG, 5‑HMF, HPC and UD treatment groups mimicked the effects of AEtLP and BS. In B35 cells, a greater upregulation of PKC phosphorylation levels were observed in the UD treatment group compared with the PCP and BS treatment groups, whereas DG, 5‑HMF and AD treatment reduced the PKC phosphorylation levels to a greater extent than AEtLP treatment. However, effects similar to AEtLP, PCP and BS on Gα expression levels were not detected in any treatment groups in IEC‑18 and B35 cells. Furthermore, the level of IP3 was enhanced only in pRISMCs, in which all five candidates were effective, while the greatest concentration was observed in the UD treatment group. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that UD may be considered the compound with the greatest laxative activity, which may regulate the 5‑HT receptor signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29524841>Protective effect of dioscin against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via adjusting microRNA-140-5p-mediated myocardial oxidative stress.</a></h1><p>Clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. Thus, exploration of effective lead compounds against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is necessary. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of dioscin against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model of DOX- treated H9C2 cells and the in vivo models of DOX-treated rats and mice were used in this study. The results showed that discoin markedly increased H9C2 cell viability, decreased the levels of CK, LDH, and improved histopathological and electrocardio- gram changes in rats and mice to protect DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, dioscin significantly inhibited myocardial oxidative insult through adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px in vitro and in vivo. Our data also indicated that dioscin activated Nrf2 and Sirt2 signaling , and thereby affected the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a through decreasing miR-140-5p expression level. In addition, the level of intracellular ROS was significantly increased in H9C2 cells treated by DOX after miR-140-5p mimic transfection, as well as the down-regulated expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2, which were markedly reversed by dioscin. In conclusion, our data suggested that dioscin alleviated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through modulating miR-140-5p-mediated myocardial oxidative stress. This natural product should be developed as a new candidate to alleviate cardiotoxicity caused by DOX in the future.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, its effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) and associated molecular mechanisms remain to be further elucidated.In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of α-solanine against CRC cells in vitro and in vivo.Cell viability was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay; cell cycle was analyzed with a Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit; cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometer; cell migration and invasive ability was determined by Transwell assays; S100P protein expression was also analyzed by western blotting; lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA targeting the S100P gene.We demonstrated that α-solanine inhibited CRC cell (SW480, SW620 and HT-29) growth as well as migration and invasion, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, we observed that S100P expression was downregulated by α-solanine. Overexpression of S100P partially reversed the α-solanine-induced growth inhibition of CRC cells. Conversely, knockdown of S100P by lentiviral-mediated RNAi resulted in significantly promoting the α-solanine-induced growth inhibition.These findings suggest that α-solanine is a potential agent for the treatment of CRC, and the anti-tumor effect of α-solanine in the CRC cells may be mediated at least partly by the downregulation of S100P.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990575>Molecular mechanism and inhibitory targets of dioscin in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Dioscin has been known for its anti-cancer activity; however, its detailed molecular mechanisms have not been studied so far. Herein, we evaluated the anti-cancer activity of dioscin for proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells. Initially, dioscin was purified and identified from Polygonatum sibiricum by HPLC, MS, and NMR analysis, respectively. Dioscin inhibited the cell multiplication at IC of 8.34 μM, altered the cell morphology, arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase and led to considerable programmed cell death. Furthermore, it has efficiently promoted the mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway. The inhibition of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 proteins in these  abolished the dioscin induced apoptosis significantly; while dioscin inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, dioscin exposure led to enhanced intracellular ROS generation and the mRNA expression of JNK gene which emphasized their involvement in the apoptosis process in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous pharmacokinetics study showed that the oral bioavailability of PPI was very low, which suggested that certain amount of PPI might be metabolized in vivo. However, to date, information regarding the final  fates of PPI is very limited. In this study, metabolites of PPI and their pharmacokinetics in rats were investigated using UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS and LC-TQ-MS/MS. A total of seven putative metabolites, including six phase I and one phase II metabolites, were detected and identified with three exact structures by comparison with authentic standards for the first time. Oxidation, deglycosylation and glucuronidation were found to be the major  processes of the compound in rats. The pharmacokinetics of prosapogenin A, trillin and , three deglycosylation metabolites of PPI with definite anticancer effects, were further studied, which suggested that the metabolites underwent a prolonged absorption and slower elimination after intragastric administration of PPI at the dose of 500 mg/kg.

We previously demonstrated that , the major sapogenin contained in the Chinese yam, attenuated food allergy and augmented Th1 and Treg immune responses. In this study, we hypothesized that  may enhance the induction of Th1-like Treg cells in the gut of mice with food allergy. Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c mice were gavaged daily with  and received repeatedly intragastric ovalbumin challenges to induce intestinal allergic responses. The induction of Foxp3 Treg cells co-expressing Th1-type transcription factors, cytokines and chemokines in the intestine was examined, and the mRNA expression of the chemokines corresponding to Th1-like Treg cells was measured.  administration increased the number of Foxp3 Treg cells co-expressing Th1 markers, including CCR5, CXCR3, IFN-γ and T-bet in the intestine, and enhanced populations of Foxp3IFN-γ and Foxp3T-bet cells that expressed the regulatory cytokine IL-10 in the Peyer's patches.  also augmented the intestinal expression of CXCR3, CCL3, and CXCL10. Concordantly,  increased the number of CXCR3Foxp3IL-10 cells in the Peyer's patches.

Further significant difference was revealed in the latency time to detect the platform that is visible and it confirmed that, there were no noteworthy dissimilarity was observed in the visual and motor function ability. The result also suggests that, the activation of Nrf2 is the possible mechanism of neuroprotection of Proto against PD.As a concluding remark, the present study confirmed the neuroprotective role of Proto against PD both in in vitro and in vivo models.Copyright © 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Many patients with osteosarcoma always develop drug resistance to current chemotherapy regimens, which induces a poor prognosis. And cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported to possess the properties to self-renew and maintain the phenotype of tumor, which may lead to clinical treatment failure. Thus, it is an urgent task to develop several potentially useful therapeutic agents, which could target CSCs in osteosarcoma. This study aims to clarify the in vitro and in vivo anti-osteosarcoma effects of dioscin, the primary component derived from Discorea nipponica Makino, and its molecular mechanism of action. In this study, all the ten human osteosarcoma cell lines were sensitive to dioscin treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Dioscin inhibits proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest as well as apoptotic cell death in osteosarcoma cells. More importantly, oral administration of dioscin (60 mg/kg) showed significant therapeutic effect on osteosarcoma growth without obvious side effects in vivo. In addition, dioscin possesses the ability to suppress stem-cell-like phenotype of osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, dioscin inhibits osteosarcoma stem-cell-like properties and tumor growth through repression of Akt/GSK3/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, β-catenin expression in osteosarcoma patients was associated with clinical prognosis. Conclusively, the present study provides comprehensive evidence for the inhibition of dioscin on osteosarcoma stem-cell-like properties and tumor growth through repression of Akt/GSK3/β-catenin pathway, which suggests dioscin as a promising therapeutic regimen. And β-catenin may be a potential therapeutic target as well as a significant prognostic marker for osteosarcoma patients in clinic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28012380>Comparison and evaluation of antimuscarinic and anti-inflammatory effects of five Bulbus fritillariae species based on UPLC-Q/TOF integrated dual-luciferase reporter assay, PCA and ANN analysis.</a></h1><p>Many species of Bulbus fritillariae are used as traditional medicines for thousands of years; however, their application is not standardized. To clarify the differences and homologies, the antimuscarinic and anti-inflammatory effects of five BM species were firstly tested and compared at cellular level. With an integrated strategy combining UPLC-Q/TOF MS, PCA and ANN analysis, the active ingredients among 28 different chemical markers were predicted and identified. SB and QB extracts showed the best antimuscarinic effects and several steroidal alkaloids, such as solanidine, contributed to this effects. However, ZB was superior to reduce the inflammatory response. Another five components were responsible by decreasing the expression of NF-κB, including puqiedine, zhepeiresinol, 2-monopalmitin, N-demethylpuqietinone, and isoverticine. More novelty, a new cluster of five BM species based on active ingredients as potential quality markers was depicted to illustrate their functions. These results of the study could make a reference for the medicinal application of BM species in clinic; and the integrated strategy provided an effective method to obtain the quality markers from medical herbs, which was helpful for the quality control of traditional medicinal products.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The  at two dose levels, namely 100 and 200mgkg(-1), was intragastrically administrated once daily for 7-day period prior to the surgery. Then, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal thread for 90min. After 24h reperfusion, several diagnostic indicators were evaluated and all animals were sacrificed to harvest their brains and blood for subsequent biochemical analyses. The results indicated that  treatment significantly inhibited the death rate and improved the impaired neurological functions along with neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct size as compared with the rats exposed to I/R insult without agents administration. The increase in the number of apoptotic cells determined by TUNEL in the hippocampus CA1 and cortex was also apparently attenuated in the  treatment group, which was closely correlated with suppression of Caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition the elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in blood serum of the I/R treated rats were reduced almost to their normal level. Further results obtained from the Western blotting analysis revealed that the protein expression of IκBα in the injured brain was up-regulated, while the p65 subunit of NF-κB was down-regulated in nucleus after the treatment. Collectively, this neuroprotection of  against I/R injury may be attained through its anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and intervening the NF-κB signal pathway properties. Due to the satisfactory findings,  might be a powerful therapeutic agent to combat the similar disease in future clinic.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The SDH and COX expressions were decreased, the SOD content was decreased, the SDH and COX expressions were increased, and the SOD content was increased in the OA group (All P<0.05), while those indexes were reversed in the OA+Dgn+Sirtinol group and the Sirtinol+OA group (All P<0.05).  Conclusion: The SIRT1 signaling pathway and OA are closely related to changes in chondrocyte apoptosis, in which Dgn may play a protective role in anti-OA by activating SIRT1 signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis of chondrocytes and to increase chondrocyte mitochondrial oxidative stress capacity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27854258>Antiproliferative, Cytotoxic, and Apoptotic Activity of Steroidal Oximes in Cervicouterine Cell Lines.</a></h1><p>Steroidal sapogenins have shown antiproliferative effects against several tumor cell lines; and their effects on human cancer cells are currently under study. Changes in the functionality on the steroidal structure make it possible to modify the biological activity of compounds. Herein, we report the synthesis and in vitro antitumor activity of two steroidal oxime compounds on cervical cancer cells. These derivatives were synthesized from the steroidal sapogenin  in good yields. The in vitro assays show that the steroidal oximes show significant antiproliferative activity compared to the one observed for . Cell proliferation, cell death, and the cytotoxic effects were determined in both cervical cancer cells and human lymphocytes. The cancer cells showed apoptotic morphology and an increased presence of active caspase-3, providing the notion of a death pathway in the cell.

Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are needed for glioma therapy. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a bioactive constituent extracted from Paris polyphylla, was reported to have anti-tumor activity. However, the detailed mechanism for this activity remains unclear. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of PPI on glioma cells and its mechanisms in vitro. U251 cells were treated with various concentrations of PPI (2-9 μM) for 24 to 72 h. The inhibition of U251 cell proliferation by PPI was assessed by MTT assay. The effects on cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry with PI and annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining, and the cell mitochondrial membrane potential level was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy with JC-1 staining. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and JNK signal pathway proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. Results showed that PPI significantly inhibited the proliferation of U251 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. PPI induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, and it upregulated the expressions of Bax, cytochrome c, and p-JNK, but downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in U251 cells. Moreover, PPI provoked the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, apoptosis induced by the PPI was remarkably suppressed by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Our data provide evidence that PPI inhibits proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death in U251 cells. This effect may be associated with the JNK pathway. These results suggest that PPI is an activator of the JNK signaling pathway with a potential anti-glioma effect.© The Author 2017.

In addition to their probiotic characteristics, they can ferment a variety of substrates, such as cereals, roots, and tubers. Phytase producer lactic acid bacteria strains and their behavior during the fermentation process of yam-based food were studied. Leuconostoc lactis CCMA 0415, Lactobacillus plantarum CCMA 0744, and Lactobacillus fermentum CCMA 0745 were selected due to phytase production, pH reduction, and growth during 24 h of fermentation. Oxalate activity was not detected in all assays, suggesting its concentration was reduced due to the bleaching process. Among the selected strains, L. lactis CCMA 0415 appeared to be a promising strain in yam-based fermentations because it maintained a cell viability above 8 log CFU/mL and did not reduce  concentrations (around 8.0 μg/mL) after fermentation for 24 h, thereby, generating a potentially functional yam food. Furthermore, this strain promoted the decrease of pH value from 6.1 to 3.8 and produced 8.1 g/L lactic acid, at 6 h of fermentation. The L. lactis CCMA 0415 was reported as a starter culture in fermented products based on cereals, roots, and tubers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791676>Combined Effect of  Along with Ezetimibe or Atorvastatin on the Fate of Labelled Bile Acid and Cholesterol in Hypercholesterolemic Rats.</a></h1><p>We analyzed the effect of , administered with atorvastatin or ezetimibe, on the fate of ³H(G)-taurocholic acid or 26-C-cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic rats. Male Wistar rats received a hypercholesterolemic diet (HD), HD + atorvastatin (HD+ATV), HD + ezetimibe (HD+EZT), HD +  (HD+DG), HD+ATV+EZT, or HD+ATV+DG for 40 days. We also included a control normal group (ND). The labelled compounds were administered on day 30. The animals were placed in  cages for daily feces collection. At day 40 the rats were sacrificed. Lipid extracts from blood, liver, spinal cord, testicles, kidneys, epididymis, intestine, and feces were analyzed for radioactivity. Cholesterol activity was the highest in the liver in HD rats. DG diminished one half of this activity in HD+DG and HD+ATV+DG groups in comparison with the HD group. HD+ATV rats showed four to almost ten-fold cholesterol activity in the spinal cord compared with the ND or HD rats. Fecal elimination of neutral steroids was approximately two-fold higher in the HD+DG and HD+ATV+DG groups. Taurocholic acid activity was four to ten-fold higher in HD+DG intestine as compared to the other experimental groups. Taurocholic activity in the liver of HD and HD+DG groups was two and a half higher than in ND.

(DSG) possesses a variety of biological activities. The present study was designed to examine the effect of DSG on GD and to investigate the possible mechanism in C57BL/KsJ-Lep (db/+) mice. We found that DSG could remarkably ameliorated GD in pregnant db/+ mice, as reflected by the improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance, and the decrease of fasting blood glucose and insulin level and the increase of hepatic glycogen content. The results showed that DSG could inhibit oxidative stress in pregnant db/+ mice, as evidenced by decrease of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, increase of glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. DSG could also attenuate the abnormal changes of lipid profiles, including TC, TG and LDL, in pregnant db/+ mice. The increase of the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1) and its target genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), was inhibited by DSG in pregnant db/+ mice. Moreover, overexpression of SREBP-1 by LV-SREBP-1 injection could markedly inhibit the protective effect of DSG against disorder of glucose and lipid  and oxidative stress in GD mice. The data demonstrated that SREBP-1 may be of major target of DSG that mediated its anti-diabetic activities in GD. The data provide novel insights into the biological activities of DSG and pave way for the investigation of the anti-diabetic activities against GD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We found that Dios suppressed the synthesis of molecules that promote inflammation (M1 markers, such as NO, IL-6, and TNF-α) in rat microglia and BV-2 cells induced with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In contrast, Dios had no effects on the cellular production of anti-inflammatory factors (M2 markers, such as IL-10, IL-1Rα and CD206) in LPS and IL-4 treated microglia. Dios repressed IκB-α, ERK MAPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, but did not affect JNK in LPS-activated microglia. We also found that conditioned medium obtained from cultures of BV-2 cells incubated with Dios plus LPS was markedly less neurotoxic than conditioned medium obtained from cultures of BV-2 cells incubated with LPS alone. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Dios can selectively suppress the production/expression of pro-inflammatory M1 markers by activated microglia, without affecting M2 markers, and might provide neuroprotection by regulating microglial M1 polarization. Our results suggest that Dios can be used in treatment of various neuroinflammatory diseases mediated by microglia.Copyright © 2017.

However, the specific mechanism by which this is achieved is not clear. This study investigated the protective effects of  on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS Healthy adult male SD rats, body weight (b.w.) 250-280 g, were used to model ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and were administered  (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg b.w.) intragastrically for 4 consecutive weeks before surgery. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) was ligated to induce myocardial ischemia for 30 min and reperfusion for 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min while relevant indicators were detected. RESULTS Both 50 mg and 100 mg  oral administration increased left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and maximum changing rate of ventricular pressure (±dp/dtmax), decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and myocardial enzyme markers. TTC staining suggested that  reduced myocardial infarct size in the rat model. Pathological results showed that myocardial ischemia and inflammation were alleviated by . In addition, the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in serum, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in myocardium were significantly suppressed by  administration.  further inhibited the phosphorylation of transcription factor NF-κB and modulated the expression of downstream inflammatory cytokines by regulating the activation of p38-MAPK and JNK .

The rat myocardial I/R model was prepared by ligating the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery by 30 minutes and reperfusion by 120 minutes. Sham group was exposure to open chest without ligation. Low, medium, high dose PPI groups were injected with PPI 75, 150, 300 mg×kg×d in front of the film for 4 weeks; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was gastric infused in the I/R model group. After the end of reperfusion, the myocardial infarction area (IA) was determined by triphenyltetrazole (TTC) and Evans blue (EB) staining; the apoptosis of myocardial cells was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling stain (TUNEL); the expressions of apoptosis related protein (Bax, Bcl-2), and cytoplasmic and nucleus expressions of P65 in nuclear factor-ΚB (NF-ΚB) signal pathway were detected by Western Blot.Compared with the Sham group, the myocardial IA was significantly increased in the I/R model group, the apoptosis rate of myocardial cells was significantly increased, the expression of Bcl-2 was significantly decreased, and the expression of Bax was significantly increased, and the intranuclear transfer of P65 was significantly increased. Compared with the I/R model group, low, medium and high dose PPI pretreatment could significantly reduce the myocardial IA [(21.6±0.9)%, (14.3±1.6)%, (15.0±0.8)% vs. (29.6±1.4)%], the apoptosis rate of myocardial cells was significantly decreased [(38.6±1.9)%, (24.3±2.6)%, (26.3±2.8)% vs. (56.8±2.4)%], the protein expression of Bcl-2 was significantly increased, while the protein expression of Bax was significantly decreased (Bcl-2/GAPDH: 0.24±0.07, 0.36±0.02, 0.34±0.09 vs. 0.13±0.04; Bax/GAPDH: 0.39±0.10, 0.21±0.08, 0.23±0.06 vs. 0.53±0.12); and P65 nuclear transfer was significantly decreased after middle and high dose PPI pretreatment [nuclear P65/Histone 3: 0.49±0.09, 0.51±0.06 vs. 0.83±0.11; cytoplasmic P65/GAPDH: 0.31±0.03, 0.30±0.05 vs. 0.22±0.07], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in each index between the medium and high dose PPI groups (all P > 0.05).PPI alleviates myocardial I/R injury in rats via NF-ΚB signal pathway, and the PPI effect of 150 mg×kg×d is most especially significant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544548>Exploration in the cascade working mechanisms of liver injury induced by total saponins extracted from Rhizoma Dioscorea bulbifera.</a></h1><p>Rhizoma Dioscorea bulbifera, the tuber of Dioscorea bulbifera L., has been used to treat various diseases. However, the clinical application has been limited for its hepatotoxicity. In this study, we explored the cascade working mechanisms of time-dependent hepatotoxicity induced by total saponins extracted from Rhizoma Dioscorea bulbifera (TSRD). Animals were orally administered with TSRD for indicated time period. The adverse effects were determined by histopathology and biochemistry. Similar hepatic index was analyzed in L-O2 cells exposed to dioscin for different durations. We found that TSRD could initially cause cell damage and cholestasis in rats. With the treatment going on, oxidative stress injury and up-regulation of Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) were observed both in vitro and in vivo. Eventually, TSRD induced mitochondrial permeability results in apoptosis or necrosis. Taken together, we provided evidence for the time-dependent hepatotoxicity of TSRD and created a 3-step injury model to clarify its cascade working mechanisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we investigated the effects of dioscin (DSN) on human GBC and the potential mechanisms underlying these effects. The results showed that DSN significantly inhibited GBC cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, DSN induced GBC cell apoptosis via mitochondrial dependent apoptotic signalling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured, and ROS scavengers completely inhibited DSN-induced apoptosis and migration, indicating that ROS play an essential role in GBC progression. Western blot analysis showed that AKT activity was significantly downregulated after DSN treatment, and that inhibition/ectopic expression of AKT enhanced/abolished DSN-induced apoptosis but not migration. Furthermore, we confirmed the relationship between ROS and the PI3K/AKT pathway and found that DSN induced apoptosis by regulating ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling.

In the present study, the antitumor activity of PPI in prostate cancer (PC) cells was evaluated. At low doses, PPI decreased proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC cells. PPI decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), an enzyme that is critical for tumor metastasis. PPI also decreased the expression of Snail and vimentin, which are EMT-associated factors. Additionally, PPI suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity and AP-1 binding to the MMP7 and vimentin promoters. The results demonstrated that PPI downregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signaling‑related kinase (ERK), which is upstream modulator of AP-1. The results of the present study demonstrated that PPI may inhibit the cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/ERK axis, downregulate the expression of MMP7, vimentin, and Snail, and suppress tumor invasion and EMT. A PC xenograft mouse model was employed and the results revealed that PPI may decrease tumor growth and weight. Additionally, PPI may inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and CIP2A/PP2A/ERK signaling pathway in PPI-treated tumors. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that PPI may suppress the growth, invasion and EMT of PC cells via inhibition of CIP2A/PP2A/ERK signaling axis.

The effects of dioscin against human gastric carcinoma in vivo were accomplished by the xenografts of MGC-803 cells in BALB/c nude mice.AO/EB and DAPI staining, TEM, single cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry assays were used in cell experiments. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach, DNA and siRNA transfection experiments were carried out for mechanism investigation.In MGC-803 cells, dioscin caused DNA damage and mitochondrial change, induced ROS generation, Ca(2+) release and cell apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle at S phase. In vivo results showed that dioscin significantly suppressed the tumor growth of MGC-803 cell xenografts in nude mice. In addition, dioscin markedly inhibited cell migration, caused Cytochrome c release and adjusted mitochondrial signal pathway. Then, an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach was carried out and 121 differentially expressed proteins were found, in which five biomarkers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis and migration were evaluated. Dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of GALR-2 and RBM-3, and down-regulated CAP-1, Tribbles-2 and CliC-3. Furthermore, overexpressed DNA transfection of CAP-1 enhanced cell migration and invasion, which was decreased by dioscin. SiRNA to Tribbles-2 affected the protein levels of Bcl-2, Bax and MAPKs, suggesting that dioscin decreased Tribbles-2 level leading to cell apoptosis.Our works confirmed the activity of dioscin against gastric cancer. In addition, this work also provided that dioscin is a new potent candidate for treating gastric cancer in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Dioscin, an herbal steroidal saponin, exerts anti-tumor effects while the underlying mechanism is unclear. Using WB, FACS, and immunofluorescence methodologies, we found dioscin significantly activated the transcription and translation of Cx43 via the retinoid acid signaling pathway and simultaneously enhanced the transporting function of Cx43. Through stimulating Cx43, dioscin remarkably suppressed the migratory and invasive capacities of B16 cells, and notably decreased pluripotency markers of cancer stem cells and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in B16 cells and animal tumor tissues. Conversely, dioscin improved the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β), and the phagocytic capacity of tumor-associated macrophages by increasing M2-to-M1 phenotype transition. More strikingly, even in Cx43 functional deficient B16 and RAW264.7 cells, dioscin still dramatically reversed the aggravated tumor malignancy and reduced macrophage phagocytic activity. Two classical metastasis animal models were utilized in vivo and results showed that dioscin showed significant anti-metastatic effects, which is closely related to the expression of Cx43 either in in situ tumor or metastatic lung nodes. In conclusion, dioscin targets Cx43 to suppress the tumor cell malignancy and activate macrophage sensitivity, thereby targeting melanoma microenvironment.© 2017 UICC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29807357>Crosstalk of NF-κB/P65 and LncRNA HOTAIR-Mediated Repression of MUC1 Expression Contribute to Synergistic Inhibition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Polyphyllin 1-Enzalutamide Combination Treatment.</a></h1><p>Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the steroidal saponins in Paris polyphylla, reportedly exhibits antitumor effects. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PPI, particularly in enhancing the effect of the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide in controlling castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has not been explored.Cell viability and cell cycle distribution were measured using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression was measured by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein expression levels of MUC1, p65, and p50. Silencing of HOTAIR was evaluated using the siRNA procedure. The promoter activity of the MUC1 gene was determined using Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. Exogenous expression of HOTAIR, p65, and MUC1 was conducted by transient transfection assay. A xenograft tumor model in nude mice was used to further evaluate the effect of the combination of PPI and enzalutamide in vivo.We showed that PPI significantly inhibited growth and induced cell cycle arrest in CRPC cells. PPI also decreased p65 and MUC1 protein expression and reduced HOTAIR expression. Exogenously expressed p65 resisted the PPI-inhibited expression of HOTAIR, whereas silenced HOTAIR reduced MUC1 protein but exerted no effect on the expression of p65 and p50 proteins. Conversely, exogenously expressed HOTAIR resisted the PPI-inhibited MUC1 protein expression, and excessive expression of MUC1 antagonized the PPI-inhibited cell growth. Notably, PPI combined with enzalutamide exerted a synergistic effect. Consistent with this finding, PPI inhibited tumor growth, HOTAIR expression, as well as p65 and MUC1 protein expressions in vivo.Our results indicate that PPI inhibits the growth of CRPC cells by inhibiting p65 protein and concomitantly reducing HOTAIR expression, thereby suppressing MUC1 gene expression. The novel regulatory interaction of p65 and HOTAIR converge in the inhibition of MUC1 expression and overall PPI response. The combination of PPI and enzalutamide exhibits synergy. This study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the synergistic inhibitory effect of PPI and enzalutamide on the growth of CRPC cells.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The objective of this study is to investigate the synergistic mechanisms of polyphyllin VII (PVII) and formosanin C (FC) in lung cancer.The combination of FC and PVII influenced on the apoptosis, autophagy, and the relative signalling  were analysed in lung cancer cells.The combination of FC and PVII demonstrated a concentration- dependent growth inhibition in human lung cancer cells. The combination index (CI) obtained from four lung cancer cells was smaller than 1. This synergistic antitumour effect was based on the increase of their single proapoptotic effect but inhibiting FC-induced autophagy in NCI-H460 cells. FC and PVII activated proapoptotic elements like cleaved-caspase-3, -8, and -9 to induce Beclin1 cleaved into Beclin1-C which suppressed FC-triggered autophagy and enhanced apoptosis.Formosanin C and PVII showed a synergistic antitumour effect on lung cancer cells. The findings would provide the foundation for the use of combination drugs in the future.© 2018 The Authors.

The previous studies demonstrated that Polyphyllin D, the main constituent of Paris polyphylla, a traditional Chinese medicine, exerts an anti-tumor effect on many tumors. However, its effects against neuroblastomas are unclear.We examined the anti-tumor effect of polyphyllin D in human neuroblastoma using IMR-32 and LA-N-2 cells, which exhibit MYCN gene amplification, and NB-69 cells, which do not exhibit MYCN gene amplification.All cell lines showed reduced cell viability in response to polyphyllin D treatment. No caspase-3/-7, -8, and -9 activity was observed in IMR-32 and LA-N-2 cells treated with polyphyllin D. In contrast, activation of caspase-3/-7, and -8 activity was observed in NB-69 cells. When polyphyllin D and specific inhibitors of RIPK3 involved in necroptosis were added to IMR-32 and LA-N-2 cell lines, polyphyllin D-induced cell death was inhibited.Together, this indicates that the underlying mechanism of polyphyllin D-induced cell death in NB-69 cells is apoptosis, whereas the cell death of IMR-32 and LA-N-2 cells occurs by necroptosis. We continue research on this topic and look forward the discovery of a new therapeutic agent for neuroblastoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317992>Dioscin alleviates dimethylnitrosamine-induced acute liver injury through regulating apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation.</a></h1><p>In our previous study, the effects of dioscin against alcohol-, carbon tetrachloride- and acetaminophen-induced liver damage have been found. However, the activity of it against dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced acute liver injury remained unknown. In the present study, dioscin markedly decreased serum ALT and AST levels, significantly increased the levels of SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and decreased the levels of MDA, iNOS and NO. Mechanism study showed that dioscin significantly decreased the expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IκBα, p50 and p65 through regulating TLR4/MyD88 pathway to rehabilitate inflammation. In addition, dioscin markedly up-regulated the expression levels of SIRT1, HO-1, NQO1, GST and GCLM through increasing nuclear translocation of Nrf2 against oxidative stress. Furthermore, dioscin significantly decreased the expression levels of FasL, Fas, p53, Bak, Caspase-3/9, and upregulated Bcl-2 level through decreasing IRF9 level against apoptosis. In conclusion, dioscin showed protective effect against DMN-induced acute liver injury via ameliorating apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation, which should be developed as a new candidate for the treatment of acute liver injury in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the effects of dioscin against human cervical carcinoma HeLa and SiHa cells were further confirmed, and the possible mechanism(s) were investigated. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay and DAPI staining were used to detect the cellular morphology. Flow cytometry was used to assay cell apoptosis, ROS and Ca(2+) levels. Single cell gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence assays were used to test DNA damage and cytochrome C release. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited cell proliferation and caused DNA damage in HeLa and SiHa cells. The mechanistic investigation showed that dioscin caused the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. In addition, dioscin significantly up-regulated the protein levels of Bak, Bax, Bid, p53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and down-regulated the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Our work thus demonstrated that dioscin notably induces apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells through adjusting ROS-mediated DNA damage and the mitochondrial signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317372>Dioscin protects against ANIT-induced cholestasis via regulating Oatps, Mrp2 and Bsep expression in rats.</a></h1><p>Alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) is a toxicant that is widely used in rodents to model human intrahepatic cholestasis. The aim of the study is to investigate whether effects of dioscin on ANIT-induced cholestasis are related to changes in expression of hepatic transporters in rats. Effects of dioscin on cholestasis were examined by histology and biochemical marker levels. The functional changes of hepatic transporters were determined by in vitro, in situ and in vivo. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to assess the expression of hepatic transporters in cholestatic rats. Dioscin administration could ameliorate cholestasis, as evidenced by reduced biochemical markers as well as improved liver pathology. The uptakes of organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) substrates were altered in liver uptake index in vivo, perfused rat liver in situ and isolated rat hepatocytes in vitro in cholestasis rats. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis indicated co-treatment of ANIT with dioscin prevented the adaptive down-regulation of Oatp1a1, 1b2, and prompted the up-regulation of Oatp1a4, multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 2 and bile salt export pump (Bsep). In addition, concerted effects on Mrp2 and Bsep occurred through up-regulation of small heterodimer partner by activating farnesoid X receptor.

There are few effective drugs that can delay the progression of this disease; thus, patients with silicosis are usually only offered supportive care. Dioscin, a steroidal saponin, exhibits many biological activities and health benefits including its protective effects against hepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of dioscin on silicosis is unknown.We employed experimental mouse mode of silicosis. Different doses of dioscin were gavaged to the animals 1 day after crystalline silica instillation to see the effect of dioscin on crystalline silica induced pulmonary fibrosis. Also, we used RAW264.7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines to explore dioscin effects on macrophages and fibroblasts. Dioscin was also oral treatment but 10 days after crystalline silica instillation to see its effect on established pulmonary fibrosis.Dioscin treatment reduced pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. It also reduced the recruitment of fibrocytes, protected epithelial cells from crystalline silica injury, inhibited transforming growth factor beta/Smad3 signaling and fibroblast activation. Together, these effects delayed the progression of crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism by which dioscin treatment alleviated CS-induced inflammation appeared to be via the reduction of macrophage, B lymphocyte, and T lymphocte infiltration into lung. Dioscin inhibits macrophages and fibroblasts from secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and may also function as a modulator of T helper cells responses, concurrent with attenuated phosphorylation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway. Also, dioscin could block the phosphorylation of Smad3 in fibroblast. Oral treatment of dioscin could also effectively postpone the progression of established silicosis.Oral treatment dioscin delays crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis and exerts pulmonary protective effects in mice. Dioscin may be a novel and potent candidate for protection against crystalline silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28161815>Next-generation sequencing of representational difference analysis products for identification of genes involved in  biosynthesis in fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum).</a></h1><p>Representational difference analysis of cDNA was performed and differential products were sequenced and annotated. Candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of  in fenugreek were identified. Detailed mechanism of  synthesis was proposed. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) is a valuable medicinal and crop plant. It belongs to Fabaceae family and has a unique potential to synthesize valuable steroidal saponins, e.g., . Elicitation (methyl jasmonate) and precursor feeding (cholesterol and squalene) were used to enhance the content of sterols and steroidal sapogenins in in vitro grown plants for representational difference analysis of cDNA (cDNA-RDA). To identify candidate genes involved in  biosynthesis, differential, factor-specific libraries were subject to the next-generation sequencing. Approximately 9.9 million reads were obtained, trimmed, and assembled into 31,491 unigenes with an average length of 291 bp. Then, functional annotation and gene ontogeny enrichment analysis was performed by aligning all-unigenes with public databases. Within the transcripts related to sterol and steroidal saponin biosynthesis, we discovered novel candidate genes of  biosynthesis and validated their expression using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Based on these findings, we supported the idea that  is biosynthesized from cycloartenol via cholesterol. This is the first report on the next-generation sequencing of cDNA-RDA products. Analysis of the transcriptomes enriched in low copy sequences contributed substantially to our understanding of the biochemical  of steroid synthesis in fenugreek.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29590661>Protodioscin Induces Apoptosis Through ROS-Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress via the JNK/p38 Activation Pathways in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.</a></h1><p>Protodioscin (PD) is a steroidal saponin with anti-cancer effects on a number of cancer cells, but the anti-tumor effects and mechanism of action of PD on human cervical cancer cells is unclear.We determined cell viability using the MTT assay. Cell death, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were measured on a flow cytometry. Caspase activation, ER stress, and MMP-dependent apoptosis proteins in cervical cancer cells in response to PD were determined by Western blot analysis. The ability of ATF4 binding to ChIP promoter was measured using the ChIP assay.We demonstrated that PD inhibits cell viability, causes a loss of mitochondrial function, and induces apoptosis, as evidenced by up-regulation of caspase-8, -3, -9, -PARP, and Bax activation, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. PD was shown to induce ROS and the ER stress pathway, including GRP78, p-eIF-2α, ATF4, and CHOP. Pre-treatment with NAC, a ROS production inhibitor, significantly reduced ER stress and apoptosis-related proteins induced by PD. Transfection of GRP78/CHOP-siRNA effectively inhibited PD-induced ER stress-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with PD significantly increased p38 and JNK activation. Co-administration of a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580) abolished cell death and ER stress effects during PD treatment. In addition, PD induced the expression of nuclear ATF4 and CHOP, as well as the binding ability of ATF4 to the CHOP promoter.Our results suggest that PD is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of human cervical cancer.© 2018 The Author(s).

Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of dioscin against human colon cancer cells and evaluated the molecular mechanism involved in this process. The cell cytotoxicity was studied by the MTT assay and BrdU incorporation. The proapoptotic mechanism of dioscin was characterized by flow cytometry analysis. A western blot and an immunofluorescence staining were used to investigate how dioscin induces apoptosis in vitro. In our study, dioscin could significantly inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Dioscin induces apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, promoting the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bax translocation to the mitochondria, cytochrome C release to cytosol, activations of caspase-9/3, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis. Dioscin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by sustained phosphorylation of JNK, p38-MAPK. N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a scavenger of ROS, significantly reversed dioscin-induced cell death and activation of JNK and p38. Collectively, the data indicate that the induction of apoptosis by dioscin is mediated through ROS proteins, which are critical upstream signals for JNK/p38-MAPK activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27496582>Effect of fenugreek on hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetes and prediabetes: A meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Fenugreek is a widely used herb for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) but the effects in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetes and prediabetes.PubMed, EMBASE, web of science, Chinese Biomedical Literature database (CBM), the Cochrane library, China Doctor Dissertations Full-text Database (CDFD), Wan Fang medical database, China Proceedings of Conference Full-text Database (CPCD), China national knowledge internet (CNKI) and China Master's Theses Full-text Database (CMFD) were searched to find the available literatures. RCTs with regard to the efficacy and safety of fenugreek on prediabetes or DM were included. The data of fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial 2h blood glucose (2hBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) were extracted to appraise the net change with fixed or randomized effect model.A total of 10 articles (12 studies) were included in the analysis. Pooled results showed fenugreek significantly decreased the levels of FBG (MD -0.84mmol/L; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.31; p=0.002), 2hBG (MD -1.30mmol/L; 95% CI -1.78 to -0.83; p<0.0001), HbA1c (MD -1.16; 95% CI -1.23 to -1.09; p<0.00001) and TC (MD -0.30mmol/L; 95% CI-0.56 to -0.03; p=0.03). In spite of the reductive trends in the TG or LDL-c levels and incremental trends of HDL-c, these results were not statistically significant or need further verification for fenugreek in the treatment of DM and prediabetes. Some studies were of low quality. No liver and kidney toxicity were found in all included studies, and the main side effects were gastrointestinal discomfort.The results suggest fenugreek has the hypoglycaemic and TC-lowering efficacy; however, the effects on TG, LDL-c and HDL-c need further confirmations.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Beside the established utilization as immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic, progestational, diuretic, sedative, anabolic and contraceptive agents, recent applications of steroid compounds include the treatment of some forms of cancer, osteoporosis, HIV infections and treatment of declared AIDS. Steroids isolated are often available in minute amounts. So biotransformation of natural products provides a powerful means in solving supply problems in clinical trials and marketing of the drug for obtaining natural products in bulk amounts. If the structure is complex, it is often an impossible task to isolate enough of the natural products for clinical trials. The microbial biotransformation of steroids yielded several novel metabolites, exhibiting different activities. The metabolites produced from pregnenolone acetate by Cunning hamella elegans and Rhizopus stolonifer were screened against tyrosinase and cholinesterase showed significant inhibitory activities than the parent compound.  and its transformed sarsasapogenin were screened for their acetyl cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase inhibitory activities.

However, its effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory liver injury remains unknown. In the present work, liver injury in mice and rats was induced by LPS, and dioscin was intragastrically administered for 7days. In vitro, the AML-12 cells and HepG-2 cells were treated with LPS after dioscin treatment. The results showed that dioscin not only markedly reduced serum ALT, AST levels and relative liver weights, but also restored cell injury caused by LPS. In mechanism study, dioscin significantly attenuated inflammation through down-regulating the levels of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (p-IKK), phosphorylated inhibitor of nuclear factor κB alpha (p-IκBα), phosphorylated nuclear factor κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65), high-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB-1), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TLR4 overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly decreased levels of MyD88, IRAK1, TRAF6, p-IKK, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB p65 and HMGB-1. Suppression of MyD88 by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of IRAK1, TRAF6, p-IKK, p-IκBα, p-NF-κB p65, HMGB-1, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Our results suggested that dioscin exhibited protective effect against LPS-induced liver injury via altering TLR4/MyD88 pathway, which should be developed as one potent candidate for the treatment of acute inflammatory liver injury in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We found that in Sprague-Dawley rats with traumatic SCI, the expressions of autophagy marker Light Chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin1 were decreased with concomitant accumulation of autophagy substrate protein p62 and ubiquitinated proteins, indicating an impaired autophagic activity. DG treatment, however, significantly attenuated p62 expression and upregulated the Rheb/mTOR signaling pathway (evidenced as Ras homolog enriched in brain) due to the downregulation of miR-155-3p.

Hoechst H33258 staining and FACS assay indicated that the combination of PSII and CUR induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot and cytokine antibody microarray suggested that the combination activated death receptors such as DR6, CD40/CD40L, FasL and TNF-α to induce cancer cells apoptosis, and up-regulated IGFBP-1 leading to inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway and increase of p21 and p27, which therefore induced a G2 phase arrest in NCI-H446 cells. Meanwhile, the combination suppressed PCNA and NF-κB pathway in 4 kinds of lung cancer cells. They activated the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, and inhibited PI3K in NCI-H460 and NCI-H446 cells, enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK in NCI-H1299 cells, and increased the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, and suppressed PI3K in NCI-H520 cells.PSII combined with CUR had a synergistic anti-cancer effect on lung cancer cells.

However, the pharmacological data are insufficient and the mechanisms have not been reported. Thus, this study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of dioscin against NAFLD. The primary cultured hepatocytes, AML-12 and HepG-2 cells were treated with palmic acid (PA) after dioscin treatment. The mice and rats were induced by high fat diet to establish the in vivo models of NAFLD. Dioscin obviously alleviated liver lipid accumulation symptoms and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters in vitro and in vivo. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated lipid  via adjusting SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway to regulate the expression levels of SREBP-1c, CPT, FAS, SCD, FoxO1 and ATGL. In addition, suppression of SIRT1 by Nicotinamide or abrogation of AMPK by Compound C eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on lipid .

We cultured purified gastric CAFs obtained from fresh human gastric cancer tissue and examined the effect of Polyphyllin I on CAF proliferation using a colorimetric viability assay. In addition, we established a nude mouse xenograft model to examine the effect of Polyphyllin I administration on tumorigenesis. Using Western analysis, we quantified protein expression of the CAF-derived cytokines fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP), secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), hepatocyte growth factor tenascin-C (TNC), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in both in vitro and in vivo models. We found that Polyphyllin I inhibits the proliferation of CAFs in a concentration-dependent manner. Following treatment with 2 μg/ml PPI for 24 h in vitro, the expression of FAP, SDF-1 and HGF protein in CAFs was significantly lower than that in the control group, but there was no significant difference in SPARC and TNC protein expression between the two groups. In the nude mouse xenograft model, the tumor inhibition rate was 45.5% when PPI was administered early and 29.4% with administration in the third week. The expression of FAP and HGF in the xenografts was significantly decreased, while the expression of SPARC, SDF-1, and TNC was largely unaltered. Altogether, these data suggest that Polyphyllin I can inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by downregulating the expression of FAP and HGF in CAFs in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Our results established that the anchor moiety is essential, and we identified a preference for , as evidenced by 17MD. Studies in primary neurons and mouse brain mitochondria also identified 17MD as exhibiting activity on neuritic outgrowth and the state 3 oxidative rate of glutamate while preserving the coupling capacity of the mitochondria. Significantly, our studies demonstrated that the integrated bivalent structure is essential to the observed biological activities. Further studies employing bivalent compounds as probes in a model membrane also revealed the influence of the anchor moiety on how they interact with the membrane. Collectively, our results suggest  to be an optimal anchor moiety, providing bivalent compounds with promising pharmacology that have potential applications for Alzheimer's disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120655>Polyphyllin I Inhibits Propionibacterium acnes-Induced Inflammation In Vitro.</a></h1><p>Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) has been implicated in the progression of acne inflammation. Because current acne medications have various side effects, it is necessary to explore alternative medications possessing anti-inflammatory activity against P. acnes. We investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphyllin I (PPI) on P. acnes-induced inflammation in vitro. In this study, we examined the effects of PPI on the production of inflammatory cytokines in HaCaT keratinocytes treated with heat-killed P. acnes. These treated HaCaT keratinocytes showed increased expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and production of inflammatory cytokines. PPI significantly suppressed the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and the expression of TLR2 in P. acnes-treated cells. Moreover, we studied the influence of PPI on the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling  in P. acnes-treated keratinocytes. PPI diminished the activation of NF-κB. Phosphorylated p38 levels were markedly increased after treatment with heat-killed P. acnes but were decreased after treatment with PPI, while the effect of PPI on ERK phosphorylation was not significant. Heat-killed P. acnes and PPI did not have any effect on JNK phosphorylation. Furthermore, we confirmed that NF-κB p65 inhibitor (BAY11-7082), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), and PPI blocked the expression of IL-8 in heat-killed P. acnes-treated cells. These results demonstrated that PPI has potential for development as a treatment for acne inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27343977>Potential neuroprotection of protodioscin against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats through intervening inflammation and apoptosis.</a></h1><p>The aim of the current research is to investigate the cerebral-protection of protodioscin on a transient cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model and to explore its possible underlying mechanisms. The rats were preconditioned with protodioscin at the doses of 25 and 50mgkg(-1) prior to surgery. Then the animals were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using an intraluminal method by inserting a thread (90min surgery). After the blood flow was restored in 24h via withdrawing the thread, some representative indicators for the cerebral injury were evaluated by various methods including TTC-staining, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. As compared with the operated rats without drug intervening, treatment with protodioscin apparently lowered the death rate and improved motor coordination abilities through reducing the deficit scores and cerebral infarct volume. What's more, an apparent decrease in neuron apoptosis detected in hippocampus CA1 and cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere might attribute to alleviate the increase in Caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, concentrations of several main pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in the serum were also significantly suppressed. Finally, the NF-κB and IκBa protein expressions in the cytoplasm of right injured brain were remarkably up-regulated, while NF-κB in nucleus was down-regulated. Therefore, these observed findings demonstrated that protodioscin appeared to reveal potential neuroprotection against the I/R injury due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis properties. This therapeutic effect was probably mediated by the inactivation of NF-κB signal .Copyright © 2016.

The finding of medicine be of benefit to joint is an important topic for osteoarthritis prevention and treatment. The present study was designed to explore the therapeutic effects and possible underlying mechanism of dioscin, a natural steroidal saponin, on osteoarthritis.OA models were created via intra-joint injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) in rats. After the administration of dioscin, the effects of dioscin were estimated with western blotting, qRT-PCR and histologic staining.The results showed that dioscin exerted cartilage and extracelluar matrix (ECM) protective effects via suppressing ER-stress, oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation. More significantly, it also ameliorated the progress of OA via inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway and up-regulating PPAR-γ expression.Our work showed the good protective effects of dioscin on MIA-induced OA for the first time.

Given the poor solubility and stability of Dioscin, we proposed a hypothesis that Dioscin's metabolite(s) are the active substance(s) in vivo to contribute to the reducing effects on serum uric acid levels.The aim of this study is to identify the active metabolite(s) of Dioscin in vivo and to explore the mechanism of its antihyperuricemic activity.After oral administration of Dioscin in potassium oxonate (PO) induced hyperuricemia rats and adenine-PO induced hyperuricemia mice models, serum uric acid and creatinine levels, clearance of uric acid and creatinine, fractional excretion of uric acid, and renal pathological lesions were determined were used to evaluate the antihyperuricemic effects. Renal glucose transporter-9 (GLUT-9) and organic anion transporter-1 (OAT-1) expressions were analyzed by western blotting method. Renal uric acid excretion was evaluated using stably urate transporter-1 (URAT-1) transfected human epithelial kidney cell line. Intestinal uric acid excretion was evaluated by measuring the transcellular transport of uric acid in HCT116 cells.In hyperuricemia rats, both 25 and 50mg/kg of oral Dioscin decreased serum uric acid levels over 4h. In the hyperuricemia mice, two weeks treatment of Dioscin significantly decreased serum uric acid and creatinine levels, increased clearance of uric acid and creatinine, increased fractional excretion of uric acid, and reduced renal pathological lesions caused by hyperuricemia. In addition, renal GLUT -9 was significantly down-regulated and OAT-1 was up-regulated in Dioscin treated hyperuricemia mice. Dioscin's metabolite Tigogenin significantly inhibited uric acid re-absorption via URAT1 from 10 to 100μM.  and Tigogenin increased uric acid excretion via ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2).Decreasing effect of Dioscin on serum uric acid level and enhancing effect on urate excretion were confirmed in hyperuricemia animal models. Tigogenin, a metabolite of Dioscin, was identified as an active substance with antihyperuricemic activity in vivo, through inhibition of URAT1 and promotion of ABCG2.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the present work, the activity and mechanism of dioscin, a natural product, against PCa were investigated. The results showed that dioscin markedly inhibited cell viability, colony formation, motility and induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. Moreover, dioscin disrupted the formation of PC3 cell-derived mammospheres and reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) level and the CD133/CD44 cells, indicating that dioscin had a potent inhibitory activity on prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). In vivo results also showed that dioscin significantly suppressed the tumor growth of PC3 cell xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, mechanism investigation showed that dioscin markedly upregulated ERβ expression level, subsequently increased prolyl hydroxylase 2 level, decreased the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor A and BMI-1, and thus induced cell apoptosis by regulating the expression levels of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 family proteins. In addition, transfection experiment of ERβ-siRNA further indicated that diosicn showed excellent activity against PCa in vitro and in vivo by increasing ERβ expression level. The co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results further suggested that dioscin promoted the interaction of c-ABL and ERβ, but did not change c-ABL expression. Moreover, the molecular docking assay showed that dioscin processed powerful affinity toward to ERβ mainly through the strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects, and the actions of dioscin on ERβ activation and tumor cells inhibition were significantly weakened in the mutational (Phe-336, Phe-468) PC3 cells. Collectively, these findings proved that dioscin exerted efficient anti-PCa activity via activation of ERβ, which should be developed as an efficient candidate in clinical for treating this cancer in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29064406>-Rich Yam Extract Enhances Cognitive Function: A Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Study of Healthy Adults.</a></h1><p>, a yam-derived compound, was found to facilitate the repair of axonal atrophy and synaptic degeneration and improve memory dysfunction in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

We hypothesized that , either isolated or in an extract, may represent a new category of cognitive enhancers with essential activities that morphologically and functionally reinforce neuronal . This study aimed to investigate the effects of a -rich yam extract on cognitive enhancement in healthy volunteers. For this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 28 healthy volunteers (age: 20-81 years) were recruited from Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and was randomly assigned to receive either a yam extract or placebo. Preliminary functional animal experiments indicated that an oil solvent mediated the most efficient distribution of  into the blood and brain after oral administration, and was a critical factor in the cognitive benefits. Therefore, test samples (placebo and yam extract) were prepared with olive oil and formulated as soft capsules. The intake period was 12 weeks, and a 6-week washout period separated the two crossover intake periods. The Japanese version of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) test was used for neurocognitive assessment, and the adverse effects were monitored through blood testing. -rich yam extract consumption for 12 weeks yielded significant increases in total RBANS score. Among the 12 individual standard cognitive subtests, -rich yam extract use significantly improved the semantic fluency. No adverse effects were reported.

The composition of furostanol glycosides has been characterized, and the dynamics of the accumulation of individual glycosides during lengthy subcultivation of cells maintained in flasks or in a barbotage bioreactor has been analyzed. A positive correlation between the growth and accumulation of substances that belonged to the class of furostanol glycosides has been demonstrated for cultured dioscorea cells, whereas the content of some of the individual glycosides varied considerably between the lines of the strain, cultures maintained under different conditions, and even between cells in different phases of the growth cycle. The increased content of (25R)-forms of the glycosides (protodioscin and deltoside) was correlated with a decrease in the cellular growth rate, whereas an increase in culture growth intensity occurred concomitantly to an increase of the amount of (25S)-isomers. This may be indicative of the specific stimulatory effect of (25S)-glycosides, but not the (25R)-forms, on cell proliferation in vitro. Thus, the concentration of (25S)-forms may increase due to the autoselection of cells capable of intensive division during prolonged cultivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327651>Inhibition of cathepsin S confers sensitivity to methyl protodioscin in oral cancer cells via activation of p38 MAPK/JNK signaling .</a></h1><p>Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Approximately 90% of oral cancers are subtyped to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Despite advances in diagnostic techniques and improvement in treatment modalities, the prognosis remains poor. Therefore, an effective chemotherapy mechanism that enhances tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutics is urgently needed. Methyl protodioscin (MP) is a furostanol bisglycoside with a wide range of beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The aim of the present study was to determine the antitumor activity of MP on OSCC and its underlying mechanisms. Our results show that treatment of OSCC cells with MP potently inhibited cell viability. Moreover, MP leading to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, which subsequently activates caspase-3, -8, -9 and PARP to induce cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that MP induces a robust autophagy in OSCC cells. The results indicate cathepsin S (CTSS) is involved in MP-induced apoptosis and autophagy by modulation of p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 . These findings may provide rationale to combine MP with CTSS blockade for the effective treatment of OSCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924509>Inhibitory effect of  on experimentally induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the effect of , a natural sapogenin possessing various pharmacological activities, on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in rats and the possible mechanisms. BPH was established in the castrated rats by subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate. Animals were randomly divided into four groups (n=10 each): model group (0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); positive control group (3 mg/kg finasteride); two  groups (50 and 100 mg/kg). The drugs were intragastricaly given in each group for consecutive 3 weeks. Another 10 rats with no testicles cut off served as negative controls and they were subcutaneously injected with 0.1 mL olive oil per day and then treated with 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose. After 3-week administration, the prostate index and serum PSA level were determined, and histopathological examination was carried out. The levels of MDA, SOD and GPx in prostates were also measured. Additionally, the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and p53 was examined using Western blotting. The results showed that the prostate index and serum PSA level were significantly decreased, and the pathological changes of the prostate gland were greatly improved in  groups as compared with the model group. Elevated activities of SOD and GPx, and reduced MDA level were also observed in -treated rats. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2 in prostates was down-regulated, whereas that of Bax and p53 was up-regulated in -treated rats. These results indicated that  was effective in inhibiting testosterone propionate-induced prostate enlargement and may be a candidate agent for the treatment of BPH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27307258>Two Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenases Catalyze Early Hydroxylation Steps in the Potato Steroid Glycoalkaloid Biosynthetic Pathway.</a></h1><p>α-Solanine and α-chaconine, steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) found in potato (Solanum tuberosum), are among the best-known secondary metabolites in food crops. At low concentrations in potato tubers, SGAs are distasteful; however, at high concentrations, SGAs are harmful to humans and animals. Here, we show that POTATO GLYCOALKALOID BIOSYNTHESIS1 (PGA1) and PGA2, two genes that encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP72A208 and CYP72A188), are involved in the SGA biosynthetic pathway, respectively. The knockdown plants of either PGA1 or PGA2 contained very little SGA, yet vegetative growth and tuber production were not affected. Analyzing metabolites that accumulated in the plants and produced by in vitro enzyme assays revealed that PGA1 and PGA2 catalyzed the 26- and 22-hydroxylation steps, respectively, in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. The PGA-knockdown plants had two unique phenotypic characteristics: The plants were sterile and tubers of these knockdown plants did not sprout during storage. Functional analyses of PGA1 and PGA2 have provided clues for controlling both potato glycoalkaloid biosynthesis and tuber sprouting, two traits that can significantly impact potato breeding and the industry.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of protodioscin against Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis rats. Rats randomly divided into model groups were injected with CFA, companied with different dose of protodioscin (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight). The histology, changes in biochemical parameters and inflammatory cytokines expression were detected for anti-inflammation effect evaluation of protodioscin. CFA treatment induced arthritic rats with swelling paw, ankle inflammation, and area of lymphocyte infiltration, upregulated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, cyclo-oxygenase 2, and IL-6 as well as prostaglandin E2), articular elastase, myeloperoxidase, lipid peroxidase and nitrite oxide levels, downregulated glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In contrast, protodioscin ameliorated all the changes induced by CFA in rats, suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect of protodioscin.

However, it shows low oral bioavailability due to poor aqueous solubility and strong hydrophobicity. The present study aimed to develop DSG nanocrystals to increase the dissolution and then improve the oral bioavailability and biopharmaceutical properties of DSG. DSG nanocrystals were prepared by the media milling method using a combination of pluronic F127 and sodium dodecyl sulfate as surface stabilizers. The physicochemical properties of the optimal DSG nanocrystals were characterized using their particle size distribution, morphology, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data, and solubility and dissolution test results. Pharmacokinetic studies of the DSG coarse suspension and its nanocrystals were performed in rats. The particle size and polydispersity index of DSG nanocrystals were 229.0 ± 3.7 nm and 0.163 ± 0.064, respectively. DSG retained its original crystalline state during the manufacturing process, and its chemical structure was not compromised by the nanonizing process. The dissolution rate of the freeze-dried DSG nanocrystals was significantly improved in comparison with the original DSG. The pharmacokinetic studies showed that the AUC and C  of DSG nanocrystals increased markedly (p < 0.01) in comparison with the DSG coarse suspension by about 2.55- and 2.01-fold, respectively. The use of optimized nanocrystals is a good and efficient strategy for oral administration of DSG due to the increased dissolution rate and oral bioavailability of DSG nanocrystals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29589340>Influence of Nutritional Status on the Absorption of Polyphyllin I, an Anticancer Candidate from Paris polyphylla in Rats.</a></h1><p>Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is one of the most suffered complications in cancer patients. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a saponin isolated from rhizome of Paris polyphylla, is a potential candidate in cancer therapy. In this study, the influence of nutritional status on the absorption of PPI in rats was explored after oral administration.PCM rats, namely mal-nourished (MN) rats, were induced from well-nourished (WN) rats by caloric restriction protocol. Intestinal absorption of PPI in WN and MN rats was evaluated by pharmacokinetic and intestinal perfusion methods. The potential mechanisms between two groups were investigated on the basis of intestinal permeability, intestinal efflux and PPI's depletions in vivo. The intestinal permeability was analyzed by determining the concentration of paracellular marker transport in serum and the expression of  proteins in intestine. The intestinal efflux was evaluated through comparing the protein level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in intestine, and the depletions of PPI and/or generation of its metabolites in liver and intestines were analyzed by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.Compared to WN rats, the oral systemic exposure of PPI was significantly increased in MN rats, evidenced by significant enhancement of maximum plasma concentration (C) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by more than 2.51- and 3.71-folds as well as terminal elimination half-life (t) prolonged from to 7.3 to 14.1 h. Further studies revealed that the potential mechanism might be associated with combined contribution of improved intestinal absorption and depressed deglycosylation of PPI in MN rats. Furthermore, enhanced intestinal absorption of PPI was benefited from increased intestinal permeability and decreased intestinal efflux in MN rats. Meanwhile, the former manifested as increased transport of paracellular marker and decreased  proteins levels, while the later evidenced by reduced P-gp expression.The oral exposure of PPI was enhanced in MN rats, which suggested that nutritional status alters the absorption of PPI, and thus the dosage of PPI should be modified during the treatment of cancer patient with PCM.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351216>In Silico and In Vitro Study of the Bromelain-Phytochemical Complex Inhibition of Phospholipase A2 (Pla2).</a></h1><p>Phospholipase A2 (Pla2) is an enzyme that induces inflammation, making Pla2 activity an effective approach to reduce inflammation.

Bromelain-amenthoflavone displays antagonistic effects on Pla2. Bromelian-asiaticoside and bromelain- displayed synergistic effects at high concentrations of the combined compounds, with inhibition percentages of more than 70% and 90%, respectively, and antagonistic effects at low concentrations. The synergistic effect of the bromelain-asiaticoside and bromelain- combinations represents a new application in treating inflammation.

The proposed mechanisms of SGA toxicity are sterol-mediated disruption of membranes and inhibition of cholinesterase activity in neurons. It has been suggested that phytopathogenic microorganisms can overcome SGA toxicity by enzymatic deglycosylation of SGAs. Here, we have explored SGA-mediated toxicity toward the invasive oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of the late blight disease in potato and tomato, as well as the potential for SGA deglycosylation by this species. Our growth studies indicate that solanidine, the nonglycosylated precursor of the potato SGAs α-chaconine and α-solanine, has a greater physiological impact than its glycosylated forms. All of these compounds were incorporated into the mycelium, but only solanidine could strongly inhibit the growth of P. infestans in liquid culture. Genes encoding several glycoside hydrolases with potential activity on SGAs were identified in the genome of P. infestans and were shown to be expressed. However, we found no indication that deglycosylation of SGAs takes place. We present additional evidence for apparent host-specific adaptation to potato SGAs and assess all results in terms of future pathogen management strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785089> ameliorates testicular damage in streptozotocin-diabetic rats through attenuation of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent  disorder that is associated with development of some complications in male reproductive system including testicular damage, sexual dysfunction, abnormal spermatogenesis, and infertility.  is a natural steroidal saponin with anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects.

Cyclophosphamide (CP) is the most commonly used anticancer and immunosuppressant drug, which causes several toxic effects, especially on the reproductive system. Patients who need to use CP therapy exhibit reduced fertility or infertility, which impacts both physically and emotionally on the decision to use this drug, especially among young men. We hypothesized that the treatment with TT dry extract would protect the male reproductive system against CP toxicity. Mice received dry extract of TT (11 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 14 days. Saline or CP was injected intraperitoneally at a single dose (100 mg/kg) on the 14th day. Animals were euthanized 24 h after CP administration, and testes and epididymis were removed for biochemical and histopathological analysis and sperm evaluation. The dry extract of TT was evaluated by HPLC analysis and demonstrated the presence of protodioscin (1.48%, /). CP exposure increased lipid peroxidation, reactive species, and protein carbonylation and altered antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and GR). Moreover, acute exposure to CP caused a reduction on 17 -HSD activity, which may be related to the reduction in serum testosterone levels, histopathological changes observed in the testes, and the quality of the semen. The present study highlighted the role of TT dry extract to ameliorate the alterations induced by CP administration in mice testes, probably due to the presence of protodioscin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29565461>The effect of α-solanine on the activity, gene expression, and kinetics of arylamine N-acetyltransferase in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>α-solanine is one of the major components of Solanum nigrum Linn., the fruits of which are used in China for food. In the present study, α-solanine was selected to assess the inhibition of arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and mRNA expression of NAT and kinetics in HepG2 cells. NAT activity was examined by HPLC. The double-reciprocal plot was contrived to yield a regression equation to calculate Km and Vmax. NAT mRNA expression was determined by PCR. The results revealed that α-solanine could significantly decrease NAT activity in intact HepG2 cells or the cytoplasm. Km did not differ either for intact HepG2 cells or for the cytoplasm, however Vmax was significantly different. α-solanine could decrease the expression of NAT1 mRNA and NAT2 mRNA. In summary, α-solanine was a non-competitive inhibitor of NAT in HepG2 cells.

Dioscin, a natural product, shows potent effect on liver protection in our previous works.This work aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of dioscin on liver regeneration.The promoting proliferation effects of dioscin on mouse hepatocytem AML12 cells, rat primary hepatocytes, rats and mice after 70% PH were evaluated.Dioscin significantly promoted proliferation of rat primary hepatocytes and AML12 cells through MTT, BrdU and PCNA staining assays. Meanwhile, dioscin rapidly recovered the liver to body weight ratios, declined ALT and AST levels, and relieved hepatocytes necrosis compared with 70% PH operation groups in rats and mice. Mechanistic test showed that dioscin significantly increased Notch1 and Jagged1 levels, and accelerated γ-secretase activity by up-regulating PS1 expression, leading to nuclear translocation of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1). Subsequently, the significant activation of Notch-dependent target genes (Hey1, Hes1, EGFR, VEGF), and cell-cycle regulatory proteins (CyclinD1, CyclinE1, CDK4 and CDK2) were all recognized. In addition, these results were further confirmed by Notch1 siRNA silencing and inhibition of γ-secretase by DAPT (a well-characterized γ-secretase inhibitor) in vitro.Dioscin, as a novel efficient γ-secretase activator, NICD1 nucleus translocation promoter and cell cycle regulator, markedly activated Notch1/Jagged1 pathway to promote hepato-proliferation. Our findings provide novel insights into dioscin as a natural product with facilitating liver regeneration after PH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Since SGAs confer a bitter taste on human and show the toxicity against various organisms, reducing the SGA content in the tubers is requisite for potato breeding. However, generation of SGA-free potato has not been achieved yet, although silencing of several SGA biosynthetic genes led a decrease in SGAs. Here, we show that the knockout of St16DOX encoding a steroid 16α-hydroxylase in SGA biosynthesis causes the complete abolition of the SGA accumulation in potato hairy roots. Nine candidate guide RNA (gRNA) target sequences were selected from St16DOX by in silico analysis, and the two or three gRNAs were introduced into a CRISPR/Cas9 vector designated as pMgP237-2A-GFP that can express multiplex gRNAs based on the pre-tRNA processing system. To establish rapid screening of the candidate gRNAs that can efficiently mutate the St16DOX gene, we used a potato hairy root culture system for the introduction of the pMgP237 vectors. Among the transgenic hairy roots, two independent lines showed no detectable SGAs but accumulated the glycosides of 22,26-dihydroxycholesterol, which is the substrate of St16DOX. Analysis of the two lines with sequencing exhibited the mutated sequences of St16DOX with no wild-type sequences. Thus, generation of SGA-free hairy roots of tetraploid potato was achieved by the combination of the hairy root culture and the pMgP237-2A-GFP vector. This experimental system is useful to evaluate the efficacy of candidate gRNA target sequences in the short-term.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The pathologic mechanism of endotoxemia induced acute neuro-inflammation still has not been fully understood. For the first time, we found the disruption of neurotransmitters 5-HT, impaired neurogenesis and activation of astrocytes coupled with concomitant neuro-inflammation were the potential pathogenesis of endotoxemia induced acute neuro-inflammation in sepsis survivors. In addition, dioscin a natural steroidal saponin isolated from Chinese medicinal herbs, enhanced the serotonergic system and produced anti-depressant effect by enhancing 5-HT levels in hippocampus. What is more, this finding was verified by  analyses of hippocampus, indicating 5-HT related  pathway was involved in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia induced acute neuro-inflammation. Moreover, neuro-inflammation and neurogenesis within hippocampus were indexed using quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of GFAP DCX and Ki67, as well as real-time RT-PCR analysis of some gene expression levels in hippocampus. Our in vivo and in vitro studies show dioscin protects hippocampus from endotoxemia induced cascade neuro-inflammation through neurotransmitter 5-HT and HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling pathway, which accounts for the dioscin therapeutic effect in behavioral tests. Therefore, the current findings suggest that dioscin could be a potential approach for the therapy of endotoxemia induced acute neuro-inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328459>α-solanine enhances the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells by inducing microRNA‑138 expression.</a></h1><p>Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor worldwide. Inherent and acquired drug resistance are the major challenges faced in anticancer chemotherapy. This study aimed to explore the effects of α-solanine in regards to the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells. We found that α-solanine enhanced the sensitivity of EC9706 and KYSE30 cells to 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (Cis) by promoting drug-induced apoptosis. qRT-PCR and western blotting results showed that α-solanine treatment promoted miR-138 expression and decreased survivin expression in EC9706 and KYSE30 cells. α-solanine also enhanced the inhibitory effects of 5-Fu and Cis in EC9706 transplanted tumors in mouse models. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay results confirmed survivin as the direct target gene of miR-138. MiR-138 inhibited survivin expression in EC9706 and KYSE30 cells. And miR-138 mimic and si-survivin had similar effects with α-solanine in suppressing survivin expression and promoting cancer cell death. miR-138 inhibitor reversed the chemosensitivity-enhancing effect of α-solanine. In EC9706 and KYSE30 cells, survivin overexpression rescued the cancer cells from apoptosis caused by α-solanine and miR-138 mimic expression. From these findings, we conclude that α-solanine enhanced the chemosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to chemotherapy via the miR-138/survivin pathway. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the chemosensitivity-enhancing function of α-solanine and suggests a new chemotherapeutic strategy for esophageal cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27982733>In vitro and ex vivo approach for anti-urolithiatic potential of bioactive fractions of gokhru with simultaneous HPLC analysis of six major metabolites and their exploration in rat plasma.</a></h1><p>Tribulus terrestris L.

However, numerous cases of toxicity outbreaks in livestock have raised concerns on safety of using these plants, especially B. decumbens. In this study, chemometric analysis of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HR-QTOF-MS) data has for the first time uncovered qualitative and quantitative differences between metabolomes of toxic B. decumbens and nontoxic B. brizantha. The steroidal saponin protoneodioscin was established as the main biomarker for B. decumbens when compared to B. brizantha, and therefore the key explanation for their phytochemical differentiation. Quantification of protodioscin in both plants showed no significant differences; consequently, the idea that this compound is solely responsible for toxicity outbreaks must be discarded. Instead, we propose that the added occurrence of its stereoisomer, protoneodioscin, in B. decumbens, can be considered as the probable cause of these events. Interestingly, the greatest concentrations of saponins for both species were reached during winter (B. decumbens = 53.6 ± 5.1 mg·g(-1) dry weight (D.W.); B. brizantha = 25.0 ± 1.9 mg·g(-1) D.W.) and spring (B. decumbens = 49.4 ± 5.0 mg·g(-1) D.W.; B. brizantha = 27.9 ± 1.4 mg·g(-1) D.W.), although in the case of B. decumbens these values do not vary significantly among seasons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27104314>Polyphyllin D induces apoptosis and differentiation in K562 human leukemia cells.</a></h1><p>Polyphyllin D, a compound derived from Paris polyphylla rhizoma, demonstrated strong anticancer activities in a previous study. Our results demonstrated that polyphyllin D exerts a growth inhibitory effect by inducing apoptosis and differentiation in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562. Polyphyllin D induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as evidenced by the decreased Bcl-2 and Bcr/Abl expression levels, the disruption of MMP and increased Bax, cytochrome c and cleaved-caspase-3 levels. At a low dose, polyphyllin D increased CD14 expression on the surface of K562 cells and induced cells to differentiate into monocytes or mature macrophages.

However, the mechanism of solanine-suppressing prostate cancer cell growth remains to be elucidated. This study investigates the inhibition mechanism of solanine on cancer development in vivo and in cultured human prostate cancer cell DU145 in vitro. Results show that solanine injection significantly suppresses the tumor cell growth in xenograft athymic nude mice. Solanine regulates the protein levels of cell cycle proteins, including Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and P21 in vivo and in vitro. Also, in cultured DU145 cell, solanine significantly inhibits cell growth. Moreover, the administration of NAC, an active oxygen scavenger, markedly reduces solanine-induced cell death. Blockade of P38 MAPK kinase cannot suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS), but can suppress solanine-induced cell apoptosis. Also, inhibition of ROS by NAC inactivates P38 pathway. Taken together, the data suggest that inhibition of prostate cancer growth by solanine may be through blocking the expression of cell cycle proteins and inducing apoptosis via ROS and activation of P38 pathway. These findings indicate an attractive therapeutic potential of solanine for suppression of prostate cancer.© 2016 The Authors.

Solanine significantly up-regulated p21 mRNA and protein expression in the tumors and induced a higher apoptosis rate of the tumor cells than saline (P<0.01).The tumor-inhibition effect of solanine is probably mediated by regulating the expressions of genes related with G1/S cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29594316>An integrated approach to elucidate signaling pathways of dioscin-induced apoptosis,  metabolism and differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia.</a></h1><p>Although the therapeutics have improved the rates of remission and cure of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in recent decades, there is still an unmet medical need for AML therapies because disease relapses are a major obstacle in patients who become refractory to salvage therapy. The development of therapeutic agents promoting both cytotoxicity and cell differentiation may provide opportunities to improve the clinical outcome. Dioscin-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells was identified through death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The formation of Bak and tBid, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were induced by dioscin suggesting the activation of intrinsic apoptotsis pathway. A functional analysis of transcription factors using transcription factor-DNA interaction array and IPA analysis demonstrated that dioscin induced a profound increase of protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), a critical factor for myeloid differentiation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay confirmed the increase of C/EBPα expression. Dioscin-induced differentiation was substantiated by an increase of CD11b protein expression and the induction of differentiation toward myelomonocytic/granulocytic lineages using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Moreover, both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis assay and IPA network enrichment analysis were proposed to dioscin action. In conclusion, the data suggest that dioscin exerts its antileukemic effect through the upregulation of both death ligands and death receptors and a crosstalk activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway with the collaboration of tBid and Bak formation. In addition, proteomics approach reveals an altered metabolic signature of dioscin-treated cells and the induction of differentiation of promyelocytes to granulocytes and monocytes in which the C/EBPα plays a key role.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483735>Dioscin attenuates high‑fat diet‑induced insulin resistance of adipose tissue through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance, as a common metabolic disorder, may be caused by diet‑induced obesity. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of dioscin on regulating insulin resistance of adipose tissue induced by a high‑fat diet (HFD). An animal model was established successfully using C57BL/6J mice with high‑fat feeding, followed by treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dioscin through gavage for 18 weeks, and randomly divided into a control group, a HFD model group and a dioscin group treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dioscin for 12 weeks. Histopathological changes in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical parameters of the serum were also monitored, including glucose, insulin, total triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and adipose insulin resistance (Adipo‑IR) levels. Expression of the mRNA and associated proteins of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1)/phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values of mice fed with a HFD were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). However, dioscin administration significantly decreased HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05), suggesting the effects of dioscin on attenuating insulin resistance. RT‑qPCR results indicated that the associated genes of the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway were significantly downregulated by HFD compared with the control group (P<0.05), while dioscin significantly increased the expression of those genes compared with the control group (P<0.05). Similarly, the significant increase in phosphorylated (p‑)IRS‑1/IRS‑1 (P<0.05) and p‑Akt/Akt (P<0.05) values were substantially reversed by dioscin treatment. Dioscin pronouncedly mitigated insulin resistance in adipose tissues through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway and has potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for the therapy of HFD‑induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28638386>Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis of the Dioscin Rich Medicinal Plant .</a></h1><p>Dioscorea contains critically important species which can be used as staple foods or sources of bioactive substances, including , which has been used to develop highly successful drugs to treat cardiovascular disease.

However, reliance on naturally growing plants as a production system limits the potential use of , raising interest in engineering   to enhance the production of secondary metabolites. However, the biosynthetic pathway of  is still poorly understood, and  is poorly characterized at a molecular level, hindering in-depth investigation. In the present work, the RNAs from five organs and seven methyl jasmonate treated  rhizomes were sequenced using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform, yielding 52 gigabases of data, which were pooled and assembled into a reference transcriptome. Four hundred and eighty two genes were found to be highly expressed in the rhizomes, and these genes are mainly involved in stress response and transcriptional regulation. Based on their expression patterns, 36 genes were selected for further investigation as candidate genes involved in dioscin biosynthesis. Constructing co-expression  based on significant changes in gene expression revealed 15 gene modules. Of these, four modules with properties correlating to dioscin regulation and biosynthesis, consisting of 4,665 genes in total, were selected for further functional investigation.

Protodioscin is a saponin whose steroidal moiety has some similarities to plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids. To test the possibility that protodioscin acts as an agonist or antagonist of brassinosteroids or other plant growth regulators, we compared responses of the weed species Bidens pilosa L. to treatment with protodioscin, brassinosteroids, auxins (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Seeds were germinated and grown in agar containing protodioscin, dioscin, brassinolides, IAA and ABA. Root apex respiratory activity was measured with an oxygen electrode. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes activities were assessed. Protodioscin at 48-240 μm inhibited growth of B. pilosa seedlings. The steroidal hormone 24-epibrassinolide (0.1-5 μm) also inhibited growth of primary roots, but brassicasterol was inactive. IAA at higher concentrations (0.5-10.0 μm) strongly inhibited primary root length and fresh weight of stems. ABA inhibited all parameters of seedling growth and also seed germination. Respiratory activity of primary roots (KCN-sensitive and KCN-insensitive) was activated by protodioscin. IAA and ABA reduced KCN-insensitive respiration. The content of MDA in primary roots increased only after protodioscin treatment. All assayed compounds increased APx and POD activity, with 24-epibrassinolide being most active. The activity of CAT was stimulated by protodioscin and 24-epibrassinolide. The results revealed that protodioscin was toxic to B. pilosa through a mechanism not related to plant growth regulator signalling. Protodioscin caused a disturbance in mitochondrial respiratory activity, which could be related to overproduction of ROS and consequent cell membrane damage.© 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714320>Anticancer effect of Polyphyllin Ι in colorectal cancer cells through ROS-dependent autophagy and G2/M arrest mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Polyphyllin Ι is a steroidal saponin isolated from the rhizoma of Paris polyphylla.

Enhancing creatine (CRE) stability in aqueous solutions, such as with microencapsulation, represents innovation potential. Ten physically active male volunteers were randomly assigned in a double-blind design to either placebo (PLA) (3-g maltodextrin; n = 5) or microencapsulated CRE (3-g creatine monohydrate; n = 5) conditions. Experimental conditions involved ingestion of the samples in a 70-mL ready-to-drink format. CRE was delivered in a novel microencapsulation matrix material consisting entirely of hydrolyzed milk protein. Three hours after ingestion, plasma creatine concentrations were unchanged during PLA, and averaged ∼45 μM. During CRE, plasma creatine concentration peaked after 30 min at 101.6 ± 14.9 μM (p < 0.05), representing a 2.3-fold increase over PLA. Thereafter, plasma creatine concentration gradually trended downwards but remained significantly elevated (∼50% above resting levels) 3 hr after ingestion.

To evaluate the anticonvulsant action of protodioscin (PDSN) in experiments with animals with pilocarpine-induced convulsions. We assessed the activity of PDSN in pilocarpine induced seizures in combination with different agents which are acting via diverse receptors, such as atropine, memantine, nimodipine, diazepam, and flumazenil, to determine the exact receptors responsible for the action of PDSN. Furthermore, the level of antioxidant markers was investigated in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex in mice to define the antioxidant action of PDSN. The effects of PDSN on proapoptotic markers (i.e., Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3) was investigated via western blot analysis. PDSN significantly enhanced latency to the first convulsion and survival compared to the group treated with pilocarpine alone. Moreover, PDSN improved animal survival, and subjects experiencing no convulsions. Striatal glutamate and aspartate levels were not modified, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) levels increased, as a result of treatment with PDSN. The results suggest that the anticonvulsive action of PDSN is dependent on inhibitory amino acids. PDSN treatment also significantly decreased nitrite levels in the blood and brain cortex compared to the normal control. In the western blot analysis, PDSN exerted its neuroprotective effect via the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax and caspase-3. The results of this study suggest that PDSN exerts neuroprotective effects via multiple mechanisms.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present study investigated whether dioscin may exert protective effects against CHD‑induced heart apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in a pig model and the potential underlying mechanisms. Adult pigs were used to establish a CHD model group and 80 mg/kg dioscin was administered for 4 weeks. Histological analysis and measurement of serum levels of heart injury markers demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin markedly alleviated CHD, while left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular systolic internal diameter measurements indicated that 80 mg/kg dioscin also increased heart function in the CHD pig model. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin significantly reduced protein levels of apoptosis markers in the heart of CHD model pigs, including Bcl‑2‑associated X and caspase‑3, potentially via the suppression of poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP)/p53 expression. Additionally, the results of ELISA and western blotting demonstrated that 80 mg/kg dioscin may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in CHD model pigs through the promotion of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression and the suppression of PARP/p53 and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression. The results of the current study indicate that dioscin may protect against CHD by regulating oxidative stress and inflammation via Sirt1/Nrf2 and p38 MAPK .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380052>Synthesis, characterization, and biological studies of diosgenyl analogs.</a></h1><p>A series of diosgenyl analogs were prepared from  to evaluate their anticancer activity and antithrombotic property. Analog 4, which had a spiroketal structure with a 6-aminohexanoic acid residue, exhibited the highest potency against all five tumor cell lines. It significantly blocked tumor growth, induced cell apoptosis and autophagy, and regulated cellular calcium concentration, mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate, and cell cycle. In addition, fluorescence-tagged compounds indicated that the analogs could rapidly accumulate in the cytoplasm, but no specific localization in the nucleus of cancer cells was observed. Furthermore, preliminary structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that spiroketal analogs exhibit better antithrombotic activity than furostanic analogs, which exhibit the opposite effect by promoting thrombosis. Our study indicates that compound 4 may be a promising anticancer drug candidate for cancer patients with thromboembolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365854>Inhibitory effects of Dioscin on atherosclerosis and foam cell formation in hyperlipidemia rats.</a></h1><p>Macrophage-derived foam cells are well known for their key role in development of atherosclerosis (AS). The present study aimed to examine whether dioscin exerts anti-atherosclerotic activity and inhibits foam cell formation. A high-fat induced AS model and ox-LDL treated macrophages were established and received treatment of dioscin. Anti-atherosclerotic activity in vivo was assessed by atherosclerotic lesions size and aortic lipid contents. Macrophage formed foam cells were positively identified by oil red o staining. Moreover, the expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB in aorta tissue and macrophages was examined by western blotting assay. Our results showed that dioscin not only reduced the levels of plasma lipid, TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6, but also inhibited atherosclerotic development in AS rats, as evidenced by decreased atherosclerotic lesions size and aortic lipid level. In vitro study revealed dioscin directly reduced foam cell formation, decreased intracellular cholesterol accumulation and lowered TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6 secretion in ox-LDL treated macrophages. Interestingly, further work found dioscin significantly reduced expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB in the aortic tissue and ox-LDL treated macrophages. In summary, our study was the first to confirm anti-atherosclerotic activity of dioscin in vivo and vitro. Moreover, the other important finding is dioscin mediated ox-LDL/LOX-1/NF-κB regulated contributions to the attenuate macrophage ox-LDL uptake and AS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172707>Growth kinetics and  estimation from callus cultures of Costus speciosus (Koen. ex.

Effect of explants, media and plant growth regulators was evaluated with respect to callus induction and growth. Out of the two explants viz pseudostem and seed, pseudostem showed maximum callus induction frequency of 90% on MS medium. The fresh weight of callus was maximum (9-folds) on 28th day on 1.0 mg/L picloram containing medium. The callus obtained was white compact hard (WCH). For growth kinetics study pseudostem derived callus was transferred on different media supplemented with 1.0 mg/L picloram. All phases of growth were seen in callus inoculated on all the three media except the absence of stationary phase on MS and SH media. MS medium proved to be the best for maximum biomass accumulation (9-fold) on 28th day of culture and callus in post-exponential phase showed maximum  accumulation (33 ppm).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29067449> attenuates neuropathic pain in a rat model of chronic constriction injury.</a></h1><p> is a steroidal saponin extract from numerous plants, including Solanum and Dioscorea species, and has been reported to possess neuroprotective activity. However, the role of  in neuropathic pain remains unclear. The present study examined the effects of  on allodynia and the levels of inflammatory mediators in rats following neuropathic pain evoked by chronic constriction injury (CCI). In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ‑induced suppression of neuropathic pain were examined. The results of the present study demonstrated  reversed CCI‑decreased mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency. Furthermore,  inhibited CCI‑induced upregulated levels of the pro‑inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑2, and suppressed oxidative stress induced by CCI in the spinal cord. Furthermore,  significantly inhibited the expression of phosphorylated‑p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)‑κB in the spinal cord in CCI rats compared with sham‑operated rats. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that  attenuates neuropathic pain in CCI rats by inhibiting activation of the p38 MAPK and NF‑κB signaling . These results implicate  in the treatment of neuropathic pain, which merits further clinical investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26947206>Effects of total saponins from Rhizoma Dioscoreae Nipponicae on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-2 and Tie-2 receptors in the synovium of rats with rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to determine the effects of total saponins from Rhizoma Dioscoreae Nipponicae (TS-RDN) on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 and Tie-2 (endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor) receptors in the synovium of rats with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (collagen-induced arthritis; CIA), and to examine the mechanisms of TS-RDN in alleviating RA.The CIA rat model was established and the animals were randomly divided into control, CIA model, TS-RDN, , and tripterygium groups. Fluorescent polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect VEGF expression in the rat knee joint synovium. Additionally, immunohistochemical assay was used to detect protein expression of Ang-2 and Tie-2 in the rat knee joint synovium.Expression of VEGF, Ang-2, and Tie-2 in the model group was significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.01). After TS-RDN, tripterygium and  treatment, VEGF and Ang-2 expression was lower than in the model group (p < 0.01). However, Tie-2 expression showed no significant difference. The effects of TS-RDN on VEGF expression were more marked than those of tripterygium and  (p < 0.01).TS-RDN might reduce the expression of VEGF, Ang-2, and Tie-2 in the synovium, thus inhibiting synovial angiogenesis and playing a therapeutic role in RA.Copyright © 2016.

Dioscin has anti‑tumor, anti‑inflammatory, antioxidant and other significant pharmacological effects with high medicinal value. The present work aimed to research the protective effect and underlying mechanisms by which dioscin prevents acute lung injury (ALI). Mice were injected with 5 mg/kg LPS to induce lung injury. Mice were treated with dioscin (20, 40 and 60 mg/kg) following LPS‑induced lung injury. Treatment with dioscin significantly decreased total number of alveolar macrophages, water content of lung and total protein concentration in ALI mice. Dioscin treatment significantly suppressed the ALI‑induced interleukin (IL)‑1B, IL‑6, tumor necrosis factor‑α, nuclear factor (NF)‑κB, myeloperoxidase, interferon‑γ and intercellular adhesion molecule‑1 activities in ALI rats. Following this, the authors identified that dioscin significantly also suppressed cyclooxygenase‑2, heat shock protein 70, Toll‑like receptor 4, MyD88 and NF‑κB protein expression in ALI rats. The results suggested that dioscin prevents LPS‑induced ALI through inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway via upregulation of HSP70.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27779235>One compound of saponins from Disocorea zingiberensis protected against experimental acute pancreatitis by preventing mitochondria-mediated necrosis.</a></h1><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a painful inflammatory disorder of the exocrine pancreas, ranking as the most common gastrointestinal reasons for hospitalization with no specific therapy currently. Diosgenyl saponins extracted from natural products and  or its derivatives have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in various diseases. However, the therapeutic effects of diosgenyl saponins from Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright in AP have not yet been determined. Five compounds were extracted and screened for taurocholate-induced necrosis in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Particularly, 26-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-3β, 22α, 26-trihydroxy-25(R)-furosta-5-en-3-O-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 4)]-β-d-glucopyranoside (compound 1) exhibited the best protective effects with no toxicity observed. Next, we showed compound 1 concentration-dependently inhibited necrotic cell death pathway activation and 2.5 mM compound 1 also prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate production, and reactive oxygen species generation in mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Finally, we showed compound 1 protected against three clinically representative murine models of AP and significantly improved pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury. These data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that one compound of diosgenyl saponins can be potential treatment for AP. This study suggests natural saponins may serve as fruitful sources for exploring/identifying potential therapies for inflammatory diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27665608>Rapid and simple determination of polyphyllin I, II, VI, and VII in different harvest times of cultivated Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.)

Hand.-Mazz ("Dian Chonglou" in Chinese) is a famous herbal medicine in China, which is usually well known for activities of anti-cancer, hemolysis, and cytotoxicity. In this study, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was applied to discriminate samples of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis harvested in different years and determine the content of polyphyllin I, II, VI, and VII in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Meanwhile, ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to study the dynamic changes of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis harvested in different years (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13 years old). According to the UPLC-MS/MS result, the optimum harvest time of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis is 8 years, due to the highest yield of four active components. By the PCA model, P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis could be exactly discriminated, except that two 8-year-old samples were misclassified as 9-year-old samples. For the prediction of polyphyllin I, II, VI, and VII, the quantitative results are satisfactory, with a high value for the determination coefficient (R ) and low values for the root-mean-square error of estimation (RMSEE), root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), and root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP). In conclusion, FT-IR combined with chemometrics is a promising method to accurately discriminate samples of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis harvested in different years and determine the content of polyphyllin I, II, VI, and VII in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087904>[Protective effect of  on chondrocytes mediated by JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in mice with osteoarthritis].</a></h1><p> To investigate the effect of  (Dgn) on chondrocytes and its relation to JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in mice with osteoarthritis (OA). Fifteen male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups:control group, OA group and OA+Dgn group. After 4 weeks of treatment, the histopathological changes of cartilage tissue were observed by toluidine blue staining under light microscopy and the ultrastructure of chondrocytes was observed under electron microscopy. The primarily cultured chondrocytes of OA mice were randomly divided into 4 groups:(1) OA group, (2) Dgn group, (3) Dgn+AG490 group, (4) AG490 group. The expression of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were detected by Western blotting, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was detected using colorimetric method.  The morphological observation showed that the chondrocytes of OA group presented considerable pathological changes, while the chondrocytes in OA+Dgn group maintained intact membrane. Electron microscopy observation found obvious injury in cartilage tissues of OA group, while that in OA+Dgn group remained smooth. Compared with OA group, the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in chondrocytes of Dgn group were increased (all <0.05), and the expressions of Bax protein, SDH, COX and SOD were decreased (all <0.05).

We explored the possibility of using Paris saponin I as an agent to sensitize gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, and examined the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Growth inhibition was detected by MTT assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry and Annexin V/PI staining. The P21waf1/cip1, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein expression were detected using Western blot analysis. RESULTS The results revealed that PSI sensitized gastric cancer cells to cisplatin, with low toxicity. The IC50 value of cisplatin in SGC-7901 cell lines was decreased when combined with PSI. PSI promoted cisplatin-induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in a cisplatin concentration-dependent manner. Bcl-2 protein expression decreased, but Bax, caspase-3, and P21waf1/cip1 protein expression increased with PSI treatment. CONCLUSIONS The underlying mechanism of Paris saponin I may be related to targeting the apoptosis pathway and cell cycle blocking, which suggests that PSI is a potential therapeutic sensitizer for cisplatin in treating gastric cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903977>Dioscin augments HSV-tk-mediated suicide gene therapy for melanoma by promoting connexin-based intercellular communication.</a></h1><p>Suicide gene therapy is a promising strategy against melanoma. However, the low efficiency of the gene transfer technique can limit its application. Our preliminary data showed that dioscin, a glucoside saponin, could upregulate the expression of connexins Cx26 and Cx43, major components of gap junctions, in melanoma cells. We hypothesized that dioscin may increase the bystander effect of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) through increasing the formation of gap junctions. Further analysis showed that dioscin indeed could increase the gap junctional intercellular communication in B16 melanoma cells, resulting in more efficient GCV-induced bystander killing in B16tk cells. By contrast, overexpression of dominant negative Cx43 impaired the cell-cell communication of B16 cells and subsequently weakened the bystander effect of HSV-tk/GCV gene therapy. In vivo, combination treatment with dioscin and GCV of tumor-bearing mice with 30% positive B16tk cells and 70% wild-type B16 cells caused a significant reduction in tumor volume and weight compared to treatment with GCV or dioscin alone. Taken together, these results demonstrated that dioscin could augment the bystander effect of the HSV-tk/GCV system through increasing connexin-mediated gap junction coupling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704260>α-Solanine reverses pulmonary vascular remodeling and vascular angiogenesis in experimental pulmonary artery hypertension.</a></h1><p>Similar to cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by vascular remodeling, which leads to obliteration of the small pulmonary arteriole, with marked proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) and/or endothelial cells dysfunction. Aberrant expression of tumor suppressor genes is closely associated with susceptibility to PAH. We hypothesized that α-solanine, a glycoalkaloid found in members of the nightshade family known to have antitumor activity in different cancers, reverses experimental PAH by activating the tumor suppressor-axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2).We investigated the effects of α-solanine on PASMC proliferation and apoptosis by using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine proliferation assay, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 staining, TUNEL and Anexine V assays. Scratch wound healing and tube formation assays were also used to study migration of endothelial cells. In vitro, we demonstrated, using cultured human PASMC from PAH patients, that α-solanine reversed dysfunctional AXIN2, β-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2 signaling, whereas restored [Ca]i, IL-6 and IL-8, contributing to the decrease of PAH-PASMC proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Meanwhile, α-solanine inhibits proliferation, migration and tube formation of PAH-pulmonary artery endothelial cells by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3α activation. In vivo, α-solanine administration decreases distal pulmonary arteries remodeling, mean pulmonary arteries pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy in both monocrotaline-induced and Sugen/hypoxia-induced PAH in mice.This study demonstrates that AXIN2/β-catenin axis and Akt pathway can be therapeutically targeted by α-solanine in PAH. α-Solanine could be used as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PAH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29308745>Polyphyllin I Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Cell Apoptosis in Human Retinoblastoma Y-79 Cells through Targeting p53.</a></h1><p>Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in childhood. Although external beam radiation and enucleation are effective to control retinoblastoma, eye salvage and vision preservation are still significant challenges. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a natural compound extracted from Paris polyphylla rhizomes, has a wide range of activities against many types of cancers. However, the potential effect of this herbal compound on retinoblastoma has not yet been investigated.In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of PPI on human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results indicated that PPI treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase and induced cell apoptosis of Y79 cells through the mitochondrial- dependent intrinsic pathway. Moreover, p53 is involved in PPI-induced cytotoxicity in human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells. Exposure to 10 μM PPI for 48 h dramatically induced the expression levels of p53, phosphorylated- p53 and acetylated-p53. Furthermore, blockade of p53 expression effectively attenuated PPI-induced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in Y-79 cells.These results demonstrated that PPI exhibits anti-proliferation effect on human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells through modulating p53 expression, stabilization and activation.

EMT, a crucial cellular process that occurs during cancer progression and metastasis, has been reported to promote drug resistance in several previous studies. Consequently, ongoing research has been focused on exploring therapeutic options for preventing EMT to delay or reverse drug resistance. Polyphyllin I (PPI) is a natural component extracted from Paris polyphylla that displays anti-cancer properties. In the present study, we investigated whether PPI can be used in the cisplatin (DDP)-resistant human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/DDP. The results demonstrated that PPI treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and EMT. TGF-β1 is known to promote EMT-induced metastasis in numerous tumor types. PPI inhibited the invasion of TGFβ1-induced SGC7901/DDP cells in vitro. PPI also increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of E-cadherin but decreased the expression levels of vimentin. Further examination of the mechanism revealed that the CIP2A/PP2A/Akt pathway is partially involved in this regulation of EMT-related biomarkers and invasion. Furthermore, xenograft tests also confirmed the antitumor effects of PPI in vivo. We propose that PPI could be developed as a candidate drug for treating cancer invasion and migration.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Effects of dietary surfactants on TJ integrity, measured as trans-epithelial resistance (TEER), were studied in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Cytotoxicity was assessed as apical LDH leakage. Monolayers were apically exposed for 60 min to the dietary surfactants solanine and chaconine (SC, potato glycoalkaloids, 0-0.25 mM), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, industrial contaminant, 0-0.8 mM), and sucrose monolaurate (SML, food emulsifier E 473, 0-2.0 mM) separately and as a mixture. Dose-response modelling of TEER EC showed that SC were 2.7- and 12-fold more potent than PFOS and SML, respectively. The mixture was composed of 1 molar unit SC, 2.7 units PFOS and 12 units SML ("SC TEER equivalent" proportions 1:1:1). Mixture exposure (0-0.05 mM SC equivalents) dose-response modelling suggested additive action on TJ integrity. Increasing SC and SML concentrations caused increased LDH leakage, but PFOS decreased LDH leakage at intermediate exposure concentrations. In the mixture PFOS appeared to protect from extensive SC- and SML-induced LDH leakage. Complex mixtures of surfactants in food may act additively on intestinal TJ integrity, which should be considered in risk assessment of emulsifier authorisation for use in food production.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is aimed to explore the interaction of fenugreek seed extract (FSE) and HPT (hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid) axis in context of leptin secretion which have important role in normal and type-1 diabetic subjects. FSE (confirmed to contain trigonelline, , 4 hydroxyisoleucine) was gavaged (0.25 gm/kg body weight/day) to normal and alloxan-induced type-1 diabetic rats for 4 weeks. Expression of hypothalamic prepro-TRH (Thyrotropin releasing hormone) mRNA, serum levels of TRH, TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone), fT, fT, insulin, leptin, glucose; thyroperoxidase activity and growth of thyroid gland, food intake, adiposity index were also studied FSE significantly down regulated prepro-TRH mRNA expression; decreased serum TRH, TSH, fT, fT levels, and regressed thyroid gland in FSE-fed normal and diabetic rats than those observed in normal diet-fed control and diabetic rats. FSE decreased (p<0.005-0.001) adiposity index and leptin secretion, increased food intake and body weight in all FSE-fed rats. FSE improved insulin secretion, decreased glucose level but impaired HPT axis in diabetic rats, indicating insulin-independent central hypothyroidism. Results suggested that the dominant signal to hypothalamus suppressing HPT axis is the fall in leptin level which i resulted from decreased adiposity index following FSE feeding. Fenugreek simultaneously having hypoglycaemic and hypothyroidal actions raises questions whether it can be safely used to treat diabetes and/or hyperthyroidism as was suggested by many workers.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463020>Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Identifies Putative Genes Involved in Dioscin Biosynthesis in Dioscorea zingiberensis.</a></h1><p>Dioscorea zingiberensis is a perennial herb native to China. The rhizome of D. zingiberensis has long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat rheumatic arthritis. Dioscin is the major bioactive ingredient conferring the medicinal property described in Chinese pharmacopoeia. Several previous studies have suggested cholesterol as the intermediate to the biosynthesis of dioscin, however, the biosynthetic steps to dioscin after cholesterol remain unknown. In this study, a comprehensive D. zingiberensis transcriptome derived from its leaf and rhizome was constructed. Based on the annotation using various public databases, all possible enzymes in the biosynthetic steps to cholesterol were identified. In the late steps beyond cholesterol, cholesterol undergoes site-specific oxidation by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and glycosylation by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) to yield dioscin. From the D. zingiberensis transcriptome, a total of 485 unigenes were annotated as CYPs and 195 unigenes with a sequence length above 1000 bp were annotated as UGTs. Transcriptomic comparison revealed 165 CYP annotated unigenes correlating to dioscin biosynthesis in the plant. Further phylogenetic analysis suggested that among those CYP candidates four of them would be the most likely candidates involved in the biosynthetic steps from cholesterol to dioscin. Additionally, from the UGT annotated unigenes, six of them were annotated as 3-O-UGTs and two of them were annotated as rhamnosyltransferases, which consisted of potential UGT candidates involved in dioscin biosynthesis. To further explore the function of the UGT candidates, two 3-O-UGT candidates, named Dz3GT1 and Dz3GT2, were cloned and functionally characterized. Both Dz3GT1 and Dz3GT2 were able to catalyze a C3-glucosylation activity on . In conclusion, this study will facilitate our understanding of dioscin biosynthesis pathway and provides a basis for further mining the genes involved in dioscin biosynthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765352>Dioscin suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma tumor growth by inducing apoptosis and regulation of TP53, BAX, BCL2 and cleaved CASP3.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy of the liver, occurs frequently in the setting of chronic liver injury. Although multiple therapeutic approaches are available, the prognosis of patients with HCC remains poor. Dioscin is a natural steroid saponin that presents in various plants. The anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic effects have been extensively reported. However, the effect of dioscin on HCC remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the anti-HCC properties of dioscin in vitro and in vivo.MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay was used to analyze the growth inhibition activity of Dioscin in human cell lines, Bel-7402, HepG2, Lovo, and EAhy926. Antitumor activity through induction of apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry using Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) analysis with Hochest33342 and PI labeling, and DNA fragmentation analysis. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins tumor protein p53 (TP53), BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Caspase 3 (CASP3) was measured by Western blot. Nude mice bearing Bel-7402 were administered intraperitoneally at different doses of dioscin and 5-FU (5-Fluorouracil) treatment was used as a control. Tumor volume and tumor weight of each mouse were then measured.We demonstrated that Dioscin inhibited proliferation of HCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Dioscin also significantly induced morphological changes during death by apoptosis and increased DNA damage of Bel-7402 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that Dioscin displayed anticancer activity via up-regulating expression of TP53, BAX and CASP3 protein, as well as down-regulating BCL2 in Bel-7402 cells. Notably, the in vivo anticancer activity of Dioscin was further assessed and achieved greater inhibition efficiency at the concentration increased to 24mg/kg/day than 5-FU at dose of 10mg/kg/day in nude mice bearing Bel-7402 cells.Dioscin inhibited tumor growth via inducing apoptosis, which was accompanied by altered expression of apoptotic pathway proteins, such as TP53, BAX, BCL2 and CASP3. Our findings indicate that further evaluation of dioscin as a novel therapeutic approach for HCC is warranted.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the underling mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, it was identified that dioscin (0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 25 µg/ml) promoted MC3T3‑E1 cell proliferation and differentiation in a dose‑dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that dioscin regulated autophagy‑associated protein expression in MC3T3‑E1 cells; it promoted the expression of apoptosis stimulated protein of p53‑2 (ASPP2), and inhibited the expression of nuclear factor (NF)‑κβ and microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3β, in a concentration‑dependent manner. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) was used to inhibit the activation of NF‑κB and examine the effect of the ASPP2/NF‑κβ pathway on osteoblastic cell differentiation, proliferation and autophagy. It was identified that CAPE reversed the regulation of dioscin on osteoblastic cell differentiation, proliferation and autophagy. In conclusion, the present study revealed that dioscin promoted osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by inhibiting cell autophagy via the ASPP2/NF‑κβ pathway. These results are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to reveal the involvement of autophagy in the effects of dioscin on the prevention and therapy of osteoporosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27751178>Dioscin inhibits gastric tumor growth through regulating the expression level of lncRNA HOTAIR.</a></h1><p>As a member of non-coding RNAs family, long non-coding RNAs' functions in cancer needs to be further investigated.

Antiproliferation effect of ADR was enhanced by dioscin in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells. Dioscin significantly inhibited MDR1 mRNA and protein expression and MDR1 promoter and nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB) activity in MCF-7/ADR cells. Additionally, inhibitor κB-α (IκB-α) degradation was inhibited by dioscin. Moreover, dioscin induced the formation of vacuoles in the cytoplasm and protein level of LC3-II in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells. Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA abolished the effect of dioscin on ADR cytotoxicity. Dioscin inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, resulting in upregulation of LC3-II expression. In conclusion, dioscin increased ADR chemosensitivity by down-regulating MDR1 expression through NF-κB signaling inhibition in MCF-7/ADR cells. Autophagy was induced by dioscin to ameliorate the cytotoxicity of ADR via inhibition of the PI3K/AKT  in MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cells.

Effects of Dydio on mitochondrial dysfunction in response to Tauro, cholecystokinin-8 and palmitoleic acid ethyl ester were also assessed. Dydio (5 or 10 mg·kg ) was administered after the induction in vivo of Tauro-induced AP (Wistar rats), caerulein-induced AP and palmitoleic acid plus ethanol-induced AP (Balb/c mice). Pancreatitis was assessed biochemically and histologically. Activation of pancreatic PI3Kγ/Akt was measured by immunoblotting.Dydio inhibited Tauro-induced activation of the necrotic cell death pathway and prevented pancreatitis stimuli-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Therapeutic administration of Dydio ameliorated biochemical and histopathological responses in all three models of AP through pancreatic mitochondrial protection and PI3Kγ/Akt inactivation. Moreover, Dydio improved pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury through preventing excessive inflammatory responses.These data provide in vitro and in vivo mechanistic evidence that the  analogue, Dydio could be potential treatment for AP.

The results showed that dioscin significantly restored fructose-induced renal injury by decreasing the levels of Cr, BUN, and rehabilitating histopathological changes. In addition, dioscin markedly adjusted the levels of MDA, SOD and GSH-Px, reduced ROS level in renal tissue, and decreased the levels of TG, FFA, α-SMA and COL1A. Mechanistic study showed that dioscin significantly up-regulated the expression levels of Sirt3, SOD2, and then suppressed inflammation by decreasing the expression levels of NF-kB, HMGB1, c-Jun, c-Fos, COX2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, dioscin-caused high levels of Sirt3 and SOD2 attenuated oxidative stress by regulating the expression levels of Nrf2, GST, Keap1, regulated lipid  by controlling the expression levels of SREBP-1c, SCD-1, FASn, ACC, CPT1, and adjusted TGF-β1/Smad signal to inhibit renal fibrosis. In summary, dioscin showed protective effects against fructose-induced renal damage via adjusting Sirt3-mediated oxidative stress, renal fibrosis, lipid  and inflammation, which should be considered as one candidate to treat renal injury in the future.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress and death receptor signaling  in PPI-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Analysis demonstrated that PPI could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Investigation into the molecular mechanism of PPI indicated that PPI notably mediated ER stress activation via IRE-1 overexpression and activation of the caspase-12 to protect HepG2 cells against apoptosis. In addition, PPI markedly induced the expression of death receptors signaling -associated factors, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1/TNF- and FAS/FASL. Additionally, suppression of the death receptor signaling  with a caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, revealed an increase in the death rate and apoptotic rate of HepG2 cells. Collectively, the findings of the present study suggested that the ER stress and death receptor signaling  were associated with PPI-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis; however, endoplasmic reticulum stress may serve a protective role in this process. The combination of PPI and Z-IETD-FMK may activate necroptosis, which enhances apoptosis.

Lanosterol synthase (LAS) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS) are phylogenetically related enzymes. Cycloartenol is the accepted precursor leading to cholesterol and phytosterols, and in potato, to steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) biosynthesis. LAS was also shown to synthesize some plant sterols, albeit at trace amounts, questioning its role in sterol homeostasis. Presently, a potato LAS-related gene (StLAS-like) was identified and its activity verified in a yeast complementation assay. A transgenic approach with targeted gene expression and  profiling of sterols and SGAs was used. Analyses of StLAS-like transcript levels and StLAS-like-promoter::GUS reporter assays indicated specific expression in tuber flesh tissue. Overexpression of Arabidopsis AtLAS in leaves where the endogenic StLAS-like is not expressed, resulted with increased SGA level and reduced phytosterol level, while in the tuber flesh SGA level was reduced. StLAS-like expression only in tuber flesh may explain the differential accumulation of SGAs in commercial cultivars-low in tubers, high in leaves. In leaves, to maintain phytosterol homeostasis, an excess of intermediates may be diverted into SGA biosynthesis, whereas in tuber flesh these intermediates are catalyzed by tuber-specific StLAS-like instead, resulting in low levels of SGA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27989874>Effect of Diabetea tea ™ consumption on inflammatory cytokines and  biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients.</a></h1><p>Diabetea tea™ (DT) is an anti-diabetic alternative medicine in some Asian countries. The main constituent of DT is black tea originating from Camellia sinensis that is supplemented by 12 other medicinal plants. Black tea contains a large amount of the flavonoids catechins especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative capacity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of DT intake on inflammatory cytokines, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and  biomarkers in T2DM.The study included 50 patients with T2DM. The patients had received 3 cups (600ml) of DT extract or placebo (PL) extract per day during a period of 12 weeks. Intracellular cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) as well as the glycemic and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after the treatment period. The active constituents of the medicinal plants included in DT were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).Ingestion of DT suppressed CD4+ T cell expression of IL-1β and Il-8 (p<0.05) and up-regulated the expression of IL-10 and the Treg/IL-17 ratio (p<0.05) which was not shown in PL. A significant decrease in HbA1c and LDL was observed at the end of the study period (p<0.05) in DT. The GC/MS analyses of DT indicated the presence of lupeol, β-Amyrin and β-sitosterol. Also analyses of individual herbs showed the presence of higher levels of lupeol and β-Amyrin in Nuga Ficus bengalensis and β-sitosterol in the Attikka Ficus racemosa, indicating that the active ingredients of DT are concentrated in these two herbs.The present study provides evidence that DT has hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Interestingly, DT has anti-inflammatory effects. These properties are attributed to the flavonoids, triterpenes and phytosterol contents of the tea. We suggest that DT protects against diabetes complications in the long term.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The present study demonstrated that PPI had an inhibitory effect through inducing apoptosis and autophagy in THP-1 and NB4 cells. PPI induced apoptosis via activating JNK pathway, as evidenced by the decreased Bcl-2 levels and increased Bax, cleaved-caspase-3 and phosphorylated-JNK expressions. In addition, PPI promoted autophagy as evidenced with increased expressions of LC3-II and Beclin-1 in western blot and autophagic vacuoles in MDC staining, which was associated with the inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathway. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor SP600125 and autophagy inhibitor 3-MA were employed to evaluate the role of apoptosis and autophagy in PPI-induced cell death. We found that autophagy and apoptosis were both causes of cell death induced by PPI.

Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial dynamics are closely implicated in carcinogenesis including CRC. Paris Saponin II (PSII), a major steroidal saponin extracted from Rhizoma Paris polyphylla, has emerged as a potential anticancer agent. However, the effects of PSII on CRC and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we found PSII induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in HT 29 and HCT 116 cells, and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. PSII inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) by dephosphorylating Drp1 at Ser616, leading to the suppression of mitochondrial fission. PSII also suppressed NF-κB activation as a result of the inhibition of IKKβ and p65 translocation. Drp1 knockdown remarkably downregulated the nuclear expression of p65 and its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc in HCT 116 cell, confirming the link between mitochondrial fission and NF-κB pathway. Silencing of Drp 1 enhanced the inhibitory effects of PSII on p65 phosphorylation and the expressions of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, revealing that the inhibitory effects of PSII on cyclin D1 and c-Myc were relevant in the suppression of Drp1 and NF-κB activation. An in vivo study demonstrated PSII remarkably decreased the xenograft tumor size and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Drp1 at Ser616. Taken together, our results suggested that PSII could inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis, at least in part, by regulating mitochondrial fission and NF-κB pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

DAPI staining and Wright-Giemsa staining were performed to check for apoptosis. Detection of apoptotic protein and AML1-ETO signaling protein expression were conducted by Western blot analysis. Our results suggested that PPI decreased growth and induced apoptosis in a dosage-dependent manner in the t(8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1. PPI significantly downregulated AML1-ETO expression in a dosage- and time-dependent manner. PPI also upregulated P21 and downregulated survivin expression by reducing AML1-ETO. Mechanistically, PPI significantly reduced the expression of C-KIT, another therapeutic target for AML with t(8;21), followed by inhibition of Akt signaling. These results suggest that PPI can suppress growth and induce apoptosis of t(8;21) AML by suppressing the AML1-ETO and C-KIT/Akt signaling .

In conclusion, it has been shown that the proliferation of α-chaconine and α-solanine in human endometrial carcinoma cells reduces the expression and activity of the Akt and ERα signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871063>Dioscorea esculenta-induced increase in muscle sex steroid hormones is associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity in a type 2 diabetes rat model.</a></h1><p>The effects of chronic Dioscorea esculenta administration and exercise training on muscle sex steroid hormone levels and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes rats was assessed. Twenty-week-old male Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were assigned randomly to the control, D. esculenta treatment, D. esculenta with 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment, or the exercise training groups (running at 25 m/min for 1 h, 5 d/wk; n = 10 each group). Eight weeks of D. esculenta treatment or exercise training significantly attenuated the increase in plasma insulin and fasting glucose levels. Plasma and muscle concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the expression of 5α-reductase increased significantly in the D. esculenta-treated and exercise training groups, and both treatments led to the upregulation of glucose transporter-4 translocation with concomitant increases in PKB and PKC-ζ/λ phosphorylation. Furthermore, the glucose  clearance rate, which represents insulin sensitivity, increased significantly in both the D. esculenta-treated and exercise training groups. These effects were suppressed by administration of the DHT synthetic inhibitor. Together, these findings suggest that the D. esculenta-induced increase in muscle sex steroid hormone levels helps decrease insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.-Sato, K., Fujita, S., Iemitsu, M.

In the present study, in vivo test of Dox-induced nephrotoxicity in rats and in vitro model in NRK-52E cells were developed. The results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated cell injury, obviously reduced ROS level in vitro, and markedly decreased the levels of BUN, Cr, MDA, and notably increased the levels of SOD, GSH and GSH-Px in rats. Mechanistic studies showed that dioscin significantly increased the levels of p-AMPKα, Nrf2, HO-1 and GST by activation of FXR against oxidative stress. In addition, dioscin suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and HMGB1, and subsequently decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α against inflammation. These results were further validated by knockdown of FXR using siRNA silencing, and abrogation of FXR using NDB (a FXR inhibitor) in NRK-52E cells, and the results suggested that the protective effect of dioscin against Dox- induced nephrotoxicity via adjusting FXR-mediated signal to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, molecular docking assay showed that dioscin directly targeted with FXR through competing with Helix12 (H12) by hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect and electrostatic interactions. In a word, our data showed that dioscin is a novel and potent FXR agonist to suppress inflammation and oxidative stress against Dox-induced nephrotoxicity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these lipids was studied in detail by investigating the effects of several structural aspects including the type of hydrophobic tails, the chain length and saturation degree. In addition, several assays were used to study their interactions with plasmid DNA, and results reveal that these lipids could condense DNA into nanosized particles with appropriate size and zeta-potentials. MTT-based cell viability assays showed that lipoplexes 5 had low cytotoxicity. The in vitro gene transfection studies showed the hydrophobic tails clearly affected the TE, and hexadecanol-containing lipid 5b gives the best TE, which was 2.2 times higher than bPEI 25k in the presence of 10% serum.

Whether SLBZP is best employed as single agent or adjunctive therapy has yet to be determined as does the mechanism whereby SLBZP exerts its anti-tumor effects.To investigate the effects of SLBZP alone and in combination with Cytoxan (CTX) on tumor growth, malignant cell apoptosis and Akt/Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-КB) signaling in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving chemotherapy.Sixty-four adult mice developed HCC following subcutaneous inoculation with H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Seven days later, all received chemotherapy with CTX (200mg/kg) once. Mice were then randomized into eight study groups (N=8/group). Three groups were treated with different concentrations of SLBZP alone (6.00, 3.00, 1.5g/kg), three with SLBZP (6.00, 3.00, 1.5g/kg) plus CTX (20mg/kg), one with CTX (20mg/kg) alone (positive control), and one with physiologic saline (untreated, negative control). All groups were treated for 14 days. Tumor size, histology and serum or tissue levels and/or mRNA expression of PDGF-BB, VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, NF-КB, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2); B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL); X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), Survivin, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Caspase-7, Akt and phosphorylated Akt expression were documented at the end of treatment.Compared to untreated negative controls, tumor sizes were decreased in the CTX alone, SLBZP (M)+CTX and SLBZP (H)+CTX groups (-52%,-53% and -58% respectively). Tumor cell density was decreased in all treated groups but most apparent in the SLBZP (H)+CTX group. Electron microscopic evidence of apoptosis was also most apparent in this group. Serum and/or tissue levels and expression of PDGF-BB, VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, their downstream signaling proteins and anti-apoptotic markers were lowest and pro-apoptotic markers highest in SLBZP (H)+CTX treated mice.In this chemotherapy-induced animal model of HCC, SLBZP was most efficacious as adjunctive therapy and appears to act by inhibiting tumor growth promoters and anti-apoptotic proteins while enhancing pro-apoptotic proteins.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this paper, the results indicated that dioscin significantly increased cell viability, and inhibited inflammation and apoptosis caused by hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury in IEC-6 cells. in vivo II/R injury, dioscin markedly suppressed inflamma- tion and apoptosis, improved pathological changes, and depressed chiu' score in rats.

However, the effect of dioscin on thioacetamide (TAA)-induced acute liver injury still remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dioscin confers a protective effect against TAA-induced acute liver injury in rats and mice. The results showed that dioscin decreased the serum levels of ALT, AST, and rehabilitated histopathological changes compared with the model groups. In addition, dioscin obviously increased the levels of GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, and significantly reduced MDA levels compared with the model groups. Mechanistic study showed that dioscin significantly up-regulated the expression levels of FXR, p-AMPKα, and then increased the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, GCLM and GST. Furthermore, dioscin obviously down-regulated the expression levels of NF-κB (p65), ICAM-1, HMGB1, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6.

In spite of aggressive treatment, osteosarcoma has a high mortality rate with minimal improvements in survival over past few decades. Polyphyllin I (PPI), a component in the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Paris polyphylla Smith, has been shown to have anti-tumor properties. However, its mechanism as an anti-osteosarcoma agent has not been well elucidated. In this study, we found that PPI suppressed osteosarcoma cell viability, arrested cell cycle in G/M phase, induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, PPI significantly suppressed intratibial primary tumor growth in xenograft orthotopic mouse model without any obvious side effects. These therapeutic efficacies were associated with inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, as PPI treatment decreased the amount of p-GSK-3β, leading to down-regulated levels of active β-catenin. PPI induced inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability was abolished upon addition of GSK-3β specific inhibitor, CHIR99021, while PPI induced inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability and migration were potentiated by β-catenin silencing. These findings suggested that, in vitro and in vivo, PPI treatment inhibited osteosarcoma, at least in part, via the inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, PPI could serve a novel therapeutic option for osteosarcoma patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902279>Metabolite profiling and in vitro biological activities of two commercial bitter melon (Momordica charantia Linn.) cultivars.</a></h1><p>The current study was designed to characterize the metabolite profile and bioactivity of two commercial bitter melon (Momordica charantia Linn.) genotypes.

Total phenolic levels were the highest (57.28 ± 1.02) in methanolic extract of the inner tissue of Indian Green cultivar, which also correlated to the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (30.48 ± 2.49 ascorbic acid equivalents (mg of AAE)/g of FD). In addition, highest levels of total saponins were observed in chloroform extract of the Chinese bitter melon pericarp (75.73 mg ± 4.67  equivalents (DE)/g of FD). Differential inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity was observed in response to polarity of extract, cultivar and tissue type.

In addition, knockdown of HSC70 significantly promoted axonal growth in neurons. As an association molecule of HSC70 in neurons, α-tubulin was detected by immunoprecipitation. After Aβ treatment, α-tubulin expression was greatly reduced in the degenerated axons, suggesting that a decline in α-tubulin may be one of the factors which correlates with axonal disruption in AD pathology. We hypothesized that the degradation of α-tubulin is triggered by the chaperone activity of HSC70.

In the present study, we found that polyphyllin I induces mitochondrial translocation of DRP1 by dephosphorylating DRP1 at Ser637, leading to mitochondrial fission, cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol and, ultimately apoptosis. Polyphyllin I also increased the stabilization of full-length PINK1 at the mitochondrial surface, leading to the recruitment of PARK2, P62, ubiquitin, and LC3B-II to mitochondria and culminating in mitophagy. PINK1 knockdown markedly suppressed polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and enhanced polyphyllin I-induced, DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of DRP1 by mdivi-1 or shRNA inhibited PINK1 knockdown/polyphyllin I-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, suggesting that PINK1 depletion leads to excessive fission and, subsequently, mitochondrial fragmentation. An in vivo study confirmed that polyphyllin I greatly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 xenografts, and these effects were enhanced by PINK1 knockdown. These data describe the mechanism by which PINK1 contributes to polyphyllin I-induced mitophagy and apoptosis and suggest that polyphyllin I may be an effective drug for breast cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27294908>Probing Steroidal Substrate Specificity of Cytochrome P450 BM3 Variants.</a></h1><p>M01A82W, M11A82W and M01A82WS72I are three cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) variants. They can catalyze the hydroxylation of testosterone (TES) and norethisterone at different positions, thereby making them promising biocatalysts for steroid hydroxylation. With the aim of obtaining more hydroxylated steroid precursors it is necessary to probe the steroidal substrate diversity of these BM3 variants. Here, three purified BM3 variants were first incubated with eight steroids, including testosterone (TES), methyltestosterone (MT), cholesterol, β-sitosterol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), , pregnenolone and ergosterol. The results indicated that the two 3-keto-Δ⁴-steroids TES and MT can be hydroxylated at various positions by the three BM3 mutants, respectively. On the contrary, the three enzymes displayed no any activity toward the remaining six 3-hydroxy-Δ⁵-steroids. This result indicates that the BM3 mutants prefer 3-keto-Δ⁴-steroids as hydroxylation substrates. To further verify this notion, five other substrates, including two 3-hydroxy-Δ⁵-steroids and three 3-keto-Δ⁴-steroids, were carefully selected to incubate with the three BM3 variants. The results indicated the three 3-keto-Δ⁴-steroids can be metabolized to form hydroxysteroids by the three BM3 variants. On the other hand, the two 3-hydroxy-Δ⁵-steroids cannot be hydroxylated at any position by the BM3 mutants. These results further support the above conclusion, therefore demonstrating the 3-keto-Δ⁴-steroid substrate preference of BM3 mutants, and laying a foundation for microbial production of more hydroxylated steroid intermediates using BM3 variants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515374>Polyphyllin I Overcomes EMT-Associated Resistance to Erlotinib in Lung Cancer Cells via IL-6/STAT3 Pathway Inhibition.</a></h1><p>Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is the most important limiting factor for treatment efficiency in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Much work has linked the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to the emergence of drug resistance, consequently, ongoing research has been focused on exploring the therapeutic options to reverse EMT for delaying or preventing drug resistance. Polyphyllin I (PPI) is a natural compound isolated from Paris polyphylla rhizomes and displayed anti-cancer properties. In the current work, we aimed to testify whether PPI could reverse EMT and overcome acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. We exposed HCC827 lung adenocarcinoma cells to erlotinib which resulted in acquired resistance with strong features of EMT. PPI effectively restored drug sensitivity of cells that obtained acquired resistance. PPI reversed EMT and decreased interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3) signaling pathway activation in erlotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, addition of IL-6 partially abolished the sensitization response of PPI. Furthermore, co-treatment of erlotinib and PPI completed abrogation of tumor growth in xenografts, which was associated with EMT reversal. In conclusion, PPI serves as a novel solution to conquer the EGFR-TKI resistance of NSCLC via reversing EMT by modulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. Combined PPI and erlotinib treatment provides a promising future for lung cancer patients to strengthen drug response and prolong survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30716316>Natural compound methyl protodioscin protects rat brain from ischemia/reperfusion injury through regulation of Mul1/SOD2 pathway.</a></h1><p>Methyl protodioscin (MPD) is reported to relieve angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia, and mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 (Mul1) plays a key role in maintaining mitochondrial functions. Bioinformatic analysis shows potential interactions between MPD and Mul1. This study aims to explore whether MPD could protect rat brain against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury through regulation of Mul1/ superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) pathway. The SD rat brains were subjected to 2 h of ischemia following by 24 h of reperfusion, which showed I/R injury (increase in neurological deficit score and infarct volume), up-regulation of Mul1 and down regulation of SOD2, these phenomena were attenuated by MPD treatment (3 or 10 mg/kg, i.g.). Consistently, in cultured HT22 cells, hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) treatment induced cellular injury (apoptosis and LDH release) concomitant with up-regulation of Mul1 and down regulation of SOD2, these phenomena were blocked in the presence of MPD (5 μM). Knockdown of Mul1 could also decrease SOD2 protein levels in HT22 cells accompanied by alleviation of H/R injury (reduction of apoptosis and LDH release). In agreement with the change of SOD2, reactive oxygen species generation was increased in H/R-treated HT22 cells while decreased in the presence of MPD. Based on these observations, we conclude that upregulation of Mul1 in rat brain contributes to cerebral I/R injury via suppression of SOD2 and that MPD protects rat brain from I/R injury through a mechanism involving regulation of Mul1/SOD2 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We found that α-solanine (10 μM) disturbed meiotic resumption and increased abnormal spindle formation and altered the cortical granule (CG) distribution compared with the untreated group. α-Solanine triggered autophagy and apoptosis by increasing the expressions of autophagy-related genes (LC3, ATG7, and LAMP2) and apoptotic related genes (BAX and CASP3). Exposure of porcine oocytes to α-solanine significantly increased the levels of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3. Moreover, α-solanine significantly reduced the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates, decreased the total and inner cell mass cells numbers, and increased apoptosis in these porcine embryos. Taken together, our data indicate that α-solanine toxically impairs oocyte maturation and quality by triggering autophagy/apoptosis and facilitating epigenetic modifications.

Despite the well-touted effects of tribulus (Tribulus terrestris L) on men's health, an optimal phytotherapy remains an elusive challenge.We sought to critically analyze the evidence in the phytotherapic literature beyond the effects of tribulus on testosterone (T) concentration and sperm analysis to also include indications for prostate health.A focused literature search was conducted to include studies published in Cochrane, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases between the years 2002 and 2018.The use of tribulus and maca (Lepidium meyenii Walp, Brassicaceae) were not scientifically supported to improve serum T levels in men.

Evidence supporting the use of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens, (W.Bartram) Small, Arecaceae) to improve prostate health remains equivocal; whereas, evidence supporting the use of Pygeum africanum Hook.f., Rosaceae, Urtica dioica L., Urticaceae, beta-sitosterols, pollen extract, onion, garlic, and tomato, appears favorable and promising.Scientific evidence supports the use of mucuna and ashwagandha as phytotherapics for improving serum T concentrations and semen parameters. Despite inconclusive evidence for use of tribulus as a T booster, it may provide advantageous effects on sperm parameters in men with idiopathic infertility. Nutraceutical strategies and some phytotherapics may also be effective to promote prostate health. Popular foodstuffs (onion, garlic, and tomato), nutraceutical agents (pollen extract and beta-sitosterols), and herbal medicines (Pygeum africanum and Urtica dioica) are rational approaches.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have suggested that lipid overload is the key initial factor that contributes to hepatic steatosis. Our previous study indicated that  (DSG) has a beneficial effect on  metabolism, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Human normal hepatocytes (LO2 cells) were incubated with palmitic acid to establish the cell model of nonalcoholic fatty liver. The effects of DSG on lipid metabolism, glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress, lipid consumption and lipid synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that palmitic acid induced obvious lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular lipid content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty acid β-oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis. The above changes might be mediated by the activation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A pathway and inhibition of the SREBP-1c/FAS pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739054>Dioscin Promotes Proliferation of Pancreatic Beta Cells via Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling .</a></h1><p>Dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells is related with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dioscin, a natural steroid saponin, has many pharmacological effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dioscin on apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells induced by high glucose.Pancreatic cell line RNAKT-15 was treated with 20 mM glucose with or without different concentrations of dioscin and viability and apoptosis of cells were measured. Western blot assay was used to measure the expression levels of some proteins such as phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the pro-inflammatory cytokines.High-glucose could significantly increase cell RNAKT-15 apoptosis and reduce cell viability (p < 0.01). Dioscin could improve the cell degeneration (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that high-glucose could increase the proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (INF-γ), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), while these effects were reduced when treated with dioscin (p < 0.05). Western blot results demonstrated that high-glucose affects p-GSK 3β and β-catenin expression levels (p < 0.01) and dioscin could significantly reduce these two protein levels (p < 0.05).The effects of dioscin against high-glucose induced apoptosis of pancreatic cells may occur through the Wnt signaling pathway. High-glucose led to increased pancreatic cell apoptosis and dioscin could attenuate these impairments. These findings highlight an important role of dioscin in the treatment potential of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189140>Optimal Fermentation Conditions of Hyaluronidase Inhibition Activity on  Merrill by .</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to evaluate the hyaluronidase (HAase) inhibition activity of  (AC) extracts following fermentation by  through response surface methodology. To optimize the HAase inhibition activity, a central composite design was introduced based on four variables: the concentration of AC extract (: 1-5%), amount of starter culture (: 1-5%), pH (: 4-8), and fermentation time (: 0-10 days). The experimental data were fitted to quadratic regression equations, the accuracy of the equations was analyzed by ANOVA, and the regression coefficients for the surface quadratic model of HAase inhibition activity in the fermented AC extract were estimated by the  test and the corresponding  values. The HAase inhibition activity indicated that fermentation time was most significant among the parameters within the conditions tested. To validate the model, two different conditions among those generated by the Design Expert program were selected. Under both conditions, predicted and experimental data agreed well.

In this study, the effects and possible mechanisms of dioscin against hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury in IEC-6 cells and II/R injury in mice were investigated. The results showed that dioscin markedly increased cell viability, and reduced ROS level caused by H/R injury in IEC-6 cells. in vivo, dioscin significantly reduced the levels of MDA, MPO and chiu' score, increased SOD level, and improved pathological changes caused by II/R injury in mice. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin markedly up-regulated the expression levels of Sirt6 by decreasing miR-351-5p levels, decreased the expression levels of p-FoxO3α via activating AMPK, and increased the expression levels of MnSOD and CAT. In addition, miR-351-5p mimic in IEC-6 cells and agomir in mice increased ROS levels and aggravated II/R injury. MiR-351-5p inhibitor in IEC-6 cells and antagomir in mice alleviated these actions by adjusting Sirt6 signal pathway. MiR-351-5p interference experiment further confirmed that dioscin increased Sirt6 expression level by down- regulating miR-351-5p level to inhibit oxidative stress and reduce II/R injury. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that dioscin inhibited the expression level of miR-351-5p via reducing TRBP expression level during the generation of miR-351-5p mature body. Dioscin showed protective effect against II/R injury via adjusting miR- 351-5/Sirt6 signal to reduce oxidative stress, which should be considered as one potent candidate to treat II/R injury. In addition, miR-351-5/Sirt6 could be one effective drug target against II/R injury.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The rats were divided into 5 groups: control group, control+dioscin group, model group (diabetes), DDL group (diabetic rats treated with 100 μg/kg/day dioscin) and DDH group (diabetic rats treated with 200 μg/kg/day dioscin). Each group was continuously intervened for 6 weeks. Hemodynamic parameters were detected and pathological alterations of myocardium were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Inflammatory response and related proteins in the NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway were detected by western blot.Dioscin treatment can increase ejection fraction (EF) and decrease left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as well as time constant of left ventricular pressure decay (Tau) parameters in diabetic rats, suggesting the improvement of left ventricular function. By histopathology observation, we found that dioscin treatment can also improve myocardial histological lesions caused by diabetes. In addition, the levels of inflammatory cytokines TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-1β of the model group were remarkably higher than those in the control group (<0.01), while after being treated with dioscin these cytokines were obviously decreased (<0.05). The levels of PDE-5, PKG and p-VASP in the diabetic rats were significantly declined after being treated by dioscin in a dose-dependent manner (<0.05).Dioscin may prevent the myocardial injury in diabetic rats by up-regulating NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG pathway.© 2019 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27649624>Dioscin attenuates gastric ischemia/reperfusion injury through the down-regulation of PKC/ERK1/2 signaling via PKCα and PKCβ2 inhibition.</a></h1><p>We previously reported the promising effects of dioscin against cerebral and renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, its role against gastric I/R injury has not yet been reported. Thus, the aim of the present work was to investigate the protective effect and possible mechanisms of dioscin against gastric I/R.The hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model in GES-1 cells and the celiac artery occlusion model in rats were carried out in the study.Dioscin markedly attenuated H/R insult in GES-1 cells and gastric I/R injury in rats. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dioscin-induced gastric protection was accompanied by inhibiting the levels of PKCα, PKCβ2 and phosphorylation via decreasing Raf-1 level. Blockade of PKC/ERK1/2 signaling pathway by dioscin decreased MEK1/2 level, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation, NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional activities, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and up-regulated PPAR-γ level. Moreover, the results of small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpression of PKCα and PKCβ2 confirmed that dioscin attenuated gastric I/R injury through inhibiting PKC/ERK1/2 signaling by down-regulating PKCα and PKCβ2.These data confirmed the protective effect of dioscin against gastric I/R injury, which should be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute gastric mucosal lesions in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the main components in the Rhizoma of Paris polyphyllin, displays a selective inhibitory effect on various tumor cells. Here we sought to investigate the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects and mechanisms of PPI on macrophages  and .  , primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and peritoneal elucidated macrophages (PEMs) were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon (IFN)-γ and then treated with PPI. We determined the degree of activation of IKKα/β and p65, two key mediators of the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway, by measuring their phosphorylated forms by Western blot. The p65 nuclear localization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Further, a NF-κB-linked luciferase reporter plasmid, as well as those expressing key mediators of the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway, such as myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) associated kinase (IRAK)-1, TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF)-6, Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and p65, were used to identify the mechanism by which PPI achieves its inhibitory effects on macrophage-mediated inflammation. Moreover, a NF-κB inhibitor, p65-targeted siRNAs, and a p65 plasmid were further used to validate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PPI. , PPI (1 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically one time a day for 7 weeks starting on the 42nd day after the first immunization with collagen in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Micro-computed Tomography scanning, histological examination, F4/80 and iNOS double immunofluorescent staining and CD4 immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine the effect of PPI treatment on joint structure and inflammation in this model.  PPI reduced the inflammatory cytokines production of PEMs stimulated by LPS/IFN-γ, inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and p65, and prevented p65 nuclear localization. The NF-κB luciferase assay showed that the target of PPI was closely related to the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, NF-κB inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p65, and p65 overexpression eliminated PPI's inhibitory effect. In addition, PPI attenuated the bone erosion and synovitis, as well as M1-like macrophage and T cell infiltration, in the ankle joint of the CIA model.  PPI demonstrated effective amelioration of synovial inflammation in the ankle joint of CIA mice while suppressing NF-κB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory effectors in activated macrophages.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408964>Complex formation equilibria between cholesterol and  analogues in monolayers determined by the Langmuir method.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between  analogues [DioA:  acetate (DAc) and (25)-5α,6β-dihydroxyspirostan-3β-ol acetate (DSol)] and cholesterol (Ch) monolayers at the air/water interface. The surface tension of pure and mixed lipid monolayers at 22 °C was measured by using the Langmuir method with a Teflon trough and a Nima 9002 tensiometer. The surface tension values were used to calculate the π-A isotherms and to determine the molecular surface areas.

The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on lipid metabolism. Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral fat was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an  expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral fat accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27107248>Quantitative determination of sarsasapogenin in rat plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Sarsasapogenin, a natural compound from Chinese medical herb Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge., has recently received a great deal of attention due to its various bioactivities. In this study, an easy and applicable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantification of sarsasapogenin in rat plasma was developed. Sample preparation was accomplished through a simple one-step protein precipitation procedure with methanol. Negative electrospray ionization was performed using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode with transitions of m/z 417.4/273.2 for sarsasapogenin, and 415.2/271.4 for  (internal standard). The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.5-500ng/mL (r=0.9994), with a lower limit of quantification at 0.5ng/mL. The RSD of intra- and inter-day precision was below 6.41%, and accuracy ranged from 87.60% to 99.20%. The RSD of matrix effect and recovery yield was within ±15% of nominal concentrations and sarsasapogenin was stable during stability tests. This validated method had been successfully applied to the preclinical pharmacokinetic studies of sarsasapogenin in rats. The half-life (t1/2) was (15.1±2.3), (16.1±3.0) and (15.4±3.9) h after single intragastric administration of 25, 50 and 100mg/kg sarsasapogenin, respectively.

Female Wistar rats underwent a sham operation (SHAM group) or ovariectomy. OVX rats were treated using vehicle (OVX group), DIO (DIO group) or estradiol valerate (EV group) for 12 weeks. After treatment, the biomarkers of bone turnover in plasma and the microstructure of alveolar bone were assessed. lncRNA microarrays were applied to assess lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in alveolar bone in the OVX and DIO group rats. Subsequently, the differentially expressed mRNAs associated with the comprehensive bone metabolism pathway in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were identified and regarded as key mRNAs. Based on some of the key mRNAs and all the differentially expressed lncRNAs, a coexpression network was established and this network was further analyzed to identify the top 6 lncRNAs with the highest closeness scores (pivotal lncRNAs). Finally, 6 modules showing interactions between pivotal lncRNAs and key mRNAs were constructed. All of the pivotal lncRNAs and key mRNAs were validated with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The present findings demonstrated that DIO suppressed the loss of alveolar bone in OVX rats, and the changes to the expression of some lncRNAs or mRNAs occurred in the alveolar bone of the rats in the DIO group. Twenty-four key mRNAs were identified during pathway analysis. Furthermore, 8/24 key mRNAs ( and ) were used to establish a coexpression network, which included 1,656 nodes and 5,341 edges. During network analysis, 6 pivotal lncRNAs (XR_008346, MRuc007iji, MRAK157089, MRAK076413, MRAK143591 and AB036696) were obtained, and 6 modules illustrating pivotal lncRNA-key mRNA interactions were identified. These results revealed that the anti-osteoporotic effect of DIO on alveolar bone may be associated with the promotion of a bone formation process through increasing the signaling of the Wnt and BMPs pathways and the inhibition of the bone resorption process through decreasing stimulators of osteoclastogenesis. To conclude, several pivotal lncRNAs may serve important roles in these processes via regulating some key mRNAs in the bone metabolism pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29460615>Precursor-Receptor Interactions in the Twin Arginine Protein Transport Pathway Probed with a New Receptor Complex Preparation.</a></h1><p>The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system moves folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts.

However, the clinical efficacy of radiotherapy is not satisfactory α-Solanine is a bioactive component of steroidal glycoalkaloids which has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-metastasis activity in different cancers. In the present study, we determined the effect of α-solanine on the radiosensitivity of EC cells and priliminarily explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was conducted to found the cytotoxic effect of α-solanine on EC cells. CCK-8 assay and colony-forming survival assays were performed to explore the effect of α-solanine on cell viability and proliferation of EC cells after irradiation. Immunofluorescence and comet assays were used to detect the effect of α-solanine on DNA repair capacity of EC cells after irradiation. The flow cytometry (FCM) and Hoechst/PI staining were conductd to study the effect of α-solanine on apoptosis of EC cells after irradiation.The cytotoxic effect of α-solanine to EC cells was dose-dependent. The results of CCK-8, colony-forming survival assay, immunofluorescence, comet assay, FCM and Hoechst/PI staining showed that α-solanine could enhance the radiosensitivity of EC cells. α-Solanine could downregulate Survivin expression level by upregulating miR-138 expression in EC cells. Upregulation of miR-138 and knock down Survivin both enhanced the radiosensitivity of EC cells. Moreover, Survivin could restore the effect of α-solanine and miR-138 on radiosensitivity of EC cells.α-solanine could enhance the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer cells by inducing microRNA-138 expression, and probably be an effective radiosensitizer in treating EC.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Dioscin exerts protective effects against tumor growth and ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, whether and how dioscin attenuates angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiac hypertrophy is still unknown. In the current study, we found that dioscin attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and restored the impaired cardiac function induced by AngII infusion in vivo. In addition, dioscin blocked the activation of the MAPK and Akt/GSK3β/mTOR  and nuclear accumulation of p-Akt1 in AngII-infused mice. In vitro, dioscin inhibited the activation of the MAPK and Akt/GSK3β/mTOR  and nuclear translocation of p-Akt1 and thus alleviated the hypertrophic growth. Our study demonstrated dioscin protects against AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy via inhibition of the MAPK and Akt/GSK3β/mTOR  and is a potential therapeutic candidate.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TKI resistance caused by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations at T790M and c-Met amplification occurs through persistent activation of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling . We therefore expected that dual inhibitors of both signaling  could overcome TKI resistance in lung adenocarcinoma. Here, dioscin was selected from a product library of Chinese naturally occurring compounds and overcame TKI resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells. Mechanistically, dioscin may down-regulate the expression of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) at the transcription level by increasing p53 binding to the SHP2 promoter due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Simultaneous inhibition of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT activation via decreased SHP2 expression and its interaction with GAB1 may be responsible for dioscin-mediated TKI sensitivity. A higher unfavorable response to TKI therapy occurred more commonly in patients with high SHP2 mRNA expression than in patients with low SHP2 mRNA expression. Therefore, we suggest that dioscin may act as a dual inhibitor of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling  to overcome TKI resistance via dysregulation of SHP2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115455>Dioscin inhibits ischemic stroke‑induced inflammation through inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/NF‑κB signaling pathway in a rat model.</a></h1><p>, as an essential natural steroidal saponin, can be extracted from numerous sources, primarily from fenugreek. It is an important raw material for the synthesis of steroid hormone drugs. It exhibits antitumor, anti‑inflammatory, antioxidation and several other significant pharmacologic actions, and is of high pharmaceutical value. In the present study, the activities and underlying mechanisms of dioscin in the inhibition of ischemic stroke in rats were investigated. Inflammatory responses wer analyzed using ELISA kits and caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 activity was analyzed using Caspase‑3 and caspase‑9 activity kits. Western blot analysis was used to measure Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB), transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1), high‑mobility group protein 1 (HMGB‑1), interleukin‑1 receptor‑associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor‑associated factor 6 (TRAF6) protein expression. Dioscin inhibited infarct volume and neurological scores in the ischemic stroke rat model. The results demonstrated that dioscin reduced inflammatory responses, and suppressed the expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF‑κB, TGF‑β1, HMGB‑1, IRAK1, and TRAF6 in the rat ischemic stroke model. Taken together, these findings suggested that dioscin inhibited ischemic stroke‑induced inflammation through inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/NF‑kB‑induced inflammation the rat model, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the effect of dioscin as an anti‑inflammatory candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke in in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28143704>(22β,25R)-3β-Hydroxy-spirost-5-en-7-iminoxy-heptanoic acid exhibits anti-prostate cancer activity through caspase pathway.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men.  and related compounds are potential cytotoxic agents. Twelve diverse analogues of long chain fatty acid/ester of -7-ketoxime have been prepared. Six of the analogues exhibited significant anticancer activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines with IC ranging from 12 to 35μM. Compound 16, the best representative of the series exerted S phase arrest in DU145 prostate cancer cells and induced apoptosis through caspase pathway. Additionally, these analogues inhibited lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) up to 47.7% and 23.3% respectively. Compound 16 was found to be safe in acute oral toxicity in Swiss albino mice up to 300mg/kg dose.

In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of α-solanine isolated from "Jayoung" a dark purple-fleshed potato by examining its in vitro inhibitory effects on inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and its in vivo effects on LPS-induced septic shock in a mouse model. α-Solanine suppressed the expression of iNOS and COX-2 both at protein and mRNA levels and consequently inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. α-Solanine also reduced the production and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced by LPS. Furthermore, molecular mechanism studies indicated that α-solanine inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by reducing nuclear translocation of p65, degradation of inhibitory κBα (IκBα), and phosphorylation of IκB kinaseα/β (IKKα/β). In an in vivo experiment of LPS-induced endotoxemia, treatment with α-solanine suppressed mRNA expressions of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and the activation of NF-κB in liver. Importantly, α-solanine increased the survival rate of mice in LPS-induced endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis models. Taken together, our data suggest that the α-solanine may be a promising therapeutic against inflammatory diseases by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. J. Cell.

Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms by which MPD induced apoptosis in MG-63 cells. The data showed that MPD significantly suppressed cell growth (cell viabilities: 22.5 ± 1.9% for 8 μM MPD versus 100 ± 1.4% for control, P < 0.01) and enhanced cell apoptosis. The exposure to MPD resulted in a significant induction of reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (P < 0.01, all cases). Furthermore, treatment with MPD increased the levels of phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK and markedly decreased the levels of phosphorylated ERK in MG-63 cells. Co-administration of the JNK-specific antagonist, the p38-specific antagonist, or the caspase antagonist (P < 0.05, all cases) has reversed the apoptotic effects in MPD treatment. We also found that exposure to MPD resulted in a significant reduction in the protein level of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, survivin, and XIAP (P < 0.05, all cases). In conclusion, our results indicate that MPD induces apoptosis of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells, at least in part, by caspase-dependent and MAPK signaling .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27421653>Inhibition of EZH2 via activation of SAPK/JNK and reduction of p65 and DNMT1 as a novel mechanism in inhibition of human lung cancer cells by polyphyllin I.</a></h1><p>Polyphyllin I (PPI), a bioactive phytochemical extracted from the Rhizoma of Paris polyphylla, has been reported to exhibit anti-cancer activity. However, the detailed mechanism underlying this remains to be elucidated.Cell viability and cell cycle distribution were measured using a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) mRNA was measured by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was performed to examine the phosphorylation and protein expression of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), p65, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and EZH2. Exogenous expression of p65, DNMT1, and EZH2 were carried out by transient transfection assays. Promoter activity of EZH2 gene was determined using Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. A xenografted tumor model in nude mice and bioluminescent imaging system were used to further test the effect of PPI in vivo.We showed that PPI significantly inhibited growth and induced cell cycle arrest of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that PPI increased the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, reduced protein expression of p65 and DNMT1. The inhibitor of SAPK/JNK (SP600125) blocked the PPI-inhibited p65 and DNMT1 protein expression. Interestingly, exogenously expressed p65 overcame PPI-inhibited protein expression of DNMT1. Moreover, PPI reduced EZH2 protein, mRNA, and promoter activity; overexpression of EZH2 resisted the PPI-inhibited cell growth, and intriguingly, negative feedback regulation of SAPK/JNK signaling. Finally, exogenous expression of DNMT1 antagonized the PPI-suppressed EZH2 protein expression. Consistent with this, PPI inhibited tumor growth, protein expression levels of p65, DNMT1 and EZH2, and increased phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK in vivo.Our results show that PPI inhibits growth of NSCLC cells through SAPK/JNK-mediated inhibition of p65 and DNMT1 protein levels, subsequently; this results in the reduction of EZH2 gene expression. The interactions among p65, DNMT1 and EZH2, and feedback regulation of SAPK/JNK by EZH2 converge on the overall responses of PPI. This study reveals a novel mechanism for regulating EZH2 gene in response to PPI and suggests a new strategy for NSCLC associated therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28677770>The function of androgen/androgen receptor and insulin growth factor‑1/insulin growth factor‑1 receptor on the effects of Tribulus terrestris extracts in rats undergoing high intensity exercise.</a></h1><p>Our previous study demonstrated that treatment with Tribulus terrestris (TT) extracts (120 mg/kg) promoted the muscle weight gain and performance of rats undergoing high intensity exercise. The present study was designed to explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of treatment with TT extracts and the involvement of androgens, the androgen receptor (AR), insulin growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1) and the IGF‑1 receptor (IGF‑1R). A total of 32 Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: Control; TT, treated with TT extracts, E, high intensity exercise; E+TT, high intensity exercise plus TT treatment. The rats of the E and E+TT groups underwent high intensity exercise with a progressively increasing load for 5 weeks, and TT extracts were intragastrically administered in the TT and E+TT rats 30 min prior to training. TT extract composition was analyzed using ultra‑high performance liquid chromatography‑quadrupole‑time of flight mass spectrometry. Testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels and AR, IGF‑1R and myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein levels in muscles were determined by ELISA and western blotting, respectively. The saponins tigogenin and  comprised ~71.35% of the total peak area. Compared with the E group, TT extracts increased the testosterone and IGF‑1 plasma levels, and AR, IGF‑1R and MHC protein levels in the gastrocnemius of rats undergoing high intensity exercise, accompanied with increased body weight and gastrocnemius weight. In conclusion, the effect of TT extracts on the performance of high intensity exercise rats may be attributed to increased levels of circulating testosterone and IGF‑1 and increased AR and IGF‑1R protein expression levels in the gastrocnemius, resulting in increased muscle weight and increased MHC in the gastrocnemius. The present study provided preliminary evidence supporting the use of TT extracts as a dietary supplement for the promotion of skeletal muscle mass increase and the enhancement of athletic performance in humans performing high intensity exercise.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28259652>Effect of orally ingested  into diet on skin collagen content in a low collagen skin mouse model and its mechanism of action.</a></h1><p>Influence on collagen content with oral ingestion of  (Dios) was investigated in established low collagen skin mouse model. And its mechanism of action was investigated using primary cultured fibroblasts.Hairless mice were fed a low protein diet with Dios for 8weeks and the contents of collagen in skin were determined by measuring the content of hydroxyproline (Hyp). In primary cultured fibroblasts, the numbers of fibroblast were determined by incubating with Dios for 120h; the contents of Hyp were determined by incubating with Dios for 24 or 72h using fibroblasts of confluent state; the expressions of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were determined by incubating with Dios for 24h.Oral ingestion of Dios in the diet for 8weeks led to a dose-dependent increase in the Hyp content as collagen content of skin. In proliferating of primary cultured fibroblasts, Dios treatment led to a decrease of adenosine 5'-triphosphate content indicating decrease of the cell number. In the cells reached to confluent, although increase of Hyp content in the control indicating progress of fibroblasts differentiation were observed, the content of Hyp remained unchanged with Dios treatment. Finally, addition of Dios led to a decrease the α-tubulin and c-fos mRNA expressions relating to the cell cycle.It is concluded that Dios can improve skin collagen content by shifting the dynamics of the fibroblasts from proliferation to differentiation via cell cycle arrest.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In current investigation Solanidine, a steroidal alkaloid was evaluated on tumorigenesis by targeting death signal using multiple tumor cells and model systems.Anti-proliferative effect was evaluated using cytotoxic studies. Prolonged cytotoxic effect of Solanidine was examined by colony formation assay. Exhibition of apoptotic hallmark induced by Solanidine was examined using FACS analysis, Annexin-V staining, Acridine orange staining, TUNEL assay. Altered gene expression was evaluated using Immunoblot, Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry technique. In-vitro results were revalidated in EAC solid tumor and CAM xenograft model.Solanidine exerts its potential effect in a target specific manner. The cytotoxic/anticlonogenic activity was due to induction of typical cellular apoptotic hallmarks and cell cycle blockage at S-G2/M phase. The molecular events underlying this effect is through activation of intrinsic pathway via Bax, Bad and Cytochrome c activation by neutralizing Bcl-2 expression, along with downregulated PI3K/Akt survival signal. As a consequence, downstream pro apoptogenic gene, active Caspase-3 was over expressed by Solanidine to cleave its substrate PARP and promotes nuclear import of DFF-40. Anti-carcinogenic aptitude was further confirmed by murine solid tumors and in-vivo CAM xenograft studies.Solanidine emerged as active molecule against tomorigenesis by activating nuclear import of DFF-40 mediated nucleosomal disruption and cell demise.

In this study, the water-soluble micromolecule compounds in SLDS were quantified through H NMR. Using SLDS as the substrate to conduct ABE fermentation by Clostridium beijerinckii, the fermentation cycle was shortened 24h, the maximum biomass and consumption rate of the glucose significantly increased, and the productivity of total solvents were increased by 0.244±0.010g/L/h compared to standard P medium. Expression analysis of genes encoding key enzymes involved in acetone and butanol production and glucose consumption showed that they were induced by SLDS.

Dioscin shows anti-inflammatory effects in our previous works. However, the action of the compound on SIRS still remained unknown. In the present paper, zymosan induced generalized inflammation (ZIGI) models in mice and rats, and PMA-differentiated THP‑1 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4 (Pam3CSK4) were used. The results showed that dioscin significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP‑1 cells stimulated by LPS and Pam3CSK4, obviously reduced the soakage of inflammatory cells and necrosis in liver, kidney and intestine of rats and mice, and reduced peritoneal ascites fluid compared with ZIGI model groups. In addition, dioscin significantly declined the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rats and mice. The migration of macrophages in tissues was also suppressed by dioscin. Mechanism investigation showed that dioscin significantly inhibited the expression levels of TLR2, MyD88, NF‑κb, HMGB‑1, increased the expression levels of IKBα, and decreased the mRNA levels of interleukin‑1 beta (IL‑1β), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6) and tumor necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α) in liver, kidney, intestine tissues of rats and mice, and in PMA-differentiated THP‑1 cells, which were further confirmed by TLR2 siRNA silencing in vitro. In conclusion, our data confirmed that dioscin exhibited protective effects against SIRS via adjusting TLR2/MyD88 signal pathway, which should be developed as one potent candidate to treat SIRS in the future.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms of  (DG) that promote cholesterol homeostasis and alleviate hypercholesterolemia remain elusive. To investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of the promotion of cholesterol  by DG, a rat model of hypercholesterolemia was induced by providing a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the rats were intragastrically administered high-dose DG (0.3 g/kg/d), low-dose DG (0.15 g/kg/d) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) once a day for 8 weeks. The serum and hepatic cholesterol were tested, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and the ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) transporters were measured. The results indicate that DG could reduce body weight, decrease the serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels compared to those in the controls. Simultaneously, liver tissue pathological morphology analyses revealed that DG could attenuate hepatic steatosis compared to that in the high-fat diet group. Further investigation demonstrated that DG significantly decreased the expression of NPC1L1 and LXR-α in the intestine and markedly increased the expression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver and intestine. Compared to the high-fat diet group, the rats in the DG-treated groups ameliorated hypercholesterolemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that DG may not only inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by downregulating NPC1L1 but also enhance cholesterol excretion by increasing the expression of ABCG5/G8.

Here, we have assessed the effects and the possible mechanisms of dioscin against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity.We used an in vivo model of CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity in rats and mice and, in vitro, cultures of NRK-52E and HK-2 cells. The dual luciferase reporter assay was used to demonstrate modulation, by dioscin, of the targeting of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) by microRNA (miR)-34a. Molecular docking assays were used to analyse the effects of dioscin with Sirt1, Keap1 and NF-κB.Dioscin attenuated cell damage in vitro and decreased renal injury in rats and mice, treated with CDDP. In terms of mechanisms, dioscin reversed CDDP-induced up-regulation of miR-34a and thus up-regulated Sirt1 levels. In addition, dioscin altered levels of haem oxygenase 1, glutathione-cysteine ligase subunits (GCLC, GCLM) and Keap1, along with increased nuclear translocation of Nrf2, thus decreasing oxidative stress. Also, dioscin affected levels of AP-1, COX-2, HMGB1, IκB-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α and decreased the ratio of acetylated NF-κB and normal NF-κB, to suppress inflammation. From molecular docking assays, dioscin directly bound to Sirt1, Keap1 and NF-κBp65 by hydrogen bonding and/or hydrophobic interactions.Our results have linked CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity and the miR-34a/Sirt1 signalling pathway, which was modulated by dioscin. This natural product could be developed as a new candidate to alleviate CDDP-induced renal injury.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954389> a phytosterol substitute for cholesterol, prolongs the lifespan and mitigates glucose toxicity via DAF-16/FOXO and GST-4 in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>Caenorhabditis elegans is a sterol auxotroph requires minute amount of exogenous sterol for their growth and development. To culture the C. elegans, cholesterol was given as sterol molecule to maintain the optimum survival of worms.  (DG), a plant derived steroidal saponin, structurally similar to cholesterol has been used as a precursor for the synthesis of steroidal hormones. In this study, worms were cultured with cholesterol (Cho) and cholesterol-free (Cho) medium with DG (5, 10 and 50μg/mL) at 20°C. It was observed that worms cultured in (Cho) exhibits late egg production, reduced lipid level and short lifespan, while addition of DG overcomes all defective facts. Combinations of both cholesterol and DG further extend the lifespan (20.8%), hinder lipid level and resistance to oxidative, thermal and high glucose stress. The intracellular ROS quantification was done by flouroscenic probe H2DCF-DA and confirmed that DG had significantly reduced ROS level (35.85%). Increased lifespan of worms were observed in the medium treated with DG which activates the nuclear translocation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, followed by downstream antioxidant gene sod-3 as evidenced by GFP tagged strain. The expression of Phase II detoxification enzyme GST-4 significantly (p<0.001) increased in transgenic worms exposed to DG with 50mM glucose, and storage of lipid in intestinal cells was reduced in N2 wild type worms. Genetic requirement of DG induced longevity was studied with different mutant strains of mev-1, daf-16, skn-1, and eat-2. These studies have proved that DG is a sterol source to worms and modulate the DAF-16, SOD-3 and GST-4 expression levels to extend the lifespan of worms.

Dioscin showed protective effect against liver fibrosis in our previous studies, and in the present work, SILAC-based proteomics was employed to test the underlying mechanism. A total of 121 differentially expressed proteins caused by dioscin in LX-2 cells were found, and dioscin significantly decreased the expression levels of FN, FAK1, ITGA5, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR, Col1a1, Col1a2, Col2a1, Col5a1, Col6a1, and increased 2ABB level in vivo and in vitro. Thus, we elucidated that dioscin specifically suppressed collagen synthesis through modulating PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, we found that dioscin directly targeted with ITGA5 by molecular docking assay. SiRNA and overexpression transfection tests showed that ITGA5 siRNA plus dioscin slightly altered the effect of ITGA5 siRNA, and ITGA5 DNA transfection reversed the inhibitory effect of dioscin on collagen expressions via PI3K/Akt pathway.

Moreover, PSI enhanced CPT/HCPT-mediated inhibition of p38 MAPK and activation of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in H1299 cells, and suppression of Akt and ERK  activation in H460 cells as well as in H446 cells. Collectively, our results demonstrated that PSI functions as a chemosensitizer by enhancing apoptosis through influencing p38 MAPK, ERK, and Akt  in lung cancer cells, and the combination with CPT/HCPT might be a promising strategy for the development of new therapeutic agents.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present work aimed to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of dioscin in preventing LPS-induced kidney injury. In vivo injury was induced in rats and mice with an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10mg/kg), and in vitro studies were performed on NRK-52E and HK-2 cells challenged with LPS (0.5μg/ml). Our results indicated that dioscin significantly protected against renal damage by decreasing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and reversing oxidative stress. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that dioscin markedly up- regulated the level of the microRNA let-7i, resulting in significant inhibition of TLR4 expression. Dioscin significantly down-regulated the levels of MyD88, NOX1 and cleaved caspase-8/3; inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB; inhibited PI3K and Akt phosphorylation; increased the levels of SOD2; and decreased the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, Fas and FasL. In vitro, transfection of microRNA let-7i inhibitor and TLR4 DNA were applied, and the results further confirmed the nephroprotective effect of dioscin in suppressing TLR4/MyD88 signaling and subsequently inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, the abrogation of cellular MyD88 expression by ST2825 eliminated the inhibitory effect of dioscin on the levels of nuclear NF-κB, cleaved caspase-3, SOD2 and ROS. These data indicated that dioscin exerted a nephroprotective effect against LPS-induced inflammatory renal injury by adjusting the microRNA let-7i/TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms of this therapeutic candidate for the treatment of inflammatory kidney injury.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have indicated that  may inhibit high glucose‑induced renal tubular fibrosis; however, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have focused on the effects of  on cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the effects of  on angiotensin II (Ang II)‑induced ECM remodeling, and its possible mechanism in rat CFs. CFs were pre‑incubated with  (1, 5 and 10 µM) for 24 h and were then stimulated with Ang II (100 nM) for 24 h. Cell proliferation was estimated using the MTS assay. The expression levels of α‑SMA, fibronectin, collagen I, TGF‑β1, in addition to phosphorylation of Smad3 were detected by western blotting. The results demonstrated that  inhibited Ang II‑induced CF proliferation and the differentiation of CFs to myofibroblasts. In addition,  was able to inhibit Ang II‑induced ECM expression in rat CFs. Furthermore,  inhibited Ang II‑induced expression of transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1) and Smad3 phosphorylation in CFs. Taken together, these results suggest that  may inhibit Ang II‑induced ECM remodeling by suppressing the TGF‑β1/Smad3 signaling pathway in rat CFs. Therefore,  may possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis.</p></html>
