Plasma ammonia concentrations increased to 411 microm within 1 h of the start of infusion of ammonium acetate at 567 mmol/h. The rate constant for ammonia clearance from plasma was 0 x 054/min and the half-life was 12 x 9 min. Infusion at 567 mmol/h for 1 h followed by 1 h without infusion, repeated four times between am- and pm-milking, caused a decrease in feed intake. Compared with sodium acetate, continuous infusion of ammonium acetate at 360 mmol/h throughout an entire 10-h milking interval increased plasma ammonia concentrations to 193 microm and caused a 20% decrease in milk, protein and lactose production with no effect on percentage composition of milk or the yield of milk . Arterial concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids tended to increase; there was no effect on arterial acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate or triacylglcerol, and branched-chain amino acids, Lys and  decreased. Mammary plasma flow, estimated by assuming 100% uptake/output of +Tyr, was significantly correlated with milk yield. Mammary uptakes of acetate tended to be reduced by hyperammonaemia, but uptakes of other energy metabolites and amino acids were not affected. Thus, while an increase in amino acid consumption during hyperammonaemia was apparent from the drop in circulating concentrations of Leu, Ile, Val, Lys and , there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that milk yield is affected by the lower concentrations. An ammonia-induced depression in feed intake may have caused the decrease in milk synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013895>Eight Collagen Peptides from Hydrolysate Fraction of Spanish Mackerel Skins: Isolation, Identification, and In Vitro Antioxidant Activity Evaluation.</a></h1><p>A previous report indicated that collagen hydrolysate fraction (F7) from Spanish mackerel () skins showed high reducing power and radical scavenging activities on 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (EC value of 1.57 mg/mL) and hydroxyl (EC value of 1.20 mg/mL). In this work, eight peptides were isolated from F7 and identified as Gly-Pro-Tyr (GPY, 335.31 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Glu (GPTGE, 459.47 Da), Pro--Gly-Pro-Asp (PFGPD, 531.52 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Ala-Lys (GPTGAKG, 586.65 Da), Pro-Tyr-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gly (PYGAKG, 591.69 Da), Gly-Ala--Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly (GATGPQG, 586.61 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Pro-Met (GPFGPM, 604.73 Da), and Tyr-Gly-Pro-Met (YGPM, 466.50 Da), respectively. Among them, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM exhibited strong radical scavenging activities on DPPH (EC values of 0.80, 3.02, and 0.72 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), hydroxyl (EC values of 0.81, 0.66, and 0.88 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), superoxide anion (EC values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.73 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) cation (EC values of 0.86, 1.07, and 0.82 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively) in a positive concentration-activity relationship. Furthermore, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM could effectively reduce Fe to Fe and inhibit  peroxidation. Hence, eight collagen peptides from hydrolysate of Spanish mackerel skins might be served as antioxidant candidates for various industrial applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23137850>Novel adipokinetic hormones in the kissing bugs Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma infestans, Dipetalogaster maxima and Panstrongylus megistus.</a></h1><p>Peptides of the adipokinetic hormone (AKH)/red pigment-concentrating hormone (RPCH) family were isolated and sequenced from the retrocerebral corpora cardiaca of four kissing bugs which are all vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi responsible for Chagas' disease. The sequence of three novel AKHs were deduced from the multiple MS(N) electrospray mass data: the octapeptide pGlu-Leu---Ser--Asp-Trp amide (denoted Rhopr-AKH) in Rhodnius prolixus and Panstrongylus megistus, the nonapeptide pGlu-Leu----Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly amide (denoted Triin-AKH) in Triatoma infestans and the decapeptide pGlu-Leu---Ser-Asp-Gly-Trp-Gly-Asn amide (denoted Dipma-AKH) in Dipetalogaster maxima. The sequences were confirmed by identical behavior of natural and synthetic forms in reversed-phase HPLC and by CID-MS mass spectra. Conspecific injections of a dose of 10 pmol of the respective synthetic peptides resulted in a small but significant increase of the  concentration in the hemolymph. These experiments suggest that AKHs in kissing bugs act to regulate , possibly during dispersal flights which is one of the mechanisms whereby the insects reach new outbreak areas.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude , amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight,  percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude , Gly, Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude , C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude  and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20467241>Neuroprotective effects of a novel peptide purified from venison protein.</a></h1><p>A novel antioxidative peptide (APVPH I, antioxidative peptides from venison protein hydrolysates I) was purified from venison by enzymatic hydrolysis, column chromatography of DEAE-Sephacel and high performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of the purified peptide was found to be 9,853 Da and the amino acid sequences of the purified peptide was Met-Gln-Ile--Val-Lys--Leu--Gly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of APVPH I against H2O2-induced neuronal cells damage in PC-12 cells. Antioxidative enzyme levels in cultured neuronal cells were increased in the presence of the peptide. In addition, APVPH I inhibited productions of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and cell death against H2O2-induced neuronal cells damage in PC-12 cells. It was presumed to be APVPH I involved in regulating the apoptosis-related gene expression in the cell environment.

As with other amyloid proteins, misfolding of huntingtin is related to Huntington's disease through  that can involve interactions with phospholipid membranes. Experimental results suggest that the N-terminal 17-amino-acid sequence (htt(NT)) positioned just before the Q(N) region is important for the binding of huntingtin to membranes. Through all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we unveil the structure and dynamics of the htt(NT)Q(N) fragment on a phospholipid membrane at the atomic level. We observe that the insertion dynamics of this peptide can be described by four main steps-approach, reorganization, anchoring, and insertion-that are very diverse at the atomic level. On the membrane, the htt(NT) peptide forms a stable α-helix essentially parallel to the membrane with its nonpolar side-chains-mainly Leu-4, Leu-7, -11 and Leu-14-positioned in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Salt-bridges involving Glu-5, Glu-12, Lys-6, and Lys-15, as well as hydrogen bonds involving -3 and Ser-13 with the phospholipids also stabilize the structure and orientation of the htt(NT) peptide. These observations do not significantly change upon adding the Q(N) region whose role is rather to provide, through its hydrogen bonds with the phospholipids' head group, a stable scaffold facilitating the partitioning of the htt(NT) region in the membrane. Moreover, by staying accessible to the solvent, the amyloidogenic Q(N) region could also play a key role for the oligomerization of htt(NT)Q(N) on phospholipid membranes.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315826>Effect of extrusion processing of soybean meal on ileal amino acid digestibility and growth performance of broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>The present experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of extrusion of inadequately processed soybean meal (SBM) on amino acid (AA) digestibility and performance of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of Lys, , Cys, Leu, , Tyr, Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily weight gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459844>Protein and energy intakes affected amino acid concentrations in plasma, muscle, and liver, and cell signaling in the liver of growing dairy calves.</a></h1><p>The nutrient content of and feeding recommendations for milk replacers (MR) vary widely in North America, and acceleration of growth through manipulation of protein and energy intakes can reduce rearing costs of dairy operations. The effects of varying the protein and energy intake of MR on metabolite concentrations in plasma, liver, and muscle and the phosphorylation activity of protein kinase B (AKT) and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) cell signals in liver and muscle were assessed. Twenty-four newborn Holstein calves were fed 1 of 4 MR for 9 wk (n=6/treatment): (1) a 20% crude protein (CP), 20%  MR fed at 441 g of dry matter (DM)/d (CON); (2) a high-protein, medium- MR (HPMF; 28% CP, 20% ) fed at 951 g of DM/d; (3) a high-protein, high- MR (HPHF; 27% CP, 28% ) fed at 951 g of DM/d; and (4) HPHF fed at 1,431 g of DM/d (HPHF+). Water and starter (20% CP, 1.43% ) were offered ad libitum and calves were fed MR twice daily. Plasma samples were obtained at 1, 5, and 9 wk of age. Calves were not weaned and were slaughtered after the last blood sampling. Liver and muscle tissues were collected and analyzed for metabolite concentrations and cell signaling activity. Calves fed all treatments had lower plasma concentrations of  and Tyr, and a trend for lower Leu, but greater concentrations of  relative to calves fed CON. Calves fed all treatments had increased muscle concentrations of Met and muscle to plasma ratios of , Tyr, and branched-chain amino acids compared with CON. All treatments increased liver to plasma ratios of  and Tyr but diminished the ratios of Met compared with CON. Phosphorylation of protein kinase B was not affected by treatment; however, relative to calves fed HPHF, HPMF and HPHF+ diets increased phosphorylation ratios of ribosomal protein S6 in the liver. Therefore, the changes in plasma and tissue concentrations and plasma to tissue ratios of amino acids were associated with enhanced growth rates. However, cell signaling activity was not consistent with accelerated growth in calves fed treatments with increased contents of energy and protein possibly due to confounding effects of diet (MR + starter) or fasting before tissue harvesting. Muscle concentrations of Met might have a regulatory role in protein synthesis in rapidly growing calves fed high levels of CP and energy.Copyright © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

They are important cell-surface antigens that are implicated in the pathogenesis of opportunistic mycobacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium avium complex. In this contribution, we described multiple-stage linear ion trap in conjunction with high-resolution mass spectrometry towards structural characterization of complex GPLs as [M + Na](+) ions isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species. Following resonance excitation in an ion trap, MS(n) spectra of the [M + Na](+) ions of GPLs contained mainly b and y series ions that readily determine the peptide sequence. Fragment ions from MS(n) also afford locating the 6-dTal and O-methyl rhamnose residues linked to the D-allo- and terminal L-alaninol of the peptide core, respectively, as well as recognizing the modifications of the glycosides, including their acetylation and methylation states and the presence of succinyl group. The GPL families consisting of 3-hydroxy fatty acyl and of 3-methoxy fatty acyl substituents are readily distinguishable. The MS profiles of the GPLs from cells are dependant on the conditions they were grown, and several isobaric isomers were identified for many of the molecular species. These multiple-stage mass spectrometric approaches give detailed structures of GPL in complex mixtures of which the isomeric structures are difficult to define using other analytical methods.Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10681410>Binding of hepatic lipase to heparin. Identification of specific heparin-binding residues in two distinct positive charge clusters.</a></h1><p>The interaction of hepatic lipase (HL) with heparan sulfate is critical to the function of this enzyme. The primary amino acid sequence of HL was compared to that of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a related enzyme that possesses several putative heparin-binding domains. Of the three putative heparin-binding clusters of LPL (J. Biol. Chem. 1994. 269: 4626-4633; J.  Res. 1998. 39: 1310-1315), one was conserved in HL (Cluster 1; residues Lys 297-Arg 300 in rat HL) and two were partially conserved (Cluster 2; residues Asp 307- 320, and Cluster 4; residues Lys 337, and  432-Arg 443). Mutants of HL were generated in which potential heparin-binding residues within Clusters 1 and 4 were changed to Asn. Two chimeras in which the LPL heparin-binding sequences of Clusters 2 and 4 were substituted for the analogous HL sequences were also constructed. These mutants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and assayed for heparin-binding ability using heparin-Sepharose chromatography and a CHO cell-binding assay. The results suggest that residues within the homologous Cluster 1 region (Lys 297, Lys 298, and Arg 300), as well as some residues in the partially conserved Cluster 4 region (Lys 337, Lys 436, and Arg 443), are involved in the heparin binding of hepatic lipase. In the cell-binding assay, heparan sulfate-binding affinity equal to that of LPL was seen for the RHL chimera mutant that possessed the Cluster 4 sequence of LPL. Mutation of Cluster 1 residues of HL resulted in a major reduction in heparin binding ability as seen in both the cell-binding assay and the heparin-Sepharose elution profile. These results suggest that Cluster 1, the N-terminal heparin-binding domain, is of primary significance in RHL. This is different for LPL: mutations in the C-terminal binding domain (Cluster 4) cause a more significant shift in the salt required for elution from heparin-Sepharose than mutations in the N-terminal domain (Cluster 1).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146434>2,4-Diamino-5-(2'-arylpropargyl)pyrimidine derivatives as new nonclassical antifolates for human dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.</a></h1><p>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been a well-recognized target for the development of therapeutics for human cancers for several decades. Classical inhibitors of DHFR use an active transport mechanism to gain access to the cell; disabling this mechanism creates a pathway for resistance. In response, recent research focuses on nonclassical -soluble DHFR inhibitors that are designed to passively diffuse through the membrane. Here, a new series of propargyl-linked antifolates are investigated as potential nonclassical human DHFR inhibitors. Several of these compounds exhibit potent enzyme inhibition with 50% inhibition concentration values under 500 nM. Molecular docking investigations show that the compounds maintain conserved hydrogen bonds between the pyrimidine ring and the enzyme as well as form van der Waals interactions with critical residues in the active site. Interestingly, the most potent compound, 2,4-diamino-5-(3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-1-ynyl)-6-ethylpyrimidine (compound 35), is 3500-fold more potent than trimethoprim, a potent inhibitor of bacterial DHFR but weak inhibitor of human DHFR. The two structural differences between compound 35 and trimethoprim show that the propargyl linkage and the substitution at C6 of the pyrimidine ring are critical to the formation of contacts with  56, Ser 59, Ile 60, Leu 22,  31 and  34 and hence, to enhancing potency. The propargyl-linked antifolates are efficient ligands with a high ratio of potency to the number of non-hydrogen atoms and represent a potentially fruitful avenue for future development of antineoplastic agents.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding betaine-containing molasses on performance of transition dairy cows during late summer in 2 trials. In early September, cows were randomly assigned to betaine (BET) or control (CON) groups either shortly after dry off (trial 1; n = 10 per treatment) or 24 d before calving (trial 2; n = 8 per treatment) based on parity and previous mature equivalent milk yield. Cows were fed common diets supplemented either with a liquid supplement made of molasses from sugar cane and condensed beet solubles containing betaine [BET, 89.1 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] or a sugar cane molasses-based liquid supplement without betaine (CON) until 8 wk postpartum. The liquid supplements had similar nutrient contents and were fed at a rate of 1.1 and 1.4 kg DM/d for pre- and postpartum cows, respectively. Starting at their entry in the studies, cows were housed in the same freestall barn without a cooling system. After calving, all cows were housed in the same barn cooled by misters and fans and milked thrice daily. Intake was recorded daily and body weight and body condition score were assessed every 2 wk. Milk yield was recorded at each milking and composition was analyzed weekly. Blood samples were collected weekly from a subset of cows to assess concentrations of metabolites and AA. No treatment effects were apparent for DM intake and body weight in the prepartum and postpartum periods. For cows enrolled at dry off, BET supported higher milk yield (45.1 vs. 41.9 kg/d) and fat content (4.78 vs. 4.34%) and elevated plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in early lactation compared to CON. However, no differences were observed for milk yield, most milk component contents and yields, and blood metabolites between treatments for cows enrolled during the close-up period. Compared to cows in the CON group, BET cows enrolled during the far-off period tended to have lower plasma concentrations of Met, , and Trp during the pre- and postpartum periods. They also had lower plasma concentrations of Lys and  before calving but higher plasma Gly concentration after parturition. In conclusion, feeding a betaine-containing liquid supplement from far-off through early lactation improves lactation performance but increases adipose tissue mobilization and production of ketone bodies in early lactation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Both AKHs are released into the blood during flight and serve to regulate  and other physiological processes involved in flight. By in vitro "pulse-chase" experiments we show that 2 precursors (P1 and P2) are involved in AKH biosynthesis. These are about 8.4 kDa polypeptides which are AKH immunoreactive but also contain an amino acid (tyrosine) not present in the AKH peptides. By following the fate of 14C-tyrosine incorporated into P1 and P2, we have identified 2 novel products of precursor processing. These are called AKH-Precursor Related Peptides or APRP 1 and APRP 2. Size exclusion chromatography shows that the APRPs are about 6.5 kDa large and therefore represent major fragments of the precursors. The optical density peaks corresponding to P1, P2, APRP 1, and APRP 2 on a reverse-phase chromatogram are identified. The precursors being metabolic intermediates are represented by minor optical density peaks that disappear when de novo protein synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide. In contrast, the APRPs are represented by major optical density peaks consistent with their being accumulating end products of AKH precursor processing. The function of the APRPs is as yet unknown. They are, however, co-synthesized and also co-released with the AKHs, and may therefore also have hormonal functions related to flight.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2054098>The adipokinetic neuropeptide of Mantodea.

The adipokinetic peptide of H. alata is an octapeptide with the sequence pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp amide denoted Schgr-AKH-II which was sequenced previously from the corpora cardiaca of a number of Caelifera, Ensifera and some Hymenoptera. A dose of 1pmol of synthetic Schgr-AKH-II causes a pronounced hyperlipaemic effect in the twig wilter. Physiological experiments with the twig wilter reveal that during flight periods of 3 min, the normally low carbohydrate concentration in the haemolymph is significantly diminished, whereas the  concentration stays constant in most cases. During a subsequent rest period of 60 min after a 3 min flight episode, however, the concentration of lipids in the haemolymph increases substantially and significantly, indicating that lipids, too, are a major fuel during flight of twig wilters. This is corroborated by the activation of the enzyme triacylglycerol (TAG) lipase in the  body, but not in the flight muscles, by injection of 5 pmol of synthetic Schgr-AKH-II, the endogenous adipokinetic hormone that is thought to be released during flight. Moreover, in the thorax there is a significant decrease in the concentration of glycogen and lipids measured after flight plus 60 min of rest compared to non-flown twig wilters, whereas no significant changes were monitored for these substrates stored in the abdomen. When the change in  class composition was analysed during flight plus 60 min of rest, TAG which comprised the major class in all compartments analysed (thorax, abdomen, haemolymph) was significantly reduced in abdomen and thorax, and diacylglycerol was significantly increased in all three compartments. From all the data collected, it is concluded that lipids are the major fuel class for flight in H. alata and that the contribution of carbohydrates is minimal.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17604877>Water scorpions (Heteroptera, Nepidae) and giant water bugs (Heteroptera, Belostomatidae): sources of new members of the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone family.</a></h1><p>Two novel octapeptide members of the AKH/RPCH family have been identified from the corpora cardiaca (CC) of two species of water bugs. The giant water bug Lethocerus indicus (family: Belostomatidae) contains a peptide code-named Letin-AKH with the sequence pGlu-Val-Asn--Ser-Pro-Tyr-Trp amide, and the water scorpion Nepa cinerea (family: Nepidae) has the peptide code-named Nepci-AKH with the sequence pGlu-Leu/Ile-Asn--Ser-Ser-Gly-Trp amide. The sequences were deduced from the multiple MS(N) electrospray mass data from crude CC extracts. Synthetic peptides were made and co-elution on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with the natural peptide from crude gland extract confirmed the accuracy of the deduced sequence for Letin-AKH and demonstrated that Nepci-AKH contains a Leu residue at position 2 and not an Ile residue. A previously characterized member of the AKH/RPCH family was identified in the stick water scorpion Ranatra linearis by mass spectrometry: Grybi-AKH (pGlu-Val-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp amide) has the same mass (919 Da) as Nepci-AKH and differs in two positions from Nepci-AKH (residues 2 and 6). The apparent function of the peptides is to achieve  mobilization in the species under investigation; indications for this came from conspecific bioassays using the appropriate synthetic peptides for injecting into the insects. This function is very likely linked to dispersal flight  of water bugs. Swimming activity in N. cinerea also results in an increase in  concentration in the hemolymph.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23684032>Purification and identification of five novel antioxidant peptides from goat milk casein hydrolysates.</a></h1><p>The present research described the preparation, purification, and identification of antioxidant peptides from goat milk casein (GMC). Goat milk casein was hydrolyzed by using a combination of neutral and alkaline proteases to obtain goat milk casein hydrolysates (GMCH) with high antioxidant activity. After desalting by nonpolar macroporous absorption resin, GMCH was isolated and purified by gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, respectively, and further identified by nanoliter electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Antioxidant activities of GMC, GMCH, and pure peptides were evaluated and compared using free radical scavenging activity, metal ion chelating ability, and anti-lipid peroxidation ability. Compared with GMC, the free radical-scavenging ability and ferrous ion-chelating ability of GMCH increased significantly. The inhibition effect of lipid peroxidation of GMCH was much stronger than that of tert-butylhydroquinone and phytogermine and a little lower than that of ascorbic acid. The antioxidant activity of GMCH could be attributed to the high antioxidant activity of oligopeptides, especially 5 novel oligopeptides: Val-Tyr-Pro-, -Gly-Gly-Met-Ala-His, -Pro-Tyr-Cys-Ala-Pro, Tyr-Val-Pro-Glu-Pro-, and Tyr-Pro-Pro-Tyr-Glu--Tyr, which were first observed in GMCH. The antioxidant activity of these 5 novel oligopeptides and GMCH increased 3.59 to 380 times compared with GMC, combining anti-lipid peroxidation ability of GMCH, which indicated that GMCH and its purified fractions in different stages could be used as functional food ingredients, food additives, and pharmaceutical agents in the future.Copyright © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.

TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the -binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific  headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the -binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and -2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the -binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7910794>Cholecystokinin type A receptors mediate intestinal -induced inhibition of acid secretion through somatostatin-14 in dogs.</a></h1><p>This study was designed to examine whether one or both principle molecular forms of somatostatin (SLI), somatostatin-28 (S-28) and somatostatin-14 (S-14), mediate inhibition of stimulated gastric acid by intestinal  and to determine whether the mode of action includes activation of type A cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in conscious dogs. SLI molecular forms were separated by gel filtration chromatography after extraction of acidified plasma on octadecyl silyl cartridges and quantified by RIA. Basal plasma levels of S-28 and S-14 were 4.1 +/- 0.6 and 3.6 +/- 0.3 fmol/ml, respectively. Intraduodenal perfusion with a 10%  emulsion increased plasma S-28 by 6.3 +/- 1.2 fmol/ml (P < 0.01) and S-14 by 17.8 +/- 2.6 fmol/ml (P < 0.001), and suppressed by 76 +/- 3% (P < 0.001) gastrin (150 pmol/kg.h)-stimulated gastric acid. Blockade of type A CCK receptors with MK-329 (75 micrograms/kg, i.v.) abolished S-28 and S-14 responses (both P < 0.001) and completely reversed the inhibitory effect of gastric acid produced by intraduodenal . Intravenous infusions of S-14 dose-dependently inhibited gastrin-stimulated secretion with an estimated 50% inhibitory dose of 125 pmol/kg.h that achieved an incremental plasma S-14 rise of 40 +/- 2 fmol/ml; infusions of S-28 at 30 pmol/kg.h increased plasma S-28 by 47 +/- 3 fmol/ml without altering acid output. The SLI antagonist cyclo-[7-aminoheptanoly--D-Trp-Lys-(BZL)] (CyCam) reversed by 89 +/- 4% (P < 0.001) exogenous S-14-induced inhibition of gastrin-stimulated acid secretion, but did not influence gastric acid output after the infusion of S-28. CyCam also reversed by 139 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) the early phase of -induced acid inhibition; in the late phase, CyCam treatment was associated with a further 2-fold elevation of plasma peptide-YY (PYY) to 102 +/- 6 fmol/ml (P < 0.001) and a 75 +/- 5% suppression of gastric acid. Simulation of this plasma PYY increment with infusions of PYY at 50 pmol/kg.h inhibited by 44 +/- 5% gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. These results indicate that in conscious dogs, endogenous CCK mediation of intraintestinal -induced inhibition of stimulated acid secretion occurs in part through CCK type A receptor activation of S-14 secretion. Modulation of gastric acid by S-14 includes both inhibition and attenuation of further suppression via counterregulation of PYY secretion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7726575>Kinetic and pharmacologic characterization of phospholipases A2 from Bothrops neuwiedii venom.</a></h1><p>Two phospholipases A2 (PLA2) (EC 3.1.1.4) were purified from Bothrops neuwiedii venom (isoenzymes P-1 and P-2). The molecular weights of P-1 and P-2 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were 15,000 and 16,200 and the isoelectric points were 4.8 and 4.6, respectively. The N-terminal 14-amino-acid sequences determined were Asn-Leu-Val-Gln--Glu--Leu-Ile-Met-Met-Ile-Ala-Gly and Ser-Leu-Val-Gln--Glu--Leu-Ile-Met-Met-Ile-Ala-Gly for P-1 and P-2, respectively. Since both show sequence almost identical to that of a PLA2 from Crotalus atrox it was tentatively classified as being of group II. The enzymatic activity of P-1 and P-2 toward  monolayers was studied. The hydrolysis of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (dlPC) shows a broad optimum between 7 and 18 mN m-1 and a cut-off pressure of 22 mN m-1. The activity toward dlPC displays a maximum at pH 8 and is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ with an apparent Kd of 0.1 mM, for both enzymes. P-1 and P-2 are heat-stable enzymes, unable to hydrolyze dilauroylphosphatidic acid monolayers. The enzymes are not lethal to mice at doses up to 5 micrograms/g body weight by intraperitoneal injection and they do not show myotoxic (up to 40 micrograms) or hemolytic activity (up to 8.5 micrograms/ml). Both lack anti-coagulant activity, determined by absence of changes in the recalcification time of platelet poor plasma (up to 100 micrograms/ml), and are not able to induce platelet aggregation (up to 50 micrograms/ml). However, both isoenzymes exhibit an important edema-inducing activity that is not altered at short times by the irreversible chemical inactivation of the hydrolytic activity with phenacyl bromide. P-1 and P-2 are able to release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids of neutrophils, property that is lost by the inactivation of the enzyme. This suggests that the edema-inducing activity of the active but not the inactive forms may be partly due to arachidonic acid-derived mediators. The edema-inducing activity of the active or inactive forms of the enzymes is inhibited by antagonists of histamine, suggesting that histamine plays an important role in both the active and the inactive B. neuwiedii PLA2s-induced edema. The results suggest that the inflammatory and the catalytic activity of these enzymes constitute separate properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487716>Defining the Apoptotic Trigger: THE INTERACTION OF CYTOCHROME c AND CARDIOLIPIN.</a></h1><p>The interaction between cytochrome c and the anionic lipid cardiolipin has been proposed as a primary event in the apoptotic signaling cascade. Numerous studies that have examined the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin embedded in a variety of model phospholipid membranes have suggested that partial unfolding of the protein is a precursor to the apoptotic response. However, these studies lacked site resolution and used model systems with negligible or a positive membrane curvature, which is distinct from the large negative curvature of the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome c resides. We have used reverse micelle encapsulation to mimic the potential effects of confinement on the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin. Encapsulation of oxidized horse cytochrome c in 1-decanoyl-rac-glycerol/lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide/hexanol reverse micelles prepared in pentane yields NMR spectra essentially identical to the protein in free aqueous solution. The structure of encapsulated ferricytochrome c was determined to high precision (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 0.23 Å) using NMR-based methods and is closely similar to the cryogenic crystal structure (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 1.2 Å). Incorporation of cardiolipin into the reverse micelle surfactant shell causes localized chemical shift perturbations of the encapsulated protein, providing the first view of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction interface at atomic resolution. Three distinct sites of interaction are detected: the so-called A- and L-sites, plus a previously undocumented interaction centered on residues -36, Gly-37, -58, Trp-59, and Lys-60. Importantly, in distinct contrast to earlier studies of this interaction, the protein is not significantly disturbed by the binding of cardiolipin in the context of the reverse micelle.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504498>In vitro and in vivo studies on the antioxidant activity of fish peptide isolated from the croaker (Otolithes ruber) muscle protein hydrolysate.</a></h1><p>Peptide from croaker (Otolithes ruber) muscle protein hydrolysate was purified, characterized and evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity. Results showed that purified peptide contained the amino acid sequence as Lys---Cys-Gly-Arg-His (861.6Da), which were expected to contribute to its antioxidant activities. This peptide efficiently quenched 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals (84.5±1.2 and 62.4±2.9%), and successfully inhibits the  peroxidation and DNA damage and proven to be a potent antioxidant at different in vitro systems.

The aim of this study was to determine whether and how mice respond to deprivation of individual EAA species.Dietary deprivation of any single EAA (not non-EAA) in mice led to progressive weight loss in the order of Ile(-) > Val(-) > (-) > Leu(-) > Trp(-) > His(-) > (-) > Met(-) > Lys(-) , which correlated with the reduction in food intake. Decreased levels of the deprived EAAs as well as increased levels of all or some of the other amino acids were detected in the serum, although these levels differed among the diets examined. Serum biochemistry identified significant increases in creatine phosphokinase, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and decreases in glucose and triglycerides; computed tomography revealed a marked reduction in abdominal/femoral fat and muscle depots; histology identified diffuse myofiber atrophy in the rectus femoris muscle, all in that approximate order. In contrast, amino acid response, autophagy, and ubiquitination marker genes as well as amino acid transporter genes were induced in both deprived EAA-specific and tissue-specific manners.Dietary deprivation of individual EAAs induced systemic adaptive responses that differed in magnitude and molecular machinery.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Two of these peptides contain 14 amino acids and the larger third peptide consists of 25 amino acids. The sequence of the salmon SST-25 is Ser-Val-Asp-Asn-Leu-Pro-Pro-Arg-Glu-Arg-Lys-Ala-Gly -Cys-Lys-Asn--Tyr-Trp-Lys-Gly---Ser-Cys. The sequence of the salmon SST-14-I is Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn---Trp-Lys----Ser-Cys. The other small somatostatin (SST-14-II) which was not sequenced has an amino acid composition identical to the C-terminal 14 amino acids of the SST-25 and it is probably derived from this larger form. Evidence for low levels of a somatostatin containing 28 amino acids is also presented. This SST-28 appears to be an N-terminal extended precursor of SST-25 or a peptide derived via alternative processing of a common preprosomatostatin. Injected into juvenile salmon, SST-25 caused a decline in circulating levels of plasma insulin, depletion of liver glycogen, and activation of lipolytic pathways. Juvenile salmon treated with anti-SST-25 serum revealed elevated levels of plasma insulin as well as an increase of the glycogen content of the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9754924>Apparent thermodynamic parameters of ligand binding to the cloned rat mu-opioid receptor.</a></h1><p>The apparent thermodynamic parameters of binding of ten ligands to the cloned rat mu-opioid receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were investigated. For every ligand, the Kd or Ki values at 0 degrees C, 12 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C were determined, a van't Hoff plot was generated and deltaH degrees' , deltaS degrees' and -TdeltaS degrees' and deltaG degrees' were calculated. Changes in free energy (deltaG degrees') ranged from -10.35 to -15.65 kcal/mol. The binding of sufentanil, ohmefentanyl, diprenorphine and D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--penicillamineThr-NH2 (CTAP) was endothermic (deltaH degrees' > 0) and driven by an increase in entropy (-TdeltaS degrees' = -13.08 to -18.57 kcal/mol). The binding of naltrexone was exothermic (deltaH degrees' = -12.56 kcal/mol) and essentially enthalpy-driven. The binding of morphine, methadone, pentazocine, [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) and Tyr-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2 (PL017) was exothermic (deltaH degrees' = -3.53 to -9.95 kcal/mol) and occurred with an increase in entropy (-TdeltaS degrees' = -2.48 to -7.92 kcal/mol). Plots of enthalpy versus entropy and enthalpy versus free energy were linear, although enthalpy-entropy compensation was not evident. The entropy changes were not correlated with apparent lipophilicity of the compounds. These results suggest that: (1) opioid ligands bind to the mu receptor by specific mechanisms, unrelated to  solubility; (2) the mechanism of binding is not universally different for peptide and non-peptide ligands; (3) the nature of binding does not a priori determine intrinsic activity. The results reveal a novel differentiation of opioid ligands into two groups (group 1: ohmefentanyl, sufentanil, diprenorphine, CTAP and PL017; group 2: naltrexone, morphine, methadone, DAMGO, pentazocine), based on two distinct relationships between enthalpy versus free energy of binding, the details of which are yet to be elucidated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10441561>Fusogenic activity of hepadnavirus peptides corresponding to sequences downstream of the putative cleavage site.</a></h1><p>Sequence homology between the amino-terminal region of the S protein of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and known fusion peptides from retroviruses and paramyxoviruses led us to propose that this region might be equally involved in the initial infective steps of hepadnaviruses. In fact, we showed that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminus region of the S protein of HBV had membrane-interacting properties and was able to induce liposome fusion adopting an extended (beta-sheet) conformation (Rodríguez-Crespo et al., 1996, 1995). We describe herein studies on the interaction of peptides derived from the N-terminal region of the S protein of duck (DHBV: Met-Ser-Gly---Gly-Gly-Ile-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Gly-Leu-Leu) and woodchuck hepatitis B viruses (WHV: Met-Ser-Pro-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ala-Gly-Leu-Gln-Val-Val) with liposomes. These peptides were able to induce to a different extent aggregation,  mixing, and leakage of internal aqueous contents from both neutral and negatively charged phospholipid vesicles in a concentration-dependent and pH-independent manner. Fluorescence depolarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene-labeled vesicles indicated that both peptides become inserted into the hydrophobic core of the  bilayer. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the DHBV peptide adopts an extended conformation in the presence of lipids, whereas the WHV peptide displays a high content of alpha-helical conformation. Therefore, these results extend our previous findings obtained for human hepatitis B virus to other members of the hepadnavirus family and suggest that this region of the S protein is important in the initial steps of the infective cycle.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14594253>In situ evaluation of hen mortality meal as a protein supplement for dairy cows.</a></h1><p>A study was conducted to evaluate the nutritional composition and in situ degradation of hen mortality meals.

FPP and lysophosphatidic acid were able to activate both G(q/11)- and G(s)-mediated signaling pathways, whereas NAG activated only the G(q/11)-mediated signaling pathway. Computer-simulated modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis of GPR92 indicated that (97), Gly(98), (101), and Arg(267) of GPR92 are responsible for the interaction of GPR92 with FPP and NAG. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that GPR92 mRNA is highly expressed in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) but faint in other brain regions. Peripheral tissues including, spleen, stomach, small intestine, and kidney also expressed GPR92 mRNA. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GPR92 is largely co-localized with TRPV1, a nonspecific cation channel that responds to noxious heat, in mouse and human DRG. FPP and NAG increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels in cultured DRG neurons.

Two of the rough (Rg) variants, Rg-3 and Rg-4, were devoid of glycopeptidolipids or any more elemental structures and thus were similar to those described previously. Two others, Rg-0 and Rg-1, each contained two novel lipopeptides, devoid of any of the carbohydrate substituents that confer serotypic activity on the glycopeptidolipids. The application of gas chromatography, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and 1H NMR to lipopeptide I established the structure C32:2-beta-OH-fatty acyl-D--D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninol. Lipopeptide II represented a minor variation of this structure: C32:1-beta-OH-fatty acyl-D--D-allo--D-Ala-L-alaninol. These newly discovered lipopeptides are identical to the fatty acyl-tripeptide-amino alcohol "core" component of the glycopeptidolipids of the M. avium complex, and thus the Rg-0 and Rg-1 variants represent a form of "deep rough" mutation in M. avium. Separately, we report that these rough variants of M. avium differ genetically from the smooth, virulent form by major deletions of portions of the genes responsible for glycopeptidolipid synthesis (Belisle, J. T., Klaczkiewicz, K., Brennan, P. J., Jacobs, W. R., Jr., and Inamine, J. M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10517-10523).

Animals were fitted with a simple ileal T-cannula on day 24 or 25 of age. A synthetic diet based on corn (Zea mays) starch and casein was either supplemented with an extruded soybean (Glycine max) meal (ESM), rice (Oryza sativa) protein concentrate (RPC), full  heat-treated soybeans (SB), corn, barley (Hordeum vulgare), or wheat (Triticum aestivum). The contribution of CP and AA from casein and from the assay feed ingredients to the assay diet averaged 50% each. Each diet was fed to 6 animals according to a row-column design with 3 periods. Apparent ileal digestibility was corrected for basal ileal endogenous losses of AA to obtain SID values. Between RPC and soy products, differences (P < 0.05) in SID of most AA such as Lys, Met, and  were greater than within soybean products (ESM and SB). The SID of indispensable AA did not differ (P > 0.05) between barley and wheat, except for Met (P < 0.05). Furthermore, SID of Arg, His, Ile, , and Trp was lower (P < 0.05) in corn than wheat. In conclusion, SID of most AA in the present study with piglets was lower than tabulated SID values determined in studies with grower-finisher pigs. Furthermore, the use of RPC, despite its high CP content, in diets for weaned piglets is limited due to its low SID of AA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106110>Evaluation of various sources of corn dried distillers grains plus solubles for lactating dairy cattle.</a></h1><p>The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of feeding dried distillers grains plus solubles (DDGS) from different sources on milk production and composition in dairy cows. Eight multiparous and 4 primiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 28-d periods. Treatments consisted of total mixed diets containing no DDGS (CON), or DDGS from source 1 (DDGS-1), source 2 (DDGS-2), or source 3 (DDGS-3) at 20% of diet dry matter. The processing of DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 was intended to decrease heat damage and improve nutritional quality. The DDGS in the diets replaced a portion of the ground corn and soybean meal, allowing them to be isonitrogenous at 16% crude protein. All diets had a forage-to-concentrate ratio of 55:45. Dry matter intake (21.4 kg/d) did not differ among diets, but cows fed diets containing DDGS had greater yields of milk (34.6 vs. 31.2 kg/d), 4% -corrected milk (32.7 vs. 29.6 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (35.4 vs. 32.3) compared with cows fed the CON diet. Feed efficiency was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (1.78 vs. 1.63). Milk  yield was greater in cows fed DDGS compared with those fed CON (1.26 vs. 1.14 kg/d). Milk protein percentages (3.28, 3.13, 3.19, and 3.17% for CON, DDGS-1, DDGS-2, and DDGS-3, respectively) were greater for CON vs. DDGS and tended to be lower for DDGS-1 than for DDGS-2 and DDGS-3. Milk protein yields tended to be greater for cows fed DDGS than for those fed CON (1.09 vs. 1.02 kg/d). Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower in cows fed DDGS compared with CON (9.36 vs. 10.6 mg/dL). Feeding DDGS decreased arterial plasma concentrations of Arg, Ile, Lys, and  and increased His and Leu compared with CON. Arterial plasma from cows fed DDGS-2 and DDGS-3 had greater concentrations of Ile, Trp, and Val compared with DDGS-1. In all diets, Lys, Met, and  were the first 3 limiting amino acids for protein synthesis with Lys being first limiting in DDGS-1 and DDGS-3 and Met being first limiting for CON and DDGS-2. Inclusion of DDGS did not affect the molar proportions of ruminal acetate or propionate compared with CON. Ruminal proportions of butyrate were lower in CON compared with DDGS. Total concentrations of VFA were greater in CON compared with DDGS. The concentrations of rumen ammonia were greater in CON (7.2 mg/dL) compared with DDGS (4.5 mg/dL). Overall, the source of DDGS used in this study did not affect lactation performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12733923>Glycopeptide-membrane interactions: glycosyl enkephalin analogues adopt turn conformations by NMR and CD in amphipathic media.</a></h1><p>Four enkephalin analogues (Tyr-D--Gly--Leu-Ser-CONH(2), 1, and the related O-linked glycopeptides bearing the monosaccharide beta-glucose, 2, the disaccharide beta-maltose, 3, and the trisaccharide beta-maltotriose, 4) were synthesized, purified by HPLC, and biophysical studies were conducted to examine their interactions with membrane model systems. Glycopeptide 2 has been previously reported to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and produce potent analgesia superior to morphine in mice (J. Med. Chem.2000, 43, 2586-90 and J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2001, 299, 967-972). The parent peptide and its three glycopeptide derivatives were studied in aqueous solution and in the presence of micelles using 2-D NMR, CD, and molecular mechanics (Monte Carlo studies). Consistent with previous conformational studies on cyclic opioid agonist glycopeptides, it was seen that glycosylation did not significantly perturb the peptide backbone in aqueous solution, but all four compounds strongly associated with 5-30 mM SDS or DPC micelles, and underwent profound membrane-induced conformational changes. Interaction was also observed with POPC:POPE:cholesterol  vesicles (LUV) in equilibrium dialysis experiments. Although the peptide backbones of 1-4 possessed random coil structures in water, in the presence of the  phase they each formed a nearly identical pair of structures, all with a stable beta-turn motif at the C-terminus. Use of spin labels (Mn(2+) and 5-DOXYL-stearic acid) allowed for the determination of the position and orientation of the compounds relative to the surface of the micelle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16563720>Purification and characterization of antioxidant peptide from hoki (Johnius belengerii) frame protein by gastrointestinal digestion.</a></h1><p>To extract antioxidant peptide from hoki frame protein hydrolysate (APHPH), we employed six proteases (pepsin, trypsin, papain, alpha-chymotrypsin, Alcalase and Neutrase) for enzymatic hydrolysis, and the antioxidant activities of their hydrolysates were investigated using both  peroxidation inhibition assay and free radical scavenging assay by electron spin resonance spin-trapping technique. Among hydrolysates, peptic hydrolysate, having the highest antioxidant activity, further separated into four groups using ultrafiltration membranes and purified consecutive chromatographic methods. Finally, the purified peptide had a molecular mass of 1801 Da, and amino acid sequence was identified as Glu-Ser--Val-Pro-Glu-Arg--His-Pro-Ala-Cys-Pro-Asp--Asn. APHPH inhibited  peroxidation higher than that of alpha-tocopherol as positive control and efficiently quenched different sources of free radical: 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycryl-hydrazyl (IC(50)=41.37 microM), hydroxyl (IC(50)=17.77 microM), peroxyl (IC(50)=18.99 microM) and superoxide radicals (IC(50)=172.10 microM).

The C-terminus was also blocked, as indicated by the lack of digestion when the peptide was incubated with carboxypeptidase A. The octapeptide has the sequence pGlu-Leu---Ser-Pro-Asp-Trp-NH2 and is clearly defined as a novel member of the RPCH/AKH (red-pigment-concentrating hormone/adipokinetic hormone) family of peptides. It is the first charged member of this family to be found. The synthetic peptide causes an increase in the haemolymph carbohydrate concentration in a dose-dependent fashion in blowflies and therefore is named 'Phormia terraenovae hypertrehalosaemic hormone' (Pht-HrTH). In addition, receptors in the -body of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) recognize the peptide, resulting in carbohydrate elevation in the blood. However, -body receptors of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) do not recognize this charged molecule, and thus no  mobilization is observed in this species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727082>Comparison of amino acid digestibility in full- soybean, two soybean meals, and peanut flour between broiler chickens and growing pigs.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in full- soybean (FFSB), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 430 g/kg CP (SBM-43), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 470 g/kg CP (SBM-47), and peanut flour (PNF) fed to broiler chickens and pigs and to compare the digestibility of CP and AA between broiler chickens and pigs. Four diets were prepared to contain FFSB, SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF as the sole source of N. A N-free diet was formulated to estimate the basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA for broiler chickens and pigs. In Exp. 1, a total of four hundred sixteen 21-d-old male broiler chickens (922.1 ± 79.9 g initial BW) were assigned to 5 experimental diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected after birds were euthanized by CO asphyxiation. In Exp. 2, twenty barrows (62.0 ± 6.9 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum were allotted to 5 experimental diets with 2 consecutive 7-d experimental periods. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected at d 6 and 7. For statistical analysis, treatments were considered a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with effects of species and experimental diets (Exp. 1 vs. Exp. 2). There were no interactions between species and diets for the digestibility of CP and AA except for Cys ( < 0.01). The AID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.01) than in broiler chickens. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the AID of CP and indispensable AA in SBM-47 were greater ( < 0.05) than in FFSB, and the AID of Lys in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. The SID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.05) than in broiler chickens except for Trp. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the SID of Lys in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. In broiler chickens, the SID of CP, Ile, Leu, , Trp, and Val in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than that in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In pigs, the SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In conclusion, the digestibility of CP and most AA were less in broiler chickens than in pigs, but the pattern of differences in the AA digestibility among ingredients was similar between broiler chickens and pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/699907>Structure-activity relationships for the -mobilising action of locust adipokinetic hormone. Synthesis and activity of a series of hormone analogues.</a></h1><p>A series of compounds structurally related to adipokinetic hormone, the decapeptide neurohormone less than Glu-Leu-Asn---Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly--NH2, have been prepared by synthesis and by enzymic cleavages of synthetic hormone. Their relative agonist activities in mobilising lipids over a fixed time interval (1 h) in locusts were assessed. The similar time courses for  release shown by two of the peptide analogues and adipokinetic hormone suggest that the analogues and the hormone are transported to the receptors on the  body cells, and are also degraded, at similar rates. Consequently, the analogue activities can be correlated with the structural requirements of the locust  body hormone receptors. The requirements for activity demonstrated in this study are as follows. Residues 1--8 from the N-terminus are necessary to elicit some activity (20%). Residues 5 and 7 in the octapeptide can be changed without affecting activity but L-pyroglutamic acid as the N-terminal residue is necessary formaximum activity both in the octapeptide and the decapeptide. Full activity is achieved only by adding the dipeptide glycyl threonine amide to the active octapeptide 'core'. In the decapeptide, residues cannot be interchanged to the same extent as in the octapeptide without reducing activity. The peptide probably has to be uncharged. Inactive analogues of seven residues or less do not interfere in the hormone-receptor interaction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9003419>Hyperprolinaemia caused by novel members of the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone family of peptides isolated from corpora cardiaca of onitine beetles.</a></h1><p>Two novel members of the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone family of peptides were identified in dung beetles of the genus Onitis using heterologous (measuring  and carbohydrate mobilization in locusts and cockroaches) and a homologous (measuring proline increase in the haemolymph) bioassay(s). Isolation of the peptides was achieved by single-step reverse-phase HPLC of corpora cardiaca extracts. The primary structure was elucidated by automated Edman degradation and by electrospray MS. Both peptides are blocked octapeptides containing three aromatic amino acids. Peptide 1, designated Ona-CC-I, is pGlu-Tyr-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp-NH2, and peptide 2, designated Ona-CC-II, is pGlu--Asn-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Asp-Trp-NH2. The synthetic peptides were chromatographically indistinguishable from the natural compounds. They both had a hyperprolinaemic effect in the dung beetle. Moreover, flight experiments established that proline is an important fuel to power flight  in Onitis species.

Unlike other protein kinase Cs (PKC), PKC-delta does not require phosphorylation of its activation loop (-507) for in vitro activity. We investigated the structural basis for this unusual capacity and its relevance to PKC-delta function in intact cells. Mutational analysis demonstrated that activity without -507 phosphorylation depends on 20 residues N-terminal to the kinase domain and a pair of phenylalanines (-500/-527) unique to PKC-delta in/near the activation loop. Molecular modeling demonstrated that these elements stabilize the activation loop by forming a hydrophobic chain of interactions from the C-lobe to activation loop to N-terminal (helical) extension. In cells PKC-delta mediates both apoptosis and transcription regulation. We found that the T507A mutant of the PKC-delta kinase domain resembled the corresponding wild type in mediating apoptosis in transfected HEK293T cells. But the T507A mutant was completely defective in AP-1 and NF-kappaB reporter assays. A novel assay in which the kinase domain of PKC-delta and its substrate (a fusion protein of PKC substrate peptide with green fluorescent protein) were co-targeted to  rafts revealed a major substrate-selective defect of the T507A mutant in phosphorylating the substrate in cells. In vitro analysis showed strong product inhibition on the T507A mutant with particular substrates whose characteristics suggest it contributes to the substrate selective defect of the PKC-delta T507A mutant in cells. Thus, activation loop phosphorylation of PKC-delta may regulate its function in cells in a novel way.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851853>Milk protein yield and mammary  are affected by phenylalanine deficiency but not by threonine or tryptophan deficiency.</a></h1><p>Efficient milk protein synthesis requires that the essential AA be presented to the mammary gland in the right amount and proportion to maximize protein synthesis and minimize losses. This study investigated the effects of individual AA deficiencies on cow productivity, mammary , and glucose whole-body rate of appearance. Five Holstein cows were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design trial with 10-d periods. Treatments were abomasal infusions of (1) water (CTL); (2) complete AA mixture (TAA); (3) TAA without  (No-); (4) TAA without  (No-); and (5) TAA without Trp (No-Trp). Each treatment was compared with TAA. Treatment did not affect milk, fat, or lactose yields. Arterial concentrations of , , and Trp decreased with their respective deletions by 60, 76, and 69%. In response to the decreased arterial supply of the deleted AA, mammary plasma flow significantly increased by 55% with No- but did not increase with No- or No-Trp. Mammary uptake of  was reduced by No-, accompanied by a reduced milk protein yield; uptakes of  and Trp were not affected by their respective deletions, and milk protein yield did not decrease with these treatments. Deletion of  tended to reduce its mammary uptake relative to milk output (U:O), accompanied by an increased U:O of Tyr, but deletion of  and Trp did not affect the U:O of the corresponding AA. Plasma urea-N concentration was lower with CTL and tended to be higher with No-. Arterial concentrations and mammary uptake of acetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and lactate were unaffected by treatment. Treatment had no effect on glucose rate of appearance at the whole-body level. Lactose output as a percentage of glucose whole-body rate of appearance was not affected by treatment. Overall, the study indicated that a deficiency of  negatively affected productivity and mammary  but that a deficiency of  or Trp did not.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

A peptide was isolated and sequenced from the retrocerebral corpora cardiaca glands of the alderfly, Sialis lutaria. The sequence of the peptide was deduced from the multiple MS(N) electrospray mass data as that of an octapeptide: pGlu-Ile/Leu----Pro-Ser-Trp amide. The ambiguity about the amino acid at position 2, Leu or Ile, was solved by comparing retention time on reversed-phase HPLC and establishing co-elution with the synthetic Leu(2)-form which also had exactly the same MS(2) mass spectra as the natural peptide. The sequence represents a novel peptide of the adipokinetic hormone family which has already more than 40 members. Interestingly, the primary structure is identical to that predicted from genome information for the adipokinetic hormone of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Since alderflies are not known for their active flight  but produce a rather high number of eggs, it is anticipated that the alderfly is a good study object to establish a possible role of the novel peptide to regulate  mobilization from the  body and transport into the egg, thereby playing a role in the control of reproductive processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19686751>Biological activity of the predicted red pigment-concentrating hormone of Daphnia pulex in a crustacean and an insect.</a></h1><p>The elucidation of the genome of the waterflea Daphnia pulex made it possible to search for orthologue genes for the crustacean red pigment-concentrating hormone (named Panbo-RPCH after the species Pandalus borealis in which the red pigment-concentrating hormone was first identified); Panbo-RPCH is a member of the adipokinetic hormone (AKH)/red pigment-concentrating hormone (RPCH) peptide family. The information pointed to a putative mature RPCH octapeptide in D. pulex with the primary sequence of pGlu-Val-Asn--Ser--Ser-Trp amide (=Dappu-RPCH). Since Panbo-RPCH is endogenous in decapod crustaceans and in the green stink bug Nezara viridula, we assayed Dappu-RPCH in the shrimp Palaemon pacificus and in N. viridula. Here we show that this variant member of the AKH/RPCH family has no activity to concentrate the red, brown, yellow and blue pigments in the epithelium of the shrimp at physiological doses but is effective in mobilising lipids in the green stink bug N. viridula. Moreover, since Panbo-RPCH and Dappu-RPCH differ structurally at three positions, viz. Leu(2) to Val(2); Pro(6) to (6); Gly(7) to Ser(7), we tested other members of the peptide family which have single or dual amino acid substitutions at the appropriate positions, for their chromatophorotropic action at physiological doses. These studies show unequivocally that a single change from Gly(7) to Ser(7) (as in the peptide Corpu-AKH) does not inflict any loss of biological activity, and the same is true for a single change from Pro(6) to (6) (represented by the peptide Schgr-AKH-II). The change from Leu(2) to Val(2) (embodied in Manto-CC), however, is accompanied with a substantial loss of chromatophorotropic activity; combinations of Val(2) and Ser(7) (as in Anaim-AKH) or Val(2) and (6) (as in Grybi-AKH) result in almost complete loss of biological activity. Dappu-RPCH with its three substitutions is not active at all in the shrimp at the tested concentration range of up to 30 pmol.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The association of CPE with  rafts in the trans -Golgi network and secretory granule membranes is necessary for its sorting receptor function. We now provide evidence that a domain within the C-terminal 25 residues of CPE functions as a signal for both raft association and the sorting of CPE to the regulated secretory pathway. A fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of the human interleukin-2 receptor Tac (N-Tac) and the C-terminal 25 amino acids of CPE was transfected into Neuro2A cells. This fusion protein floated in sucrose density gradients, indicating raft association, and co-localized with chromogranin A (CGA), a secretory granule marker. To define further a minimum sequence required for raft association and sorting, deletion mutants of CPE that lacked the C-terminal four or 15 residues (CPE-Delta4 and CPE-Delta15 respectively) were transfected into a clone of CPE-deficient Neuro2A cells. In contrast with full-length CPE, neither CPE-Delta4 nor CPE-Delta15 floated in sucrose density gradients. The sorting of both CPE-Delta4 and CPE-Delta15 to the regulated secretory pathway was impaired, as indicated by significantly increased basal secretion and a lack of response to stimulation. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the co-localization of mutant CPE immunofluorescence with CGA when compared with full-length CPE. Finally, the sorting of the prohormone POMC to the regulated pathway was impaired in cells transfected with either CPE-Delta4 or CPE-Delta15. We conclude that the sorting of CPE to the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells is mediated by  rafts, and that the C-terminal four residues of CPE, i.e. (431)-Leu-Asn-(434), are required for raft association and sorting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3311164>Perturbation of the  bilayer of model membranes by synthetic signal peptides.</a></h1><p>The interaction of synthetic peptides corresponding to the signal sequences of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase: Lys-Gln-Ser--Ile-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu---Pro-Val-- Lys-Ala - OCH3, chicken lysozyme: Met-Lys-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ile-Leu-Val-Leu-Cys(Bzl)--Leu-Pro-Leu- Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly-OCH2-C6H5 and variant of the chicken lysozyme signal sequence with a charged residue in the hydrophobic region: Lys-Leu-Leu-Ile-Ala-Leu-Val-Leu-Lys--Leu-Pro-Leu-Ala-Ala- Leu-Gly-OCH3 with model membranes of brain phosphatidylserine (PS) and egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) have been investigated by 90 degrees light scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy.

NBCe1-A transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) is involved in forming part of the ion permeation pathway, and a missense mutation S427L in TM1 impairs ion transport, causing proximal renal tubular acidosis. In the present study, we examined the topology of NBCe1-A-TM1 in detail and its structural perturbation induced by S427L. We analyzed the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (Cys-389-Gln-424) of NBCe1-A-TM1 using the substituted cysteine scanning accessibility method combined with extensive chemical stripping, in situ chemical probing, and functional transport assays. NBCe1-A-TM1 was previously modeled on the anion exchanger 1 TM1 (AE1-TM1); however, our data demonstrated that the topology of AE1-TM1 differs significantly from NBCe1-A-TM1. Our findings revealed that NBCe1-A-TM1 is unusually long, consisting of 31 membrane-embedded amino acids (-412 to -442). The linker region (Arg-394-Pro-411) between the N terminus of TM1 and the cytoplasmic domain is minimally exposed to aqueous and is potentially folded in a helical structure that intimately interacts with the NBCe1-A cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, AE1-TM1 contains 25 amino acids connected to an aqueous-exposed cytoplasmic region. Based on our new NBCe1-A-TM1 model, Ser-427 resides in the middle of TM1. Leucine substitution at Ser-427 blocks the normal aqueous access to -442, Ala-435, and Lys-404, implying a significant alteration of NBCe1-TM1 orientation. Our study provides novel structural insights into the pathogenic mechanism of S427L in mediating proximal renal tubular acidosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28091903>Effects of Opioid Peptides on Changes in Lipid  in Rats Subjected to Swimming Stress.</a></h1><p>Blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL increased in rats subjected to forced swimming stress. Administration of opioid peptides dynorphin A(1-13), DSLET, or DAGO reduced stress-induced disturbances in lipid . Dynorphin A(1-13) and DAGO produced the most pronounced effects and prevented an increase in concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL as soon as 39 h after treatment. Only DSLET increased HDL content in the plasma of stressed rats.

Cows were fed a diet of 67.0% corn silage, 5.3% grass hay, 14.2% peas, 7.8% maize starch, 1.0% each of molasses, urea, and sodium bicarbonate and 2.4% minerals and vitamins. Requirements of the remaining 9 essential amino acids were met by infusing into the duodenum 323 g/d of a mixture of amino acids including, Ile, Val, Met, Lys, Trp, , His, , Arg, Tyr and Glu. Milk protein content and yield were highest with 40 g/d of Leu and then progressively declined. Milk  content and yield were significantly decreased over the entire range of Leu infusions. Arterial concentrations of Leu increased linearly and corresponding mammary arterio-venous differences increased to a plateau with 80 g/d of Leu. As Leu infusions increased, extraction rates of Leu decreased linearly, whereas those of Ile, Val, Lys, Arg,  and Tyr were significantly increased. Leu was taken up by the mammary gland according to milk output with 0 and 40 g/d of Leu infused and then largely in excess. Based on responses of protein yield and mammary uptake to milk output ratio, Leu concentration in total amino acids absorbed in the small intestine needs to be close to 8.9% for optimal milk protein synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8093008>A novel adipokinetic octapeptide found in the damselflies Pseudagrion inconspicuum and Ischnura senegalensis.</a></h1><p>A member of the adipokinetic hormone family of peptide was identified in the damselflies Pseudagrion inconspicuum and Ischnura senegalensis using a heterologous (in migratory locusts and American cockroaches) and a homologous (in P. inconspicuum) bioassay.

As per in vitro activity testing, SCPE-A, SCPE-B and SCPE-C exhibited strong scavenging activities on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH•) (half elimination ratio (EC) 2.43, 2.66 and 1.99 mg/mL), hydroxyl radicals (HO•) (EC 0.28, 0.21 and 0.15 mg/mL), 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radicals (ABTS⁺•) (EC 0.24, 0.18 and 0.29 mg/mL), and superoxide anion radicals ( O 2 - •) (EC 0.10, 0.14 and 0.11 mg/mL). In addition, SCPE-A showed inhibition activity similar to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in lipid peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system.

ACOT12, the primary acetyl-CoA thioesterase in the liver of human, mouse, and rat, is responsible for cleavage of the thioester bond within acetyl-CoA, producing acetate and coenzyme A for a range of cellular processes. The enzyme is regulated by ADP and ATP, which is believed to be mediated through the ligand-induced oligomerization of the thioesterase domains, whereby ATP induces active dimers and tetramers, whereas apo- and ADP-bound ACOT12 are monomeric and inactive. Here, using a range of structural and biophysical techniques, it is demonstrated that ACOT12 is a trimer rather than a tetramer and that neither ADP nor ATP exert their regulatory effects by altering the oligomeric status of the enzyme. Rather, the binding site and mechanism of ADP regulation have been determined to occur through two novel regulatory regions, one involving a large loop that links the thioesterase domains ((154)-(178)), defined here as RegLoop1, and a second region involving the C terminus of thioesterase domain 2 (Gln(304)-Gly(326)), designated RegLoop2. Mutagenesis confirmed that Arg(312) and Arg(313) are crucial for this mode of regulation, and novel interactions with the START domain are presented together with insights into domain swapping within eukaryotic thioesterases for substrate recognition. In summary, these experiments provide the first structural insights into the regulation of this enzyme family, revealing an alternate hypothesis likely to be conserved throughout evolution.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14571716>Plasma amino acid levels in patients with colorectal cancers and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h1><p>A variety of cancer-bearing patients have been shown to have disturbances in carbohydrate,  and protein . The complex of metabolic derangements of protein in cancer patients may be reflected by alteration in the plasma free amino acid profile. In this study, we try to investigate the plasma free amino acid profile in patients with colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, which are the most common cancers in Taiwan.Fasting venous blood samples were drawn from sixteen control volunteers and 42 cancer-bearing patients including 14 early stage colorectal cancer patients (Duke A and B), 18 late stage ones (Duke C and D) and 10 liver cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Seventeen amino acid levels were measured using a Beckman amino acid analyzer.About one third of early or late colorectal cancer patients had body weight loss more than 10% in half a year and were defined as malnourished. For individual amino acids, in early colorectal cancer patients, the plasma level of most essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids decreased (significantly in Tyr, Ala, Met,  and ). In late stage colorectal cancer patients and patients with liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma levels of most essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids decreased more obviously. For group amino acids, the plasma levels of essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids, gluconeogenic amino acids and branched-chain amino acids were also lower in the cancer patients than those in control volunteers. The difference was also noticeably significant in patients with late stage colorectal cancer and liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. The plasma free amino acid patterns in colorectal cancer patients are quite different from those in patients with non-gastrointestinal cancer and weight loss. The plasma level of essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids was not kept within normal range in colorectal cancer patients. Elevation of plasma aromatic amino acids and methionine levels usually observed in liver cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma was not apparent in our cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.The plasma free amino acid patterns in our colorectal cancer patients and cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were rather characteristic. The results will offer useful tools for improving diagnosis and therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225562>The adipokinetic hormone of Mantodea in comparison to other Dictyoptera.</a></h1><p>Six species of the order Mantodea (praying mantises) are investigated for the presence and sequence of putative adipokinetic hormones (AKHs). The selected species span a wide evolutionary range of various families and subfamilies of the clade Mantodea. The corpora cardiaca of the different species are dissected, methanolic extracts prepared, peptides separated by liquid chromatography, and AKHs detected and sequenced by ion trap mass spectrometry. All six species investigated contain an octapeptide with the primary structure pGlu-Val-Asn---Pro-Asn-Trp amide, which is code-named Emppe-AKH and had been found earlier in three other species of Mantodea. Conspecific bioassays with the species Creoboter sp. (family Hymenopodidae) reveal an adipokinetic but not a hypertrehalosemic function of Emppe-AKH. Comparison with other members of the Dictyoptera (cockroaches, termites) show that Emppe-AKH is only found in certain termites, which have been recently placed into the Blattaria (cockroaches) as sister group to the family Cryptocercidae. Termites and cockroaches both show biodiversity in the sequence of AKHs, and some cockroach species even contain two AKHs. In contrast, all praying mantises-irrespective of their phylogenetic position-synthesize uniformly only one and the same octapeptide Emppe-AKH.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10432319>-binding and antimicrobial properties of synthetic peptides of bovine apolipoprotein A-II.</a></h1><p>We previously showed that bovine apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) had antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in PBS. We have characterized here the active domain of apoA-II using synthetic peptides. A peptide corresponding to C-terminal residues Leu(49)-(76) exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli in PBS, but not against S. cerevisiae. Experiments using amino-acid-substituted peptides indicated that the residues (52)-(53)-Lys(54)-Lys(55) are required for the activity. Peptide Leu(49)-(76) induced the release of calcein trapped inside the vesicles whose  composition resembles that of E. coli membrane, suggesting that peptide Leu(49)-(76) can destabilize the E. coli membrane. CD measurements showed that the alpha-helicity of peptide Leu(49)-(76) increased from 3.5 to 36% by addition of the vesicles. When E. coli cells were incubated with peptide Leu(49)-(76), some proteins were released to the external medium, probably owing to membrane destabilization caused by the peptide. In electron micrographs of E. coli cells treated with peptide Leu(49)-(76), transparent nucleoids and granulated cytoplasm were observed. Amino acid substitutions, (52)(53)-->AlaAla ((52, 53)-->Ala) in peptide Leu(49)-(76) caused the loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli, although protein-releasing activity was retained. Electron micrographs of the cells treated with peptide Leu(49)-(76)((52,53)-->Ala) revealed morphological change only at the nucleoids. Therefore peptide Leu(49)-(76) appears to primarily target the cytoplasm rather than the membrane of E. coli cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889653>Ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed extruded diets containing different protein sources.</a></h1><p>This study compared apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of macronutrients and amino acids in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) fed dry extruded diets. The control diet contained fish meal as the main protein source, while in the other diets 50% of the fish meal protein was replaced by not de-hulled solvent-extracted soybean meal, meat meal or bacterial protein meal. Ileal digestibility was obtained with animals modified with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA method). There were no significant differences in the average digestibility of CP, Lys, Trp, Val, Ala or Glu between IRA modified and intact animals. Average ileal digestibilities of His, , Asp, Cys, Gly, Hyp, Pro, Ser, starch and total carbohydrates (CHO) were significantly lower compared with total tract values. Average ileal digestibility of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , Tyr and crude  was significantly higher than total tract digestibility. Digestibility measured in IRA modified animals showed less variability compared with values from intact animals. There were significant differences among diets in ileal as well as total tract digestibility of orude protein, most amino acids, starch and CHO, and in ileal digestibility of crude . Ileal crude protein digestibility of the diets ranged from 81.0-86.4% and total tract digestibility from 82.5-86.4%. Ileal amino acid digestibilities ranged from 70.1 (Asp) to 93.3% (Arg) and total tract values ranged from 72.8 (Cys) to 92.2% (Arg). Both ileal and total tract digestibilities of crude protein and most amino acids were significantly lower for diets containing meat meal or bacterial protein meal compared with the control fish meal-based diet and the diet with soybean meal. Although ileal digestibility may be more accurate than total tract digestibility in estimating the protein and amino acid supply in blue foxes, total tract digestibility may be acceptable because of numerically small differences between ileal and total tract digestibilities for protein and most amino acids. It was further concluded that ileal digestibilities of starch and CHO in the blue fox are lower than corresponding total tract digestibilities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/958472>Structure of locust adipokinetic hormone, a neurohormone that regulates  utilisation during flight.</a></h1><p>Adipokinetic hormone, isolated from locust corpora cardiaca, has been identified as a blocked peptide: PCA-Leu-Asn---Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly--NH2.

Like peroxidases, cytochrome c is inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. During this inactivation the heme prosthetic group is destroyed.Variants of the iso-1-cytochrome c were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and were found to be more stable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide than the wild type. No heme destruction was detected in a triple variant (Tyr67-->/Asn52-->Ile/Cys102-->) with the catalytic hydrogen peroxide concentration of 1 mM, even following the loss of catalytic activity, whereas both double variants Tyr67-->/Cys102--> and Asn52-->Ile/Cys102--> showed a greater rate of peroxide-induced heme destruction than observed with the wild-type protein.Heme destruction and catalytic inactivation are two independent processes. An internal water molecule (Wat166) is shown to be important in the heme destruction process. The absence of a protein radical in the resistant variant suggests that the protein radical is necessary in the heme destruction process, but presumably is not involved in the reactions leading up to the protein inactivation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8731009>The oxidative inactivation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase by peroxynitrite.</a></h1><p>The oxidative inactivation of rabbit skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles by peroxynitrite (ONOO-) was investigated. The exposure of SR vesicles (10 mg/ml protein) to low peroxynitrite concentrations ( < or = 0.2 mM) resulted in a decrease of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity primarily through oxidation of sulfhydryl groups. Most of this deactivation (ca.70%) could be chemically reversed by subsequent reduction of the enzyme with either dithiothreitol (DTT) or sodium borohydride (NaBH4), indicating that free cysteine groups were oxidized to disulfides. The initial presence of 5 mM glutathione failed to protect the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. However, as long as peroxynitrite concentrations were kept < or = 0.45 mM, the efficacy of DTT to reverse Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation was enhanced for reaction mixtures which initially contained 5 mM glutathione. At least part of the disulfides were formed intermolecularly since gel electrophoresis revealed protein aggregation which could be reduced under reducing conditions. The application of higher peroxynitrite concentrations ( > or = 0.45 mM) resulted in Ca(2+)-ATPase inactivation which could not be restored by exposure of the modified protein to reducing agents. On the other hand, treatment of modified protein with NaBH4 recovered all SR protein thiols. This result indicates that possibly the oxidation of other amino acids contributes to enzyme inactivation, corroborated by amino acid analysis which revealed some additional targets for peroxynitrite or peroxynitrite-induced processes such as Met, Lys, , , Ser, Leu and Tyr. Tyr oxidation was confirmed by a significant lower sensitivity of oxidized SR proteins to the Lowry assay. However, neither bityrosine nor nitrotyrosine were formed in significant yields, as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and immunodetection, respectively. The Ca(2+)-ATPase of SR is involved in cellular Ca(2+)-homeostasis. Thus, peroxynitrite mediated oxidation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase might significantly contribute to the loss of Ca(2+)-homeostasis observed under biological conditions of oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3831969>Strategies for the isolation of insect peptides.</a></h1><p>Two distinct diuretic peptides affect the rate of fluid secretion of the Malpighian tubules in Locusta. Diuretic peptide (DP 1) has a molecular mass ca. 4500 and acts via cyclic AMP: the second diuretic peptide (DP 2) has a molecular mass of ca. 1000 and operates via an unknown transduction mechanism; the possible involvement of cGMP, calcium mobilization and the breakdown of phosphoinositides has been investigated. Preliminary sequence data for DP 1 is reported and details are provided concerning the isolation and characterisation of a peptide which is present in large amounts in the storage lobes of the corpora cardiaca and co-chromatographs with DP 1 on high performance size-exclusion chromatography. Adipokinetic hormones (AKH) present in the corpora cardiaca of insects can regulate . AKH occurs in two forms as AKH I and as AKH II: these hormones have been isolated and characterised in both Locusta and Schistocerca. AKH I is a decapeptide of the following structure: pGlu-Leu-Asn---Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-ThrNH2 and is identical in Locusta and Schistocerca. AKH II is different in these two insects: AKH II-L from Locusta is: pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser-Ala-Gly-TrpNH2 and AKH II-S from Schistocerca is: pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser--Gly-TrpNH2. These structures have been established using newly developed quick and simple procedures employing HPLC and gas-phase sequencing which enables full structures to be elucidated from 2-3 nmoles of peptide. Comparisons are made between the structures of AKH and related peptides isolated from insects and crustacea.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639287>NMR analysis of free and  nanodisc anchored CEACAM1 membrane proximal peptides with Ca/CaM.</a></h1><p>CEACAM1, a homotypic transmembrane receptor with 12 or 72 amino acid cytosolic domain isoforms, is converted from inactive cis-dimers to active trans-dimers by calcium-calmodulin (Ca/CaM). Previously, the weak binding of Ca/CaM to the human 12 AA cytosolic domain was studied using C-terminal anchored peptides. We now show the binding of N labeled -454 cytosolic domain peptides in solution or membrane anchored using NMR demonstrates a significant role for the  bilayer. Although binding is increased by the mutation Phe454Ala, this mutation was previously shown to abrogate actin binding. On the other hand, Ca/CaM binding is abrogated by phosphorylation of nearby -457, a post-translation modification required for actin binding and subsequent in vitro lumen formation. Binding of Ca/CaM to a membrane proximal peptide from the long 72 AA cytosolic domain anchored to  nanodiscs was very weak compared to  free conditions, suggesting membrane specific effects between the two isoforms. NMR analysis of N labeled Ca/CaM with unlabeled peptides showed the C-lobe of Ca/CaM is involved in peptide interactions, and hydrophobic residues such as Met-109, Val-142 and Met-144 play important roles in binding peptide. This information was incorporated into transmembrane models of CEACAM1 binding to Ca/CaM. The lack of Ca/CaM binding to phosphorylated -457, a residue we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by CaMK2D, also dependent on Ca/CaM, suggests stepwise binding of the cytosolic domain first to Ca/CaM and then to actin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This protein differs from other well-studied viral and cellular fusion proteins because of its distinct molecular architecture and apparent lack of involvement of coiled coils in the low-pH-induced structural transitions that lead to fusion. A highly conserved loop (the cd loop), which resides at the distal tip of each subunit and is mostly buried in the subunit interface of the native E homodimer at neutral pH, has been hypothesized to function as an internal fusion peptide at low pH, but this has not yet been shown experimentally. It was predicted by examination of the X-ray crystal structure of the TBE virus E protein (F. A. Rey et al., Nature 375:291-298, 1995) that mutations at a specific residue within this loop (Leu 107) would not cause the native structure to be disrupted. We therefore introduced amino acid substitutions at this position and, using recombinant subviral particles, investigated the effects of these changes on fusion and related properties. Replacement of Leu with hydrophilic amino acids strongly impaired () or abolished (Asp) fusion activity, whereas a  mutant still retained a significant degree of fusion activity. Liposome coflotation experiments showed that the fusion-negative Asp mutant did not form a stable interaction with membranes at low pH, although it was still capable of undergoing the structural rearrangements required for fusion. These data support the hypothesis that the cd loop may be directly involved in interactions with target membranes during fusion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20818167>Synthetic substrates for measuring activity of autophagy proteases: autophagins (Atg4).</a></h1><p>Atg4 cysteine proteases (autophagins) play crucial roles in autophagy by proteolytic activation of Atg8 paralogs for targeting to autophagic vesicles by  conjugation, as well as in subsequent deconjugation reactions. However, the means to measure the activity of autophagins is limited. Herein, we describe two novel substrates for autophagins suitable for a diversity of in vitro assays, including (i) fluorogenic tetrapeptide acetyl-Gly-L--L--Gly-AFC (Ac-GTFG-AFC) and (ii) a fusion protein comprised of the natural substrate LC3B appended to the N-terminus of phospholipase A(2) (LC3B-PLA(2)), which upon cleavage releases active PLA(2) for fluorogenic assay. To generate the synthetic tetrapeptide substrate, the preferred tetrapeptide sequence recognized by autophagin-1/Atg4B was determined using a positional scanning combinatorial fluorogenic tetrapeptide library. With the LC3B-PLA(2) substrate, we show that mutation of the glycine proximal to the scissile bond in LC3B abolishes activity. Both substrates showed high specificity for recombinant purified autophagin-1/Atg4B compared to closely related proteases and the LC3B-PLA(2) substrate afforded substantially higher catalytic rates (k(cat)/K(m) 5.26 x 10(5) M(-1)/sec(-1)) than Ac-GTFG-AFC peptide (0.92 M(-1)/sec(-1)), consistent with substrate-induced activation. Studies of autophagin-1 mutants were also performed, including the protease lacking a predicted autoinhibitory domain at residues 1 to 24 and lacking a regulatory loop at residues 259 to 262. The peptide and fusion protein substrates were also employed for measuring autophagin activity in cell lysates, showing a decrease in cells treated with autophagin-1/Atg4B siRNA or transfected with a plasmid encoding Atg4B (Cys74Ala) dominantnegative. Therefore, the synthetic substrates for autophagins reported here provide new research tools for studying autophagy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16766530>Characterization of the stomatin domain involved in homo-oligomerization and  raft association.</a></h1><p>The cytoplasmically oriented monotopic integral membrane protein stomatin forms high-order oligomers and associates with  rafts. To characterize the domains that are involved in oligomerization and detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) association, we expressed truncation and point mutants of stomatin and analyzed their size and buoyancy by ultracentrifugation methods. A small C-terminal region of stomatin that is largely hydrophobic, Ser--Ile-Val--Pro-Leu-Pro-Ile (residues 264-272), proved to be crucial for oligomerization, whereas the N-terminal domain (residues 1-20) and the last 12 C-terminal amino acids (residues 276-287) were not essential. The introduction of alanine substitutions in the region 264-272 resulted in the appearance of monomers. Remarkably, only three of these residues, Ile-Val- (residues 266-268), were found to be indispensable for the DRM association. Interestingly, the exchange of Pro-269 and to some extent the residues 270-272, which are essential for oligomerization, did not affect the DRM association of stomatin. This suggests that the formation of oligomers is not necessary for the association of stomatin with DRMs. Internal deletions near the membrane anchoring domain resulted in the formation of intermediate size oligomers suggesting a conformational interdependence of large parts of the C-terminal region. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of the tagged, monomeric, non-DRM mutant ST-(1-262)-green fluorescent protein and wild type stomatin StomGFP showed a significantly higher lateral mobility of the truncation mutant in the plasma membrane suggesting a membrane interaction of the respective C-terminal region also in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18215441>Carbohydrate and  in cockroach (Periplaneta americana)  body are both activated by low and similar concentrations of Peram-AKH II.</a></h1><p>Injection of 0.1 pmol of the octapeptide Peram-AKH II (pGlu-Leu----Pro-Asn-TrpNH(2)) elicits a significant hypertrehalosemic response in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana; a maximal effect is obtained with 1pmol. The latter amount also lowers the level of neutral  (NL) and phospholipid (PL) in the hemolymph. The evidence supports the idea that Peram-AKH II promotes the liberation of fatty acids from hemolymph phospholipid, and indirectly diacylglycerol in the same compartment. The fatty acids are then transported into the  body where they are converted into triacylglycerol for storge. Because lipolysis and trehalose synthesis are initiated by a common concentration of Peram-AKH II it is reasonable to suggest that the physiological function of Peram-AKH II involves the participation of both metabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541889>Five functional adipokinetic peptides expressed in the corpus cardiacum of the moth genus Hippotion (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae).</a></h1><p>This is the first study that finds five adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) in the corpus cardiacum of an insect. From two species of the sphingid moth genus Hippotion, eson and celerio, three novel and two known AKHs were isolated and sequenced by deduction from multiple MS(n) electrospray mass data: two octapeptides are pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp amide (denoted Hipes-AKH-I) and its (7) analogue (Hipes-AKH-II); two nonapeptides are pGlu-Leu----Ser-Ser-Trp-Gly amide (Manse-AKH) and its (7) analogue (Hipes-AKH-III), as well as a decapeptide pGlu-Leu---Ser-Ser-Gly-Trp-Gly-Gln amide (Manse-AKH-II). All sequences were confirmed by identical behaviour of natural and synthetic peptides in reversed-phase HPLC and liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry, resulting in identical retention times and tandem mass spectral data. High resolution mass spectrometry and retention time data also confirmed that the amino acid at position 10 in Manse-AKH-II is Gln and not the isobaric Lys. Conspecific injections of all five peptides in synthetic form and low doses caused hyperlipaemia in H. eson. Our results and pertaining literature suggest that five genes code for the mature peptides, which are very likely released during flight to provide energy for long distance migration in this genus via  oxidation; as all five peptides are active at low doses in a conspecific bioassay, it may be speculated, but not proven, that there is only one AKH receptor present in Hippotion that can bind all five peptides with high affinity.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
