In this study, we examined the ability of a novel cyano derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid, that is, butyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxours-1,12-dien-24-oate (BCDD) to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. BCDD inhibited cell proliferation with 48 h IC(50) of 0.67 µM in HL-60, 1 µM in Molt4, and 1.5 µM in THP1 cells. The mechanism of cell death was investigated in HL-60 cells where it caused apoptosis by acting against several potential apoptosis suppressive targets. It inhibited phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activity, NF-κB, Hsp-90, and survivin which may enhance the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis. Also, BCDD decreased the activity of Bid and Bax in cytosol, caused ΔΨ(mt) loss, releasing pro-apoptotic cytochrome c, SMAC/DIABLO leading to caspase-9-mediated down stream activation of caspase-3, ICAD, and PARP1 cleavage. Translocation of apoptotis-inducing factor (AIF) from  to the nucleus indicated some caspases-independent apoptosis. Though it upregulated DR-5 and caspase-8, the caspase inhibitor yet had no effect on apoptosis as against 75% inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor. Attempts were made to examine any acclaimed role of AIF in the activation of caspase-8 using siRNA where it had no effect on caspase-8 activity while the Bax-siRNA inhibited caspase-3 activation suggesting predominance of intrinsic signaling. Our studies thus demonstrated that BCDD exerts multi-focal action in cancer cells while it required 10-fold higher the concentration to produce cytotoxicity in normal human PBMC and gingival cell line, and therefore, may find usefulness in the management of human leukemia.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23500016>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) inhibits human gastric carcinoma growth through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Acetyl- (AKBA) is a derivative of boswellic acid, an active component of Boswellia serrata gum resin. We examined the effect of AKBA on human gastric carcinoma growth and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.Inhibition of cancer cell growth was estimated by colorimetric and clonogenic assays. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry and apoptosis determined using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and DNA ladder quantification. After three weeks of oral AKBA administration in nude mice bearing cancer xenografts, animals were sacrificed and xenografts removed for TUNEL staining and western blot analysis.AKBA exhibited anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo. With oral application in mice, AKBA significantly inhibited SGC-7901 and MKN-45 xenografts without toxicity. This effect might be associated with its roles in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. The results also showed activation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p53 in  and increased cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio after AKBA treatment. Further analysis suggested that these effects might arise from AKBA's modulation of the aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Upon AKBA treatment, β-catenin expression in nuclei was inhibited, and membrane β-catenin was activated. In the same sample, active GSK3β was increased and its non-active form decreased. Levels of cyclin D1, PCNA, survivin, c-Myc, MMP-2, and MMP-7, downstream targets of Wnt/β-catenin, were inhibited.AKBA effects on human gastric carcinoma growth were associated with its activity in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.AKBA could be useful in the treatment of gastric cancers.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated in vitro cytotoxicities of B. serrata extract and AKBA on differentiated and undifferentiated keratinocytes (HaCaT and NCTC 2544), and foetal dermal fibroblasts (HFFF2), using neutral red uptake (NRU), MTT, and DNA assays. Comparison between NRU and MTT, and between the extract and AKBA, suggested a relatively higher toxicity of both substances on lysosomes respect to . Extract cytotoxicity on lysosomes was higher in NCTC and HFFF2 than on the more differentiated HaCaT. DNA assay showed low extract inhibition on HFFF2 proliferation, possibly due to lower growth rate, and a stronger effect on NCTC than on HaCaT, possibly related to higher proapoptotic effect on the less differentiated NCTC, as also suggested by higher AKBA toxicity on NCTC than on HaCaT. In general, gum resin and AKBA toxicities were slightly lower or higher than that of the reference compound SDS. Our in vitro model allowed to compare the sensitivities of different human skin cells to B. serrata, and indicated that the gum resin and AKBA exert moderate to low toxicity on the skin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821018>Potentiation of the antitumor effect of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid by its 3-α-hexanoyloxy derivative.</a></h1><p>We recently discovered that a propionyloxy derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (PKBA) showed better anticancer potential than other boswellic acids including AKBA, encompassing the importance of acyl group at the 3-α-hydroxy position of KBA. In continuation of our previous work, other higher derivatives (with increasing alkoxy chain length at 3-α-hydroxy position) including butyryloxy (BKBA) and hexanoyloxy (HKBA) derivatives of KBA were synthesized. The respective IC(50) values of BKBA and HKBA in HL-60 cells were found to be 7.7 and 4.5 μg/ml. IC(50) value of HKBA was comparatively lower than that of BKBA, and further lower than that of the previously reported derivative (PKBA, IC(50) 8.7 μg/ml). In order to compare the anticancer potential of HKBA with PKBA, detailed in vitro pro-apoptotic and in vivo anticancer studies were carried out. The induction of apoptosis by HKBA was measured using various parameters including fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, DNA fragmentation and Annexin V-FITC binding. The extent of DNA damage was measured using neutral comet assay. HKBA was further evaluated for its effect on DNA cell cycle and  where it was found to arrest cells in G(2)/M phase and also induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These events were associated with increased expression of cytosolic cytochrome c and cleavage of PARP. Target based studies showed that HKBA inhibited the enzymatic activity of topoisomerases I and II at low doses than that of PKBA. In vivo studies also revealed a low dose inhibitory effect of HKBA on ascitic and solid murine tumor models.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

HPV E6 protein promotes the degradation of p53 thereby inhibiting its stabilization and activation. This study demonstrates that treatment with a novel cyano derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid, i.e. butyl 2-cyano-3, 11-dioxours-1,12-dien-24-oate (BCDD) reduced the viral E6 mRNA expression and lead to the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 in the nucleus of HPV18 HeLa cells following DNA damage. Western blot analysis showed that BCDD robustly up regulated time-dependent expression of p53/PUMA/p21 whereas it deprived cells essentially of p-AKT and NF-κB cell survival signalling cascade. BCDD appeared to gear up PUMA activation through p53 pathway and that both p53 and p21 translocated heavily into the nucleus. Simultaneously, it inhibited anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, augumented Drp-1 expression, disrupted mitochondrial functions causing the activation of proapoptotic proteins and caspases activation. Additionally, BCDD inhibited telomerase expression that's likely to result in a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of high-grade cervical cancers. Consequently BCDD caused apoptotic death in cervical cancer cells as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and PARP-cleavage. Further, BCDD did not affect the extrinsic signalling transduction pathway as depicted by its null effect on caspase-8. The in vivo anticancer activity of BCDD was investigated in Ehrlich Ascites carcinoma model where it exhibited tumor regression by 48% at 30 mg/kg, i.p., in mice. These findings indicated that BCDD is a potential candidate that may be found useful in the management of cervical cancer.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
