In this study, we characterized a novel porcine β-defensin (pBD129) and explored its role in alleviating bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation and intestinal epithelium atrophy. The  gene was cloned and expressed in . A recombinant pBD129 protein was also purified. To explore its role in alleviating the endotoxin-induced inflammation, mice, with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge were treated by pBD129 at different doses. The recombinant pBD129 showed significant antimicrobial activities against the  and  with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of 32 μg/mL. Hemolytic assays showed that the pBD129 had no detrimental impact on cell viabilities. Interestingly, we found that pBD129 attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses by decreasing serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, such as the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α ( < 0.05). Moreover, pBD129 elevated the intestinal villus height ( < 0.05) and enhanced the expression and localization of the major -associated protein ZO-1 in LPS-challenged mice. Additionally, pDB129 at a high dose significantly decreased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) concentration ( < 0.05) and reduced intestinal epithelium cell apoptosis ( < 0.05) in LPS-challenged mice. Importantly, pBD129 elevated the expression level of Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bcl-2), but down-regulated the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes such as the B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein (Bax), BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and caspase-9 in the intestinal mucosa ( < 0.05). These results suggested a novel function of the mammalian defensins, and the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of pBD129 may allow it a potential substitute for conventionally used antibiotics or drugs.Copyright © 2019 Xie, Xie, Su, Chen, Yu, Mao, Huang, Yu, Luo, Zheng, Luo and He.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527509>Detailed Clinical Features of Deafness Caused by a Claudin-14 Variant.</a></h2><p> are cellular  that play a major role in the epithelial barrier function. In the inner ear, claudins, occludin, tricellulin, and angulins form the bicellular or tricellular binding of membrane proteins. In these, one type of claudin gene, , was reported to be responsible for human hereditary hearing loss, DFNB29. Until now, nine pathogenic variants have been reported, and most phenotypic features remain unclear. In the present study, genetic screening for 68 previously reported deafness causative genes was carried out to identify  variants in a large series of Japanese hearing loss patients, and to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNB29 in the Japanese population. One patient had a homozygous novel variant (c.241C>T: p.Arg81Cys) (0.04%: 1/2549). The patient showed progressive bilateral hearing loss, with post-lingual onset. Pure-tone audiograms indicated a high-frequency hearing loss type, and the deterioration gradually spread to other frequencies. The patient showed normal vestibular function. Cochlear implantation improved the patient's sound field threshold levels, but not speech discrimination scores. This report indicated that claudin-14 is essential for maintaining the inner ear environment and suggested the possible phenotypic expansion of DFNB29. This is the first report of a patient with a  variant receiving a cochlear implantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581480>Apoptotic Fragmentation of Tricellulin.</a></h2><p>Apoptotic extrusion of cells from epithelial cell layers is of central importance for epithelial homeostasis. As a prerequisite cell-cell contacts between apoptotic cells and their neighbors have to be dissociated. Tricellular  (tTJs) represent specialized structures that seal polarized epithelial cells at sites where three cells meet and are characterized by the specific expression of tricellulin and angulins. Here, we specifically addressed the fate of tricellulin in apoptotic cells.Apoptosis was induced by staurosporine or camptothecin in MDCKII and RT-112 cells. The fate of tricellulin was analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Caspase activity was inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK or Z-DEVD-FMK.Induction of apoptosis induces the degradation of tricellulin with time. Aspartate residues 487 and 441 were identified as caspase cleavage-sites in the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of human tricellulin. Fragmentation of tricellulin was inhibited in the presence of caspase inhibitors or when Asp487 or Asp441 were mutated to asparagine. Deletion of the tricellulin C-terminal amino acids prevented binding to lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR)/angulin-1 and thus should impair specific localization of tricellulin to tTJs.Tricellulin is a substrate of caspases and its cleavage in consequence contributes to the dissolution of tTJs during apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556290>2--β-d-Glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic Acid, an Ascorbic Acid Derivative Isolated from the Fruits of  L., Modulates Gut Microbiota and Palliates Colitis in Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>In this study, the effects of 2--β-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid (AA-2βG), a natural ascorbic acid derivative from the fruits of , on treating the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice were investigated. The results revealed that AA-2βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing colitis disease activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing  proteins. Additionally, AA-2βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty acids and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to IBD were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and . The results indicated that AA-2βG might treat IBD through the regulation of gut microbiota, suggesting that AA-2βG has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536969>Biomanufacturing of a novel <i>in vitro</i> biomimetic blood-brain barrier model.</a></h2><p>Glioma is a malignant tumor that severely threatens human health. However, it is difficult for most therapeutic agents to penetrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exhibit their antineoplastic activity in the brain. In this manuscript, a biomimetic in vitro BBB model was created by a composite process, this model can provide a significant foundation for the research of drug transport, tumor treatment, tumor microenvironment and other fields. A series of tests and comparative experiments were performed to evaluate this model. The tests showed that the model enabled preliminary simulation of the structure and function of the BBB. Experimental results demonstrated: 1) the new technology enabled controlled release of growth factors and successfully induced endothelial progenitor cells into endothelial cells. Compared with the traditional gold standard, the Transwell model, the expression of four specific proteins that are related to the BBB characteristics was significantly increased (alkaline phosphatase(ALP) by 89.82%, γ-GT by 88.86%, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by 57.40%, and Claudin-5 by 102.32%) in this model; 2) Astrocytes had a promoting effect on the microvascular endothelial cells to form  (ZO-1 increased by 249.35%, Claudin-5 increased by 184.99%), and there was a great difference between whether these two types of cells were contact cultured or not; 3) The gelatinous cell U118 had a destructive effect on the  of BBB (ZO-1 decreased by 55.86%, Claudin-5 decreased by 37.84%).© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652502>Neutrophil-Derived Microvesicle Induced Dysfunction of Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells In Vitro.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) that are tightly linked by  (TJ) proteins, restricts the movement of molecules between the periphery and the central nervous system. Elevated systemic levels of neutrophils have been detected in patients with altered BBB function, but the role of neutrophils in BMEC dysfunction is unknown. Neutrophils are key players of the immune response and, when activated, produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV). NMV have been shown to impact the integrity of endothelial cells throughout the body and we hypothesize that NMV released from circulating neutrophils interact with BMEC and induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction of NMV with human BMEC and determined whether they altered gene expression and function in vitro. Using flow cytometry and confocal imaging, NMV were shown to be internalized by the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 via a variety of energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The internalization of NMV significantly altered the transcriptomic profile of hCMEC/D3, specifically inducing the dysregulation of genes associated with TJ, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and vesicular transport. Functional studies confirmed NMV significantly increased permeability and decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of a confluent monolayer of hCMEC/D3. These findings indicate that NMV interact with and affect gene expression of BMEC as well as impacting their integrity. We conclude that NMV may play an important role in modulating the permeability of BBB during an infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554875>CFH exerts anti-oxidant effects on retinal pigment epithelial cells independently from protecting against membrane attack complex.</a></h2><p>Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the first cause of social blindness in people aged over 65 leading to atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), photoreceptors and choroids, eventually associated with choroidal neovascularization. Accumulation of undigested cellular debris within RPE cells or under the RPE (Drusen), oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators contribute to the RPE cell death. The major risk to develop AMD is the Y402H polymorphism of complement factor H (CFH). CFH interacting with oxidized phospholipids on the RPE membrane modulates the functions of these cells, but the exact role of CFH in RPE cell death and survival remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the potential protective mechanism of CFH on RPE cells submitted to oxidative stress. Upon exposure to oxidized lipids 4-HNE (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) derived from photoreceptors, both the human RPE cell line ARPE-19 and RPE cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells were protected from death only in the presence of the full length human recombinant CFH in the culture medium. This protective effect was independent from the membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. CFH maintained RPE cells ' structure and regulated the caspase dependent apoptosis process. These results demonstrated the CFH anti-oxidative stress functions independently of its capacity to inhibit MAC formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578353>Antimicrobial peptide, cLF36, affects performance and intestinal morphology, microflora, junctional proteins, and immune cells in broilers challenged with E. coli.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), cLF36, on growth performance and the histophysiological changes of the intestine in E. coli-challenged broiler chickens. A total number of 360 day old male chicks were randomly assigned to 4 groups of 6 replicates as follows: T1) negative control diet based on corn-soybean meal without E. coli challenge and additives; T2) positive control diet based on corn-soybean meal and challenged with E. coli without any additives; T3) positive control diet challenged with E. coli and supplemented with 20 mg AMP (cLF36)/kg diet; T4) positive control diet challenged with E. coli and supplemented with 45 mg antibiotic (bacitracin methylene disalicylate)/kg diet. Results showed that T3 improved growth performance and the jejunal morphology of E. coli-challenged chickens similar to those of T4. While antibiotic non-selectively decreased the population of ileal bacteria, AMP increased the population of Lactobacillus spp. and decreased harmful bacteria in the ileum of E. coli-challenged chickens. Supplementing E. coli-challenged chickens with AMP improved the gene expression of immune cells and upregulated the expression of  proteins compared to other challenged groups. In conclusion, although cLF36 beneficially affected growth performance and the intestinal morphology of E. coli-challenged chickens similar to those of the antibiotic group, this AMP drastically improved the intestinal microbiome, immune cells, and junctional proteins compared to other E. coli-challenged birds, and can be nominated as an alternative for growth promoter antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536982>Lubiprostone Induces Claudin-1 and Protects Intestinal Barrier Function.</a></h2><p>Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, is said to reduce epithelial permeability. However, whether lubiprostone has a direct effect on the epithelial barrier function and how it modulates the intestinal barrier function remain unknown. Therefore, the effects of lubiprostone on intestinal barrier function were evaluated in vitro.Caco-2 cells were used to assess the intestinal barrier function. To examine the expression of claudins, immunoblotting was performed with specific antibodies. The effects of lubiprostone on cytokines (IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-1β) and aspirin-induced epithelial barrier disruption were assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability.IFNγ, IL-6, IL-1β, and aspirin significantly decreased TEER and increased epithelial permeability. Lubiprostone significantly improved the IFNγ-induced decrease in TEER in a dose-dependent manner. Lubiprostone significantly reduced the IFNγ-induced increase in FITC labeled-dextran permeability. The changes induced by IL-6, IL-1β, and aspirin were not affected by lubiprostone. The expression of claudin-1, but not claudin-3, claudin-4, occludin, and ZO-1 was significantly increased by lubiprostone.Lubiprostone significantly improved the IFNγ-induced decrease in TEER and increase in FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Lubiprostone increased the expression of claudin-1, and this increase may be related to the effect of lubiprostone on the epithelial barrier function.© 2019 S.

However, current monolayer systems are cost- and/or time-intensive, hampering progress. This study evaluates two separate methods to reduce resource input: FB Essence as a fetal bovine serum (FBS) alternative and a new, 3-day Caco-2 system deemed "thrifty, rapid intestinal monolayers" (TRIM).Caco-2 cells were cultured with FB Essence and compared to cells in 10% FBS for proliferation and monolayer formation. TRIM were compared to commonly-used 21-day and Corning® HTS monolayer systems, as well as mouse intestines, for permeability behavior, epithelial gene expression, and  arrangement.No amount of FB Essence maintained Caco-2 cells beyond 10 passages. In contrast, TRIM compared favorably in permeability and gene expression to intestinal tissues. Furthermore, TRIM cost $109 and required 1.3 h of time per 24-well plate, compared to $164 and 3.7 h for 21-day monolayers, and $340 plus 1.0 h for the HTS system.TRIM offer a new approach to generating Caco-2 monolayers that resemble the intestinal epithelium. They are anticipated to accelerate the pace of in vitro intestinal experiments while easing financial burden.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572482>Effect of  N1115 and fructooligosaccharides in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern worldwide. Administration of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a convenient and effective treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of  N1115 (N1115) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) by examining the histopathogenesis and underlying molecular events of NAFLD.An NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). N1115, FOS and synbiotics were administered for 16 weeks.N1115, FOS and synbiotics alleviated HFD-induced hepatic steato-sis and release of tumor necrosis factor-α, and slowed the progression of cirrhosis. Compared to the HFD group, these dietary supplements reduced serum total triglyceride and cholesterol, and appeared to decrease the fasting blood glucose and insulin. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and real-time PCR showed that the regimens could overcome insulin resistance. These findings were associated with the transcriptional repression of inflammatory factors such as lipopolysaccharides, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB. Lastly, N1115, FOS, and synbiotics improved the intestinal barrier functions and histologic integrity. This was accompanied by the restoration of the p38 MAPK pathway and in-creased expression of the  components occludin-1 and claudin-1.N1115, FOS and synbiotics are effective in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Our data support the translation of these agents into clinical evaluation in human subjects with NAFLD and/or associated risk factors.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia & Banach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494661>Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4 (ANGPTL4) Induces Retinal Pigment Epithelial Barrier Breakdown by Activating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3): Evidence from ARPE-19 Cells Under Hypoxic Condition and Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Diabetic retinopathy is a primary contributor of visual impairment in adult diabetes mellitus patients. Diabetic retinopathy causes breakdown of blood retinal barrier (BRB), and leads to diabetic macular edema. Previous studies have demonstrated angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) as an effective diabetic retinopathy therapeutic target, however, its role in maintaining the outer BRB in diabetic retinopathy has yet not elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS We established an in vivo diabetic rat model with the use of streptozotocin injections and cultured ARPE-19 cells under (hypoxia, 1%) condition. We first investigated the expression of hypoxia induced factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and ANGPTL4 in vivo and subsequently studied the transcriptional regulation and underlying molecular mechanisms in ARPE-19 cells under oxygen-deprived situations. RESULTS The expression of HIF-1alpha and ANGPTL4 was increased with diabetic retinopathy progression both in vivo and in vitro. Depletion of HIF-1alpha by siRNA inhibited hypoxia-induced ANGPTL4 expression. Repressing the HIF-1alpha/ANGPTL4 signaling effectively alleviated the migration and cellular permeability induced by hypoxia in ARPE-19 cells. Depletion of ANGPTL4 by siRNA significantly alleviated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity in vitro, thereby attenuating the decrease of  proteins occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) under hypoxia in ARPE-19 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that ANGPTL4 partially modulates STAT3 and could serve as an effective diabetic retinopathy treatment strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671721>Structure and Junctional Complexes of Endothelial, Epithelial and Glial Brain Barriers.</a></h2><p>The homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) is ensured by the endothelial, epithelial, mesothelial and glial brain barriers, which strictly control the passage of molecules, solutes and immune cells. While the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the epithelial blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) have been extensively investigated, less is known about the epithelial and mesothelial arachnoid barrier and the glia limitans. Here, we summarize current knowledge of the cellular composition of the brain barriers with a specific focus on describing the molecular constituents of their junctional complexes. We propose that the brain barriers maintain CNS immune privilege by dividing the CNS into compartments that differ with regard to their role in immune surveillance of the CNS. We close by providing a brief overview on experimental tools allowing for reliable in vivo visualization of the brain barriers and their junctional complexes and thus the respective CNS compartments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554900>Cesarean section increases sensitivity to oxazolone-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice.</a></h2><p>Children born by cesarean section (CS) have an increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), possibly due to skewed microbial colonization during birth and consequently impaired bacterial stimulation of the developing immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between CS and experimental colitis in a murine model of IBD. It was hypothesized that CS aggravates colonic inflammation due to a change in gut microbiota (GM) composition. C57BL/6 mice, delivered by CS or vaginal delivery (VD), were intra-rectally challenged with oxazolone at 8 weeks of age and monitored for colitis symptoms. The results showed that CS delivered mice experienced an increased body weight loss and colon weight, together with higher colonic concentrations of TNF-α and MPO compared with VD mice. Increased infiltration of inflammatory cells was present in CS delivered mice, as well as a downregulation in expression of the gut integrity genes occludin and  protein 1 indicative of an impaired barrier function. The GM from CS delivered mice without colitis partly contributed to the increase in colitis symptoms when inoculated into germ-free recipient mice. In conclusion, CS increased sensitivity to oxazolone induced colitis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669344>Changes in vascular permeability in the spinal cord contribute to chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.</a></h2><p>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a dose-limiting side effect of many cancer therapies due to their propensity to accumulate in peripheral nerves, which is facilitated by the permeability of the blood-nerve barrier. Preclinically, the chemotherapy agent vincristine (VCR) activates endothelial cells in the murine peripheral nervous system and in doing so allows the infiltration of monocytes into nerve tissue where they orchestrate the development of VCR-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity. In this study we demonstrate that VCR also activates endothelial cells in the murine central nervous system, increases paracellular permeability and decreases trans endothelial resistance. In in vivo imaging studies in mice, VCR administration results in trafficking of inflammatory monocytes through the endothelium. Indeed, VCR treatment affects the integrity of the blood-spinal cord-barrier as indicated by Evans Blue extravasation, disrupts  coupling and is accompanied by the presence of monocytes in the spinal cord. Such inflammatory monocytes (Iba-1 CCR2 Ly6C TMEM119 cells) that infiltrate the spinal cord also express the pro-nociceptive cysteine protease Cathepsin S. Systemic treatment with a CNS-penetrant, but not a peripherally-restricted, inhibitor of Cathepsin S prevents the development of VCR-induced hypersensitivity, suggesting that infiltrating monocytes play a functional role in sensitising spinal cord nociceptive neurons. Our findings guide us towards a better understanding of central mechanisms of pain associated with VCR treatment and thus pave the way for the development of innovative antinociceptive strategies.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we investigated the effect of  and its extracellular vesicles (EVs) on obesity-related genes in microarray datasets and evaluated the cell line and C57BL/6 mice by conducting RT-PCR and ELISA assays. -derived EVs caused a more significant loss in body and fat weight of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, compared with the bacterium itself. Moreover, treatment with  and EVs had significant effects on lipid metabolism and expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissues. Both treatments improved the intestinal barrier integrity, inflammation, energy balance, and blood parameters (i.e., lipid profile and glucose level). Our findings showed that -derived EVs contain various biomolecules, which can have a positive impact on obesity by affecting the involved genes. Also, our results showed that  and its EVs had a significant relationship with intestinal homeostasis, which highlights their positive role in obesity treatment. In conclusion, -derived EVs can be used as new therapeutic strategies to ameliorate HFD-induced obesity by affecting various mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 Ashrafian, Shahriary, Behrouzi, Moradi, Keshavarz Azizi Raftar, Lari, Hadifar, Yaghoubfar, Ahmadi Badi, Khatami, Vaziri and Siadat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597222>A composite Gelatin/hyaluronic acid hydrogel as an ECM mimic for developing mesenchymal stem cell derived epithelial tissue patches.</a></h2><p>Here we report fabrication of Gelatin based biocomposite films and their application in developing epithelial patches.

Our data show differentiation of Calu-3 cells on composite films as evidenced by  protein expression and barrier formation.

We also show the suitability of the composite films as a biomimetic scaffold and growth factor delivery platform for differentiation of human MSCs to epithelial cells. MSCs differentiation to the epithelial lineage was confirmed by staining for epithelial and stem cell specific markers. Our data show that the MSCs acquire the epithelial characteristics after two weeks with significant reduction in vimentin, increase in pan cytokeratin expression as well as morphological changes. However, despite the expression of epithelial lineage markers these cells did not form fully functional  as evidenced by low expression of junctional protein ZO1. Further optimisation of culture conditions and growth factor cocktail is required to enhance  formation in MSCs derived epithelial cells on the composite hydrogels. Nevertheless, our data clearly highlight the possibility of using MSCs in epithelial tissue engineering and the applicability of the composite hydrogels as transferrable ECM mimics and delivery platforms with potential applications in regenerative medicine and in vitro modelling of barrier tissues.This article is protected by copyright.

These include the toxin-like molecules CRP136 and ESP58 that induce intestinal hyper-peristalsis. After the completion of the Giardia genome database and using up-to date transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, secreted 'virulence factors' have also been identified and experimentally characterized. This repertoire includes arginine deiminase (ADI) that competes for arginine, an important energy source for trophozoites, some high-cysteine membrane proteins (HCMPs) and VSP88, a versatile variant surface protein (VSP) that functions as an extracellular protease. Another giardial protein, enolase, moonlights as a metabolic enzyme that interacts with the fibrinolytic system and damages host epithelial cells. Other putative Giardia virulence factors are cysteine proteases that degrade multiple host components including mucin, villin,  proteins, immunoglobulins, defensins and cytokines. One of these proteases, named giardipain-1, decreases transepithelial electrical resistance and induces apoptosis in epithelial cells. A putative role for tenascins, present in the Giardia's secretome, is interfering with the host epidermal growth factor. Based on the roles that these molecules play, drugs may be designed to interfere with their functions. This review presents a comprehensive description of secreted Giardia virulence factors. It further describes their cytotoxic mechanisms and roles in the pathophysiology of giardiasis, and then assesses their potential as targets for drug development.© 2019 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566218>Protective Effects of Astaxanthin on Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation in Bovine Endometrial Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Astaxanthin (AST), a natural antioxidant carotenoid, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, to our knowledge, no study has specifically addressed the potential protective effects of AST against bovine endometritis. The purpose of this study was to examine whether treatment with AST could protect endometrial epithelial cells against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury. Treatment of bovine endometrial epithelial cell line (BEND) with AST reduced LPS-induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), increased the cellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), decreased the proportion of apoptotic cells, and promoted the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and epithelial growth factor (EGF). The effects of AST were mediated through the downregulation of Bcl-2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), and cleaved caspase-3 and through the upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, AST significantly increased the expression of the  proteins claudin, cadherin-1 (CDH1), and  protein 1 (TJP1), which play an essential role in the maintenance of host endometrial defense barrier against pathogen infection. Collectively, these results demonstrated that treatment with AST protected against oxidative stress, prevented cell apoptosis, promoted BEND cells viability, and increased the production of growth factors, in addition to activating the endometrial defense barrier. Therefore, AST is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of endometritis. This finding is of utmost importance in the present times when the excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.© The Author(s) 2019.

We hypothesized that feed restriction after day 5 following muscle satellite cell development would allow the full growth of the breast meat. To accomplish this goal, 300 1-day-old ducklings (Maple Leaf Farms Inc.) were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 groups (n = 4 pens, 25 ducks per pen): (1) Control group fed to ad libitum; (2) 85% daily feed intake from days 1 to 14 (FR 85% 1-14); 85% daily feed intake from days 5 to 14 (FR 85% 5-14). All ducks were vaccinated with inactivated Salmonella enteritidis on day 14 and boosted on day 26. The FR 85% 5-14 did show similar production standards to controls, and improved gait characteristics (P < 0.05). To determine if the partial feed restriction would have an impact on intestinal epithelial  integrity, we treated ducks on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 with 8.32 mg/kg FITC-d in water per os and blood samples were obtained via the tibial vein 1 h later. Serum samples were analyzed for presence and quantification of FITC-d. Feed restriction elicited a significant increase in FITC-d permeability at all points of evaluation. Anti-S. enteritidis specific IgY responses were assessed by ELISA from serum collected at 14 D, 28 D, and 35 D. Although all ducks showed an increase humoral immune response to the S. enteritidis, both feed restricted groups showed reduced IgY production compared to ad lib controls. Our data suggest that although the FR 5-14 feed restriction paradigm may reduce gait abnormalities without affecting production rates, some challenges exist due to increased gut leakiness or decreased acquired immune activity. Future studies will look at altering the feed restriction milieu to ameliorate these challenges.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632236>Pre- and Post-natal High Fat Feeding Differentially Affects the Structure and Integrity of the Neurovascular Unit of 16-Month Old Male and Female Mice.</a></h2><p>Compelling experimental and clinical evidence supports a role for maternal obesity in offspring health.

However, there is currently little information about the effect of chronic HF feeding on the BBB of aged animals. Moreover, the long-term consequences of maternal obesity on the cerebrovasculature of aged offspring are not known. This study determined the impact of pre- and post-natal HF diet on the structure and integrity of cerebral blood vessels in aged male and female mice. Female C57Bl/6 mice were fed either a 10% fat control (C) or 45% HF diet before mating and during gestation and lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring were fed the C or HF diet until sacrifice at 16-months of age. Both dams and offspring fed the HF diet weighed significantly more than mice fed the C diet. Post-natal HF diet exposure increased hippocampal BBB leakiness in female offspring, in association with loss of astrocyte endfoot coverage of arteries. Markers of , pericytes or smooth muscle cells were not altered by pre- or post-natal HF diet. Male offspring born to HF-fed mothers showed decreased parenchymal GFAP expression compared to offspring of mothers fed C diet, while microglial and macrophage markers were higher in the same female diet group. In addition, female offspring exposed to the HF diet for their entire lifespan showed more significant changes in vessel structure, BBB permeability and inflammation compared to male animals. These results suggest that the long-term impact of prenatal HF diet on the integrity of cerebral blood vessels differs between male and female offspring depending on the post-natal diet. This may have implications for the prevention and management of age- and obesity-related cerebrovascular diseases that differentially affect men and women.Copyright © 2019 Contu, Nizari, Heath and Hawkes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534167>Non-hematopoietic STAT6 induces epithelial  dysfunction and promotes intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Enhanced gut permeability due to dysregulated epithelial  is often associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which have a greater risk for developing colorectal cancer. STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial  integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial  dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial  integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618435>Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibition Mitigates Pouchitis.</a></h2><p>Pouchitis is the most common long-term complication after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which can eventually progress to pouch failure, necessitating permanent stoma construction. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor prolyl hydroxylase-containing enzymes (PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3) are molecular oxygen sensors that control adaptive gene expression through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Emerging evidence supports PHDs as being therapeutic targets in intestinal inflammation. However, pharmacological inhibition of PHDs has not been validated as a treatment strategy in pouchitis.PHD1-3 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed in mucosal pouch and prepouch ileal patient biopsies. After establishment of a preclinical IPAA model in rats, the impact of the pan-PHD small-molecule inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced pouchitis was studied. Clinical and molecular parameters were investigated.PHD1, but not PHD2 or PHD3, was overexpressed in pouchitis in biopsies of patients with IPAA for UC but not FAP. In addition, PHD1 expression correlated with disease activity. DMOG treatment profoundly mitigated DSS-induced pouchitis in a rodent IPAA model. Mechanistically, DMOG restored intestinal epithelial barrier function by induction of  proteins zona occludens-1 and claudin-1 and alleviation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, thus attenuating pouch inflammation.Together, these results establish a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting PHD1 with small-molecule inhibitors in pouchitis after IPAA for UC.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Biodegradable ureteral stents, commonly made of polymers, have been proposed to overcome these problems. Recently, absorbable metals have been considered as potential materials offering both biodegradation and strength. This work proposed zinc-based absorbable metals by firstly evaluating their cytocompatibility toward normal primary human urothelial cells using 2D and 3D assays. In the 2D assay, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of metal extracts (i.e., 10 mg/mL of Zn-1Mg and 8.75 mg/mL of Zn-0.5Al) for up to 3 days and found that their cytoskeletal networks were affected but were recovered at day 3, as observed by immunofluorescence. In the 3D ureteral wall tissue construct, the cells formed a multilayered urothelium, as found in native tissue, with the presence of  at the superficial layer and laminin at the basal layer, indicating a healthy tissue condition even with the presence of the metal samples for up to 7 days of exposure. The basal cells attached to the metal surface as seen in a natural spreading state with pseudopodia and fusiform morphologies, indicating that the metals were non-toxic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31518857>Giardia excretory-secretory proteins modulate the enzymatic activities of mast cell chymase and tryptase.</a></h2><p>Mast cells are involved in the host immune response controlling infection with the non-invasive intestinal protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis. Experimental infections in rodents with G. intestinalis showed increased intestinal expression of mucosal and connective mast cell specific proteases suggesting that both mucosal and connective tissue mast cells are recruited and activated during infection. During infection Giardia excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) with immunomodulatory capacity are released. However, studies investigating potential interactions between Giardia ESPs and the connective tissue mast cell specific serine proteases, i.e. human chymase and mouse mast cell protease (mMCP)-4 and, human and mouse tryptase (mMCP-6) remain scarce.We first investigated if soluble Giardia proteins (sGPs), which over-lap extensively in protein content with ESP fractions, from the isolates GS, WB and H3, could induce mast cell activation. sGPs induced a minor activation of bone marrow derived mucosal-like mast cells, as indicated by increased IL-6 secretion and no degranulation. Furthermore, sGPs were highly resistant to degradation by human tryptase while human chymase degraded a 65 kDa sGP and, wild-type mouse ear tissue extracts degraded several protein bands in the 10 to 75 kDa range. In striking contrast, sGPs and ESPs were found to increase the enzymatic activity of human and mouse tryptase and to reduce the activity of human and mouse chymase.Our finding suggests that Giardia ssp. via enhancement or reduction of mast cell protease activity may modulate mast cell-driven intestinal immune responses. ESP-mediated modulation of the mast cell specific proteases may also increase degradation of , which may be beneficial for Giardia ssp. during infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent gut barrier dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the gut epithelium (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal  were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin 5 and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all  mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via  alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667008>Modelling Macular Edema: The Effect of IL-6 and IL-6R Blockade on Human Blood-Retinal Barrier Integrity In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Macular edema (ME) is a leading cause of visual loss in a range of retinal diseases and despite the use of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, its successful treatment remains a major clinical challenge. Based on the indirect clinical evidence that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key additional candidate mediator of ME, we interrogated the effect of IL-6 on blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity in vitro.Human retinal pigment epithelial cell (ARPE-19) and human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) monolayers were used to mimic the outer and inner BRB, respectively. Their paracellular permeability was assessed by measuring the passive permeation of 40 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran across confluent cells in the presence of IL-6. Transendothelial/epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) then was measured and the distribution of the  protein ZO-1 was assessed by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy.Treatment with IL-6 for 48 hours significantly increased the diffusion rate of FITC-dextran, decreased TEER, and disrupted the distribution of ZO-1 in ARPE-19 cells, which constitutively express the IL-6 transmembrane receptor, and this was reversed with IL-6R blockade. In contrast, IL-6 did not affect the paracellular permeability, TEER, or ZO-1 distribution in HRMECs.These in vitro data support the hypothesis that IL-6 reversibly disrupts the integrity of ARPE-19 cells, but it does not affect HRMECs.IL-6 is a candidate therapeutic target in the treatment of outer BRB driven ME.Copyright 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607844>Retinal Phenotype in the rd9 Mutant Mouse, a Model of X-Linked RP.</a></h2><p>Retinal degeneration 9 (rd9) mice carry a mutation in the retina specific "Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator (RPGR)" Open Reading Frame (ORF) 15 gene, located on the X chromosome and represent a rare model of X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP), a common and severe form of retinal degeneration (Wright et al., 2010; Tsang and Sharma, 2018). The rd9 RPGR-ORF15 mutation in mice causes lack of the protein in photoreceptors and a slow degeneration of these cells with consequent decrease in Outer Nuclear Layer (ONL) thickness and amplitude of ERG responses, as previously described (Thompson et al., 2012). However, relative rates of rod and cone photoreceptor loss, as well as secondary alterations occurring in neuronal and non-neuronal retinal cell types of rd9 mutants remain to be assessed. Aim of this study is to extend phenotype analysis of the rd9 mouse retina focusing on changes occurring in cells directly interacting with photoreceptors. To this purpose, first we estimated rod and cone survival and its degree of intraretinal variation over time; then, we studied the morphology of horizontal and bipolar cells and of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), extending our observations to glial cell reactivity. We found that in rd9 retinas rod (but not cone) death is the main cause of decrease in ONL thickness and that degeneration shows a high degree of intraretinal variation. Rod loss drives remodeling in the outer retina, with sprouting of second-order neurons of the rod-pathway and relative sparing of cone pathway elements. Remarkably, despite cone survival, functional defects can be clearly detected in ERG recordings in both scotopic and photopic conditions. Moderate levels of Muller cells and microglial reactivity are sided by striking attenuation of staining for RPE , suggesting altered integrity of the outer Blood Retina Barrier (BRB). Because of many features resembling slowly progressing photoreceptor degeneration paradigms or early stages of more aggressive forms of RP, the rd9 mouse model can be considered a rare and useful tool to investigate retinal changes associated to a process of photoreceptor death sustained throughout life and to reveal disease biomarkers (e.g., BRB alterations) of human XLRP.Copyright © 2019 Falasconi, Biagioni, Novelli, Piano, Gargini and Strettoi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586306>The mechanobiology of .</a></h2><p> (TJ) play a central role in the homeostasis of epithelial and endothelial tissues, by providing a semipermeable barrier to ions and solutes, by contributing to the maintenance of cell polarity, and by functioning as signaling platforms.

We demonstrated that the agonism of the δ opioid receptor (DOR) by epicatechin preserves the  proteins in ARPE-19 cells under diabetic conditions. Presently, we aimed to evaluate the possible role of the DOR on the maintenance of  of RPE layer and on the early markers of experimental DR.DR markers and external retinal  proteins were evaluated in CL57B diabetic mice submitted to intravitreous injection of short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-DOR (108 transducing units [TU]/mL) treated or not with DOR agonist (0.05 g/animal/d of epicatechin in drinking water) for 16 weeks. The presence of DOR in human retina from postmortem eyes from diabetic and nondiabetic donors were also performed.DOR is present in RPE layer and in neuro retina. The treatment with DOR agonist prevented the upregulation of the early markers of retinopathy (glial fibrillary acidic protein, VEGF) and the downregulation of pigment epithelium-derived factor, occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occludens-1  expressions. The silencing of DOR in retina of diabetic mice partially abolished the protective effects of epicatechin. In human retina specimens, DOR is present throughout the retina, similarly in nondiabetic and diabetic donors.This set of experiments strongly indicates that the DOR agonism preserves RPE  and reduces the early markers of retinopathy in model of diabetes. These novel findings designate DOR as a potential therapeutic tool to treat DR with preservation of the RPE  proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538163>The ameliorative effect of the Pyracantha fortuneana (Maxim.) H. L. Li extract on intestinal barrier dysfunction through modulating glycolipid digestion and gut microbiota in high fat diet-fed rats.</a></h2><p>Pyracantha fortuneana fruits are consumed as a dietary supplement in China and attenuate obesity and metabolic disorders. Obesity is known to be associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction driven by hyperglycemia and gut dysbiosis. However, whether the health benefits of P. fortuneana fruits are linked with the intestinal barrier function (IBF) remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the restorative effects of P. fortuneana fruit extract (PFE) on the IBF. Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a chow, a high-fat diet (HFD), or a PFE-supplemented diet for 8 weeks. Results showed that PFE intervention ameliorated HFD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction by attenuating impaired structural integrity, reducing the elevated lactulose/mannitol ratio, and improving the mRNA and protein expression levels of  proteins in HFD-fed rats. The ameliorations were associated with a beneficial effect on glycolipid homeostasis, as evidenced from the PFE decreasing intestinal absorptive capacity based on the d-xylose excretory rate, lowering the expression of GLUT2 and inhibiting digestive enzyme activities. The proanthocyanidins in the PFE showed greater in vitro inhibition on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and lipase compared with triterpenoid saponins. Furthermore, the ameliorations on the IBF were also associated with effects on the microbial composition based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Several bacterial groups, which were linked with gut barrier integrity, were modulated after PFE administration, that is, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and S24-7 were elevated and the HFD-induced increase in Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, Oscillospira, and Flexispira was restored. These data provide evidence for the ameliorative effect of the PFE on diet-induced intestinal barrier functional alternations in association with its capacity to modulate glycolipid digestion and gut microbiota in HFD-fed obese rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614141>Trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid alleviates LPS-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction by activating the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that trans-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), the exclusive lipid component of royal jelly (RJ), alleviates Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation both in vivo and in vitro. However, whether 10-HDA can protect against LPS-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is largely unexplored. In this study, we first observed that 10-HDA decreased BBB permeability in LPS-stimulated C57BL/6 mice by Evan's blue (EB) dye. Immunostaining and Western blot results showed that 10-HDA alleviated BBB dysfunction by inhibiting the degradation of  proteins (occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1). In LPS-stimulated human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), 10-HDA decreased the expression of chemokines (CCL-2 and CCL-3), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), reactive oxygen species, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and increased the expression of  proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 10-HDA pretreatment upregulated the expression of mitochondria-associated proteins, which may reflect the mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on reactive oxygen species. We further illustrated that 10-HDA promoted the activation of the AMPK pathway and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) markedly reversed the alleviating effect of 10-HDA on the expression of  proteins, indicating that 10-HDA inhibited LPS-induced BBB dysfunction by triggering the activation of the AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these data reveal that 10-HDA may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of diseases related to BBB damage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is challenging to use light to manipulate protein activity in living systems without genetic modification. Here, we report a technique to optically switch off protein activity in living cells with high spatiotemporal resolution, referred to as molecular hyperthermia (MH). MH is based on the nanoscale-confined heating of plasmonic gold nanoparticles by short laser pulses to unfold and photoinactivate targeted proteins of interest. First, we show that protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor and an important pathway that leads to pain sensitization, can be photoinactivated  by MH without compromising cell proliferation. PAR2 activity can be switched off in laser-targeted cells without affecting surrounding cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular specificity of MH by inactivating PAR2 while leaving other receptors intact. Second, we demonstrate that the photoinactivation of a  protein in brain endothelial monolayers leads to a reversible blood-brain barrier opening . Lastly, the protein inactivation by MH is below the nanobubble generation threshold and thus is predominantly due to the nanoscale heating. MH is distinct from traditional hyperthermia (that induces global tissue heating) in both its time and length scales: nanoseconds  seconds, nanometers  millimeters. Our results demonstrate that MH enables selective and remote manipulation of protein activity and cellular behavior without genetic modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572532>Astragaloside IV alleviates the symptoms of experimental ulcerative colitis  and .</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory intestinal disease. Although the morbidity of UC has increased notably in recent years, effective therapeutic treatment remains unsatisfactory. Astragaloside IV (ASI), a monomeric compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine herb , exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of ASI on experimental UC  and . Cell proliferation was detected via a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay . In addition, the concentrations of the inflammatory factors myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO) in the colon tissues were determined by ELISA. Western blot analysis was used to examine phosphorylated transcription factor p65 (p-p65), p-inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), claudin-1 and  protein ZO-1 (ZO-1) protein levels  and , respectively. The results indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in CCD-18Co cells, which was markedly ameliorated by ASI. In addition to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ASI decreased the levels of p-p65 and p-IκB proteins. In addition, ASI decreased the disease activity index scores, and increased colon lengths in dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC mice. ASI also decreased the levels of the pro-inflammatory factors MPO, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NO, and upregulated the expression of claudin-1 and ZO-1 in colon tissues. Therefore, ASI was effective in ameliorating experimental UC  and  via the inhibition of inflammatory molecules, and the downregulation of NF-κB signaling.

This work tried to elucidate whether GLP-1, GLP-2 and EGF can affect the EB of the rumen. Ovine ruminal epithelia were incubated in Ussing chambers for 7 hr with 25 or 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP-2 on the serosal side, with 2.5 nM of EGF on the serosal side or with 0.25 or 2.5 nM EGF on the mucosal side. No treatment affected tissue conductance. Short-circuit current (I ) was affected by time and treatment and their interactions. Only 250 nM of either GLP-1 or GLP-2 decreased I in certain periods compared with 25 nM GLP-1 or 0.25 nM mucosally applied EGF; however, not when compared to control epithelia. Fluorescein flux rates (J ) of ruminal epithelia were affected by treatment, time and time × treatment interaction. The time × treatment interaction was based on an increase in J between the first and last hour in epithelia incubated with 25 nM GLP-1 or GLP-2 and in epithelia incubated with EGF. After 7 hr incubation, claudin-7 mRNA expression was downregulated in all treatments. Claudin-1 mRNA was upregulated after incubation with 2.5 nM EGF on the serosal side, claudin-4 mRNA was downregulated by 2.5 nM EGF on the mucosal side, and occludin mRNA was increased after incubation with 250 nM GLP-2. The protein abundance of all tested TJ proteins was not influenced by treatment. We conclude that GLP-1, GLP-2, and EGF have no obvious acute effects on the EB of ruminal epithelia under simulated physiological conditions ex vivo. However, by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-7 and partly affecting other TJ proteins, they may modulate EB in the longer term or under certain conditions.© 2019 The Authors.

Ameloblasts had not previously been screened for membrane anchored proteases that could contribute to cell movement. Here we performed a PCR screen for proteolyticlly active A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family members. These proteinases are termed sheddases because they have a transmembrane domain and their catalytic domain on the cell surface can function to release anchored proteins. Significantly, ADAMs can be targeted to specific substrates on the cell membrane through their interaction with tetraspanins. Six ADAMs (ADAM8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 19) were expressed in mouse enamel organs. We show that Adam10 expression begins in the apical loop, continues through the secretory stage and abruptly ends at the transition stage when ameloblast migration ceases. ADAM10 cleaves cadherins and  plus desmosome proteins and is well characterized for its role in cell movement. ADAM10 facilitated LS8 cell migration/invasion through a Matrigel coated membrane and we demonstrate that ADAM10, but not ADAM17 cleaves the RELT extracellular domain. This striking result is significant because RELT mutations cause amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) and this directly links ADAM10 to an important role in enamel development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31536749>Retinoic acid signalling adjusts  permeability in response to air-liquid interface conditions.</a></h2><p>The pulmonary epithelium separates the gaseous intraluminal space of the airways and the aqueous interstitium. This compartimentalization is required for appropriate lung function, it is established during perinatal periods and can be disturbed in lung edema. Herein we elaborated the impact of the air-liquid interface (ALI) on the function of the pulmonary epithelium. We used NCI-H441 epithelia as a well-established and characterized model of distal airway epithelia, which were cultivated either at ALI or (at submerged conditions) at liquid-liquid interface conditions (LLI). Our study revealed that paracellular permeability was increased and claudin 1 (CLDN1) expression levels were reduced under LLI conditions. This was accompanied by elevated c-FOS, c-JUN and retinoic acid receptor α (RARA) expression, as well as cellular retinoic acid (RA) content. Exposure of epithelia to RA derivatives of ALI cultivated epithelia mimicked effects of LLI. The increase in RA content was in line with the identified upregulation of retinoic acid anabolizing enzymes ALDH1A3 and DHRS3. CLDN1 promoter analysis revealed c-FOS and c-JUN as activating transcription factors, whereas activation of RARA reduced CLDN1 promoter activity. We then concluded that ALI/LLI dependent modulation of CLDN1 expression and TJ permeability is under the control of RA synthesis. Activation of RARA results in an inhibition of c-FOS/c-JUN dependent CLDN1 promoter activation and increased TJ permeability. Our results underscore RA signalling as a pivotal mechanism in adjusting TJ properties, which could play a role during birth when the lung changes from LLI to ALI conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we examined the effects of gut microbiota on mice with carboplatin-induced intestinal mucosal damage. Carboplatin resulted in intestinal mucositis, as indicated by weight loss, diarrhoea, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. It markedly increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in intestine. Carboplatin also altered the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota. A significantly higher abundance of Prevotella copri (P. copri) was observed in carboplatin-treated mice. Moreover, the content of P. copri was positively correlated with the severity of intestinal mucositis. Pretreatment with metronidazole reduced the content of P. copri and relieved the intestinal mucosal injury and inflammation that was induced by carboplatin. Further study revealed that supplementation with P. copri in carboplatin-treated mice resulted in more severe tissue damage, lower  protein expression and higher cytokine expression, and it enhanced both local and systemic immune responses. These data demonstrated that P. copri was involved in the pathological process of carboplatin-induced intestinal mucositis, suggesting a potential attenuation of carboplatin-induced intestinal mucositis by targeting P. copri.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500238>Claudin 19 Is Regulated by Extracellular Osmolality in Rat Kidney Inner Medullary Collecting Duct Cells.</a></h2><p>The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) is subject to severe changes in ambient osmolality and must either allow water transport or be able to seal the lumen against a very high osmotic pressure.

Presence of claudin-19 in rat IMCD was investigated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Primary cell culture of rat IMCD cells on permeable filter supports was performed under different osmotic culture conditions and after stimulation by antidiuretic hormone (AVP).

The effect of enteric parasites on the gut function of teleost fish, which represent the most ancient bony vertebrates, is far from being understood. The intestinal myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum leei dwells between gut epithelial cells and causes severe enteritis in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), anorexia, cachexia, growth impairment, reduced marketability and increased mortality.This study aimed to outline the gut failure in this fish-parasite model using a multifaceted approach and to find and validate non-lethal serum markers of gut barrier dysfunction. Intestinal integrity was studied in parasitized and non-parasitized fish by immunohistochemistry with specific markers for cellular adhesion (E-cadherin) and  (Tjp1 and Cldn3) and by functional studies of permeability (oral administration of FITC-dextran) and electrophysiology (Ussing chambers). Serum samples from parasitized and non-parasitized fish were analyzed using non-targeted metabolomics and some significantly altered metabolites were selected to be validated using commercial kits.The immunodetection of Tjp1 and Cldn3 was significantly lower in the intestine of parasitized fish, while no strong differences were found in E-cadherin. Parasitized fish showed a significant increase in paracellular uptake measured by FITC-dextran detection in serum. Electrophysiology showed a decrease in transepithelial resistance in infected animals, which showed a diarrheic profile. Serum metabolomics revealed 3702 ions, from which the differential expression of 20 identified compounds significantly separated control from infected groups in multivariate analyses. Of these compounds, serum inosine (decreased) and creatine (increased) were identified as relevant and validated with commercial kits.The results demonstrate the disruption of  and the loss of gut barrier function, a metabolomic profile of absorption dysfunction and anorexia, which further outline the pathophysiological effects of E. leei.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571172>Roles of Drug Transporters in Blood-Retinal Barrier.</a></h2><p>Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) includes inner BRB (iBRB) and outer BRB (oBRB), which are formed by retinal capillary endothelial (RCEC) cells and by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in collaboration with Bruch's membrane and the choriocapillaris, respectively. Functions of the BRB are to regulate fluids and molecular movement between the ocular vascular beds and retinal tissues and to prevent leakage of macromolecules and other potentially harmful agents into the retina, keeping the microenvironment of the retina and retinal neurons. These functions are mainly attributed to absent fenestrations of RCECs, , expression of a great diversity of transporters, and coverage of pericytes and glial cells. BRB existence also becomes a reason that systemic administration for some drugs is not suitable for the treatment of retinal diseases. Some diseases (such as diabetes and ischemia-reperfusion) impair BRB function via altering , RCEC death, and transporter expression. This chapter will illustrate function of BRB, expressions and functions of these transporters, and their clinical significances.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588474>Meat proteins in a high-fat diet have a substantial impact on intestinal barriers through mucus layer and  protein suppression in C57BL/6J mice.</a></h2><p>Protein diets are well known for body maintenance and weight loss. However, it remains unclear whether and how different protein sources affect the intestinal epithelial integrity through , mucus secretions and host immunity in diet-induced obesity. To evaluate possible effects, soybean, chicken and pork proteins either with low fat (12% kcal) or high fat (60% kcal) were administered to C57BL/6J mice for 12 weeks. Muc2 expression,  proteins, goblet cells, and inflammatory cytokines in the colon and serum were measured. The intake of a high-fat pork protein diet decreased the number of goblet cells and inhibited Muc2 expression in the colon, which impaired the mucus barrier. Immunohistochemistry indicated decreased crypt depth and downregulation of  proteins in high-fat diet fed mice, signifying losses of epithelial barriers. In addition, a pork protein diet reduces the key zonula occludens-1 and E-cadherin proteins. A high-fat meat protein diet induces colonic inflammatory injury by upregulating several key cytokines and increasing IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ concentrations in serum. The intake of high-fat meat protein diets resulted in the impairment of the colon barrier through mucus suppression, downregulation of , and gut inflammation in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515596>Protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum against chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in the murine model.</a></h2><p>Long-term alcohol consumption causes liver injuries such as alcoholic hepatitis, fatty liver, and endotoxemia. Some probiotics were demonstrated to exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CMU995 against alcohol-induced liver injury. The mice were orally administered L. plantarum CMU995 for 1 week, followed by the administration of alcohol and different tested substances daily for 6 weeks. The liver injury was examined by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-oxidative enzyme, endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and lipid accumulation in the liver or serum among different groups. L. plantarum CMU995 exhibited beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury via reduction in the serum concentration of AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal  protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were considerably higher in L. plantarum CMU995-fed groups when compared with placebo group. Meanwhile, the protective effects were demonstrated biological gradients as controversial dose-dependent. We speculate that L. plantarum CMU995 inhibited the migration of alcohol-derived endotoxin into the blood and liver, thereby improving the intestinal barrier. The present evidence may provide a novel microbiota-based strategy to prevent the alcohol-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578801>Chronic sleep loss disrupts blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers, and reduces male fertility.</a></h2><p>Sleep loss increases blood-brain barrier permeability. As the blood-brain barrier and the blood-tissue barriers in the reproductive tract (blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers) share common characteristics, we hypothesized that sleep restriction may also modify their barrier function. Previous reports showed that sleep loss decreased sperm viability and progressive fast mobility, which may be a consequence of altered blood-testis and blood-epididymis barrier. Therefore, we quantified changes in blood-testis and blood-epididymis barrier after sleep loss and related them to male fertility. Adult male Wistar rats were sleep restricted using the multiple-platform technique in a protocol of 20 hr daily sleep deprivation plus 4 hr of sleep recovery in the home-cage. At the 10th day, barrier permeability assays were performed with Na-fluorescein, 10 kDa Cascade blue-dextrans and Evans blue, and the expression of  proteins, actin and androgen receptor was quantified. At the 10th day of sleep restriction and after sleep recovery days 1-7, males were placed with sexually receptive females, sexual behaviour was tested, and the percentage of pregnancies was calculated. Sleep restriction increased the barrier permeability to low- and high-molecular-weight tracers, and decreased the expression of  proteins, actin and androgen receptor. Concomitantly, sleep restriction reduced the percentage of ejaculating males and the number of pregnancies. Sleep recovery for 2-3 days progressively re-established fertility, as indicated by a higher percentage of ejaculating males and impregnated females. In conclusion, chronic sleep loss alters fertility concomitantly with the disruption of the blood-tissue barriers at the reproductive tract, the mechanism involves androgen signalling.© 2019 European Sleep Research Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633476>Radial glia-Endothelial cells bidirectional interactions control vascular maturation and astrocyte differentiation: impact for blood brain barrier formation.</a></h2><p>In the developing cerebral cortex, radial glia (RG) multipotent neural stem, among other functions, differentiate into astrocytes and serve as a scaffold for blood vessel development. Later on, blood vessel endothelial cells (ECs) associate with astrocytes to form the neurovascular blood brain barrier (BBB) unit.Since little is known about the mechanisms underlying bidirectional RG-ECs interactions in both vascular development and astrocyte differentiation, this study investigated the impact of interactions between RG and ECs mediated by secreted factors on EC maturation and gliogenesis control.First, we demonstrated that immature vasculature in the murine embryonic cerebral cortex physically interacts with Nestin positive RG neural stem cells in vivo. Isolated microcapillary brain endothelial cells (MBEC) treated with the conditioned medium from RG cultures (RG-CM) displayed decreased proliferation, reduction in the protein levels of the endothelial tip cell marker Delta-like 4 (Dll4), and decreased expression levels of the vascular permeability associated gene, plasmalemma vesicle associated protein-1 (PLVAP1). These events were also accompanied by increased levels of the  protein expression, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1).Finally, we demonstrated that isolated RG cells cultures treated with MBEC conditioned medium promoted astrocyte differentiation into astrocytes in a vascular endothelial growth factor - A (VEGF-A) dependent manner.These results suggest that the bidirectional interaction between RG and ECs is essential to induce vascular maturation and astrocyte generation, which may be an essential cell-cell communication mechanism to promote BBB establishment.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569528>Syncytiotrophoblast of Placentae from Women with Zika Virus Infection Has Altered  Protein Expression and Increased Paracellular Permeability.</a></h2><p>The cytotrophoblast of human placenta transitions into an outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer that covers chorionic villi which are in contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space. During pregnancy, the Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious prenatal threat. STB cells are resistant to ZIKV infections, yet placental cells within the mesenchyme of chorionic villi are targets of ZIKV infection. We seek to determine whether ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells. This route is regulated by  (TJs) which are present in the uppermost portion of the lateral membranes of STB cells. We analyzed the paracellular permeability and expression of E-cadherin, occludin, JAMs -B and -C, claudins -1, -3, -4, -5 and -7, and ZO-1, and ZO-2 in the STB of placentae from ZIKV-infected and non-infected women. In ZIKV-infected placentae, the pattern of expression of TJ proteins was preserved, but the amount of claudin-4 diminished. Placentae from ZIKV-infected women were permeable to ruthenium red, and had chorionic villi with a higher mean diameter and Hofbauer hyperplasia. Finally, ZIKV added to the basolateral surface of a trophoblast cell line reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance. These results suggest that ZIKV can open the paracellular pathway of STB cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557363>Fumonisin B damages the barrier functions of porcine intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>Fumonisins (Fums) are mycotoxins widely distributed in crops and feed, and ingestion of Fums-contaminated crops is harmful to animal health. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Fum B (FB ) on barrier functions of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, IPEC-J2, to clarify the intestinal toxicity of Fums in pigs. The results showed that the persistent treatment of FB significantly decreased the viability of IPEC-J2. Moreover, the expressions of Claudin 1, Occludin, Zonula Occluden-1 (ZO-1) on the messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein levels and MUC1 on the mRNA level were significantly inhibited after FB treatment, while the mRNA relative expression level of MUC2 was clearly increased. FB also enhanced the monolayer cell permeability of IPEC-J2. Importantly, FB promoted the expression of phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (p-ERK ). These data suggest that long-term treatment of FB can suppress IPEC-J2 proliferation, damage  of IPEC-J2, and regulate expression of mucins to induce the damage of barrier functions of porcine intestinal epithelial cells, which may be associated with the ERK phosphorylation pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571171>Contributions of Drug Transporters to Blood-Brain Barriers.</a></h2><p>Blood-brain interfaces comprise the cerebral microvessel endothelium forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the epithelium of the choroid plexuses forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB).

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the  protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514177>Topological and transport properties of graphene-based nanojunctions subjected to a magnetic field.</a></h2><p>We study the topological properties of finite-size S-shaped graphene  with distinctive edge features subjected to the perpendicular magnetic field, using the -binding model.

Activation of myenteric neurons has been implicated in the inhibitory effects of GLP-1 on gastrointestinal motility; however, the mechanisms of action underlying this are not clear.A rat model of IBS was used to examine physiological changes evoked by intraperitoneal administration of a GLP-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4. Behavioral and physiological analysis of stress-sensitive Wister Kyoto (WKY) rats was used to determine if administration of exendin-4, in the presence or absence of neutralizing interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies, modified IBS-like symptoms. Immunofluorescence, calcium imaging, and Western blotting techniques were used to investigate the potential role of enteric neural plexi and  protein expression in this effect.Consistent with the expression of GLP-1 and interleukin-6 receptors in both submucosal and myenteric ganglia, exendin-4 and interleukin-6 stimulated calcium responses in these neurons. In vivo administration of exendin-4 normalized stress-induced defecation and visceral pain sensitivity in WKY rats. No additional changes were noted in rats co-treated with exendin-4 and anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibodies. Mucosal expression of occludin, a  protein, was decreased by exendin-4. Centrally regulated anxiety-like behaviors were not modified.These data suggest that intraperitoneal injection of exendin-4 improves bowel dysfunction in WKY rats without impacting on centrally regulated anxiety-like behaviors.

This study investigated the influence of propolis on the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa in rats with diabetes.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to the control group, model group, and three propolis groups (supplemented with 80, 160, and 240 mg/kg·bw propolis, respectively). A high-fat diet combined with a streptozotocin (STZ) abdominal injection were used to induce diabetes in the rats. After 4 weeks, the intestinal histopathological analysis of the ileum was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, glucose tolerance (OGTT) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured. The expression of  (TJ) proteins in the ileum was measured using western blotting. The molecular ecology of the fecal gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The contents of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).After propolis treatment, compared to the model group, FBG and HbA1c levels declined, while the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased. The levels of TJ proteins in the ileum increased in the propolis groups. The  and gap  of the intestinal epithelium were also improved in the propolis groups. The contents of the feces acetic acid, propionic acid and butyrate were increased in the propolis groups. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota of rats in the propolis supplement group was significantly improved.Compared to the model group, propolis exerted hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats, and it repaired intestinal mucosal damage, benefited the communities of the gut microbiota and increased SCFA levels in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method was applicated to establish the model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. BBB permeability after I/R injury was assessed with the leaking amount of Evans Blue and the expression of occludin and ZO-1. The expression of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing (NLRP3) was checked to explore the inhibition of inflammation by XNJ. The results showed that XNJ could significantly increase the survival percent, decrease the infarct area and ameliorate neurological deficits and brain damage after I/R injury. Leaking amount of Evans Blue was reduced by XNJ, and the expression of  protein, occludin and ZO-1 was also up-regulated by XNJ, which showed a role of protection on BBB disruption. The expression of NLRP3 was inhibited after exposure of XNJ, which was associated with inhibition of the inflammatory response. In summary, XNJ could suppress NLRP3 inflammasomes and improve BBB disruption and brain damage in rats after cerebral I/R injury, which provided a beneficial insight to further explore XNJ.Copyright © 2019 China Pharmaceutical University.

Chronic restraint stress (CRS) has been found to exacerbate neurological impairments in an experimental focal cortical ischemia model. However, there have been no studies reporting the effect and mechanism of CRS on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of CRS on a mouse ICH model. Adult male C57BL mice were subjected to infusion of collagenase IV (to induce ICH) or saline (for sham) into the left striatum. After ICH, animals were stressed with application of CRS protocol for 21 days. Our results showed that CRS significantly exacerbated neurological deficits (Garcia test, corner turn test, and wire grip test) and the ipsilateral brain atrophy and reduced body weight gain after ICH. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that CRS exerted significant suppressive effects on neuron, astrocyte, vascular endothelial cell and pericyte and excessively activated microglia post ICH. All of the key cellular components mentioned above are involved in the neurovascular unit (NVU) remodeling in the peri-hemorrhagic region after ICH. Western blot results showed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and  (TJ) proteins including zonula occludens-1, occludin and claudin-5 were increased after ICH, but MMP-9 protein was further up-regulated and TJ-related proteins were down-regulated by CRS. In addition, ICH-induced activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis were further strengthened by CRS. Collectively, CRS exacerbates neurological deficits and disrupts the remodeling of the peri-hemorrhagic NVU after ICH, which may be associated with TJ proteins degradation and excessive activation of MMP-9 and endoplasmic reticulum stress-apoptosis. LAY SUMMARY CRS exacerbates neurological deficits and disrupts the remodeling of the NVU in the recovery stage after ICH, which suggest that monitoring chronic stress levels in patients recovering from ICH may merit consideration in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578523>The RIPK4-IRF6 signalling axis safeguards epidermal differentiation and barrier function.</a></h2><p>The integrity of the mammalian epidermis depends on a balance of proliferation and differentiation in the resident population of stem cells. The kinase RIPK4 and the transcription factor IRF6 are mutated in severe developmental syndromes in humans, and mice lacking these genes display epidermal hyperproliferation and soft-tissue fusions that result in neonatal lethality. Our understanding of how these genes control epidermal differentiation is incomplete. Here we show that the role of RIPK4 in mouse development requires its kinase activity; that RIPK4 and IRF6 expressed in the epidermis regulate the same biological processes; and that the phosphorylation of IRF6 at Ser413 and Ser424 primes IRF6 for activation. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), histone chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of skin in wild-type and IRF6-deficient mouse embryos, we define the transcriptional programs that are regulated by IRF6 during epidermal differentiation. IRF6 was enriched at bivalent promoters, and IRF6 deficiency caused defective expression of genes that are involved in the metabolism of lipids and the formation of . Accordingly, the lipid composition of the stratum corneum of Irf6 skin was abnormal, culminating in a severe defect in the function of the epidermal barrier.

Cldn4 expression was ~75-fold higher in adult islets than in exocrine tissues and was mostly up-regulated during functional maturation of developing islet cells. Cldn4 was progressively down-regulated in functionally compromised, dedifferentiating insulin-secreting β cells and in db/db type-2 diabetic islets. Furthermore, the genetic deletion of Cldn4 impaired significantly the functional state without apparently affecting pancreas morphology, islet architectural structure and cellular distribution, and secretion of enteroendocrine hormones. Thus, we suggest a previously unidentified role for Cldn4 in regulating the functional state of islets, with implications in translational research for better diabetes therapies.© 2019 The Authors.

Fish were exposed to zinc (0, 1 mg/L) and arsenic trioxide (0, 2.83 mg/L) in individual or combination for a month. Inflammatory infiltration and TJ structure changes were displayed by H&E staining and transmission electron microscope. To further explore these changes, biochemical indicator (SOD), gene or protein expressions of inflammatory responses (NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8) and TJ proteins (Occludin, Claudins and ZOs) were determined. In the anterior intestine, arsenic decreased activity of SOD, mRNA levels of Occludin, Claudins and ZOs, increased mRNA levels of ILs. However, unlike the anterior intestine, arsenic has an upregulation effects of Occludin and Claudin-4 in the mid intestine. These anomalies induced by arsenic, except IL-8, were completely or partially recovered by zinc co-administration. Furthermore, transcription factor (NF-κB) nuclear translocation paralleled with its downstream genes in both intestinal regions. In conclusion, our results unambiguously suggested that under arsenic stress, zinc can partly relieve intestinal inflammation and disruption of  segment-dependently.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to alleviate porcine jejunal epithelia cell (IPEC-J2) injury induced by DON in this study. The results indicated that cell viability and proliferation rates were significantly decreased when DON concentrations were increased from 0 to 64 µM after 24 h incubation (p < 0.05). The longer incubation time and higher DON concentrations would cause more serious effects on cell viability. S. cerevisiae could significantly degrade DON and decrease lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the cells induced by DON (p < 0.05). DON (4 µM) could increase necrotic and apoptotic cell rates as well as decrease viable cell rates, compared with the control group (p < 0.05). However, S. cerevisiae addition in the DON group could decrease necrotic, late apoptotic and early apoptotic cell rates by 38.05%, 46.37% and 44.78% respectively, increase viable cell rates by 2.35%, compared with the single DON group (p < 0.05). In addition, S. cerevisiae addition could up-regulate mRNA abundances of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in IPEC-J2 cells (p < 0.05), but down-regulate mRNA abundances of  proteins (TJP-1) and occludin by 36.13% and 50.18% at 1 µM of DON (p < 0.05). It could be concluded that S. cerevisiae was able to alleviate IPEC-J2 cell damage exposed to DON.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566332>Ménétrier's disease : a case of successful treatment using long-acting octreotide.</a></h2><p>The authors describe a 31 years old male, admitted for hematemesis, epigastric pain and lower limb edema. Laboratorial data showed haemoglobin 18.4g/dl, total proteins 2.8g/dl, albumin 1.6g/dl and hipogammaglobulinaemia. 24h urinary proteins were normal. HIV and CMV serology were negative. Upper GI endoscopy revealed markedly enlarged gastric folds covered by abundant exudative fluid. Endoscopic ultrasound showed ascites, pleural effusion and gastric wall thickening with mucosa expansion and intact submucosa. In gastric biopsies foveolar hyperplastic and regenerative mucosa were observed being suggestive of Ménétrier´s disease. Helicobacter pylori was not detected. Albumin replacement and diuretics corrected anasarca and long-acting octreotide was instituted. Nine months later, the patient was asymptomatic, serum proteins were normal (albumin 4.6g/dl and total proteins 6.5g/dl), signs of endoscopic improvement were observed with marked reduction in gastric folds and mucosal inflammation and no ultrastructural changes were detected in gastric specimens sent for electron microscopy. Ménétrier´s Disease (MD) is a rare form of hypertrophic gastropathy characterized by massive enlargement of gastric folds causing marked protein exudation. The increase in  diameter is the most consistent ultraestrutural change. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that acts by modulating TGFαEGFR pathway, which has been associated with the pathogenic mechanisms. As well as other cases reported in literature, this case report highlights the potential of long-acting octreotide for MD treatment avoiding more expensive therapies like cetuximab and gastrectomy.© Acta Gastro-Enterologica Belgica.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654502>Circular RNA USP1 regulates the permeability of blood-tumour barrier via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate circular RNAs are related to dysregulation of vascular endothelial cell function, yet the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we characterized the functional role of circular RNA USP1 (circ-USP1) in the regulation of the blood-tumour barrier (BTB) permeability and the potential mechanisms. In the current study, the circ-USP1 expressing level was up-regulated in glioma cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (GECs) of the BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of circ-USP1 disrupted the barrier integrity, increased its permeability as well as reduced -related protein claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 expressions in GECs. Bioinformatic prediction and luciferase assay indicated that circ-USP1 bound to miR-194-5p and suppressed its activity. MiR-194-5p contributed to circ-USP1 knockdown-induced increase of BTB permeability via targeting and down-regulating transcription factor FLI1. Furthermore, FLI1 regulated the expressions of claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 in GECs through binding to their promoter regions. Single or combined treatment of circ-USP1 and miR-194-5p effectively promoted anti-tumour drug doxorubicin across BTB to induce apoptosis of glioma cells. Overall, this present study identified the crucial regulation of circ-USP1 on BTB permeability via miR-194-5p/FLI1 axis-mediated regulation of  proteins, which might facilitate the development of therapeutics against human gliomas.© 2019 The Authors.

One-week-old germ-free piglets were orally colonized/infected with the  Typhimurium LT2 strain or its isogenic rough Δ, Δ or Δ mutants with exactly defined lipopolysaccharide (LPS) defects. After 24 h, the piglets were euthanized and the colonization of the small intestine, translocations into the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lungs, and bacteremia, along with changes in the ileum histology, and transcription levels of the  proteins claudin-1, claudin-2, and occludin were all assessed. Additionally, transcription levels of IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-10 in the terminal ileum, and their local and systemic protein levels were evaluated. Wild-type  Typhimurium showed the highest translocation, histopathological changes, upregulation of claudins and downregulation of occludin, transcription of the cytokines, intestinal IL-8 and TNF-α levels, and systemic TNF-α and IL-10 levels. Depending on the extent of the incompleteness of the LPS, the levels of the respective elements decreased, or no changes were observed at all in the piglets colonized/infected with Δ mutants. Intestinal IL-10 and systemic IL-8 levels were not detected in any piglet groups.

We explore the mechanism responsible for changes in the morphology and function of the intestinal barrier using a rat model of food allergy, focusing on the contribution of intestinal microbiota. Juvenile-young adult rats were sensitized with ovalbumin and treated with antibiotics or probiotics (  and  ), respectively. The serum ovalbumin-IgE levels, intestinal permeability, histopathological features,  (TJ)-associated proteins, Th2 cytokines, and gut microbiota in feces were analyzed in each group. Sensitized rats showed an increase in ovalbumin-IgE levels and intestinal permeability with gut mucosal inflammation, whereas rats that received probiotics were only mildly affected. Rats given ovalbumin, but not those given probiotics, showed a reduction in both TJ-related protein expression and localization. Th2 cytokine levels were increased in the sensitized rats, but not in those given probiotics. TJs in rats treated with ovalbumin and antibiotics were disrupted, but those in rats administered probiotics were undamaged. Clostridiaceae were increased in the probiotics groups, especially , relative to the ovalbumin-sensitized group. Gut microbiota appears to play a role in regulating epithelial barrier function, and probiotics may help to prevent food sensitization through the up-regulation of TJ proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635305>AMPK Activation Promotes  Assembly in Intestinal Epithelial Caco-2 Cells.</a></h2><p>The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is principally known as a major regulator of cellular energy status, but it has been recently shown to play a key structural role in cell-cell . The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of AMPK activation on the reassembly of  in intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. We generated Caco-2 cells invalidated for AMPK α1/α2 (AMPK dKO) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated the effect of the direct AMPK activator 991 on the reassembly of  following a calcium switch assay. We analyzed the integrity of the epithelial barrier by measuring the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the paracellular permeability, and quantification of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) deposit at plasma membrane by immunofluorescence. Here, we demonstrated that AMPK deletion induced a delay in  reassembly and relocalization at the plasma membrane during calcium switch, leading to impairments in the establishment of TEER and paracellular permeability. We also showed that 991-induced AMPK activation accelerated the reassembly and reorganization of , improved the development of TEER and paracellular permeability after calcium switch. Thus, our results show that AMPK activation ensures a better recovery of epithelial barrier function following injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569415>Curcumin Mitigates Immune-Induced Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction by .</a></h2><p> () is the most common cause of foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide. The bacteria induce diarrhea and inflammation by invading the intestinal epithelium. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol from turmeric rhizome of , a medical plant, and is commonly used in curry powder. The aim of this study was the investigation of the protective effects of curcumin against immune-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction in  infection. The indirect -induced barrier defects and its protection by curcumin were analyzed in co-cultures with HT-29/B6-GR/MR epithelial cells together with differentiated THP-1 immune cells. Electrophysiological measurements revealed a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in infected co-cultures. An increase in fluorescein (332 Da) permeability in co-cultures as well as in the germ-free IL-10 mouse model after  infection was shown. Curcumin treatment attenuated the -induced increase in fluorescein permeability in both models. Moreover, apoptosis induction,  redistribution, and an increased inflammatory response-represented by TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 secretion-was observed in co-cultures after infection and reversed by curcumin. In conclusion, curcumin protects against indirect -triggered immune-induced barrier defects and might be a therapeutic and protective agent in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542690>Graphene quantum dots modified flower like BiWO for enhanced photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</a></h2><p>Graphene quantum dots modified BiWO (GQD/BiWO) composites is applied to photocatalytic N fixation.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is expressed in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuronal survival. This study aimed to investigate the role of bFGF in vitro in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) challenged by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). MATERIAL AND METHODS HBMECs were cultured in glucose-free medium and an environment with <0.5% oxygen in an anaerobic chamber. Immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to measure the protein and mRNA expression levels of bFGF, , adherens , apoptotic proteins, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The effects of bFGF on the viability of HBMECs was evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using the TUNEL assay, and endothelial permeability was quantified using a transwell migration assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with dextran. The effects of bFGF were evaluated following inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) with PD173074 and inhibition of ERK with PD98059. RESULTS Following OGD/R of HBMECs, bFGF significantly reduced cell permeability and apoptosis and significantly inhibited the down-regulation of the expressions of proteins associated with , adherens , apoptosis and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The effects of bFGF were mediated by the activation of FGFR1 and ERK, as they were blocked by FGFR1 and ERK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS Permeability and apoptosis of HBMECs challenged by OGD/R were reduced by bFGF by activation of the FGFR1 and the ERK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511021>Claudin-12 is not required for blood-brain barrier  function.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) ensures central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by strictly controlling the passage of molecules and solutes from the bloodstream into the CNS. Complex and continuous  (TJs) between brain endothelial cells block uncontrolled paracellular diffusion of molecules across the BBB, with claudin-5 being its dominant TJs protein. However, claudin-5 deficient mice still display ultrastructurally normal TJs, suggesting the contribution of other claudins or  associated proteins in establishing BBB junctional complexes. Expression of claudin-12 at the BBB has been reported, however the exact function and subcellular localization of this atypical claudin remains unknown.We created claudin-12-lacZ-knock-in C57BL/6J mice to explore expression of claudin-12 and its role in establishing BBB TJs function during health and neuroinflammation. We furthermore performed a broad standardized phenotypic check-up of the mouse mutant.Making use of the lacZ reporter allele, we found claudin-12 to be broadly expressed in numerous organs. In the CNS, expression of claudin-12 was detected in many cell types with very low expression in brain endothelium. Claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice lacking claudin-12 expression displayed an intact BBB and did not show any signs of BBB dysfunction or aggravated neuroinflammation in an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Determining the precise localization of claudin-12 at the BBB was prohibited by the fact that available anti-claudin-12 antibodies showed comparable detection and staining patterns in tissues from wild-type and claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice.Our present study thus shows that claudin-12 is not essential in establishing or maintaining BBB TJs integrity. Claudin-12 is rather expressed in cells that typically lack TJs suggesting that claudin-12 plays a role other than forming classical TJs. At the same time, in depth phenotypic screening of clinically relevant organ functions of claudin-12 C57BL/6J mice suggested the involvement of claudin-12 in some neurological but, more prominently, in cardiovascular functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569788>Anti-Inflammatory Mechanisms of Koreanaside A, a Lignan Isolated from the Flower of , against LPS-Induced Macrophage Activation and DSS-Induced Colitis Mice: The Crucial Role of AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT Signaling.</a></h2><p>The current treatment options for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti-inflammatory effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent inflammatory gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing inflammatory cell infiltration, restoring  (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced inflammatory responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586017>Decreased ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio attenuates ethanol-induced alterations in intestinal homeostasis, microbiota and liver injury.</a></h2><p>Ethanol-induced alterations in intestinal homeostasis lead to multi-system pathologies, including liver injury.  w6-PUFAs exert pro-inflammatory activity, while ω3-PUFAs promote anti-inflammatory activity that is mediated, in part, through specialized pro-resolving mediators (e.g. RvD1).  We tested the hypothesis that a decrease in ω6/ω3 PUFA ratio would attenuate ethanol-mediated alterations in the gut-liver axis.  fat-1 mice, which endogenously increase w3-PUFA levels, were protected against ethanol-mediated down-regulation of intestinal  proteins in organoid cultures and in vivo.  Ethanol and LPS-induced expression of INF-g, Il-6, and Cxcl1 was attenuated in fat-1 and WT RvD1-treated mice. RNA-seq of ileum tissue revealed up-regulation of several genes involved in cell proliferation and stem cell renewal, and anti-microbial defense (including Alpi and Leap2) in fat-1 vs WT mice fed ethanol.  fat-1 mice were also resistant to ethanol-mediated down-regulation of genes important for xenobiotic/bile acid detoxification.  Further, gut microbiome and plasma metabolomics revealed several changes in fat-1 vs. WT mice that may contribute to a reduced inflammatory response.  Finally, these data correlated with a significant reduction in liver injury.  Our study suggests that w3-PUFA enrichment or treatment with resolvins can attenuate the disruption in alcohol-induced intestinal homeostasis caused by ethanol consumption and systemic inflammation with a concomitant reduction in liver injury.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591580>Engineering of human brain organoids with a functional vascular-like system.</a></h2><p>Human cortical organoids (hCOs), derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provide a platform to study human brain development and diseases in complex three-dimensional tissue. However, current hCOs lack microvasculature, resulting in limited oxygen and nutrient delivery to the inner-most parts of hCOs. We engineered hESCs to ectopically express human ETS variant 2 (ETV2). ETV2-expressing cells in hCOs contributed to forming a complex vascular-like network in hCOs. Importantly, the presence of vasculature-like structures resulted in enhanced functional maturation of organoids. We found that vascularized hCOs (vhCOs) acquired several blood-brain barrier characteristics, including an increase in the expression of , nutrient transporters and trans-endothelial electrical resistance. Finally, ETV2-induced endothelium supported the formation of perfused blood vessels in vivo. These vhCOs form vasculature-like structures that resemble the vasculature in early prenatal brain, and they present a robust model to study brain disease in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616319>Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress in Rats Induces Colonic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Chronic psychological stress is associated with an increased risk for relapse of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and impedes the treatment of this condition. However, the impact of stress on the risk of IBD onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal barrier. This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal barrier integrity was associated with a reduction in expression of the  protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal barrier defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wei, Li, Tang, Sun, Chen, Wang, Liu, Yu, Yu, Liu and Ma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632292>YangXue QingNao Wan, a Compound Chinese Medicine, Attenuates Cerebrovascular Hyperpermeability and Neuron Injury in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat: Effect and Mechanism.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to explore the effect of YangXue QingNao Wan (YXQNW), a compound Chinese medicine, on cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, neuronal injury, and related mechanisms in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR).Fourteen-week-old male SHR were used, with Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as control. YXQNW (0.5 g/kg/day), enalapril (EN, 8 mg/kg/day), and nifedipine (NF, 7.1 mg/kg/day) were administrated orally for 4 weeks. To assess the effects of the YXQNW on blood pressure, the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP) were measured. After administering the drugs for 4 weeks, the cerebral blood flow (CBF), albumin leakage from microvessels in middle cerebral artery (MCA)-dominated area, and the number and morphology of microvessels were assessed in the hippocampus area and cortex. Neuronal damage and apoptosis were assessed by Nissl staining and TUNEL staining. To assess the mechanisms of cerebrovascular hyperpermeability, we performed immunofluorescence and Western blot to assess the expression and integrity of cerebral microvascular  (TJ) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in cortex. Energy metabolism and Src-MLC-MLCK pathway in cortex were assessed then for elucidating the underlying mechanism of the observed effect of YXQNW.Spontaneously hypertensive rat exhibited higher blood pressure, Evans blue (EB) extravasation, albumin leakage, increased brain water content, decreased CBF, perivascular edema, and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex, all of which were attenuated by YXQNW treatment. YXQNW inhibited the downregulation of TJ proteins, mitochondrial Complex I, Complex II, and Complex V, and upregulation of caveolin-1, inhibiting Src/MLCK/MLC signaling in SHR. YXQNW combined with EN + NF revealed a better effect for some outcomes compared with either YXQNW or EN + NF alone.The overall result shows the potential of YXQNW to attenuate blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in SHR, which involves regulation of energy metabolism and Src/MLCK/MLC signaling. This result provides evidence supporting the application of YXQNW as an adjuvant management for hypertensive patients to prevent hypertensive encephalopathy.Copyright © 2019 Jiao, Huang, Yan, Sun, Pan, Li, Fan, Ma and Han.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576468>DPP4 inhibitor reinforces cell  proteins in mouse model of short bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Bacterial overgrowth commonly occurs and favors bacterial translocation in short bowel syndrome (SBS). Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is effective for treating SBS, but is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4). DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4I) is known to be effective for treating SBS. Here, we investigated cell  protein function following DPP4I administration in a mouse model of SBS.Mice were divided into four groups: naïve (n = 5), naïve + DPP4I (n = 6), control (n = 6), and DPP4I (n = 5). All control and DPP4I mice had 50% of their proximal small bowel resected. DPP4I or normal saline was administered orally twice daily from days 1-7 postoperatively. The functions of cell  proteins were assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Body weights and blood glucose levels were recorded.E-Cadherin was significantly higher in the DPP4I group than in the control group. E-Cadherin, occludin, and claudin-4 were significantly higher in the naïve group than in the control group. Positive staining for E-cadherin and occludin varied widely between the control and DPP4I groups.Up-regulation of E-cadherin and occludin by DPP4I may be correlated with the anti-inflammatory action of DPP4I.

We aim to investigate the effects of vitamin D on intestinal injury in intestinal epithelial cells and organoids.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce injury in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-18) and organoids, and the effect of vitamin D was assessed. Cell viability was measured and inflammation cytokines TNFα and IL-8 were quantified. FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD4) permeability was measured using Transwell while  markers were assessed by immunofluorescence staining in IEC-18 and intestinal organoids. Data were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.IEC-18 viability was decreased by LPS treatment, but was prevented by vitamin D. The upregulation of inflammation was inhibited by vitamin D, which also decreased epithelium permeability. Vitamin D restored  ZO-1 and claudin 2. In addition, vitamin D decreased TNFα expression and prevented the disruption of ZO-1 in injured organoids.Vitamin D rescued epithelial barrier function by improving permeability and restoring , leading to decrease inflammation.

This study aims to investigate the protective effects of irisin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALIin vivo and in vitro, and to explore its underlying mechanism.Male SD rats and A549 cells were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPS group, Irisin pretreated group, and Irisin/Compound C(a special inhibitor of AMPK)-treated group. The ALI model was established by intravenous injection of LPS in rats, and LPS challenge in A549 cells. Pulmonary specimens were harvested for microscopic examination of the pathological changes, and the expression of AMPK,SIRT1,NF-κB, p66Shc and caspase-3 in lung tissues. The pulmonary permeability were examined by wet/dry lung weight ratio(W/D) and lung permeability index(LPI). The apoptotic index, and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), monocyte chemoattractant activating protein-1 (MCP-1),  (occludin,ZO-1) were determined both in lung tissue and A549 cells.Irisin alleviated lung histological changes and decreased pulmonary microvascular permeability in LPS-induced rats. Irisin up-regulated the expression of occludin, ZO-1,AMPK,SIRT1, down-regulated the expression of TNF-α,IL-1β,MCP-1,NF-κB, p66Shc caspase-3, and decreased the apoptotic index in LPS-induced rats and A549 cells. All these protective effects of irisin could be reversed by Compound C.Irisin improved LPS-induced alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction via suppressing inflammation and apoptosis, and this protective effect might be mediated by activating AMPK/SIRT1 pathways.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of irritant laxatives causes serious side effects. Meanwhile, more than 50% of patients are dissatisfied with sense of use of non-prescriptional laxatives. -glucans are natural polysaccharides widely found in yeast, fungus, and plants, which have been reported to exhibit various pharmacological effects.

Forty mice were fed with loperamide (10 mg/kg) to make the constipation model and a diet supplemented with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg -glucan.

Meanwhile, we detected expression of neurotransmitters including acetylcholinesterase, substance P, and serotonin (5-HT) and expression of  protein (TJP) including zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 in distal colon to characterize the possible molecular mechanisms. -glucans significantly enhanced intestinal motility and provided a possibility to regulate the expression of neurotransmitters and TJP in mice. The intestinal microecological portion of the treatment group partially recovered and was closer to the normal group. This study showed that -glucans can influence the intestinal microbiota and restore microecological balance to regulate the express of neurotransmitters and TJP to recover intestinal epithelial mechanical barrier. We suggested that -glucans could be used as an active nutritional supplement to protect the damaged intestinal barrier and help patients who have constipation complications and dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533081>Dietary Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts supplementation improved immunity and intestinal morphology, antioxidant ability and  proteins mRNA expression of hybrid groupers (Epinephelus lanceolatus ♂ × Epinephelus fuscoguttatus ♀) fed high lipid diets.</a></h2><p>For many years, Ginkgo biloba has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (GBLE) supplementation on immune response, intestinal morphology, antioxidant ability and  proteins mRNA expression of hybrid groupers fed high lipid diets. Basal diets supplemented with GBLE at 0, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 4.00 and 10.00 g/kg were fed to hybrid grouper for 8 weeks. The study showed that dietary GBLE supplementation significantly improved immune ability by increasing plasma complement 3, complement 4 and Immunoglobulin M content. Dietary supplementation of 0.50-2.00 g/kg GBLE improved intestinal morphology and increased the expression of zonula occludens 1, zonula occludens 2, zonula occludens 3, occludin and claudin 3a. Dietary supplementation of 0.50-2.00 g/kg GBLE improved antioxidant ability by increasing activities and expressions of glutathione peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase, suppressed inflammatory by increasing expression of interleukin 10, transforming growth factor β1 and target of rapamycin, and decreased apoptotic responses by reducing the expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 in the intestine of hybrid grouper fed high lipid diets. This study indicated that dietary GBLE supplementation was clearly beneficial for intestinal health and immunity in hybrid groupers fed high lipid diets and it could be used as a functional feed additive in aquaculture to promote the application of high lipid diets.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we report a de novo mutation in TNFAIP3 in a Chinese patient with neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE).Whole exome sequencing was performed for the patient and healthy members from the family. Suspected pathogenic variants were further analyzed and co-segregation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Real-time PCR and western blot were performed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and patient-derived T cells.

In contrast to the well-characterized role of TJs in maintaining cerebrovascular integrity, the specific function of endothelial podosomes remains unknown. Intriguingly, we discovered cross-talk between podosomes and TJs in human brain endothelial cells.  scaffold proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 localize at podosomes in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. We found that both ZO proteins are essential for podosome formation and function. Rather than being derived from new protein synthesis, podosomal ZO-1 and ZO-2 are relocated from a pre-existing pool found at the peripheral plasma membrane with enhanced physical interaction with cortactin, a known protein marker for podosomes. Sequestration of ZO proteins in podosomes weakens  complex formation, leading to increased endothelial cell permeability. This effect can be further attenuated by podosome inhibitor PP2. Altogether, our data revealed a novel cellular function of podosomes, specifically, their ability to negatively regulate  and endothelial barrier integrity, which have been linked to a variety of cerebrovascular diseases.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657756>Effects of resveratrol on intestinal oxidative status and inflammation in heat-stressed rats.</a></h2><p>Heat stress, experienced by humans and animals under high ambient temperatures, is known to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, which endangers human health as well as animal welfare and production. The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress and compromised intestinal functions can contribute to multi-organ injury under heat environment. Resveratrol (RSV) has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of RSV on intestinal function (digestion and barrier), oxidative stress and inflammation in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg RSV/kg body weight/day prior to daily heat stress (40 °C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejunal morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and  proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate intestinal injury and dysfunctions by improving oxidative status and suppressing inflammation in heat-stressed rats.Copyright © 2019.

Vascularization is one of the major challenges for recapitulating processes in the developing human brain. Here, we examined the formation of blood vessel-like structures in cerebral organoids induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro. The results indicated that VEGF enhanced differentiation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) without reducing neuronal markers in the embryonic bodies (EBs), which then successfully developed into cerebral organoids with open-circle vascular structures expressing an EC marker, CD31, and a  marker, claudin-5, characteristic of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Further treatment with VEGF and Wnt7a promoted the formation of the outer lining consisting of pericyte-like cells, which surrounded the vascular tubes. RNA sequencing revealed that VEGF upregulated genes associated with tube formation, vasculogenesis, and the BBB; it also changed the expression of genes involved in brain embryogenesis, suggesting a role of VEGF in neuronal development.

Although succinate is known to regulate intestinal metabolism and immune function, its role in the protection of the intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of succinate on intestinal epithelial barrier function and inflammation in pigs. Twenty-four growing pigs were distributed into three groups ( = 8) and received either a basal diet (control group) or the same diet supplemented with 0.1% succinate or 1% succinate. The diet supplemented with 1% succinate led to alterations in the intestinal morphology. We confirmed in vitro that 5 mM succinate treatment modulated intestinal epithelial permeability by increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in intestinal porcine epithelial cell (IPEC)-J2 cells. Furthermore, succinate treatment increased the abundance of  proteins claudin-1, zona occluden (ZO)-1, and ZO-2 in the jejunum in vivo and in vitro. In addition, dietary succinate supplementation promoted the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-25, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-18 in the jejunum. Taken together, these data identify a novel role of succinate in the modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier function, which may be a nutritional target to improve gut health in animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540133>Alcohol or Gut Microbiota: Who Is the Guilty?</a></h2><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a disorder caused by excessive alcohol intake represents a global health care burden. ALD encompasses a broad spectrum of hepatic injuries including asymptomatic steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The susceptibility of alcoholic patients to develop ALD is highly variable and its progression to more advanced stages is strongly influenced by several hits (i.e., amount and duration of alcohol abuse). Among them, the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites have been recently identified as paramount in ALD pathophysiology. Ethanol abuse triggers qualitative and quantitative modifications in intestinal flora taxonomic composition, mucosal inflammation, and intestinal barrier derangement. Intestinal hypermeability results in the translocation of viable pathogenic bacteria, Gram-negative microbial products, and pro-inflammatory luminal metabolites into the bloodstream, further corroborating the alcohol-induced liver damage. Thus, the premise of this review is to discuss the beneficial effect of gut microbiota modulation as a novel therapeutic approach in ALD management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669294>Acanthamoeba mauritaniensis genotype T4D: An environmental isolate displays pathogenic behavior.</a></h2><p>Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living amoebae with a worldwide distribution. These amoebae can cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and amoebic keratitis in humans. Proteases are considered virulence factors in pathogenic Acanthamoeba. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of Acanthamoeba mauritaniensis, a nonpathogenic amoeba. We analyzed the cytopathic effect of A. mauritaniensis on RCE1(5 T5) and MDCK cells and compared it to that of Acanthamoeba castellanii. A partial biochemical characterization of proteases was performed in total crude extracts (TCE) and conditioned medium (CM). Finally, we evaluated the effect of proteases on  (TJ) proteins and the transepithelial electrical resistance of MDCK cells. The results showed that this amoeba can induce substantial damage to RCE1(5T5) and MDCK cells. Moreover, the zymograms and Azocoll assays of amoebic TCE and CM revealed different protease activities, with serine proteases being the most active. Furthermore, A. mauritaniensis induced the alteration and degradation of MDCK cell TJ proteins with serine proteases. After genotyping this amoeba, we determined that it is an isolate of Acanthamoeba genotype T4D. From these data, we suggest that A. mauritaniensis genotype T4D behaves similarly to the A. castellanii strain.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of inhibiting CLDN4 in pancreatic ductal carcinomas (PDC). We first examined 91 cases of human PDC by immunohistochemistry and found that CLDN4 expression was correlated with tumor invasion, nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis. Anti-CLDN4 extracellular domain antibody, previously established by us (4D3), inhibited the proliferation of MIA-PaCa-2 PDC cells and increased intracellular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) concentration with lowering transepithelial electrical resistance. Concurrent treatment of 5-FU and 4D3 resulted in synergistic inhibition of growth of MIA-PaCa-2 cells in nude mice. In addition, MIA-PaCa-2 cell tumors treated with full-dose folfirinox (FFX) decreased tumor diameters to 50%; however, 60% of mice were dead from adverse effects. In contrast, half-dose FFX concomitant with 4D3 treatment decreased tumors equivalent to full-dose FFX, but without the adverse effects. These findings suggest that targeting CLDN4 might increase the effectiveness and safety of anticancer drug therapy in PDC.© 2019 The Authors.

Its effect on the immune response in intestinal epithelial cells and on the intestinal mucosal barrier are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated Caco-2 cells, a monolayer model of intestinal epithelial cells, with or without treatment with C. albicans SC5314 (CA) or heat-inactivated CA (CA-inact). RNA sequencing was conducted, and the mRNA and protein levels of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) or NLRP6/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome signaling pathway components, inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-18 [IL-18] and IL-1β), anti-microbial peptides (AMPs; β-defensin-2 [BD-2], BD-3, and LL-37), and  proteins (occludin and zona occludens-1 [ZO-1]) were examined by real-time PCR, western blotting, and/or immunofluorescence microscopy. Lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the Caco-2 cell supernatant were measured by enzyme kinetics analysis. Our results showed that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway participates in the CA- and CA-inact-infected Caco-2 cells, as shown by microarray analysis of total mRNA expression. The expression of NLRP3, NLRP6, ASC, BD-2, BD-3, occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly decreased in Caco-2 cells infected with CA and CA-inact compared to that in the untreated control. IL-1β expression was decreased in the Caco-2 cells in both the CA- and CA-inact-infected groups compared to that in the control. Caspase-1 and IL-18 levels were not markedly affected by CA or CA-inact in Caco-2 cells. Our findings indicate that CA can inhibit the NLRP3 and NLRP6 pathways and dampen human intestinal mucosal barrier activity by decreasing the production of AMPs and  proteins, independent of CA activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite their significance to cell function, isolation of membrane proteins from their hydrophobic lipid environment and further characterization remains a challenge. To obtain insights into membrane proteins, computational approaches such as docking or self-assembly simulations have been used; however, the promise of these approaches has been limited due to the computational cost. Here we present a new approach called Protein AssociatioN Energy Landscape (PANEL) that provides an extensive and converged data set for all possible conformations of membrane protein associations using a combination of stochastic sampling and equilibration simulations. The PANEL method samples the rotational space around both interacting proteins to obtain the comprehensive interaction energy landscape. We demonstrate the versatility of the PANEL method using two distinct applications: (a) dimerization of claudin-5  proteins in phospholipid bilayer membrane and (b) dimer and trimer formation of the Outer membrane protein F (OmpF) in the lipopolysaccharide-rich bacterial outer membrane. Both applications required only a fraction of simulation cost compared to self-assembly simulations. The method is robust as it can capture changes in protein-protein conformations caused by point mutations. Moreover, the method is versatile and independent of the molecular resolution (atomistic or coarse grain) or the choice of force field employed to compute the pair-interaction energies. The PANEL method is implemented in easy-to-use scripts that are available for download for general use by the scientific community to characterize any pair of interacting integral membrane proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623029>Expression of Neurotrophic Factors,  Proteins, and Cytokines According to Irritable Bowel Syndrome Subtype and Sex.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence shows that the mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with neurotrophic factors and  proteins (TJPs) It is known that there are sex differences in the pathophysiology of IBS. The aim of the present study is to determine expression levels of neurotrophic factors, TJPs, and cytokines according to IBS subtype and sex.From 59 IBS (33 IBS-constipation, 21 IBS-diarrhea, and 5 IBS-mixed) and 36 control patients, colonic mucosa mRNA expression levels of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), nerve growth factor (NGF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and various TJPs were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was performed to determine levels of zonular occludens-1 (ZO-1). Serum levels of cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.TRPV1, GDNF, and NGF mRNA levels were significantly increased in those with IBS-constipation compared to those in controls (all  < 0.05). However, they showed no significant difference between those with IBS-diarrhea and controls. Expression level of TRPV1 correlated with that of GDNF ( = 0.741,  < 0.001) and NGF ( = 0.935,  < 0.001). ZO-1 RNA expression levels were lower (P = 0.021) in female IBS-diarrhea than those in controls, although they showed no significant differences between male IBS-diarrhea and controls. Serum IL-1β levels in female IBS were significantly higher than those of male IBS, especially in IBS-constipation ( < 0.001).Our results suggest that neurotrophic factors and IL-1β are closely related to IBS-constipation and that decrease of ZO-1 is an important factor in female with IBS-diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608051>Acute Respiratory Barrier Disruption by Ozone Exposure in Mice.</a></h2><p>Ozone exposure causes irritation, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), inflammation of the airways, and destruction of alveoli (emphysema), the gas exchange area of the lung in human and mice. This review focuses on the acute disruption of the respiratory epithelial barrier in mice. A single high dose ozone exposure (1 ppm for 1 h) causes first a break of the bronchiolar epithelium within 2 h with leak of serum proteins in the broncho-alveolar space, disruption of epithelial  and cell death, which is followed at 6 h by ROS activation, AHR, myeloid cell recruitment, and remodeling. High ROS levels activate a novel PGAM5 phosphatase dependent cell-death pathway, called oxeiptosis. Bronchiolar cell wall damage and inflammation upon a single ozone exposure are reversible. However, chronic ozone exposure leads to progressive and irreversible loss of alveolar epithelial cells and alveoli with reduced gas exchange space known as emphysema. It is further associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the lung, resembling other environmental pollutants and cigarette smoke in pathogenesis of asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we review recent data on the mechanisms of ozone induced injury on the different cell types and pathways with a focus on the role of the IL-1 family cytokines and the related IL-33. The relation of chronic ozone exposure induced lung disease with asthma and COPD and the fact that ozone exacerbates asthma and COPD is emphasized.Copyright © 2019 Sokolowska, Quesniaux, Akdis, Chung, Ryffel and Togbe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622690>Chitosan coating of zein-carboxymethylated short-chain amylose nanocomposites improves oral bioavailability of insulin in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Non-invasive means of insulin administration circumvent some of the inconveniences of injections. Oral administration in particular is convenient, pain-free, and allows favorable glucose homeostasis, but is subject to chemical instability, enzymatic degradation, and poor gastrointestinal absorption. Natural polymeric nanoparticles have emerged as a promising oral delivery system for peptide therapeutics due their safety, biocompatibility, and stability. In this study, self-assembled nanocomposites from chitosan (CS) and insulin-loaded, zein-carboxymethylated short-chain amylose (IN-Z-CSA) nanocomposites were synthesized to improve oral bioavailability of insulin. The optimized IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites exhibited an average size of 311.32±6.98 nm, a low polydispersity index (0.227±0.01), a negative zeta potential (43.77±1.36 mV), an encapsulation efficiency of 89.6±0.9%, and a loading capacity of 6.8±0.4%. The IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites were stable in storage conditions. The transepithelial permeability of the N-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites was 12-fold higher than that of insulin. Cellular uptake studies revealed that the IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites were internalized into Caco-2 cells by both endocytosis and a paracellular route. Additionally, in pharmacological studies, orally administered IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites had a stronger hypoglycemic effect with a relative bioavailability of 15.19% compared with that of IN-Z-CSA nanocomposites. Furthermore, cell toxicity and in vivo tests revealed that the IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites were biocompatible. Overall, these results indicate that the IN-Z-CSA/CS nanocomposites can improve oral bioavailability of insulin and are a promising delivery system for insulin or other peptide/protein drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cell viability was estimated by cell counting kit-8 and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, Beclin-1 and autophagy-related (atg) 5 mRNA was evaluated by quantitative PCR, and the expression of ZO-1, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) I and, LC3B II protein by Western blot.LPS effectively inhibited cell viability and LC3B I expression and enhanced LC3B II, Beclin-1 and atg5 expressions in MLE-12 cells.

CPE action starts when it binds to claudin receptors, forming a small complex (90 kDa). Six small complexes then oligomerize to create prepores, followed by insertion of beta-hairpins from CPE to form beta-barrel pores named CH-1 or CH-2. Of the ~27 members of the human claudin protein family, only some bind CPE. However, both receptor claudins and the nonreceptor claudin-1 (CLDN-1) are associated with the small and CH-1/CH-2 CPE complexes. Therefore, this study evaluated whether claudin-1 affects CPE action by generating a CLDN-1 null mutant in Caco-2 cells using CRISPR-Cas9. Compared to wild-type Caco-2 cells, paracellular permeability of the CLDN-1 mutant was significantly enhanced, suggesting that claudin-1 may reduce CPE absorption during enterotoxemia. The CLDN-1 mutant was also markedly more sensitive than wild-type Caco-2 cells to apically-applied CPE. The mechanism behind this increased sensitivity involved higher CPE binding by the CLDN-1 mutant vs. wild-type Caco-2 cells, which led to more CH-1/CH-2 complex formation. However, the CH-1/CH-2 complexes formed by the CLDN-1 mutant were less stable or trypsin resistant than those of wild-type cells. These results indicate that, although a nonreceptor, CLDN-1 positively and negatively influences CPE action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576512>L-Arginine alleviates heat stress-induced intestinal epithelial barrier damage by promoting expression of  proteins via the AMPK pathway.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) and secondary restricted blood flow to the intestines cause dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier.  (TJs) are essential to maintain intestinal integrity. L-Arginine has beneficial effects on gut functions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that L-arginine regulates the TJ network by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which in turn improves intestinal barrier functions under HS. IEC-6 cells and rat small intestines were used as experiment models of heat stress. AICAR and dorsomorphin were used to activate and inhibit the AMPK pathway, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, differential gene expression and KEGG pathway analysis, intestinal paracellular permeability, intestinal morphology, and expression of HSP and TJ proteins, and p-AMPK were determined. L-Arginine promoted cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis after heat exposure at an optimal concentration of 5 mmol. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes associated with the HSP family and TJs were elevated by L-arginine. According to KEGG pathway analysis, L-arginine activated the AMPK signaling pathway. In vivo, intestinal damage resulted in obvious morphological changes as well as apoptosis with TUNEL and caspase-3 staining under HS and dorsomorphin treatments. Furthermore, HS and dorsomorphin increased the serum D-lactate concentration, diamine oxidase activity, and mRNA expression level of MLCK (P < 0.05). In contrast, L-arginine and AICAR treatments reduced intestinal injury, maintained intestinal permeability, and increased the villus/crypt ratio under hyperthermia. L-Arginine had the same effect as AICAR both in vitro and in vivo, namely increasing p-AMPK protein expression. L-Arginine and AICAR also upregulated the mRNA expression level of HSP70 and HSP90, and downregulated mRNA expression of MLCK (P < 0.05). The protein expression levels of TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-1 were suppressed by heat stroke and dorsomorphin, but enhanced by L-arginine and AICAR. Our findings indicate that activation of AMPK signaling by L-arginine is associated with improved intestinal mucosal barrier functions by enhancing the expression of TJs in rat small intestines and IEC-6 cells during HS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499514>Hyaluronan 35 kDa enhances epithelial barrier function and protects against the development of murine necrotizing enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Disruption of  (TJs) predisposes to bacterial translocation, intestinal inflammation, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Previously, studies showed that hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan in human milk, maintains intestinal permeability, enhances intestinal immunity, and reduces intestinal infections. In this study, we investigated the effects of HA 35 kDa on a NEC-like murine model.Pups were divided into Sham, NEC, NEC+HA 35, and HA 35. Severity of intestinal injury was compared using a modified macroscopic gut scoring and histologic injury grading. The effect of HA 35 on intestinal permeability was determined by measuring FITC dextran and bacterial translocation. RNA and protein expression of TJ proteins (claudin-2, -3, -4, occludin, and ZO-1) were compared between the groups.Pups in the NEC+HA 35 group had increased survival and lower intestinal injury compared to untreated NEC. In addition, HA 35 reduced intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and proinflammatory cytokine release. Ileal expression of claudin-2, -3, -4, occludin, and ZO-1 was upregulated in NEC+HA 35 and HA 35 compared to untreated NEC and shams.These findings suggest that HA 35 protects against NEC partly by upregulating intestinal TJs and enhancing intestinal barrier function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645438>The anion transporter SLC26A9 localizes to  and is degraded by the proteasome when co-expressed with F508del-CFTR.</a></h2><p>Mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) disrupt epithelial secretion and cause cystic fibrosis (CF). Available CFTR modulators provide only modest clinical benefits, so alternative therapeutic targets are being explored. The anion-conducting transporter solute carrier family 26 member 9 (SLC26A9) is a promising candidate, but its functional expression is drastically reduced in cells that express the most common CF-associated CFTR variant, F508del-CFTR, through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Here, we examined the metabolic stability and location of SLC26A9 and its relationship to CFTR. Compared with SLC26A9 levels in BHK cells expressing SLC26A9 alone or with wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR), co-expression of SLC26A9 with F508del-CFTR reduced total and plasma membrane levels of SLC26A9. Proteasome inhibitors increased SLC26A9 immunofluorescence in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBEs) homozygous for F508del-CFTR but not in non-CF pHBEs, suggesting that F508del-CFTR enhances proteasomal SLC26A9 degradation. Apical SLC26A9 expression increased when F508del-CFTR trafficking was partially corrected by low temperature or with the CFTR modulator VX-809. The immature glycoforms of SLC26A9 and CFTR co-immunoprecipitated, consistent with their interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Transfection with increasing amounts of WT-CFTR cDNA progressively increased SLC26A9 levels in F508del-CFTR-expressing cells, suggesting that WT-CFTR competes with F508del-CFTR for SLC26A9 binding. Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous SLC26A9 and transfection of a 3HA-tagged construct into well-differentiated cells revealed that SLC26A9 is mostly present at . We conclude that SLC26A9 interacts with CFTR in both the ER and Golgi and that its interaction with F508del-CFTR increases proteasomal SLC26A9 degradation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632511>An emerging tumor invasion mechanism about the collective cell migration.</a></h2><p>Traditionally, the metastasis has been detected in the late stage of the cancer, which mostly leads to death. The classical opinion about tumor metastasis is that tumor cell migration begins with the single tumor cell and goes through a series of complicated procedures, and lastly arrives and survives at distant tissues and organs. However, emerging studies have found a new migration mechanism called collective cell migration in many cancers. The collective cell migration could move as clusters with the  cell-cell  in the tumor microenvironments, toward the traction established by the leader cells. In addition, the collective cell migration has been shown to have higher invasive capacity and higher resistance to the clinical treatments than the single tumor cell migration. Interestingly, the collective clusters of tumor cells have been detected in the early stage of the cancer patient, which has led to the understanding of the significance of early cancer screenings. Here, we reviewed the major principles and guidance of the collective cell migration mechanisms, and the specific manifestations in the different tumors such as breast cancer and lung cancer.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570003>The comprehensive pathophysiological changes in a novel rat model of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity.</a></h2><p>So far, a comprehensive animal model that can mimic both the central and peripheral pathophysiological changes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is lacking. Here, we developed a novel IBS rat model combining trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) (designated as TC-IBS) and compared it with the TNBS-induced and CUMS-induced models. TC-IBS showed a pronounced depression phenotype with increased corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor (CRHR)1 and CRHR2 expression at the frontal cortex and increased serum ACTH concentration. Visceral hypersensitivity (VH), as evidenced by colorectal distention (CRD) test, was highest in TC-IBS, accompanied by increased serum 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) level and colonic 5-HT receptor 3A (5-HTR)/5-HT receptor 2B expression, impaired  protein expression including occludin, zonula occludens-1, and phosphorylated myosin light chain. Palonosetron, a second generation of 5-HTR antagonist, alleviated VH significantly in TC-IBS. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that TNBS plus CUMS induced a significant disturbance of the gut microbiota. Cytokine profile analysis of TC-IBS model indicated an innate immune activation both in serum and colonic mucosa. Further, fecal microbiota transplantation improved VH and some pathophysiological changes in TC-IBS. In summary, we established a postinflammatory IBS model covering multifactorial pathophysiological changes, which may help to develop therapies that target specific IBS subtype.-Ma, J., Li, J., Qian, M., He, N., Cao, Y., Liu, Y., Wu, K., He, S.

Another important target of EPEC is the  (TJ), and EspF induces displacement of TJ proteins and increased intestinal permeability. Previously, we determined that an EPEC strain lacking EspF did not cause TJ disruption; meanwhile, pedestals were located on the TJ and smaller than those induced by the wild-type strain. Therefore, EspF could be playing an important role in both phenotypes. Here, using different cell models, we found that EspF was essential for pedestal maturation through ZO-1 disassembly from TJ, leading to (a) ZO-1 recruitment to the pedestal structure; no other main TJ proteins were required. Recruited ZO-1 allowed the afadin recruitment. (b) Afadin recruitment caused an afadin-ZO-1 transient interaction, like during TJ formation. (c) Afadin and ZO-1 were segregated to the tip and the stem of pedestal, respectively, causing pedestal maturation. Initiation of these three discrete phases for pedestal maturation functionally and physically required EspF expression. Pedestal maturation process could help coordinate the epithelial actomyosin function by maintaining the actin-rich column composing the pedestal structure and could be important in the dynamics of the pedestal movement on epithelial cells.© 2019 The Authors.

Several barnacle species are described as highly euryhaline and a few species even have the ability to colonize estuarine and brackish habitats below 5 PSU. However, the physiological and/or morphological adaptations that allow barnacles to live at low salinities are poorly understood and current knowledge is largely based on classical eco-physiological studies offering limited insight into the molecular mechanisms. This review provides an overview of available knowledge of salinity tolerance in barnacles and what is currently known about their osmoregulatory strategies. To stimulate future studies on barnacle euryhalinity, we briefly review and compare barnacles to other marine invertebrates with known mechanisms of osmoregulation with focus on crustaceans. Different mechanisms are described based on the current understanding of molecular biology and integrative physiology of osmoregulation. We focus on ion and water transport across epithelial cell layers, including transport mechanisms across cell membranes and paracellular transfer across  as well as on the use of intra- and extracellular osmolytes. Based on this current knowledge, we discuss the osmoregulatory mechanisms possibly present in barnacles. We further discuss evolutionary consequences of barnacle osmoregulation including invasion-success in new habitats and life-history evolution. Tolerance to low salinities may play a crucial role in determining future distributions of barnacles since forthcoming climate-change scenarios predict decreased salinity in shallow coastal areas. Finally, we outline future research directions to identify osmoregulatory tissues, characterize physiological and molecular mechanisms, and explore ecological and evolutionary implications of osmoregulation in barnacles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556210>Abundance of Probiotics and Butyrate-Production Microbiome Manages Constipation via Short-Chain Fatty Acids Production and Hormones Secretion.</a></h2><p>The characteristics of gut microbiota and host metabolism are hypothesized to be associated with constipation status, but the regulation mechanism is not fully understood. Thus, the current study investigates the effect of constipation symptoms on gut functionality following the modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites via dietary fiber intervention.Constipation causes a significantly reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and a higher level of iso-butyrate. The feces of constipated people are characterized with inhibited Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Roseburia abundance. Desulfovibrionaceae is identified to be an important endotoxin producer in constipated patients, and a butyrate-enriched SCFAs profile achieved by dietary fiber supplement accelerates gastrointestinal transit and increases the thickness of the mucosal layer, possibly through triggering the secretion of colonic hormones and enhancing the expression of  proteins for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. More importantly, an interacting regulatory mechanism among SCFAs, in particular butyrate and propionate, may be involved in signaling between the microbiome and host cells in the colon.Gut microbiota, characterized with enriched butyrate-producing and depressed Desulfovibrionaceae bacteria, attenuates constipation symptoms through promoting intestinal hormones secretion and maintaining gut barrier integrity.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, the Zn-enriching ability of 33 probiotics in a medium or an aqueous solution was evaluated. A Lactobacillus plantarum strain, CCFM242, with a superior Zn-enriching ability was screened. Among the cellular components, the cell wall played the most important role in the Zn binding of L. plantarum CCFM242. The carboxyl and amino groups on the surface of the strain were also vital for Zn enrichment. Upon optimization of the Zn-enriching procedure, the Zn-binding ability of this strain reached 24.89 ± 0.50 mg g dry biomass. Compared to the treatment of ZnSO or L. plantarum CCFM242, oral supplementation with Zn-enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 resulted in a higher serum Zn level, enhanced levels of mRNA expression of colonic , increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in colonic contents, and stronger modulatory effects on the anti-oxidant and immune defense systems in the gut of normal mice. Zn-Enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 treatment also offered more significant protective effects against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice compared to the treatment of ZnSO or L. plantarum CCFM242 alone. The synergistic effect of Zn-enriched L. plantarum CCFM242 may be due to the increased tolerance of the strain to the gastrointestinal tract conditions and the higher bioavailability of Zn after the metal-enrichment process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498437>CLDN1 induces autophagy to promote proliferation and metastasis of esophageal squamous carcinoma through AMPK/STAT1/ULK1 signaling.</a></h2><p> is a structural constitution in cell-cell adhesion and play an important role in the maintenance of permeability and integrity of normal epithelial cell barrier. The protein encoded by Claudin 1 (CLDN1), a member of the claudin family, is an integral membrane protein and a component of  strands. CLDN1 has been proved to regulate the proliferation and metastasis of multiple tumors, but little is known about its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we found that CLDN1 was aberrantly increased in ESCC tissues and cell lines, and mainly distributed in the nucleus of tumor cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that CLDN1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of ESCC by triggering autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we validated that CLDN1-induced autophagy via increasing Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) expression through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway in ESCC cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that aberrant expression and distribution of CLDN1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of esophageal squamous carcinoma by triggering autophagy through AMPK/STAT1/ULK1 signaling pathway.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616513>Effect of ulinastatin combined with mild therapeutic hypothermia on intestinal barrier dysfunction following cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ulinastatin (UTI) alone or combined with mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) on intestinal barrier dysfunction following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in rats. A total of 25 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly organized into five groups: Sham; control; UTI; MTH; and the combined group. The latter four groups were induced with the asphyxiated cardiac arrest rat model and treated with different interventions. After 6 h of treatment, the intestinal tissues of the rats were examined by electron microscopy, and the levels of intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined. The results of the present study indicated that the target temperature had successfully been attained in MTH and the combined group, and the other three groups of rats all survived at a normal temperature. In the rats treated with UTI or MTH, the epithelial cells exhibited pathological changes in their  and epithelial cell surface microvilli compared with the sham group. In the rats treated with a combination of UTI and MTH, whilst the epithelial cells exhibited a few slight changes, including mitochondrial edema, they were largely similar to the normal epithelial cells. However, there were significant differences in the levels of MDA and SOD between the different treatment groups. UTI combined with MTH may serve a protective role by suppressing oxidative stress in the small intestinal mucosa following CPR in rats compared with either UTI or MTH treatment alone.Copyright: © Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555860>Intestinal organoids in infants and children.</a></h2><p>Recent advances in culturing of intestinal stem cells and pluripotent stem cells have led to the development of intestinal organoids. These are self-organizing 3D structures, which recapitulate the characteristics and physiological features of in vivo intestinal epithelium. Intestinal organoids have allowed the development of novel in vitro models to study various gastrointestinal diseases expanding our understanding of the pathophysiology of diseases and leading to the development of innovative therapies. This article aims to summarize the current usage of intestinal organoids as a model of gastrointestinal diseases and the potential applications of intestinal organoids in infants and children. Intestinal organoids allow the study of intestinal epithelium responses to stress factors. Mimicking intestinal injury such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal organoids increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes and shows disruption of  after they are injured by lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia. In cystic fibrosis, intestinal organoids derived from rectal biopsies have provided benefits in genetic studies and development of novel therapeutic gene modulation. Transplantation of intestinal organoids via enema has been shown to rescue damaged colonic epithelium in mice.

Gut microbiota appears to play a significant role in the induction of peripheral and central inflammation. Ethanol (EtOH) exposure alters gut permeability, but its effects on Trp metabolism and the involvement of gut microbiota have not been studied. We analyzed several parameters of gut-barrier and of peripheral and central Trp metabolism following 2 different EtOH consumption patterns in mice, the binge model, drinking in the dark (DID), and the chronic intermittent (CI) consumption paradigm. Antibiotic treatment was used to evaluate gut microbiota involvement in the CI model. Mice exposed to CI EtOH intake, but not DID, show bacterial translocation and increased plasma LPS immediately after EtOH removal. Gut-barrier permeability to FITC-dextran is increased by CI, and, furthermore, intestinal epithelial  (TJ) disruption is observed (decreased expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin) associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity and iNOS expression. CI EtOH, but not DID, increases kynurenine (Kyn) levels in plasma and limbic forebrain. Intestinal bacterial decontamination prevents the LPS increase but not the permeability to FITC-dextran, TJ disruption, or the increase in MMP-9 activity and iNOS expression. Although plasma Kyn levels are not affected by antibiotic treatment, the elevation of Kyn in brain is prevented, pointing to an involvement of microbiota in CI EtOH-induced changes in brain Trp metabolism. Additionally, CI EtOH produces depressive-like symptoms of anhedonia, which are prevented by the antibiotic treatment thus pointing to an association between anhedonia and the increase in brain Kyn and to the involvement of gut microbiota.-Giménez-Gómez, P., Pérez-Hernández, M., O'Shea, E., Caso, J.

The rhesus macaque is the gold standard for modeling viral infection and activation of CNS, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We have developed a rhesus macaque choroid plexus epithelial cell culture model which we believe to be suitable for studies of inflammation associated with viral infection of the CNS. Epithelial morphology and function were assessed using vimentin, phalloidin, the  protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Choroid plexus epithelial cell type was confirmed using immunofluorescence with two proteins highly expressed in the choroid plexus: transthyretin and α-klotho. Finally, barrier properties of the model were monitored using pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, the TLR2 agonist PamCys3K, and dexamethasone). When pro-inflammatory TNF-α was added to the xCelligence wells, there was a decrease in barrier function, which decreased in a step-wise fashion with each additional administration. This barrier function was repaired upon addition of the steroid dexamethasone. The TLR2 agonist PAM3CysK increased barrier functions in TNF-α treated wells. We have presented a model of the blood-CSF barrier that will allow study into pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions in the brain, while simultaneously measuring real time changes to epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656916>Resveratrol and Curcumin Improve Intestinal Mucosal Integrity and Decrease mA RNA Methylation in the Intestine of Weaning Piglets.</a></h2><p> -Methyladenosine (mA) is the most prevalent modification on eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). Resveratrol and curcumin, which can exert many health-protective effects, may have a relationship with mA RNA methylation. We hypothesized that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin could affect growth performance, intestinal mucosal integrity, mA RNA methylation, and gene expression in weaning piglets. One hundred and eighty piglets weaned at 28 ± 2 days were fed a control diet or supplementary diets (300 mg/kg of antibiotics; 300 mg/kg of each resveratrol and curcumin; 100 mg/kg of each resveratrol and curcumin; 300 mg/kg of resveratrol; 300 mg/kg of curcumin) for 28 days. The results showed that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin improved growth performance and enhanced intestinal mucosal integrity and functions in weaning piglets. Resveratrol and curcumin also increased intestinal antioxidative capacity and mRNA expression of  proteins. Furthermore, resveratrol and curcumin decreased the content of mA and decreased the enrichment of mA on the transcripts of  proteins and on heme oxygenase-1 in the intestine. Our findings indicated that the combination of resveratrol and curcumin increased growth performance, enhanced intestine function, and protected piglet health, which may be associated with changes in mA methylation and gene expression, suggesting that curcumin and resveratrol may be a potential natural alternative to antibiotics.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555257>The Contribution of Gut Barrier Changes to Multiple Sclerosis Pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>The gut barrier consists of several components, including the mucus layer, made of mucins and anti-bacterial molecule, the epithelial cells, connected by  proteins, and a mixed population of cells involved in the interplay with microbes, such as M cells, elongations of "antigen presenting cells" dwelling the lamina propria, intraepithelial lymphocytes and Paneth cells secreting anti-bacterial peptides.

GU, also modifies the characteristics of  proteins (occludin and claudin) at the site of BBB by depolarizing the enzyme, protein tyrosine phosphatase that manifests its usefulness for passive delivery of nanocarriers to the brain. GU, thus, represents itself as an ideal ligand for the surface decoration of nanocarriers to successfully administer them across the brain via receptor-mediated drug delivery pathway. Hence, we have employed here,  approaches to identify the potential GU-like molecules, as appropriate ligand(s) for surface engineering of nanoconstruct with the purpose of attaining targeted drug delivery to the brain. Structure-based virtual screening methods was used to filter PubChem database for the identification of bioactive compounds with >95% structure similarity with GU. We have further screened the compounds against NMDAR using molecular docking approach. Top hits were selected based on their high binding affinities and selectivity towards NMDAR, and their binding pattern was analysed in detail. Finally, all atom molecular dynamics simulation for 100 ns was carried out on free NMDAR and in-presence of the selected GU-like compound, gamma-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine to evaluate complex stability and structural dynamics. In conclusion, gamma-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine may act as potential binding partner of NMDAR which can further be evaluated in drug delivery system to brain across the BBB. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, it remains unknown whether and how exosomes mediate the release of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome products such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) from endothelial cells. The present study hypothesized that lysosomal acid ceramidase (AC) determines the fate of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to control the exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products during hyperglycemia. Using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mouse model, we found that endothelium-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1/EC) significantly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in coronary arterial ECs (CECs). These mice also had increased thickening of the coronary arterial wall and reduced expression of  protein compared to wild-type (WT/WT) littermates. We also observed the expression of exosome markers such as CD63 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was augmented in STZ-treated Asah1/EC mice compared to WT/WT mice, which was accompanied by an increased IL-1β release of exosomes. In the primary cultures of CECs, we demonstrated that AC deficiency markedly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, but significantly down-regulated  proteins when these cells were exposed to high levels of glucose. The CECs from Asah1/EC mice had decreased MVB-lysosome interaction and increased IL-1β-containing exosome release in response to high glucose stimulation. Together, these results suggest that AC importantly controls exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products in CECs, which is enhanced by AC deficiency leading to aggravated arterial inflammatory response during hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of commonly used NI solutions on epithelial mucociliary and barrier functionality in primary cultured human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs).HNECs from control subjects and patients with CRSwNP were established as air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Differentiated cultures were treated with different NI solutions, including isotonic 0.9% and hypertonic 3.0% saline, isotonic and hypertonic seawater, and Ringer lactate solution. The changes in ciliary beat frequency (CBF), numbers of ciliated and goblet cells, and cytotoxicity were measured. Epithelial barrier functionality was assessed by measuring the transepithelial electric resistance (TER), paracellular flux, and expression of  protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin.Isotonic saline, isotonic seawater, and Ringer lactate solutions did not affect epithelial mucociliary and barrier function in either control or CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures; however, hypertonic saline induced a significant disruption of these cell functions in both cultures. Hypertonic seawater caused a transient decrease of CBF and TER in CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures, in contrast to inducing an obvious mucociliary and barrier dysfunction and cytotoxicity in control ALI cultures.Although isotonic NI solutions appear to not affect epithelial mucociliary and barrier function in control and CRSwNP-derived ALI cultures, hypertonic saline and seawater solutions damaged sinonasal epithelial cells in ALI cultures.

Thus, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of MAM on the diabetic intestinal epithelium.16S high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of db/db mice (T2DM mouse model). We transfected a FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid into human colonic cells to explore the protein-protein interactions and observe cell monolayer permeability. For in vivo experiments, db/db mice were supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein from E. coli BL21 (DE3).The abundance of F. prausnitzii was downregulated in the gut microbiota of db/db mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectroscopy (MS) analyses revealed that MAM potentially interacts with proteins in the  pathway, including zona occludens 1 (ZO-1). FLAG-tagged MAM plasmid transfection stabilized the cell permeability and increased ZO-1 expression in NCM460, Caco2, and HT-29 cells. The db/db mice supplemented with recombinant His-tagged MAM protein showed restored intestinal barrier function and elevated ZO-1 expression.Our study shows that MAM from F. prausnitzii can restore the intestinal barrier structure and function in DM conditions via the regulation of the  pathway and ZO-1 expression.© 2019 The Authors.

The current study was conducted to investigate if a high concentrate (HC) supplemented with sodium butyrate can alleviate the inflammation and if an epigenetic mechanism is involved in regulating the expression of the key GPR41/43 genes in the cecum. Twelve lactating goats were randomly divided into two groups: the control group fed the HC diet and the treatment group fed the HC diet supplemented with sodium butyrate (HCB). Our results suggested that the supplementation of sodium butyrate significantly increased the pH value in the rumen and cecum, downregulated the expression of GPR41/43 and related inflammatory cytokines, upregulated the expression of  proteins, and reduced the protein expression levels of GPR 41/43, ERK1/2, and p38. Moreover, the ratios of DNA methylation and chromatin compaction in the promoter region of the GPR41/43 genes were altered due to the addition of sodium butyrate. In brief, dietary addition of sodium butyrate can reduce the inflammatory injury to the cecal mucosa in lactating goats and can affect the expression of GPR41/43 via epigenetic modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620885>Berberis lycium fruit extract attenuates oxi-inflammatory stress and promotes mucosal healing by mitigating NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs signalling and augmenting splenic Treg proliferation in a murine model of dextran sulphate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis.</a></h2><p>There is a growing interest in developing phytomolecule-based therapies for the management of inflammatory disorders owing to rising cost of treatments and unwarranted effects. The present work attempted to assess the efficacy and mechanisms of Berberis lycium Royle fruit extract (BLFE) in mitigating chemical-induced colitis in mice.Colitis was induced in Balb/C mice using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) and protective effects of BLFE were examined. Several oxi-inflammatory parameters, histopathological changes, epithelial barrier integrity and activation of NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs in colon tissue were determined. Splenic T cell subpopulations were also gauged to evaluate the systemic effects of BLFE in the modulation of immune responses.BLFE treatment effectively improved animal survival rate, DAI score, colon length and structural damage in DSS-exposed mice. Expression of oxi-inflammatory markers such as MPO, IgE, iNOS, ICAM-1, MCP-1 and RANTES as well as Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines were decreased in BLFE treated animals. On the other hand, an increased mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4/IL-10),  proteins and IgA levels were also observed during BLFE treatment. BLFE appeared to modulate intestinal epithelial cell proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (Bcl2/Bax), thereby suggesting its role in the maintenance of intestinal integrity. Analysis of inflammatory signalling pathways indicated robust activation and expression of NF-κB/c-Jun/MAPKs (JNK and p38) in DSS treated animal which was strongly abrogated by BLFE treatment. BLFE supplementation also enhanced the proliferation of CD3CD4CD25 Treg cells indicating suppression of inflammatory activation.These observations provide compelling evidence that BLFE could be considered as a viable natural strategy in the prevention and management of ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533100>Glutamine Blocks Interleukin-13-Induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function is a hallmark of a variety of pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily bowel movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro.Caco-2 cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of  proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin-2 expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not.IL-13 induced barrier integrity impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-2. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced barrier dysfunction by increasing claudin-1 expression, via disruption of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.© 2019 S.

The levels of soluble F11R/JAM-A (sJAM-A) in the murine plasmas were measured by ELISA. Levels of F11R/JAM-A mRNA and protein in cell lines were assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell surface expression of F11R/JAM-A was demonstrated by flow cytometry. Functional tests included the TEM of breast cancer cells and adhesion of breast cancer cells to the endothelium. The endothelial permeability was studied by fluorescent tracer assay and by the Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA).The tumor inducers Tβ4 and TGF-β1 reduced the levels of sJAM-A in murine plasma, and reduced the F11R/JAM-A protein levels in the human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1. The adhesion and TEM measured between breast cancer cells and inflamed or Tβ4-treated endothelium were inhibited by P4D. The presence of P4D did not destabilize the pre-existing  in the endothelial monolayer. The barrier-protecting effect of P4D was stronger than that of forskolin, when a booster dose of P4D was applied to the inflamed endothelium.F11R/JAM-A protein can be considered as a novel target in the treatment of breast cancer metastasis. In vivo and clinical studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of F11R/JAM-A-derived peptide as a possible anti-metastatic drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606658>Changes in the expression and distribution of  and polarity proteins in the porcine endometrium during early pregnancy period.</a></h2><p>The maternal endometrium undergoes transformations during early pregnancy period to regulate the paracellular permeability across the epithelium and to enable adhesion between the trophoblast and endometrial epithelial cells. These transformations, under the influence of ovarian hormones, are associated with a partial loss in polarity of epithelial cell that is regulated by  (TJ), adherens  (AJ) and associated polarity protein complexes. This study examined the change in expression and distribution of proteins associated with TJs, AJs and apical partition defective (PAR) complex in porcine endometrium on Days 10, 13 and 16 of estrous cycle and pregnancy. Moreover, effect of hormones, progesterone (P4) and 17-β estradiol (E) on polar phenotype of endometrial epithelial cells was also investigated in vitro. There was pregnancy induced increase in gene and protein expression of TJ associated claudin-1 (CLDN1) on Day 13 of pregnancy as compared to corresponding day of estrous cycle and a decrease in TJ protein, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and PAR complex associated PAR6 expression levels on Day 16 of pregnancy (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence studies revealed that on Days 10 and 13, TJ proteins occludin (OCLN) and ZO-1were primarily present in the apical region of lateral epithelial membrane. On Day 16 of pregnancy, whereas, OCLN redistributed into cytoplasm, ZO-1 decreased apically but was found to localize in the basal epithelium. The AJ proteins cadherin and β-catenin were located at the apical epithelium on Day 10 of estrous cycle and pregnancy and Day 13 of estrous cycle. On Days 13 and 16 of pregnancy both proteins were expressed in the lateral membrane and co-localization between these proteins was observed on Day 16. On Day 10, PAR complex proteins PAR3, cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) ζ were observed in apical epithelium and in lateral membrane and CDC42 was also present in the cytoplasm of epithelium. Pregnancy induced redistribution of aPKCζ to cytoplasm and CDC42 to apical surface of luminal epithelium was observed on Days 13 and 16. The in vitro P4 and E treatment of epithelial cells mimicked in vivo results. These results indicate that P4 and E regulate alterations in epithelium that may facilitate embryo implantation and given the role of cadherin, catenin and CDC42 in embryo invasion, change in distribution of these proteins may limit the invasiveness of porcine conceptuses into the stroma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, magnitudes of toxic effects, induced by MCs, depend on route and magnitude of exposure to the toxin. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed 1, 10 or 100 μg/L MC-LR for 90 or 180 days, and pathological approach and the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics were employed with testes. Proteomics revealed that a number of differentially altered proteins may be involved in MC-LR-induced chronic testicular toxicity. The biological process analysis indicated the altered proteins played an important role in biological adhesion, cellular process, response to stimulus or rhythmic process. The cellular component analysis revealed that most of the proteins with altered expression associated with cell part, extracellular region, extracellular region part, membrane, membrane part, organelle or organelle part. The molecular function showed that these proteins were critical in molecular transducer activity. Integrity analyses provide first compelling evidence that MC-LR significantly cause dysfunction of blood-testis barrier (BTB) through affecting  and gap . Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT eventually contributed to injury result from chronic low-level MC-LR treatment.

Here, we hypothesize that Zika virus (ZIKV) infects the brain via a disrupted BBB and altered expression of  (TJ) proteins, which are structural components of the BBB. To assess this hypothesis,  and  studies were performed using three different strains of ZIKV: Honduras (ZIKV-H), Puerto Rico (ZIKV-PR), and Uganda (ZIKV-U). Primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were productively infected by all studied ZIKV strains at MOI 0.01, and were analyzed by plaque assay, immunofluorescence for NS1 protein, and qRT-PCR at 2 and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to mock-infected controls, expression level of ZO-1 was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-H-infected BMECs, while occludin and claudin-5 levels were significantly downregulated in BMECs infected by all three studied viral strains. Interestingly, BMEC permeability was not disturbed by ZIKV infection, even in the presence of a very high viral load (MOI 10). All studied ZIKV strains productively infected wild-type C57BL/J mice after intravenous infection with 10 PFU. Viral load was detected in the plasma, spleen, and brain from 1 to 8 dpi. Peak brain infection was observed at 2 dpi; therefore, TJ protein expression was assessed at this time point. Claudin-5 was significantly downregulated in ZIKV-U-infected animals and the BBB integrity was significantly disturbed in ZIKV-H-infected animals. Our results suggest that ZIKV penetrates the brain parenchyma early after infection with concurrent alterations of TJ protein expression and disruption of the BBB permeability in a strain-dependent manner.Copyright © 2019 Leda, Bertrand, Andras, El-Hage, Nair and Toborek.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506421>Indole-3-propionic acid inhibits gut dysbiosis and endotoxin leakage to attenuate steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites have emerged as critical components that mediate the metabolic effects of the gut microbiota. Here, we show that indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a tryptophan metabolite produced by gut bacteria, is a potent anti-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) microbial metabolite. Here, we demonstrate that administration of IPA modulates the microbiota composition in the gut and inhibits microbial dysbiosis in rats fed a high-fat diet. IPA induces the expression of  proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, and maintains intestinal epithelium homeostasis, leading to a reduction in plasma endotoxin levels. Interestingly, IPA inhibits NF-κB signaling and reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, in response to endotoxin in macrophages to repress hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Moreover, IPA is sufficient to inhibit the expression of fibrogenic and collagen genes and attenuate diet-induced NASH phenotypes. The beneficial effects of IPA on the liver are likely mediated through inhibiting the production of endotoxin in the gut. These findings suggest a protective role of IPA in the control of metabolism and uncover the gut microbiome and liver cross-talk in regulating the intestinal microenvironment and liver pathology via a novel dietary nutrient metabolite. IPA may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489648>Wnt/β-Catenin signaling plays a protective role in the Mdr2 KO murine model of cholestatic liver disease.</a></h2><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has a well-described role in liver pathobiology. Its suppression was recently shown to decrease bile acid (BA) synthesis, thus preventing the development of cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis after bile duct ligation (BDL). To generalize these observations, we suppressed β-catenin in Mdr2 knockout (KO) mice, which develop sclerosing cholangitis due to regurgitation of BA from leaky ducts. When β-catenin was knocked down (KD) in KO for 2 weeks, hepatic and biliary injury were exacerbated in comparison to KO given placebo, as shown by serum biochemistry, ductular reaction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Simultaneously, KO/KD livers displayed increased oxidative stress and senescence and an impaired regenerative response. Although total liver BA levels were similar between KO/KD and KO, there was significant dysregulation of BA transporters and BA detoxification/synthesis enzymes in KO/KD compared to KO alone. Multiphoton intravital microscopy revealed a mixing of blood and bile in the sinusoids, and validated the presence of increased serum BA in KO/KD mice. Although hepatocyte  were intact, KO/KD livers had significant canalicular defects, which resulted from loss of hepatocyte polarity. Thus, in contrast to the protective effect of β-catenin KD in BDL model, β-catenin KD in Mdr2 KO aggravated rather than alleviated injury by interfering with expression of BA transporters, hepatocyte polarity, canalicular structure, and the regenerative response. The resulting imbalance between ongoing injury and restitution led to worsening of the Mdr2 KO phenotype, suggesting caution in targeting β-catenin globally for all cholestatic conditions.

However, the exact mechanism was still unclarified. This study aimed to investigate the role of high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway in normal human gastric epithelial (GES-1) cells under clopidogrel exposure. Morphological alterations of the gastric epithelial cells were observed under a microscope. A laser scanning confocal microscope was used to determine the distribution of HMGB1 and TLR4 in clopidogrel-induced injury. MTT was used to compare the viability of GES-1 cell among the pretreated Cli-095 (TLR4 inhibitor) group, pretreated ethyl pyruvate (HMGB1 inhibitor) group, clopidogrel group, and control group. Moreover, expression of the HMGB1, TLR4,  (TJ) proteins occludin and the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 were examined by western blot. We found the expression of HMGB1 and TLR4 in the cytoplasm increased after clopidogrel administration. Besides, inhibited TLR4, which is a receptor of HMGB1, prevented the injury and occludin reducing caused by clopidogrel challenge. Furthermore, blocking HMGB1 or TLR4 activity by ethyl pyruvate (HMGB1 inhibitor) or cli-095(TLR4 inhibitor) can partially diminish the activation of p38MAPK. Gastric mucosal damages observed by clopidogrel challenge are associated with HMGB1, TLR4, through p38MAPK signal pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574128>Pyk2-dependent phosphorylation of LSR enhances localization of LSR and tricellulin at tricellular .</a></h2><p> (TJs) are cellular  within the mammalian epithelial cell sheet that function as a physical barrier to molecular transport within the intercellular space. Dysregulation of TJs leads to various diseases. Tricellular TJs (tTJs), specialized structural variants of TJs, are formed by multiple transmembrane proteins (e.g., lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor [LSR] and tricellulin) within tricellular contacts in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet. However, the mechanism for recruiting LSR and tricellulin to tTJs is largely unknown. Previous studies have identified that tyrphostin 9, the dual inhibitor of Pyk2 (a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase) and receptor tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suppresses LSR and tricellulin recruitment to tTJs in EpH4 (a mouse mammary epithelial cell line) cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Pyk2 inhibition on LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs. Pyk2 inactivation by its specific inhibitor or repression by RNAi inhibited the localization of LSR and downstream tricellulin to tTJs without changing their expression level in EpH4 cells. Pyk2-dependent changes in subcellular LSR and tricellulin localization were independent of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and expression. Additionally, Pyk2-dependent LSR phosphorylation at Tyr-237 was required for LSR and tricellulin localization to tTJs and decreased epithelial barrier function. Our findings indicated a novel mechanism by which Pyk2 regulates tTJ assembly and epithelial barrier function in the mammalian epithelial cell sheet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665089>Impact of Docetaxel on blood-brain barrier function and formation of breast cancer brain metastases.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent malignant tumor in females and the 2nd most common cause of brain metastasis (BM), that are associated with a fatal prognosis. The increasing incidence from 10% up to 40% is due to more effective treatments of extracerebral sites with improved prognosis and increasing use of MRI in diagnostics. A frequently administered, potent chemotherapeutic group of drugs for BC treatment are taxanes usually used in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, which, however, have been suspected to be associated with a higher incidence of BM. The aim of our study was to experimentally analyze the impact of the taxane docetaxel (DTX) on brain metastasis formation, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism.A monocentric patient cohort was analyzed to determine the association of taxane treatment and BM formation. To identify the specific impact of DTX, a murine brain metastatic model upon intracardial injection of breast cancer cells was conducted. To approach the functional mechanism, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and electron microscopy of mice as well as in-vitro transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and tracer permeability assays using brain endothelial cells (EC) were carried out. PCR-based, immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses with additional RNA sequencing of murine and human ECs were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by DTX treatment.Taxane treatment was associated with an increased rate of BM formation in the patient cohort and the murine metastatic model. Functional studies did not show unequivocal alterations of blood-brain barrier properties upon DTX treatment in-vivo, but in-vitro assays revealed a temporary DTX-related barrier disruption. We found disturbance of tubulin structure and upregulation of  marker claudin-5 in ECs. Furthermore, upregulation of several members of the tubulin family and downregulation of tetraspanin-2 in both, murine and human ECs, was induced.In summary, a higher incidence of BM was associated with prior taxane treatment in both a patient cohort and a murine mouse model. We could identify tubulin family members and tetraspanin-2 as potential contributors for the destabilization of the blood-brain barrier. Further analyses are needed to decipher the exact role of those alterations on tumor metastatic processes in the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574316>Repetitive magnetic stimulation protects corneal epithelium in a rabbit model of short-term exposure keratopathy.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) on corneal epithelial permeability in a rabbit model of exposure keratopathy.61 female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were treated on one eye with repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) at a frequency of 20 Hz for 15 min. The other eye was untreated. Rabbit eyes were kept open for 2 h to induce acute corneal desiccation. The extent of fluorescein corneal staining was evaluated using EpiView software and the concentration of fluorescein in the anterior chamber was determined by a fluorometer. Safety was evaluated by electroretinogram, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and histopathology. Expression pattern of corneal cell markers was determined by immunofluorescence.A significant decrease in fluorescein concentration in the anterior chamber (146.5 ± 18.6 ng/ml vs. 54 ± 8.4 ng/ml p = 0.000001) and in corneal surface fluorescein staining score (1.7 ± 0.2 vs. 4.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.00001) was obtained in RMS-treated eyes compared with control eyes, respectively. RMS treatment reduced by nearly 4 fold the percentage of corneal area with epithelial erosions by Anterior segment OCT. The therapeutic effect was maintained for at least 3 months. Increased expression of epithelial  protein Zo-1 was observed in treated eyes. SD-OCT and histopathology analysis revealed no pathological changes in the treated or non-treated eyes.RMS treatment decreases epithelial corneal erosions in a rabbit model of exposure keratopathy, with no indication of pathological changes.

Aberrant autophagy also contributes to AMD pathology, as autophagy maintains RPE homeostasis to ensure blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity and protect photoreceptors. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) promotes cellular oxidative stress by inhibiting thioredoxin reducing capacity and is in turn inversely regulated by reactive oxygen species levels; however, its role in oxidative stress-induced RPE cell dysfunction and the mechanistic link between TXNIP and autophagy are largely unknown. Here, we observed that TXNIP expression was rapidly downregulated in RPE cells under oxidative stress and that RPE cell proliferation was decreased. TXNIP knockdown demonstrated that the suppression of proliferation resulted from TXNIP depletion-induced autophagic flux, causing increased p53 activation via nuclear localization, which in turn enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and activation. Moreover, TXNIP downregulation further negatively impacted BRB integrity by disrupting RPE cell  and enhancing cell motility by phosphorylating, and thereby activating, Src kinase. Finally, we also revealed that TXNIP knockdown upregulated HIF-1α, leading to the enhanced secretion of VEGF from RPE cells and the stimulation of angiogenesis in cocultured human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. This suggests that the exposure of RPE cells to sustained oxidative stress may promote choroidal neovascularization, another AMD pathology. Together, these findings reveal three distinct mechanisms by which TXNIP downregulation disrupts RPE cell function and thereby exacerbates AMD pathogenesis. Accordingly, reinforcing or restoring BRB integrity by targeting TXNIP may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing or attenuating photoreceptor damage in AMD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608059>Exploiting the Zonulin Mouse Model to Establish the Role of Primary Impaired Gut Barrier Function on Microbiota Composition and Immune Profiles.</a></h2><p>The balanced interplay between epithelial barrier, immune system, and microbiota maintains gut homeostasis, while disruption of this interplay may lead to inflammation. Paracellular permeability is governed by intercellular  (TJs). Zonulin is, to date, the only known physiological regulator of intestinal TJs. We used a zonulin transgenic mouse (Ztm) model characterized by increased small intestinal permeability to elucidate the role of a primary impaired gut barrier on microbiome composition and/or immune profile. Ztm exhibit an altered gene expression profile of TJs in the gut compared to wild-type mice (WT): Claudin-15, Claudin-5, Jam-3, and Myosin-1C are decreased in the male duodenum whereas Claudin-15, Claudin-7, and ZO-2 are reduced in the female colon. These results are compatible with loss of gut barrier function and are paralleled by an altered microbiota composition with reduced abundance of the genus , known to have positive effects on gut barrier integrity and strengthening, and an increased abundance of the  genus, associated to low-grade inflammatory conditions. Immune profile analysis shows a subtly skewed distribution of immune cell subsets toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with more IL-17 producing adaptive and innate-like T cells in Ztm. Interestingly, microbiota "normalization" involving the transfer of WT microbiota into Ztm, did not rescue the altered immune profile. Our data suggest that a primary impaired gut barrier causing an uncontrolled trafficking of microbial products leads to a latent pro-inflammatory status, with a skewed microbiota composition and immune profile that, in the presence of an environmental trigger, as we have previously described (1), might promote the onset of overt inflammation and an increased risk of chronic disease.Copyright © 2019 Miranda-Ribera, Ennamorati, Serena, Cetinbas, Lan, Sadreyev, Jain, Fasano and Fiorentino.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572598>Effect of arabinoxylan on colonic bacterial metabolites and mucosal barrier in high-fat diet-induced rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of arabinoxylan on colonic mucosal barrier and metabolomic profiles in high-fat diet-induced rats.

Results showed that feeding AXD reduced serum lipopolysaccharide in rats after 5 weeks. In colonic digesta,  population was reduced, while ,  and  populations were increased in AXD group. Metabolomics assay found that the different abundances of 84 metabolites were observed, involving lipid, carbohydrate, and nitrogenous metabolism in colonic digesta. In colonic mucosa, AXD up-regulated gene level of -related proteins. Meanwhile, lower TNF-α and IL-1β levels were related to TLR4/NF-κB/MyD88 pathway in AXD group.

We previously reported that colon cancer-derived EVs contain abundant miR-92a-3p and have a pro-angiogenic function. We previously identified Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3) as a direct target of miR-92a-3p; however, the pro-angiogenic function of miR-92a-3p cannot only be attributed to downregulation of Dkk-3. Therefore, the complete molecular mechanism by which miR-92a-3p exerts pro-angiogenic effects is still unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the gene sets affected by ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p in endothelial cells to elucidate processes underlying EV-induced angiogenesis. We found that the ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p upregulated cell cycle- and mitosis-related gene expression and downregulated adhesion-related gene expression in endothelial cells. We also identified a novel target gene of miR-92a-3p, claudin-11. Claudin-11 belongs to the claudin gene family, which encodes essential components expressed at  (TJs). Disruption of TJs with a concomitant loss of claudin expression is a significant event in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

But drug resistance will inevitably occur, thereby causing increased tumor invasion and metastasis. Claudin-5 (CLDN5) is a protein member of  (TJ) structures expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells and confirmed to be involved in the proliferation and leakage of endothelial cells (ECs) and malignant metastases. This study aimed to investigate how bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) neutralizing antibody applied in clinic, affects the  protein CLDN5 and subsequently influences tumor cell invasion and potential metastasis. Western-blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that low-dose bevacizumab up-regulated CLDN5, whereas high-dose bevacizumab down-regulated CLDN5. Cell migration, invasion and permeation assay demonstrated that high-dose bevacizumab enhanced the migration, invasion and permeation abilities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The migration and permeation abilities of HUVECs were also enhanced by silencing the CLDN5 expression. CLDN5 was regulated by JNK, PI3K and transforming growth factor-β-1 (TGFβ1), and these findings were confirmed by the inhibitor or siRNA of JNK, PI3K and TGFβ1. Our data indicated that high-dose bevacizumab likely increased tumor invasion and potential metastatic abilities by down-regulating CLDN5, which was down regulated by TGFβ1. Low-dose bevacizumab increased CLDN5 expression by up-regulating PI3K and JNK expression.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493389>Phenotypic characteristics of human bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells in vitro support cell effectiveness for repair of the blood-spinal cord barrier in ALS.</a></h2><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was recently recognized as a neurovascular disease. Accumulating evidence demonstrated blood-spinal-cord barrier (BSCB) impairment mainly via endothelial cell (EC) degeneration in ALS patients and animal models. BSCB repair may be a therapeutic approach for ALS. We showed benefits of human bone marrow endothelial progenitor cell (hBMEPC) transplantation into symptomatic ALS mice on barrier restoration; however, cellular mechanisms remain unclear. The study aimed to characterize hBMEPCs in vitro under normogenic conditions. hBMEPCs were cultured at different time points. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concentrations of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A, angiogenin-1, and endoglin) and angiogenic inhibitor endostatin in conditioned media. Double immunocytochemical staining for CD105, ZO-1, and occludin with F-actin was performed. Results showed predominantly gradual significant post-culture increases of VEGF-A and angiogenin-1 levels. Cultured cells displayed distinct rounded or elongated cellular morphologies and positively immunoexpressed for CD105, indicating EC phenotype. Cytoskeletal F-actin filaments were re-arranged according to cell morphologies. Immunopositive expressions for ZO-1 were detected near inner cell membrane and for occludin on cell membrane surface of adjacent hBMEPCs. Together, secretion of angiogenic factors by cultured cells provides evidence for a potential mechanism underlying endogenous EC repair in ALS through hBMEPC transplantation, leading to restored barrier integrity. Also, ZO-1 and occludin immunoexpressions, confirming hBMEPC interactions in vitro, may reflect post-transplant cell actions in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Greater understanding is required of the underlying relationships in ischemic brains in order to prevent stroke or to develop effective treatment. This review highlights new findings about the relationship of blood-brain barrier with astrocytes, pentraxin-3 (PTX3), and other factors expressed during or after ischemic stroke. These are discussed with respect to their ameliorative or deleterious effects. These effects are measured  in animal models as well as  in cell cultures. Evidence was found to suggest that astrocytes play a key role in stroke by expressing PTX3, which, in turn, enhances endothelial tightness, increases  proteins, and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor. The role of astrocytes and PTX3 is examined in relation to hypoxic stress and conditioning as well as mitochondrial transfer. Astrocytes and PTX3 are placed in the context of brain circulation and related areas.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646055>Co-cultured microfluidic model of the airway optimized for microscopy and micro-optical coherence tomography imaging.</a></h2><p>We have developed a human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell and endothelial cell co-cultured microfluidic model to mimic the  human airway.

CAR is involved in the formation of epithelial  and promotes tumor growth in some cancers. Previously, we developed mouse monoclonal antibodies against human CAR and found that one, mu6G10A, significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenografts of human cancer cells. Herein, we generated and characterized a mouse-human chimeric anti-CAR antibody (ch6G10A) from mu6G10A. ch6G10A had binding activity, inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and in vivo anti-tumor activity against CAR-expressing prostate cancer DU-145 cells. In addition, cancer tissue array analysis confirmed that CAR is highly expressed in neuroendocrine lung cancers including small cell lung cancer, and treatment with ch6G10A effectively inhibited in vivo subcutaneous tumor growth of NCI-H69 small cell lung cancer cells in nude mice. Moreover, treatment with mu6G10A effectively inhibited both in vivo orthotopic tumor growth and distant metastatic formation in mouse xenograft models of a highly metastatic subline of human small cell lung cancer DMS273 cells.

Given its bioactivity, there is much interest in the potential use of bovine colostrum to improve human gastrointestinal health throughout the life span. There is evidence that bovine colostrum is effective at improving small intestinal barrier integrity and some indication that it may alter colonic motility. However, for colostrum to be used as a product to improve intestinal health, it needs to be bioactive after processing. The aim of this study was to determine whether industrial processing of bovine colostrum affects its ability to improve small intestinal barrier integrity or alter distal colon motility. Three colostrum sample types were compared; raw whole colostrum powder (WCP), raw skim colostrum powder (SCP), and industrially produced colostrum milk protein concentrate (CMPC). To determine whether these colostrum powders had different effects on small intestinal barrier integrity, their effects on the transepithelial electrical resistance across an in vitro intestinal epithelial layer (Caco-2 cells) were measured, both with and without a challenge from the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. These results showed that CMPC enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance across unchallenged epithelial cell layers, whereas the raw colostrum samples, WCP and SCP, did not have an effect. The colostrum samples were also compared to determine how they affect contractility in the distal colon isolated from the rat. Skim colostrum powder was the only sample to act directly on colonic tissue to modulate motility, increasing the amplitude of contractions. The results show that bovine colostrum is able to improve small intestinal barrier integrity and alter colon motility, and they implicate different components. The barrier integrity enhancement was apparent only in the industrial CMPC, which may have been due to the increase in protein concentration or the release of small peptides as a result of processing. The ability to alter colon motility was present in SCP but absent in WCP, again implying that an increase in protein concentration is responsible for the effect. However, this effect was not apparent for the industrially processed CMPC, suggesting denaturation or degradation of the active component. The beneficial effect of colostrum on small intestinal barrier integrity was present after processing, confirming that it is feasible to industrially produce an active product for gut health.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a promising cytokine that is critical in protecting the lung during infection. This cytokine is strongly regulated by the soluble receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP), which is constitutively expressed in the lungs where it inhibits IL-22 activity. The IL-22/IL-22BP axis is thought to prevent chronic exposure of epithelial cells to IL-22. However, the importance of this axis is not understood during an infection such as influenza. Here we demonstrate through the use of IL-22BP-knockout mice (il-22ra2) that a pro-IL-22 environment reduces pulmonary inflammation during H1N1 (PR8/34 H1N1) infection and protects the lung by promoting  formation. We confirmed these results in normal human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro demonstrating improved membrane resistance and induction of the  proteins Cldn4, Tjp1, and Tjp2. Importantly, we show that administering recombinant IL-22 in vivo reduces inflammation and fluid leak into the lung. Taken together, our results demonstrate the IL-22/IL-22BP axis is a potential targetable pathway for reducing influenza-induced pneumonia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515728>Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) Attenuates Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, Complement Activation and Cell Death in Brain Endothelial Cells Following OGD/Reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Brain endothelial cells play an important role in maintaining blood flow homeostasis in the brain. Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/reperfusion promote cell death and BBB breakdown in brain endothelial cells. Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), a biologically active phytoconstituent of the medicinal plant Boswellia serrata, has been shown to be protective against various inflammatory diseases as well as ischemic brain injury. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial characteristics of AKBA are poorly understood. We subjected bEND.3 cells to OGD/reperfusion to investigate the protective role of AKBA in this model. We found that AKBA treatment attenuated endothelial cell death and oxidative stress assessed by means of TUNEL assay, cleaved-caspase-3, and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, OGD downregulated  proteins ZO-1 and Occludin levels, and increased the expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, ICAM-1, and complement C3a receptor (C3aR). We also noticed the increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in bEND.3 cells in OGD group. AKBA treatment significantly attenuated expression levels of these inflammatory proteins and prevented the degradation of ZO-1 and Occludin following OGD. In conclusion, AKBA treatment provides protection against endothelial cell dysfunction following OGD by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642122>Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide may affect the endothelial barrier and IL-10 expression of apolipoprotein B100-pulsed dendritic cells.</a></h2><p>Atherogenesis is associated with chronic gut infections; however, the mechanisms are not clear. The aim of the study was to determine whether lipopolysaccharide of E. coli (E. coli LPS) may affect endothelial barrier and modify IL-10 expression in dendritic cells (DCs). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and monocyte-derived DCs were treated with E. coli LPS, apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kCH) - harmful oxidized form of cholesterol. The effect of E. coli LPS, 7-kCH and ApoB100 on the barrier functions of HUVECs in real-time cell electric impedance sensing system (RTCA-DP) was assessed. Furthermore, the effect of 7-kCH and ApoB100 on barrier functions of HUVECs co-cultured with DCs previously treated with LPS was analyzed. Both E. coli LPS and 7-kCH decreased barrier functions of HUVECs and reduced  proteins mRNA expression, whereas ApoB100 increased endothelial barrier. In DCs, ApoB100 and E. coli LPS decreased IL-10 mRNA expression. In HUVECs co-cultured with DCs treated with LPS and subsequently pulsed with ApoB100 or 7-kCH IL-10 mRNA expression was lower. E. coli LPS-exposed DCs diminished the protective effect of ApoB100 on endothelial integrity and led to the decrease of occludin mRNA expression. LPS potentially derived from gut microflora may destabilize endothelial barrier together with oxidized cholesterol and intensify the immunogenicity of ApoB100.© 2019 APMIS.

Although the mechanisms of polarization remain mostly unknown, they are fundamental for homeostasis of the outer retina. Recent research is revealing a growing picture of interconnected tissues in the outer retina, with the retinal pigment epithelium at the center. This review discusses how elements of epithelial polarity relate to emerging apical interactions with the neural retina, basolateral cross-talk with the underlying Bruch's membrane and choriocapillaris, and  biology. An integrated view of outer retina physiology is likely to provide insights into the pathogenesis of blinding diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These effects have been speculated to occur via the gut microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and  (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal epithelium was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal SCFA content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the gut microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of SCFA-producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other probiotics including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Gain of TRPC6 function and loss of podocin function induce podocyte injury. We have previously shown that high glucose induces apoptosis of podocytes by activating TRPC6; however, whether the activated TRPC6 can alter podocin expression remains unknown. Western blot, confocal microscopy, and scanning ion conductance microscopy were used to examine both the expression levels of TRPC6, podocin, and nephrin and the morphological change of podocytes in response to high glucose. High glucose increased the expression of TRPC6, but reduced the expression of podocin and nephrin, both in cultured human podocytes and in type 1 diabetic rat kidney. The decreased podocin was diminished in TRPC6 knockdown podocytes. High glucose elevated intracellular calcium in control podocytes, but not in TRPC6 knockdown podocytes. High glucose also elevated the expression of a  protein, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and induced the redistribution of ZO-1 and the loss of podocyte processes. These data together suggest that high glucose reduces the protein levels of podocin by activating TRPC6 and induces morphological changes of cultured podocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559425>Drug Abuse-Related Neuroinflammation in Human Postmortem Brains: An Immunohistochemical Approach.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate blood-brain barrier alterations, neuroinflammation, and glial responses in drug abusers. Five immunohistochemical markers (CD3, zonula occludens-1 [ZO-1], intracellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM-1], and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) were assessed on postmortem brain samples collected from drug abusers who died from acute intoxication of cocaine, heroin, or a combination of both, compared with controls. CD3 and ICAM-1 immunopositivity were significantly stronger in drug abusers than in controls. VCAM-1 immunopositivity was similar across drug abuser and control groups. In heroin abusers, significantly lower ZO-1 immunopositivity was observed relative to controls. GFAP positivity did not show significant differences between groups, but its distribution within the brain did differ. Both cocaine and heroin abuse promoted neuroinflammation, increasing expression of ICAM-1 and recruiting CD3+ lymphocytes. Heroin affected the molecular integrity of , as reflected by reduced ZO-1 expression. The outcomes of the present study are, overall, consistent with prior available evidence, which is almost exclusively from studies conducted in vitro or in animal models. These findings provide important information about the downstream consequences of neuroinflammation in drug abusers and may help to inform the development of potential therapeutic targets.© 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Here, we provide evidence that a missense FHHNC mutation c.908C>G (p.T303R) in the claudin-16 gene interferes with the phosphorylation in the claudin-16 protein. The claudin-16 protein carrying phosphorylation at residue T303 is localized in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) but not in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the mouse kidney. The phosphomimetic claudin-16 protein carrying the T303E mutation but not the wildtype claudin-16 or the T303R mutant protein increases the Trpv5 channel conductance and membrane abundance in human kidney cells. Phosphorylated claudin-16 and Trpv5 are colocalized in the luminal membrane of the mouse DCT tubule; phosphomimetic claudin-16 and Trpv5 interact in the yeast and mammalian cell membranes. Knockdown of claudin-16 gene expression in transgenic mouse kidney delocalizes Trpv5 from the luminal membrane in the DCT. Unlike wildtype claudin-16, phosphomimetic claudin-16 is delocalized from the  but relocated to the apical membrane in renal epithelial cells because of diminished binding affinity to ZO-1. High-Ca diet reduces the phosphorylation of claudin-16 protein at T303 in the DCT of mouse kidney via the PTH signaling cascade. Knockout of the PTH receptor, PTH1R, from the mouse kidney abrogates the claudin-16 phosphorylation at T303. Together, these results suggest a pathogenic mechanism for FHHNC involving transcellular Ca pathway in the DCT and identify a molecular component in renal Ca homeostasis under direct regulation of PTH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604003>AICAR-induced activation of AMPK inhibits the migration of TSCC cells by targeting ZO-1.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of AMPK on  (TJ) components, ZO-1 and F-actin, and the underlying mechanisms of AMPK in inhibiting migration of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cells.Expression and distribution of mRNA and/or protein was detected by qRT-PCR, western blot or immunofluorescence. The migration ability was tested by scratch and transwell migration assays. Transient knockdown of ZO-1 was achieved by siRNA transfection.AMPK can be activated within both short-time (90 min) and long-time (24 or 48 h) treatment with AICAR. Cell migration was inhibited after AMPK activation. ZO-1 was translocated from cytoplasm to perimembrane and distributed continuously after short-time activation of AMPK. However, the continuous distribution of ZO-1 was broken up after long-time activation of AMPK, as well as F-actin, accompanied by shortened and decreased filopodia. ZO-1 expression and Cofilin activity was upregulated by long-time activation of AMPK, and the inhibitory effect on migration and upregulation of Cofilin activity of AMPK was partially reversed by knockdown of ZO-1.AICAR induced activation of AMPK could greatly damage to the structure of TJ and inhibited the migration of TSCC cells through the abnormal increase and redistribution of ZO-1 and ZO-1/Cofilin mediated depolymerization of F-actin.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and function of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-2, a  protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut barrier function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of seasonal variation on the cell ultrastructure and ion transport protein activity of MRCs during hibernation and non-hibernation of Chinese soft-shelled turtle's intestine. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that, during hibernation the high-density cytoplasm of MRCs occupied large cross-sectional area and showed heterogeneous abundance of mitochondria and an expanded extensive tubular system as compared to non-hibernation. During hibernation the cytoplasm of MRCs exhibited more mitochondrial vacuolization, autophagosomes, phagophore formation and well-structured endoplasmic reticulum. During hibernation, MRCs connected with absorptive cells through wide interdigitation, and created  and more desmosomes as compared to non-hibernation. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence showed, the strong immunopositive reactions and immunosignaling of Na/K-ATPase (NKA) and Na/K/2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) at basolateral region of mucosal surface of intestine during hibernation. However, weak immunopositive reactions and immunosignaling of NKA and NKCC during non-hibernation. The statistical analysis showed that the number and size of MRCs with NKA-associated immunoreactivity were significantly increased during hibernation. NKA and NKCC mRNA expression was significantly increased during hibernation via qPCR. Further confirmed, the intensity of NKA and NKCC proteins was more elevated during hibernation than non-hibernation shown by immunobloting. However, the concentrations of the plasma ions Na and Cl- were significantly higher during hibernation; conversely, K concentration was significantly higher during non-hibernation. The findings suggest that the potential role of MRCs is affected by seasonal fluctuations, during which intestinal homeostasis and hydromineral balance are essential for turtles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These forces alter both structure and function. While precise recapitulation of the complex mechanobiology of organs remains challenging, better understanding of the effect of mechanical stimuli is necessary towards the development of biorelevant in vitro models. This is especially relevant to organs-on-chip models which allow for fine control of the culture environment. In this study, the effects of the FSS on Caco-2 cell monolayers were systematically determined using a microfluidic device based on Hele-Shaw geometry. This approach allowed for a physiologically relevant range of FSS (from ∼0 to 0.03 dyn/cm) to be applied to the cells within a single device. Exposure to microfluidic FSS induced significant phenotypical and functional changes in Caco-2 cell monolayers as compared to cells grown in static conditions. The application of FSS significantly altered the production of mucus, expression of , vacuolization, organization of cytoskeleton, formation of microvilli, mitochondrial activity and expression of cytochrome P450. In the context of the intestinal epithelium, this detailed understanding of the effects of the FSS will enable the realization of in vitro organs-on-chip models with well-defined and tailored characteristics to a specific purpose, including for drug and nanoparticle absorption studies.

Loss of CDX2 has been shown to associate with poor clinical outcome and predict benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II and III colorectal carcinoma. The prognostic relevance of CDX2 in stage II disease has not been sufficiently validated, especially in relation to clinical risk factors, such as microsatellite instability (MSI) status, BRAF mutation status, and tumor budding. In this study, we evaluated the protein expression of CDX2 in tumor center and front areas in a tissue microarrays material of stage II colorectal carcinoma patients (n=232). CDX2 expression showed a partial or total loss in respective areas in 8.6% and 10.9% of patient cases. Patients with loss of CDX2 had shorter disease-specific survival when scored independently either in tumor center or tumor front areas (log rank P=0.012; P=0.012). Loss of CDX2 predicted survival independently of other stage II risk factors, such as MSI status and BRAF mutation status, pT class, and tumor budding (hazard ratio=5.96, 95% confidence interval=1.55-22.95; hazard ratio=3.70, 95% confidence interval=1.30-10.56). Importantly, CDX2 loss predicted inferior survival only in patients with microsatellite stable, but not with MSI-high phenotype. Interestingly, CDX2 loss associated with low E-cadherin expression,  disruption, and high expression of ezrin protein. The work demonstrates that loss of CDX2 is an independent risk factor of poor disease-specific survival in stage II colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, the study suggests that CDX2 loss is linked with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition independently of tumor budding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586867>Oxidative stress mediates heat-induced changes of  proteins in porcine sertoli cells via inhibiting CaMKKβ-AMPK pathway.</a></h2><p>Heat stress causes reversible changes in  proteins in immature Sertoli cells via inhibition of the AMPK signaling pathway; these effects are accompanied by an increase in the early apoptotic rate and decrease in the cell viability of Sertoli cells. Since heat stress is known to also cause oxidative damage, in the present study, we investigated whether the earlier mentioned effects of heat stress were brought about via the induction of oxidative stress in boar Sertoli cells. Immature Sertoli cells obtained from 3-week-old piglets were subjected to heat treatment (43 °C, 30 min), and the percentage of ROS-positive cells, the malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration, and the activity of the antioxidases, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Next, the Sertoli cells were treated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) (1 mmol/L, 2 h), an antioxidant agent, before they were exposed to heat stress. The effects of NAC on ROS accumulation, MDA levels, antioxidase activity, the CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway and expression of  proteins were assessed. The results showed that heat stress reversibly increased the percentage of ROS-positive cells and MDA levels, and decreased the activity of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT. Pretreatment with NAC abrogated these effects of heat stress. Additionally, NAC reversed the heat stress-induced decrease in the expression of CaMKKβ and dephosphorylation of AMPK. NAC also obviously rescued the heat stress-induced downregulation of  proteins (claudin-11, JAM-A, occludin, and ZO-1) both at the mRNA and protein level. In conclusion, the findings indicate that oxidative damage participates in heat stress-induced downregulation of  proteins in Sertoli cells by inhibiting the CaMKKβ-AMPK axis. Further, NAC reversed the effects of heat stress on  proteins; this means that it has potential as a protective agent that can prevent reproductive dysfunction in boars under conditions of heat stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although the previously mentioned molecules reflect the appreciable contributions both adherens  and  are believed to have in endothelial cell intercellular stresses, in doing so they also reveal the obscure relationship that exists between gap  and intercellular stresses. Therefore, to bring clarity to this relationship we disrupted expression of the endothelial gap  connexin 43 (Cx43) by exposing confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to a low (0.2 μg/mL) and high (2 μg/mL) concentration of 2,5-dihydroxychalcone (chalcone), a known Cx43 inhibitor. To evaluate the impact Cx43 disruption had on endothelial cell mechanics we utilized traction force microscopy and monolayer stress microscopy to measure cell-substrate tractions and cell-cell intercellular stresses, respectively. HUVEC monolayers exposed to a low concentration of chalcone produced average normal intercellular stresses that were on average 17% higher relative to control, while exposure to a high concentration of chalcone yielded average normal intercellular stresses that were on average 55% lower when compared to control HUVEC monolayers. HUVEC maximum shear intercellular stresses were observed to decrease by 16% (low chalcone concentration) and 66% (high chalcone concentration), while tractions exhibited an almost 2-fold decrease under high chalcone concentration. In addition, monolayer cell velocities were observed to decrease by 19% and 35% at low chalcone and high chalcone concentrations, respectively. Strain energies were also observed to decrease by 32% and 85% at low and high concentration of chalcone treatment, respectively, when compared to control. The findings we present here reveal for the first time the contribution Cx43 has to endothelial biomechanics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31570498>Hepatic Bile Formation: Canalicular osmolarity and paracellular and transcellular water flow.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this minireview is to indicate that a new paradigm is developing regarding hepatic bile flow. The focus thus far has been on the carrier-mediated transport of bile acids and other solutes, such as glutathione, which create an osmotic gradient for the transcellular and paracellular flow of water into canaliculi. In addition to the physico-chemical properties of the bile acids, which govern the osmotic gradient, data now exists that the , governing paracellular water flow, and Aquaporin-8 water channels, governing transcellular water flow, are regulated independently. Thus, the rate of water flow into the canaliculus in response to bile acid transport is variable and determines canalicular bile acid concentration, which affects the production and solubilization of cholesterol-lecithin vesicles. These new considerations modify thinking regarding the occurrence of cholestasis and its progression and re-orient the design of experimental studies that can distinguish the different determinants of bile flow. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The paradigm that water flow into the canaliculus is determined only by the rate of carrier-mediated transport has been challenged recently by the changes that occur in hepatic bile composition in the Claudin-2 knockout mouse and with the cholestatic effect of estradiol 17-D-glucuronide. Thus, respectively, a reduction in paracellular or transcellular canalicular water flow, probably via Aquaporin 8, has no significant effect on bile acid excretion.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559977>Clostridium tyrobutyricum alleviates Staphylococcus aureus-induced endometritis in mice by inhibiting endometrial barrier disruption and inflammatory response.</a></h2><p>Endometritis is an inflammatory disease of the uterus caused by bacterial infection, and it affects both human and animal health. This study aims to investigate the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of probiotics such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum (C. tyrobutyricum) on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced endometritis. The results showed that S. aureus infection significantly induced the pathological damage of the uterus, increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and attenuated the expression of  proteins of uterine tissues. However, C. tyrobutyricum pretreatment obviously reduced the inflammatory response and reversed the changes of  proteins of the uterus induced by S. aureus. Together, the data showed that C. tyrobutyricum also inhibited the expression of the TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway and HDAC induced by S. aureus. In addition, the treatment of mice with live C. tyrobutyricum, spent culture supernatants (SCS) from C. tyrobutyricum, rather than inactive C. tyrobutyricum, inhibited the inflammatory response induced by S. aureus. Through further research, we found that the levels of butyrate in both blood and uterine tissues of mice treated with C. tyrobutyricum were significantly increased. These findings underscore the protective effect of C. tyrobutyricum on endometritis by enhancing the uterus barrier integrity and inhibiting the inflammatory response. The anti-inflammatory mechanism may occur through the regulation of the expression of TLR2/NF-κB and HDAC, and C. tyrobutyricum can be a potentially therapeutic candidate for the treatment of endometritis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633685>A Simple Approach to Perform TEER Measurements Using a Self-Made Volt-Amperemeter with Programmable Output Frequency.</a></h2><p>Transepithelial/endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) has been used since the 1980s to determine confluency and permeability of in vitro barrier model systems. In most cases, chopstick electrodes are used to determine the electric impedance between the upper and lower compartment of a cell culture filter insert system containing cellular monolayers. The filter membrane allows the cells to adhere, polarize, and interact by building . This technique has been described with a variety of different cell lines (e.g., cells of the blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, or gastrointestinal and pulmonary tract). TEER measurement devices can be readily obtained from different laboratory equipment suppliers. However, there are more cost-effective and customizable solutions imaginable if an appropriate voltammeter is self-assembled. The overall aim of this publication is to set up a reliable device with programmable output frequency that can be used with commercially available chopstick electrodes for TEER measurement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635790>Mechanosensitive  Remodeling Promotes Robust Epithelial Morphogenesis.</a></h2><p>Morphogenesis of epithelial tissues requires  spatiotemporal coordination of cell shape changes. In vivo, many tissue-scale shape changes are driven by pulsatile contractions of intercellular , which are rectified to produce irreversible deformations. The functional role of this pulsatory ratchet and its mechanistic basis remain unknown. Here we combine theory and biophysical experiments to show that mechanosensitive tension remodeling of epithelial cell  promotes robust epithelial shape changes via ratcheting. Using optogenetic control of actomyosin contractility, we find that epithelial  show elastic behavior under low contractile stress, returning to their original lengths after contraction, but undergo irreversible deformation under higher magnitudes of contractile stress. Existing vertex-based models for the epithelium are unable to capture these results, with cell  displaying purely elastic or fluid-like behaviors, depending on the choice of model parameters. To describe the experimental results, we propose a modified vertex model with two essential ingredients for  mechanics: thresholded tension remodeling and continuous strain relaxation. First,  must overcome a critical strain threshold to trigger tension remodeling, resulting in irreversible  length changes. Second, there is a continuous relaxation of junctional strain that removes mechanical memory from the system. This enables pulsatile contractions to further remodel cell shape via mechanical ratcheting. Taken together, the combination of mechanosensitive tension remodeling and junctional strain relaxation provides a robust mechanism for large-scale morphogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Biophysical Society.

It is in close contact with the gut microbiota on its luminal side and with the enteric neurons on the tissue side. Both microbiota and the enteric nervous system are regulatory housekeepers of the intestinal barrier. Therefore, the recently observed enteric neuropathology along with gut dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease have prompted research on intestinal permeability in this neurodegenerative disorder.

Acarbose is an α-glucosidase inhibitor that suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia, however, the cardiovascular protection of acarbose has still remained controversial. NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediated  disruption, a hallmark event of endothelial barrier dysfunction leading to endothelial hyperpermeability in diabetes. Given the anti-inflammatory property of acarbose, it was investigated that acarbose protected against vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in vascular endothelial cells in T2DM rats. The rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were incubated with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) for 24 h in vitro. It was found that HG significantly induced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which was markedly blocked by acarbose treatment. Furthermore, acarbose blocked the Nox4-dependent superoxide (O) generation, which regulated NLRP3 inflammasome in RAECs. Importantly, we found that acarbose remarkably enhanced the  protein expression of ZO-1 and VE-Cadherin and consequently abolished vascular hyperpermeability, which was associated with inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in RAECs. In vivo, acarbose intervention relieved vascular leakage in the heart of diabetic rats injected with Evans blue dye and the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine, which was accompanied with the restoration of ZO-1, VE-Cadherin, Nox4 and NLRP3 inflammasome in the aortal endothelium of diabetic rats. Taken together, our data indicated that acarbose ameliorated endothelial barrier dysfunction by directly inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome which was dependent on inhibiting Nox4 oxidase-dependent O production. These properties might carry a potential significance for acarbose in cardiovascular protection in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have investigated here if (+)-catechin (CAT) and procyanidin B (PB), two main dietary polyphenols, protect the barrier function of intestinal cells undergoing inflammatory stress. The cell model adopted consisted of co-cultured Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells, while inflammatory conditions were mimicked through the incubation of epithelial cells with the conditioned medium of activated macrophages (MCM). The epithelial barrier function was monitored through trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and ROS production was assessed with dichlorofluorescein, while the expression of -junctional proteins and signal transduction pathways were evaluated with Western blot. The results indicated that MCM produced significant oxidative stress, the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, a decrease in occludin and ZO-1 expression, and an increase in claudin-7 (CL-7) expression, while TEER was markedly lowered. Neither CAT nor PB prevented oxidative stress, transduction pathways activation, ZO-1 suppression, or TEER decrease. However, PB prevented the decrease in occludin expression and both polyphenols produced a huge increase in CL-7 abundance. It is concluded that, under the conditions adopted, CAT and PB do not prevent inflammation-dependent impairment of the epithelial barrier function of intestinal cell monolayers. However, the two compounds modify the expression of -junctional proteins and, in particular, markedly increase the expression of CL-7. These insights add to a better understanding of the potential biological activity of these major dietary flavan-3-ols at intestinal level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581662>Temporal Effects of Quercetin on  Barrier Properties and Claudin Expression and Localization in MDCK II Cells.</a></h2><p> Kidney stones affect 10% of the population. Yet, there is relatively little known about how they form or how to prevent and treat them. The claudin family of  proteins has been linked to the formation of kidney stones. The flavonoid quercetin has been shown to prevent kidney stone formation and to modify claudin expression in different models. Here we investigate the effect of quercetin on claudin expression and localization in MDCK II cells, a cation-selective cell line, derived from the proximal tubule. For this study, we focused our analyses on claudin family members that confer different  properties: barrier-sealing (Cldn1, -3, and -7), cation-selective (Cldn2) or anion-selective (Cldn4). Our data revealed that quercetin's effects on the expression and localization of different claudins over time corresponded with changes in transepithelial resistance, which was measured continuously throughout the treatment. In addition, these effects appear to be independent of PI3K/AKT signaling, one of the pathways that is known to act downstream of quercetin. In conclusion, our data suggest that quercetin's effects on claudins result in a tighter epithelial barrier, which may reduce the reabsorption of sodium, calcium and water, thereby preventing the formation of a kidney stone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31535658>Bioinformatic identification of key candidate genes and pathways in axon regeneration after spinal cord injury in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Zebrafish and human genomes are highly homologous; however, despite this genomic similarity, adult zebrafish can achieve neuronal proliferation, regeneration and functional restoration within 6-8 weeks after spinal cord injury, whereas humans cannot. To analyze differentially expressed zebrafish genes between axon-regenerated neurons and axon-non-regenerated neurons after spinal cord injury, and to explore the key genes and pathways of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury, microarray GSE56842 was analyzed using the online tool, GEO2R, in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction networks were used to analyze the identified differentially expressed genes. Finally, we screened for genes and pathways that may play a role in spinal cord injury repair in zebrafish and mammals. A total of 636 differentially expressed genes were obtained, including 255 up-regulated and 381 down-regulated differentially expressed genes in axon-regenerated neurons. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment results were also obtained. A protein-protein interaction network contained 480 node genes and 1976 node connections. We also obtained the 10 hub genes with the highest correlation and the two modules with the highest score. The results showed that spectrin may promote axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury in zebrafish. Transforming growth factor beta signaling may inhibit repair after spinal cord injury in zebrafish. Focal adhesion or  may play an important role in the migration and proliferation of some cells, such as Schwann cells or neural progenitor cells, after spinal cord injury in zebrafish.

Phosphorene is modeled by a -binding Hamiltonian that describes its electronic structure at low energies, where the electrons behave in the armchair direction as massive Dirac Fermions and in the orthogonal zigzag direction as Schrödinger electrons. Applying the continuum approximation, we derive the electron optics laws in phosphorene pn , which show very particular and unusual properties. Because of the anisotropy of the electronic structure, these laws depend strongly on the orientation of the  with respect to the sublattice. Negative and anomalous reflection are observed for tilted , whereas the typical specular reflection is found only if the  is parallel to the zigzag or armchair edges. Moreover, omni-directional total reflection, called anti-super-Klein tunneling, is observed if the  is parallel to the armchair edge. Applying the nonequilibrium Green's function method on the -binding model, we calculate numerically the current flow. The good agreement of both approaches confirms the atypical transport properties, which can be used in nanodevices to collimate and filter the electron flow or to switch its direction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650454>Ghrelin alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation-mediated reproductive dysfunction induced by stress.</a></h2><p>Psychological stress exists widely in modern society and results in the disruption of testicular , germ cell apoptosis, and the disorder of fertility hormones and even causes infertility. Ghrelin (GHRL), a 28-amino acid peptide secreted mainly by the stomach and pancreas, has been reported to alleviate male reproductive injury through inhibiting apoptosis. However, whether GHRL has a beneficial effect on psychological stress-induced testicular injury and the possible mechanisms remain poorly understood.Male mice were immobilized in Decapicone bags for 3 h daily for 14 days treated with or without GHRL (i.p. 100 mg/kg body weight). Body weight and testicular weight were measured. Histological alterations and apoptosis were examined by H.E. staining and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the testes was investigated.Exposure to stress caused testicular histological alterations, an elevation of the Johnsen score, and germ cell apoptosis, while GHRL partially alleviated the adverse effects. The expression of ER stress marker proteins, including GRP78, CHOP, ATF6, p-JNK, and XBP-1, was upregulated in the stress group; however, GHRL treatment significantly suppressed the activation of ER stress in the testes. GHRL also inhibited the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TLR4, and NF-κB.GHRL alleviated testicular injury induced by ER stress and inflammation which is associated with the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, and these findings may provide a novel strategy for preventing and treating reproductive dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510792>Endothelial Targets in Stroke: Translating Animal Models to Human.</a></h2><p>Cerebral ischemia (stroke) induces injury to the cerebral endothelium that may contribute to parenchymal injury and worsen outcome.

Bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R) activation has been implicated in many neuroinflammatory diseases, but the contribution of B1R to inflammation and vascular breakdown is yet to be determined. As a result, the present study evaluated the effect of B1R stimulation using Des-Arg-9-BK on the cytokine profile and junctional properties of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMVECs). Results showed that stimulation of B1R receptors increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), but decreased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a cytokine and growth factor required for maintenance of the vasculature. B1R stimulation also resulted in the loss of occludin expression at  with no change in VE-cadherin expression. There was also a significant increase in permeability to Evans blue albumin, suggesting an increase of vascular permeability. Taken together, these results suggest that B1R activation that occurs in neuroinflammatory diseases may contribute to both the inflammation and loss of blood-brain barrier integrity that is characteristic of these diseases.© 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532718>Cellular and Extracellular Matrix of bone, with Principals of Synthesis and Dependency of Mineral Deposition on Cell Membrane Transport.</a></h2><p>Bone differs from other connective tissues; it is isolated by a layer of osteoblasts that are connected by  and gap . This allows bone to create dense lamellar type I collagen, control pH, mineral deposition, and regulate water content forming a compact and strong structure. New woven bone formed after degradation of mineralized cartilage is rapidly degraded and re-synthesized to impart structural order for local bone strength. Ossification is regulated by thickness of bone units and by patterning via bone morphogenetic receptors. This superfamily interacts with receptors for additional signals in bone differentiation. Important features of the osteoblast environment were established using recent tools including osteoblast differentiation . Osteoblasts deposit matrix protein, over 90% type I collagen, in lamellae with orientation alternating parallel or orthogonal to the main stress axis of the bone. Into this organic matrix, mineral is deposited as hydroxyapatite. Mineral matrix matures from amorphous to crystalline hydroxyapatite. This process includes at least two-phase changes of the calcium-phosphate mineral as well as intermediates involving tropocollagen fibrils to form the bone composite. Beginning with initiation of mineral deposition, there is uncertainty regarding cardinal processes, but the driving force is not merely exceeding the calcium-phosphate solubility product. It occurs behind a epithelial-like layer of osteoblasts, which generate phosphate and remove protons liberated during calcium-phosphate salt deposition. The forming bone matrix is discontinuous from the general extracellular fluid. Required adjustment of ionic concentrations and water removal from bone matrix are important details remaining to be addressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614968>Galactomannan Pentasaccharide Produced from Copra Meal Enhances  Integration of Epithelial Tissue through Activation of AMPK.</a></h2><p>Mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) is well-known as an effective fed supplement for livestock to increase their nutrients absorption and health status.

The apical structure of merozoites and sporozoites contains rhoptry and microneme secretory organelles, which are conserved with other infective forms of apicomplexan parasites. During merozoite invasion of erythrocytes, some rhoptry proteins are secreted to form a  between the parasite and target cell, while others are discharged to maintain subsequent infection inside the parasitophorous vacuole. It has been questioned whether the invasion mechanisms mediated by rhoptry proteins are also involved in sporozoite invasion of two distinct target cells, mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes. Recently we demonstrated that rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2), which is crucial for  formation in merozoites, is also important for sporozoite invasion of both target cells. With the aim of comprehensively describing the mechanisms of sporozoite invasion, the expression and localization profiles of rhoptry proteins were investigated in  sporozoites. Of 12 genes representing merozoite rhoptry molecules, nine are transcribed in oocyst-derived sporozoites at a similar or higher level compared to those in blood-stage schizonts. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that eight proteins, namely RON2, RON4, RON5, ASP/RON1, RALP1, RON3, RAP1, and RAMA, localize to rhoptries in sporozoites. It is noteworthy that most rhoptry neck proteins in merozoites are localized throughout rhoptries in sporozoites. This study demonstrates that most rhoptry proteins, except components of the high-molecular mass rhoptry protein complex, are commonly expressed in merozoites and sporozoites in  spp., which suggests that components of the invasion mechanisms are basically conserved between infective forms independently of their target cells. Combined with sporozoite-stage specific gene silencing strategies, the contribution of rhoptry proteins in invasion mechanisms can be described.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563609>Blue-light induced breakdown of barrier function on human retinal epithelial cells is mediated by PKC-ζ over-activation and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>We aimed to study the time course decrease of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) barrier function when exposed to blue light. To this end, we cultured ARPE-19 cells on Electrical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) multi-well arrays. Using an ad hoc light emitting diode (LED) array illumination system together with a set of neutral density filters and a 3-dimensional (3D) printed filter holder, cells were exposed to a gradient of irradiances of blue-light with a measured peak at 468 nm. The electrical resistance between 4 kHz and 64 kHz was recorded during the exposure. Blue light exposure induced a dose-dependent decrease in the resistances at 4 kHz, however the time course resistance at 64 kHz did not show any decrease before t = 52 h. Quantification of the barrier function using mathematical model integrated in the ECIS software showed that blue-light exposure induced a dose-dependent decrease in the barrier function associated with  formation (P < 0.05). This was confirmed by the immunostaining of the  associated structural protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). The detection of reactive oxygen species by carboxy-H2DCFDA confirmed that the blue light induced dose-dependent decrease in the barrier function is mediated by oxidative stress. On a separate experiment, blue-light exposed ARPE-19 cells were treated with 100 nM Protein Kinase C zeta (PKC-ζ) pseudo substrate inhibitor to identify underlying pathway for blue-light induced damage on the barrier function. The treatment with 100 nM PKC-ζ pseudo substrate inhibitor induced faster recovery of the barrier function compared to no treatment. Altogether our results document that blue LED light exposure decreased RPE barrier function in-vitro in a dose-dependent manner, before any cell death occurred. This damage induced by blue-light on  is mediated by oxidative stress through PKC-ζ activation. The quantification of the healing effect observed by inhibition of PKC-ζ might lead to development of high throughput wound healing assays through ECIS in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The B cell epitopes of murine TNF‑α (mTNF‑α) were predicted in silico and coupled with the universal interleukin 1β (IL‑1β) helper T‑cell epitope peptide VQGEESNDK to synthesize the eight‑branched MAP vaccine. Then, the immunological effects of the MAP vaccine were assessed in vitro and in vivo, as well as its impacts on DAI index, serum DAO levels, colon tissue  protein amounts, ultrastructural changes, and MPO activity in BALB/c mice with UC. The amino acids LTLRSSSQNSSDKPV at positions 78‑92 of mTNF‑α may constitute the dominant B cell epitope. Based on this finding, an eight‑branched peptide structure, the TNF‑α B‑cell epitope/IL‑1β helper T‑cell epitope complex MAP vaccine, was synthesized. Indirect ELISA confirmed that MAP had a high affinity with commercialized mTNF‑α antibodies. Meanwhile, MAP induced high specific antibody titers in vivo, reduced the DAI score, serum MPO activity, colorectal lymph node colony count, ultrastructural injuries, colon tissue histological index score and MPO activity in UC mice, while increasing the expression levels of occludin, claudin1 and ZO1 in colon tissues.

Thus, the aim of the present study was 2-fold: first, to provide new information on the localization and expression of cell-cell  proteins in the testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens of domestic turkeys and second, to compare expression of junctional protein genes between 2 turkey population, one that produces white normal semen (WNS) and the other that produces yellow abnormal semen. Expression of occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), connexin 43 (Cx43), N- and E-cadherin, and β-catenin genes were investigated using 3 complementary techniques: quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Compared to WNS testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens, YSS tissues exhibited downregulation of occludin and β-catenin mRNA (P < 0.05) and protein (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) and upregulation of N- and E-cadherin mRNA (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively) and protein (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, ZO-1 and Cx43 mRNA and protein were upregulated in YSS testis (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively) but not in epididymis and ductus deferens; both mRNAs and proteins were downregulated (P < 0.05) compared to the respective WNS epididymis and ductus deferens. Altered staining intensity of immunoreactive proteins in YSS vs. WNS reproductive tissue sections confirmed the gene expression results. The present study is the first to demonstrate altered levels of junctional protein gene expression in reproductive tissues of male YSS turkeys. These findings may suggest that subtle changes in junctional protein expression affect the microenvironment in which spermatozoa develop and mature and thus may have an impact on the appearance of yellow semen in domestic turkeys.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650247>Tricellular  protein LSR/angulin-1 contributes to the epithelial barrier and malignancy in human pancreatic cancer cell line.</a></h2><p>Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR)/angulin-1 is a crucial molecule of tricellular contacts in the epithelial barrier of normal cells and the malignancy of cancer cells. To investigate whether LSR/angulin-1 affects the epithelial barrier and malignancy in human pancreatic cancer, human pancreatic cancer cell line HPAC was used. Treatment with EGF or TGF-β increased the expression of LSR, but not tricellulin (TRIC), and induced the localization of LSR and TRIC to bicellular  from tricellular . TGF-β receptor type-1 inhibitor EW-7197 prevented changes of the distribution and the barrier function of LSR by TGF-β. Knockdown of LSR increased cell migration, invasion, proliferation and EGF ligand amphiregulin expression and decreased the epithelial barrier. Treatment with amphiregulin induced cell migration and invasion and knockdown of amphiregulin prevented the increases of cell migration, invasion and proliferation caused by knockdown of LSR. Treatment with LSR ligand peptide angubindin-1 decreased the epithelial barrier and the expression of LSR, but not TRIC, and increased cell invasion. Knockdown of TRIC decreased cell migration and the epithelial barrier. In immunohistochemical analysis of human pancreatic cancer tissues, LSR and TRIC were found to be localized at the cell membranes of normal pancreatic ducts and well-differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), whereas in poorly differentiated PDAC, LSR was weakly detected in the cytoplasm. Amphiregulin was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of well- and poorly differentiated PDAC. In pancreatic cancer, LSR contributes to the epithelial barrier and malignancy via growth factors and may be a potential targeting molecule in the therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621455>Knockdown of IQGAP-1 Enhances  and Prevents  Invasion of Human Corneal Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>: To determine the role of IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein1 (IQGAP-1) in  of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) and its effect against  (PAK) invasion. : Primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs), immortalized HCECs, and IQGAP-1 RNA knockdown HCECs (siHCECs) were used.

We examined differential exosomal miRNA expression in untreated OSA patients with normal dipping blood pressure (NDBP) and reverse dipping blood pressure (RDBP; an extreme form of non-dipping) to understand the mechanisms underlying non-dipping blood pressure in OSA.46 patients (RDBP, n=15  NDBP, n=31) matched for OSA severity (respiratory event index, 32.6±22.5 h  32.2±18.1 h, p=0.9), age (54.8±12.9  49±9.9 years, p=0.09) and body mass index (36.2±6.6 kg·m  34.4±6.8 kg·m, p=0.4) were included. Plasma exosomes were characterised by flow cytometry, and functional  reporter assays were conducted on cultured endothelial cells. Exosome miRNA cargo was profiled with microarrays followed by bioinformatics analyses.Exosomes from RDBP patients increased the permeability of endothelial cell  and adhesion molecule expression. Principal component analyses of miRNA array data showed strict separation and identification of the two groups. A restricted and validated signature of exosomal miRNAs were identified in RDBP  NDBP group. Their predicted target genes involved PI3K-Akt (p=0.004), Ras (p=3.42E-05), Wnt (p=0.003), and HIF-1 signalling (p=0.04), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels (p=0.01), and several cancer-related pathways.Patients with RDBP have altered miRNA cargo in circulating exosomes that invoke  endothelial dysfunction. A selected number of circulating exosomal miRNAs play an important role in abnormal circadian regulation of blood pressure and may provide prognostic biomarkers of CVD risk in OSA.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592143>Distinct Origin of Claudin7 in Early Tumor Endosomes Affects Exosome Assembly.</a></h2><p>Microvesicles are the body's most powerful intercellular communication system and cancer-initiating cell microvesicles (CIC-TEX) reprogram Non-CIC towards fortified malignancy. Claudin7, a CIC-biomarker in gastrointestinal tumors, is recovered in TEX. Recent evidence suggesting individual cells delivering distinct microvesicles became of particular interest for claudin7, which is part of  (TJ) and glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEM), GEM-located claudin7 is palmitoylated. This offered the unique possibility of exploring the contribution of a CIC marker and its origin from distinct membrane domains on CIC-TEX biogenesis and activities. Proteome and miRNA analysis of wild-type, claudin7-knockdown and a rescue with claudin7 harboring a mutated palmitoylation site (mP) of a rat pancreatic and a human colon cancer line uncovered significant, only partly overlapping contributions of palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated claudin7 to TEX composition. Palmitoylated claudin7 facilitates GEM-integrated plasma membrane and associated signaling molecule recruitment; non-palmitoylated claudin7 supports recruitment of trafficking components, proteins engaged in fatty acid metabolism and TJ proteins into TEX. Claudin7mP also assists TEX recovery of selected miRNA. Thus, distinctly located claudin7 affects CIC-TEX composition and TJ-derived cld7 might play a unique role in equipping CIC-TEX with transporters and lipid metabolism-regulating molecules, awareness of distinct TEX populations being crucial facing therapeutic translation.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553086>Primary tumor-secreted VEGF induces vascular hyperpermeability in premetastatic lung via the occludin phosphorylation/ubiquitination pathway.</a></h2><p>Primary tumor can induce the formation of premetastatic niche. The hyperpermeability of the vessels in the premetastatic niche is the first step in the development of metastasis. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability remain to be elucidated. In this study, 4T1 breast cells were injected into the breasts of mice to establish a tumor model. Our results showed that primary tumors induced hyperpermeability of the vessels in the premetastatic lung. Subsequent studies showed that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was elevated in the tumor-bearing mice serum and the levels of  (TJ) proteins occludin and ZO-1 were decreased in the premetastatic lung. In vitro studies demonstrated that VEGF increased the permeability of dextran and decreased the levels of occludin and ZO-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Moreover, the hyperpermeability of vessels and the degradation of occludin was blocked by bevacizumab. Overexpression of occludin alleviated the VEGF-induced hyperpermeability. Further investigations revealed that VEGF-induced occludin phosphorylation at Ser-490 and ubiquitination. Finally, we showed that VEGF accelerated the process of occludin degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In conclusion, primary tumor-secrete VEGF induce the occludin phosphorylation/ubiquitination and downregulation, resulting in the disruption of TJs and hyperpermeability of vessels in premetastatic lung. The occludin phosphorylation/ubiquitination pathway may be the mechanism of VEGF-induced vascular hyperpermeability in the lung premetastatic niche.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662022>Localization of Tricellular  Molecule LSR at Midbody and Centrosome During Cytokinesis in Human Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>Epithelial integrity and barrier function are maintained during cytokinesis in vertebrate epithelial tissues. The changes in localization and the roles of tricellular  molecule lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) during cytokinesis are not well known, although new tricellular  form at the flank of the midbody during cytokinesis. In this study, we investigated the changes in localization and the role of LSR at the midbody and centrosome during cytokinesis using human endometrial carcinoma cell line Sawano, comparing the tricellular  molecule tricellulin; bicellular  molecules occludin, claudin-7, zonula occludens-1, and cingulin; and the epithelial polarized related molecules apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2, PAR3, and yes-associated protein. During cytokinesis induced by treatment with taxol, the epithelial barrier was maintained and the tricellular  molecules LSR and tricellulin were concentrated at the flank of the acetylated tubulin-positive midbody and in γ-tubulin-positive centrosomes with the dynein adaptor Hook2, whereas the other molecules were localized there as well. All the molecules disappeared by knockdown using small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, by the knockdown of Hook2, the epithelial barrier was maintained and most of the molecules disappeared from the centrosome.

Autophagy of epithelial cells maintains homeostasis of the intestinal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating degradation of the  protein claudin-2. This study investigated the effects and mechanism of activity of sinensetin, a polymethylated flavonoid isolated from tangerine peel and citrus, on intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis. Animal model of colitis were established by intracolonic administration of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and oral treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. Epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-4 kD dextran in vivo and transepithelial electrical resistance in Caco-2 cells, respectively. Epithelial cell autophagy assayed by autophagosome formation and expression of autophagy-related protein. Sinensetin reversed colitis-associated increase in intestinal permeability, significantly promoted epithelial cell autophagy, and further decreased epithelial cell apoptosis, and reduced mucosal claudin-2. Sinenstetin alleviated colitis symptoms rats and mice with colitis. Knockdown of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the promotion of epithelial autophagy by sinensetin. In conclusion, sinensetin significantly alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis by promoting epithelial cell autophagy, and further inhibiting apoptosis and promoting claudin-2 degradation. The results highlighted novel potential benefits of sinensetin in colitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Geniposide, a natural product extracted from the herb Gardenia jasminoides, has been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in neurologic deficits. This study aims to investigate whether Geniposide has therapeutic potential to HI brain injury and the underlying mechanisms. C57/bl6 mice were subjected to HI insult on postnatal day 10. Geniposide (20 mg/kg b.w.) was administered intragastrically every day after HI insult for 7 successional days. Then mice at P18 were sacrificed and brain tissues were collected for further analysis. Geniposide treatment significantly inhibited cell apoptosis, reduced serum IgG leakage into brain tissue, attenuated astrogliosis and microgliosis, prevented loss of pericytes, loss of  and adherens  proteins. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which related proteins were downregulated after HI insult, was activated by Geniposide treatment. Geniposide treatment after neonatal HI insult attenuated HI-induced cell apoptosis, IgG leakage, microgliosis, astrogliosis, pericytes loss and  protein degradation.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the  (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to palmitic or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic acid had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

Current treatments rely upon donor allogeneic tissue to replace the damaged CE. A donor cornea shortage necessitates the development of biomaterials, enabling in vitro expansion of corneal endothelial cells (CECs). This study investigated the use of a synthetic peptide hydrogel using poly-ε-lysine (pεK), cross-linked with octanedioic-acid as a potential substrate for CECs expansion and CE grafts. PεK hydrogel properties were optimised to produce a substrate which was thin, transparent, porous and robust. A human corneal endothelial cell line (HCEC-12) attached and grew on pεK hydrogels as confluent monolayers after 7 days, whereas primary porcine CECs (pCECs) detached from the pεK hydrogel. Pre-adsorption of collagen I, collagen IV and fibronectin to the pεK hydrogel increased pCEC adhesion at 24 h and confluent monolayers formed at 7 days. Minimal cell adhesion was observed with pre-adsorbed laminin, chondroitin sulphate or commercial FNC coating mix (fibronectin, collagen and albumin). Functionalisation of the pεK hydrogel with synthetic cell binding peptide H-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly-Gly-OH (RGD) or α2β1 integrin recognition sequence H-Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala-OH (DGEA) resulted in enhanced pCEC adhesion with the RGD peptide only. pCECs grown in culture at 5 weeks on RGD pεK hydrogels showed zonula occludins 1 staining for  and expression of sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphase, suggesting a functional CE. These results demonstrate the pεK hydrogel can be tailored through covalent binding of RGD to provide a surface for CEC attachment and growth.

After absorption, nanoparticles enter circulation and effect endothelial cells. We previously showed that exposure to Au-NPs (40-50 nm) collapsed endothelial  and increased their paracellular permeability. Inhaled nanoparticles have gained significant attention due to their biodistribution in the brain; however, little is known regarding their role in cerebral edema. The present study investigated the expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) in the cerebral endothelial cell line, bEnd.3, stimulated by Au-NPs.We found that treatment with Au-NPs induced AQP1 expression and increased endothelial permeability to water. Au-NP exposure rapidly boosted the phosphorylation levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and AKT, increased the accumulation of caveolin 1 (Cav1), and reduced the activity of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK). The inhibition of AKT (GDC-0068) or FAK (PF-573228) not only rescued ERK activity but also prevented AQP1 induction, whereas Au-NP-mediated Cav1 accumulation remained unaltered. Neither these signaling molecules nor AQP1 expression responded to Au-NPs while Cav1 was silenced. Inhibition of ERK activity (U0126) remarkably enhanced Cav1 and AQP1 expression in bEnd.3 cells. These data demonstrate that Au-NP-mediated AQP1 induction is Cav1 dependent, but requires the repression on ERK activity. Mice receiving intranasally administered Au-NPs displayed cerebral edema, significantly augmented AQP1 protein levels; furthermore, mild focal lesions were observed in the cerebral parenchyma.These data suggest that the subacute exposure of nanoparticles might induce cerebral edema, involving the Cav1 dependent accumulation on endothelial AQP1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575337>Integrin α5β1 inhibition by ATN-161 reduces neuroinflammation and is neuroprotective in ischemic stroke.</a></h2><p>Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability with limited therapeutic options. Endothelial cell β integrin receptors play a direct role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction through regulation of  proteins and infiltrating leukocytes, potentially mediated by β1 integrins. Following tandem transient common carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion on wild-type mice, we administered the integrin a5b1 inhibitor, ATN-161, intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 1 mg/kg acutely after reperfusion, on post-stroke day (PSD)1 and PSD2. Systemic changes (heart rate, pulse distension, and body temperature) were determined. Additionally, infarct volume and edema were determined by 2,3-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and magnetic resonance imaging, while neurological changes were evaluated using an 11-point Neuroscore. Brain immunohistochemistry was performed for claudin-5, α5β1, IgG, and CD45 + cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-1β, collagen IV, and CXCL12. ATN-161 significantly reduced integrin α5β1 expression in the surrounding peri-infarct region with no systemic changes. Infarct volume, edema, and functional deficit were significantly reduced in ATN-161-treated mice. Furthermore, ATN-161 treatment reduced IgG extravasation into the parenchyma through conserved claudin-5, collagen IV, CXCL12 while reducing MMP-9 transcription. Additionally, IL-1β and CD45 + cells were reduced in the ipsilateral cortex following ATN-161 administration.

EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 mediates virus attachment and is the important virulence factor in the EV-A71pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the roles of VP1 in the permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB). Sera albumin, Evans blue, and dextran leaked into brain parenchyma of the 1-week-old C57BL/6J mice intracranially injected with VP1 recombinant protein. VP1 also increased the permeability of the brain endothelial cells monolayer, an in vitro BBB model.  protein claudin-5 was reduced in the brain tissues or brain endothelial cells treated with VP1. In contrast, VP1 increased the expression of virus receptor vimentin, which could be blocked with VP1 neutralization antibody. Vimentin expression in the VP1-treated brain endothelial cells was regulated by TGF-β/Smad-3 and NF-κB signal pathways. Moreover, vimentin over-expression was accompanied with compromised BBB.

Evans blue and FITC-dextran leakage were determined to evaluate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in vivo. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and Na-F penetration rate were measured with a co-culture of the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) and human normal glial cell line (HEB) in vitro BBB model. WB were used to analyzed the expression of BBB  (TJs) related protein (ZO-1, Occludin, Claudin-3, p-ERM, and p-MLC), ultrastructure of TJs was determined by transmission electron microscope.LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated that EGb could improve brain uptake of ginsenoside Rg1, Re, Rd and Rb1. In vivo study showed that, BBB permeability was significantly increased after EGb administration, evidenced by the markedly increased penetration of FITC-dextran and Evans Blue into the mice brain parenchyma. In the in vitro BBB model, reduced TEER and increased Na-F penetration rate was observed in EGb group, which was associated with alteration of TJs ultrastructure. Furthermore, the expression of p-ERM and p-MLC in hCMEC/D3 as well as mice brain microvessels were significantly upregulated, but no significant change on the expression of TJs proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-3). Moreover, the effect of EGb on in vitro BBB permeability and ERM, MLC phosphorylation was counteracted by DPCPX, an A1 adenosine receptor (A1R) antagonist.EGb might induce ERM/MLC phosphorylation and increase the cell-cell  gaps to cause a reversible increase of the BBB permeability via A1R signaling pathway.

These changes were prevented by EPO treatment. The in vitro study with ARPE-19 cells confirmed these changes, and the protective effect of EPO was abolished by sEPOR. Gö6976 and digoxin rescued the  and barrier function in glyoxal-treated ARPE-19 cells.In early diabetic rats, the outer BRB might be more severely damaged and its breakdown is the major factor for retinal oedema. EPO maintains the outer BRB integrity through down-regulation of HIF-1α and JNK signallings, and thus up-regulating ZO-1 and occludin expressions in RPE cells.© 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671507>A Novel Claudinopathy Based on Claudin-10 Mutations.</a></h2><p>Claudins are key components of the , sealing the paracellular cleft or composing size-, charge- and water-selective paracellular channels. Claudin-10 occurs in two major isoforms, claudin-10a and claudin-10b, which constitute paracellular anion or cation channels, respectively. For several years after the discovery of claudin-10, its functional relevance in men has remained elusive. Within the past two years, several studies appeared, describing patients with different pathogenic variants of the  gene. Patients presented with dysfunction of kidney, exocrine glands and skin. This review summarizes and compares the recently published studies reporting on a novel autosomal-recessive disorder based on claudin-10 mutations.</p></html>
