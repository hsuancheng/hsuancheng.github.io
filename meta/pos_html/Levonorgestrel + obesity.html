We examined the effects of patient  on primary breast tumor gene expression, by profiling transcription of a set of 103 tumors for which the patients' body mass index (BMI) was ascertained. Sample profiles were stratified according to patients'  phenotype defined as normal (BMI < 25), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), or obese (BMI ≥ 30). Widespread gene expression alterations were evident in breast tumors from obese patients as compared to other tumors, allowing us to define an -associated cancer transcriptional signature of 662 genes. In multiple public expression data sets of breast cancers (representing > 1,500 patients), manifestation of the  signature patterns correlated with manifestation of a gene signature for IGF signaling and (to a lesser extent) with lower levels of estrogen receptor. In one patient cohort, manifestation of the  signature correlated with shorter time to metastases. A number of small molecules either induced or suppressed the -associated transcriptional program in vitro; estrogens alpha-estradiol, , and hexestrol induced the program, while several anti-parkinsonian agents targeting neurotransmitter receptor pathways repressed the program.  in breast cancer patients appears to impact the gene expression patterns of the tumor (perhaps as a result of altered body chemistry). These results warrant further investigation of -associated modifiers of breast cancer risk and disease outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29560743>Bleeding patterns for the Liletta  52 mg intrauterine system.</a></h2><p>Evaluate bleeding patterns for the Liletta  52 mg intrauterine system (IUS) using the World Health Organization Belsey definitions.This prospective multicenter trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of Liletta (Clinicaltrials.gov ). We evaluated bleeding patterns for 1700 nulliparous and multiparous women using a daily diary completed by participants for the first 2 years and by questionnaire every 3 months thereafter. We assessed amenorrhea rates over 3 years and the proportion of subjects with infrequent, frequent, prolonged and irregular bleeding per 90-day reference period over 2 years for the entire study population as well as comparing nulliparous and parous women and obese and non-obese women.Amenorrhea rates at 1 and 3 years in  52 mg IUS users were 19 and 37%, respectively. The infrequent bleeding rate increased from 14% in the first 90 days to 30% at the end of Year 1, and was maintained at the same rate through Year 2. Frequent, prolonged and irregular bleeding declined to low levels by the end of the first year. Discontinuation for bleeding-related complaints occurred in 35 (2.1%, 95% CI 1.3-2.7%) women during the first 36 months; only one subject discontinued for amenorrhea (in Year 2). Outcomes did not vary for nulliparous versus parous or obese versus non-obese women.Among Liletta users, amenorrhea and infrequent bleeding become more prevalent over time and amenorrhea rates continue to increase after the first year of use. Bleeding patterns do not differ significantly by parity or by -status. Discontinuation for bleeding concerns is uncommon with this product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656494>[Health risks of oral contraceptives].</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptives (OC) are either composed of a combination of an estrogen derivative (usually ethinly estradiol) and a progestogen, or they contain a progestogen only. OC are characterized by a high effectiveness and have a low failure rate if taken correctly. Most women tolerate OC relatively well, but adverse effects do occur which are driven by the estrogen dose as well as by the type of progestogen. The most frequently reported adverse effects are nausea or vomiting, breast tenderness, headache or inbalanced mood, but these unwanted side effects are often transient. The fear of weight gain of many OC users is not necessarily supported by data from studies which report relatively little differences in body mass index on average during OC use. Nevertheless, substantial weight gain can occur in individual women. The widely discussed fear of breast cancer is also not justified, and the risk of developing ovarian or endometrial cancer is reduced for women who use OC on a regular basis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the adverse effect with the greatest potential for serious harm if pulmonary embolism develops. This rare, but potentially dangerous adverse effect of OC has been discussed emotionally for many years and keeps attracting a lot of public interest. VTE is rare in young women, but the VTE risk is increased two- to sixfold for OC users as compared to non-users. The VTE risk increases with increasing estrogen dose, is highest in the first year of use, and is higher for OC from the third generation (containing desogestrel, gestodene or norgestimate) than for OC from the second generation (containing ) or than for the progestogen-only pill. According to most studies, OC containing the progestogens drospirenone or cyproterone acetate are similar with regard to VTE risks than OC from the third generation. Individual genetic susceptibility affecting the clotting system plays a major role in the risk of developing VTE in combination with OC, and smoking is also an important contributing factor to an increased VTE risk for women using OC. It is important that doctors and pharmacists inform new users of OC about potential health risks of OC use, and that the personal and family history of previous health risks is assessed thoroughly in order to rule out that important and relevant contraindications are present when a women starts taking OC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28126541>Pharmacokinetics of  and ulipristal acetate emergency contraception in women with normal and obese body mass index.</a></h2><p>This study compares the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  (LNG) emergency contraceptive (EC) and ulipristal acetate (UPA)-EC between normal-body mass index (BMI) and obese-BMI women.This prospective, randomized crossover study evaluates the PK of women after single doses of LNG-EC (1.5mg) and UPA-EC (30mg). Study procedures took place during clinical research unit admissions, where participants received a standardized meal and each study drug, in random order, during two separate 24-h admissions. Study staff collected 14 blood specimens (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24 and 48h). We evaluated serum concentrations of LNG and UPA using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and estimated the PK parameters of both drugs using noncompartmental analysis. The main outcome of this study was a comparison of between-group differences in AUC.Thirty-two women completed the study (16 in each group). Among normal-BMI and obese-BMI participants, the mean BMIs were 22.0 (range 18.8-24.6) and 34.3 (range 30.6-39.9), respectively. After LNG-EC, mean AUC and maximum concentration (C) were 50% lower among obese-BMI women than among normal-BMI women (AUC 100.8 vs. 208.5ng*h/mL, IQR 35.8, IQR 74.2, p≤.01; C 10.8 vs. 18.2ng/mL, p=.01). After UPA-EC, AUC and C were similar between obese-BMI and normal-BMI women (AUC 362.5 vs. 293.5ng*h/mL, IQR 263.2, IQR 112.5, p=.15; C 95.6 vs. 89.3ng/mL, p=.70).After a single dose of EC, obese-BMI women are exposed to lower concentrations of LNG and similar concentrations of UPA, when compared to normal-BMI women.Differences in LNG-EC PK by BMI group may underlie and account for the lower LNG-EC efficacy reported among obese-BMI women, but modest differences in UPA-EC PK by BMI group provide less support for variable efficacy. A pharmacodynamic study may be able to clarify whether these PK differences account for observed differences in LNG-EC and UPA-EC efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Rates of endometrial cancer are rising, in part because of rising  rates. Endometrial hyperplasia is a precancerous condition in women that can lead to endometrial cancer if left untreated. Endometrial hyperplasia occurs more commonly than endometrial cancer. Progesterone tablets currently used to treat women with endometrial hyperplasia are associated with adverse effects in up to 84% of women. The  intrauterine device (Mirena Coil, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA) may improve compliance, but it is invasive, is not acceptable to all women, and is associated with irregular vaginal bleeding in 82% of cases. Therefore, an alternative treatment for women with endometrial hyperplasia is needed. Metformin, a drug that is often used to treat people with diabetes, has been shown in some human studies to reverse endometrial hyperplasia. However, the effectiveness and safety of metformin for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia remain uncertain.To determine the effectiveness and safety of metformin in treating women with endometrial hyperplasia.We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and two trials registers from inception to 10 January 2017. We searched the bibliographies of all included studies and reviews on this topic. We also handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) 2015 and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2015.We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over trials comparing metformin (used alone or in combination with other medical therapies) versus placebo or no treatment, any conventional medical treatment, or any other active intervention for women with histologically confirmed endometrial hyperplasia of any type.Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data from included studies, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by deferment to a third review author. When study details were missing, review authors contacted study authors. The primary outcome of this review was regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology (with or without atypia) towards normal histology. Secondary outcome measures included recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia, progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer, hysterectomy rate, abnormal uterine bleeding, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects during treatment.We included three RCTs in which a total of 77 women took part. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low for all outcomes owing to very serious risk of bias (associated with poor reporting, attrition, and limitations in study design) and imprecision.We performed a meta-analysis of two trials with 59 participants. When metformin was compared with megestrol acetate in women with endometrial hyperplasia, we found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 11.57, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), hysterectomy rates (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 59, very low-quality evidence), and rates of abnormal uterine bleeding (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.52, two RCTs, n = 44 , very low-quality evidence). We found no data for recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia or health-related quality of life. Both studies (n = 59) provided data on progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer as well as one (n = 16) reporting some adverse effects in the metformin arm, notably nausea, thrombosis, lactic acidosis, abnormal liver and renal function among others.Another trial including 16 participants compared metformin plus megestrol acetate versus megestrol acetate alone in women with endometrial hyperplasia. We found insufficient evidence to determine whether there were differences between groups for the following outcomes: regression of endometrial hyperplasia histology towards normal histology (OR 9.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 86.52, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence), recurrence of endometrial hyperplasia among women who achieve regression (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 8, very low-quality evidence), progression of endometrial hyperplasia to endometrial cancer (OR not estimable, no events recorded, one RCT, n = 13, very low-quality evidence), or hysterectomy rates (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.37, one RCT, n = 16, very low-quality evidence). Investigators provided no data on abnormal uterine bleeding or health-related quality of life. In terms of adverse effects, three of eight participants (37.5%) in the metformin plus megestrol acetate study arm reported nausea.At present, evidence is insufficient to support or refute the use of metformin alone or in combination with standard therapy - specifically, megestrol acetate - versus megestrol acetate alone, for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia. Robustly designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials yielding long-term outcome data are needed to address this clinical question.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679478>Extended use of the intrauterine device: a literature review and recommendations for clinical practice.</a></h2><p>There are multiple advantages to "extended use" of the intrauterine device (IUD) use beyond the manufacturer-approved time period, including prolongation of contraceptive and non-contraceptive benefits. We performed a literature review of studies that have reported pregnancy outcomes associated with extended use of IUDs, including copper IUDs and the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). Among parous women who are at least 25 years old at the time of IUD insertion, there is good evidence to support extended use of the following devices: the TCu380A and the TCu220 for 12 years, the Multiload Cu-375 for 10 years, the frameless GyneFix® (330 mm²) for 9 years, the  intrauterine system 52 mg (Mirena®) for 7 years and the Multiload Cu-250 for 4 years. Women who are at least 35 years old at the time of insertion of a TCu380A IUD can continue use until menopause with a negligible risk of pregnancy. We found no data to support use of the LNG-IUS 13.5 mg (Skyla®) beyond 3 years. When counseling about extended IUD use, clinicians should consider patient characteristics and preferences, as well as country- and community-specific factors. Future research is necessary to determine the risk of pregnancy associated with extended use of the copper IUD and the LNG-IUS among nulliparous women and women less than 25 years old at the time of IUD insertion. More data are needed on the potential effect of overweight and  on the long-term efficacy of the LNG-IUS.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Most previous studies have excluded obese women, so the effect of OC use on weight change in obese women is unknown.This analysis evaluates weight and body composition change with OC use among obese (body mass index [BMI] 30.0-39.9) and normal weight (BMI 19.0-24.9) women who were randomly assigned to two OC doses: 20 μg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 100 μg  (LNG) OCs or 30 μg EE and 150 μg LNG OCs. Follow-up occurred after three to four OC cycles. Weight and body composition were measured at baseline and at follow-up using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer.Among 150 women (54 obese and 96 normal weight) who used OCs for 3 to 4 months, there were no clinically or statistically significant weight or body composition changes in the overall group or by BMI or OC formulation group.These findings add to evidence that EE/LNG OCs are not associated with short term weight or body composition change for normal weight women and suggest that OCs are also are not associated with short term weight or body composition change in obese women.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515745> and hormonal contraception: an overview and a clinician's practical guide.</a></h2><p>The growing prevalence of  among the fertile female population poses a considerable problem to contraceptive providers. Obese women, who are more at risk for venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events due to their condition, might be at an even higher risk of developing thromboembolic events when on medical contraception. Combined hormonal contraceptives might be less effective in obese women and may lead to unacceptable metabolic side effects for this population. In addition, the lack of safety data for weight loss drugs and the higher risk for complications during and after pregnancy require a close surveillance of the fertility status of obese patients.The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the available medical contraceptive options and to give the readers a practical guidance for a wise contraceptive choice with regards to .A general literature review of peer-reviewed publications on the topic " and contraception" was performed using the PubMed database.Nowadays, there are many useful tools that help clinicians in choosing among the wide range of therapeutic possibilities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraceptive use. Furthermore, the great diversity of hormonal contraceptive formulations (combined hormonal formulations; progestin-only methods) and active substances (different estrogens and progestins) allow physicians to tailor therapies to patients' clinical peculiarities.Long-acting reversible contraceptives [progestin-only implants, -intra-uterine devices (IUDs) and copper IUDs] and progestin-only methods in general are excellent options for many categories of patients, including obese ones.V, narrative review.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7956212>Blood pressure changes and hormonal contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The effects of low-estrogen and progestogen-only contraceptives on blood pressure changes were investigated on 238 women taking 35 micrograms EE OC, 267 using Norplant implants and 259 adopting IUD. The mean increases in diastolic pressure at 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks among pill users were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those among IUD users by 1.8, 2.1, 2.3 and 1.9 mm Hg, respectively; the increases in systolic pressure were higher but not significant (p > 0.05) by 1.3, 1.7, 1.5 and 1.3 mm Hg. Neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure was affected by use of Norplant implants. Regression analysis, including interaction terms, showed that women's age,  and family history of hypertension were associated with an increase of blood pressure during follow-up and were independent of contraceptive use and vice versa.

The groups were comparable for race, age, parity,  indices, alcohol ingestion, smoking, diet and exercise. Fasting blood samples were obtained twice before CVR treatment, after 2 and 7 weeks of treatment and 1 week thereafter. The women using the CVR had a significant incremental reduction of cholesterol from baseline to treatment which was distributed among all the lipoprotein classes. The cholesterol/HDL-C ratio was significantly increased with treatment. All mena changes were within the reference range. The reduction in HDL and especially in the subclasses HDL 2a and HDL 2b were significant and outside the reference range. The LDL/HDL ratio increased significantly, while the LDL/HDL 2a+2b ratio increased significantly outside the reference range with treatment. Of the lipid and lipoprotein measurements that changed significantly with treatment, HDL-C, HDL, HDL 2a LDL/HDL and LDL/HDL 2a+2b changed significantly towards baseline in the 1-week-off treatment. The potential reduction in predicted coronary risk with the use of the CVR suggested by a reduction in cholesterol was counterbalanced by a reduction in HDL-C and increases in the cholesterol/HDL-C and LDL/HDL ratios.

Subjects were admitted for two 48-h inpatient stays at the beginning and end of the hormone-free interval. Ethinyl estradiol and  (LNG) levels were evaluated during both inpatient stays. Gonadotropin pulsatility (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) was measured during the second inpatient stay. Estradiol (E(2)) and progesterone (P) were measured daily during inpatient stays and twice per week in Cycle 2.BMI was greater in the obese compared to the normal-BMI group [37.3 kg/m(2) (SD, 6.0) vs. 21.9 kg/m(2) (SD, 1.6); p<.05]. The LNG half-life was significantly longer in the obese group (52.1+/-29.4 vs. 25.6+/-9.3 h, p<.05), which correlated with a lower maximum LNG concentration on Cycle 2, Day 1 [1.9 ng/mL (SD, 0.5) vs. 2.5 ng/mL (SD, 0.7)] and a longer time to reach steady state (10 vs. 5 days) in obese women. There were no significant differences in volume of distribution between groups. LH pulse parameters did not differ statistically between groups but trended toward greater HPO activity in the obese group. Additionally, more obese (6/10 vs. 3/10 normal BMI, p>.05) women exhibited E(2) levels consistent with development of a dominant follicle and P levels consistent with ovulation (2/10 vs. 1/10) during Cycle 2.Compared to women with normal BMI, obese women exhibit differences in OC pharmacokinetics that are associated with greater HPO activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153898>Prolonged monitoring of ethinyl estradiol and  levels confirms an altered pharmacokinetic profile in obese oral contraceptives users.</a></h2><p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters based on short sampling times (48 h or less) may contain inaccuracies due to their dependency on extrapolated values. This study was designed to measure PK parameters with greater accuracy in obese users of a low-dose oral contraceptive (OC) and to correlate drug levels with assessments of end-organ activity.Obese [body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2], ovulatory, otherwise healthy women (n=32) received an OC containing 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/100 mcg  (LNG) for two cycles. EE and LNG PK parameters were characterized for 168 h at the end of Cycle 1. During cycle 2, biweekly outpatient visits were performed to assess cervical mucus, monitor ovarian activity with transvaginal ultrasound and obtain serum samples to measure EE, LNG, estradiol and progesterone levels. PK parameters were calculated and correlated with end-organ activity and compared against control samples obtained from normal and obese women sampled up to 48 h in a previous study. Standard determination of PK accuracy was performed, defined by the dependency on extrapolated values ('excess' area under the curve of 25% or less).The mean BMI was 39.4 kg/m2 (SD 6.6) with a range of 30-64 kg/m2. Key LNG PK parameters were as follows: clearance, 0.52 L/h (SD 0.24); half-life, 65 h (SD 40); area under the curve (AUC), 232 h*ng/mL (SD 102); and time to reach steady state, 13.6 days (SD 8.4). The majority of subjects had increased ovarian activity with diameter of follicles ≥8 mm (n=25), but only seven women had follicles ≥10 mm plus cervical mucus scores ≥5. Evidence of poor end-organ suppression did not correlate with the severity of the alterations in PK. As compared to historical normal and obese controls (48-h PK sampling), clearance, half-life, AUC and time to reach steady state were found to be significantly different (p≤.05) in obese women undergoing a longer duration of PK sampling (168 h).

These data were then related to a recent large international prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort active surveillance study, on the cardiovascular risk of users of different types of combined estroprogestin contraceptive (CEPC).The crude HR for E2-valerate (E2V)/dienogest vs other CEPCs with EE was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.4-1.6), but when the data were corrected for age, body mass index, duration of use, and family history of VTE, the corresponding adjusted HR was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.0). A comparison of the E2V/dienogest and EE/ groups showed that the two contraceptives induced a similar VTE risk with the crude and adjusted VTE HRs of 0.7 (95% CI, 0.3-1.8) and 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.3), respectively. Similar results were obtained when the observation was prolonged to January 2017.The reduced impact of E2 vs EE on coagulation translates into the epidemiologic evidence of a reduced number of events in E2V vs EE users, when progestins other than  are used. However, E2 may continue to negatively impact on the risk of VTE, and this should not be forgotten at the time of prescription. Family history of VTE or thrombophilia, age, and  are risk factors for VTE too. If these risk factors are not taken into consideration and excluded, they can overcome or hide the higher safety of E2 vs CEPCs with EE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29400073>Oral hormonal therapy with ethinylestradiol- improves insulin resistance, , and glycogen synthase kinase-3 independent of circulating mineralocorticoid in estrogen-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>Estrogen deficiency has been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases , and recent clinical trials of standard formulations of hormonal therapies have not demonstrated consistent beneficial effects. Estrogen-progestin therapy has been used as exogenous estrogen to normalize depressed estrogen level during menopause. Ovariectomized rodents mimic an estrogen-deficient state in that they develop cardiometabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance (IR). We therefore hypothesized that hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptive steroids, ethinylestradiol- (EEL), improves IR, , and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through reduction of circulating mineralocorticoid in ovariectomized rats. Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (SHM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with or without EEL (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that OVX or SHM + EEL treated rats had increased HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of IR), 1 h postload glucose, HOMA-β, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL cholesterol, TG/HDL cholesterol, plasma insulin, GSK-3, corticosterone, and aldosterone. On the other hand, OVX + EEL treatment ameliorated all these effects except that of aldosterone.

Duration of this treatment was three months. During this time, incidence of side effects were documented by reports of the patients or in reply to questions of the treating gynaecologists. Data has been analysed with special regard to smoking,  and increase of blood pressure. Upon inquiry, 38.1% of women had complaints before and 28.5% after treatment with this oral contraceptive, whereby in 16.9% of patients, complaints were noted for the first time. The observed side effects were more pronounced in smokers than in non-smokers, in obese women more than in those with normal weight, and more pronounced in patients with increased blood pressure compared to normal controls. Cycles became regular, whereas the number of spottings increased. Dysmenorrhoea disappeared almost completely. In the same time interval, genital infections were less prominent.

The inclusion criteria were an age of ≥65 years, pathological confirmation of a uterine neoplasm, a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) value of ≥4 and the presence of vaginal bleeding. Patients underwent intrauterine insertion of an LNG-IUD, and thereafter, received a total dose of 30 Gy at 3 Gy per fraction, over 10 days. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the uterus and disease-involved tissues in the pelvis plus a 1-cm margin. The planning target volume was obtained by adding a 1-cm isotropic margin to the CTV. A total of 9 patients with EC (median age, 85 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2, ≥88.8%; , 55.5%; median CCI, 5) received an LNG-IUD plus RT. An early complete resolution of bleeding was documented in 8 patients (88.8%), while the remaining patient experienced a marked improvement. The median duration of bleeding control was 18 months, while the 2-year actuarial rate of bleeding-free survival was 53.3% (median follow-up time, 20 months; range, 9-60 months). No LNG-IUD- or severe RT-related complications were documented. Overall, a high rate of bleeding remission, durable bleeding-free survival in face of the easy intrauterine insertion of an LNG-IUD and a negligible toxicity profile of the complete treatment were documented in this study, indicating a requirement for further investigation in a larger series.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28140761>Healthcare Provider Attitudes Regarding Contraception for Women with .</a></h2><p>Whether providers who regularly provide family planning services consider contraceptive methods as unsafe for women with  is unknown.We analyzed questionnaire responses received from December 2009 to March 2010 from 635 office-based physicians and 1323 Title X clinic providers delivering family planning services, who were randomly sampled (response rate 65%) before the release of national evidence-based contraception guidelines.

Overweight women of mean age 33.9 ± 6.7 years and mean BMI (body mass index) of 36.5 ± 7.0 kg/m with PCOS ( = 60) were randomized to either metformin, higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or low-dose OCP + spironolactone (OCP + S). Primary outcome measures included changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PF1 and 2), plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and thrombin generation (TG).  PAI-1 activity fell in all groups, ADMA fell in higher-dose OCP, PF1 and 2 increased with metformin and higher-dose OCP, TG rose and tPA fell in both OCP groups, plasminogen increased in all and TAFI increased after higher-dose OCP.  Endothelial function (primary haemostasis) improved with higher dose with some improvement in low-dose OCP + S and metformin.

As women age, their fecundity decreases but does not disappear until menopause. After age 40, 75% of pregnancies are unplanned and may result in profound physical and emotional impact. Clinical evaluation must be relied on to diagnose menopause, since hormonal levels fluctuate widely. Until menopause is confirmed, some potential for pregnancy remains; at age 45, women's sterility rate is 55%. Older gravidas experience higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and death. Many safe and effective contraceptive options are available to perimenopausal women. In addition to preventing an unplanned and higher-risk pregnancy, perimenopausal contraception may improve abnormal uterine bleeding, hot flashes, and menstrual migraines. Long-acting reversible contraceptives, including the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), the etonogestrel subdermal implant (ESI), and the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD), provide high efficacy without estrogen. LNG-IUS markedly decreases menorrhagia commonly seen in perimenopause. Both ESI and LNG-IUS provide endometrial protection for women using estrogen for vasomotor symptoms. Women without cardiovascular risk factors can safely use combined hormonal contraception. The CDC's Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use informs choices for women with comorbidities. No medical contraindications exist for  emergency-contraceptive pills, though  does decrease efficacy. In contrast, the Cu-IUD provides reliable emergency and ongoing contraception regardless of body mass index (BMI).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102631>Ulipristal acetate compared to  emergency contraception among current oral contraceptive users: a cost-effectiveness analysis.</a></h2><p>To estimate the cost-effectiveness of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and  (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) on pregnancy prevention among combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill users with an extended pill-free interval. We accounted for the potential interaction of COCs and  on EC efficacy.We built a decision-analytic model using TreeAge software to evaluate the optimal oral EC strategy in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 twenty-five-year-old women midcycle with a prolonged "missed" pill episode (8-14 days). We used a 5-year time horizon and 3% discount rate. From a healthcare perspective, we obtained probabilities, utilities and costs inflated to 2018 dollars from the literature. We set the threshold for cost-effectiveness at a standard $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We included the following clinical outcomes: number of protected cycles, unintended pregnancies, abortions, deliveries and costs.We found that UPA was the optimal method of oral EC, as it resulted in 720 fewer unintended pregnancies, 736 fewer abortions and 80 fewer deliveries at a total cost savings of $50,323 and 79 additional adjusted life-years. UPA continued to be the optimal strategy even in the case of  or COCs impacting UPA efficacy, in which a COC interaction would have to change efficacy of UPA by 160% before LNG was the dominant strategy.Our models found that UPA was the dominant choice of oral EC among COC users with a prolonged "missed" pill episode, regardless of body mass index or an adverse interaction of COCs on UPA.Ulipristal acetate is the dominant choice of oral emergency contraception among combined oral contraceptive users.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using radioimmunoassay techniques, we measured levels of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and  (LNG). During the same cycle, women underwent twice-weekly sonography to assess ovarian follicular development and blood draws to measure endogenous estradiol (E2) and progesterone levels.Obese women had a lower area under the curve (AUC; 1077.2 vs. 1413.7 pg*h/mL) and lower maximum values (85.7 vs. 129.5 pg/mL) for EE than normal-weight women (p=.04 and <0.01, respectively); EE trough levels were similar between BMI groups. The similar, but smaller, differences in their LNG levels for AUC and maximum values (C(max)) were not statistically significant. While peak values differed somewhat, the LNG trough levels were similar for obese and normal-weight women (2.6 and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively). Women with greater EE AUC had smaller follicular diameters (p=.05) and lower E2 levels (p=.04). While follicular diameters tended to be larger among obese women, these differences were not statistically significant.OC hormone peak levels are lower among obese women compared to normal-weight women, but their trough levels are similar.

Three analyses pooled overlapping data from a total of three primary studies and demonstrated significant associations between  and risk of pregnancy after ECP use. One analysis reported a 4-fold increased risk of pregnancy among women with  (BMI≥30kg/m) compared with women within normal/underweight categories (BMI<25kg/m) after use of LNG ECPs [odds ratio (OR) 4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-9.4]. Further analysis of the same LNG data found that, at an approximate weight of 80 kg, the rate of pregnancy rose above 6%, which is the estimated pregnancy probability without contraception; at weights less than 75 kg, the rate of pregnancy was less than 2%. Two analyses examining UPA suggested an approximate 2-fold increased risk of pregnancy among women with  compared with either normal/underweight women or nonobese (BMI<30kg/m) women (OR 2.6; 95% CI 0.9-7.0 and OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.0-4.3, respectively), but CIs were wide. Finally, the fourth secondary analysis pooled data from three separate randomized controlled trials on LNG ECPs and found no increase in pregnancy risk with increasing weight or BMI and found no consistent association between pregnancy and both factors when adjusted for other covariates.While data are limited and poor to fair quality, findings suggest that women with  experience an increased risk of pregnancy after use of LNG ECP compared with those normal/underweight. Women with  may also experience an increased risk of pregnancy compared with women without  after use of UPA ECP, though differences did not reach statistical significance.

A group of non-operated obese patients served as control. Apart from significantly higher gonadotrophin levels, which could be attributed to periovulatory sampling in the non-operated group, there was no significant differences in basal levels of estradiol, estrone, conjugated estrone, androstendione, testosterone, and progesterone. The operation did not influence the pattern of the menstrual cycle. Following a single oral dose of 4 mg micronized estradiol and 125 microgram D-norgestrel, serum levels of estradiol and estrone were equal in the three groups. serum D-norgestrel was equal in the two operated groups, but was significantly higher in the bypass group with 1:3 jejunoileal ratio, compared with the non-operated group. Further, a significant negative correlation between peak levels and weight was found.

Pregnancy rates were also low in women weighing over 80kg (0.7%) and who were obese (BMI over 30kg/m) (2.0%). The pooled analyses for pregnancy demonstrated that BMI over 30kg/m decreased efficacy significantly (odds ratio 8.27, 95% confidence interval = 2.70-25.37) when compared to women in lower BMI categories, mainly influenced by pregnancies in obese women from one study site. Sensitivity analyses excluding that site showed that  was no longer a risk factor; however, the other studies included too few obese women in the sample to exclude a substantial decrease in efficacy.Pregnancy rates with use of LNG 1.5mg for EC were low at less than 3% across different weight and BMI categories.

The most commonly used contraceptive methods were intrauterine devices, 29 % preoperatively and 26 % postoperatively even though there was a postoperative switch from the copper intrauterine device to the  intrauterine system. Thirty percent did not use any contraceptive during the first 12 months after surgery. Sixty percent of the responders were aware of the recommendations to avoid pregnancy after surgery.Many women who undergo bariatric surgery are not using any contraceptive method despite the recommendation that they should avoid pregnancy for at least 12 months.

The data derived from these recent studies is of borderline statistical significance because any important factors are not considered to evaluate the real correlation between the assumption of OCs and risk of venous thromboembolism. Among the factors that should be considered, there are: EE dose, duration of use, coexistance of other risk factors of venous thromboembolism (age, BMI, familiarity, surgical interventions) and other prescription bias. The lack of these factors is likely to contribute to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism observed in users of third-generation OCs when compared to that in users of second-generation OCs.

Implants are one of the most effective and reversible methods of contraception available. These devices may be particularly appropriate for certain populations of women, including women who cannot use estrogen-containing contraception. Implants are safe for use by women with many chronic medical problems. The newest implant, Implanon (Organon International, Oss, The Netherlands), is the only device currently available in the United States and was approved in 2006. It is registered for 3 years of pregnancy prevention. Contraceptive implants have failure rates similar to tubal ligation, and yet they are readily reversible with a return to fertility within days of removal. Moreover, these contraceptive devices can be safely placed in the immediate postpartum period, ensuring good contraceptive coverage for women who may be at risk for an unintended pregnancy. Irregular bleeding is a common side effect for all progestin-only contraceptive implants. Preinsertion counseling should address possible side effects, and treatment may be offered to women who experience prolonged or frequent bleeding.Thieme Medical Publishers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20664386>Ovarian suppression in normal-weight and obese women during oral contraceptive use: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To assess ovarian suppression during oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use among normal-weight and obese women using two OCP doses.This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of two 21-day monophasic OCP formulations (20-microgram ethinyl estradiol [E2],/100-microgram  compared with 30-microgram ethinyl E2/150-microgram ) among normal-weight (body mass index 19.0-24.9) and obese (body mass index 30.0-39.9) women with regular menses and normal ovarian ultrasonography.

Venous thromboembolism remains one event that can occur in users independent of the presence of risk factors. However, the attributable risk is small, with a range of approximately 7 to 18 events per 100 000 women annually. This risk is directly proportional to estrogen dosage starting at levels of 30-35 microg. The type of progestogen (progestin) may also influence risk, though recent studies are controversial. In particular, there is debate surrounding whether desogestrel and gestodene carry a greater risk of thromboembolism than . Modifiable risk factors for venous thromboembolism include hemostatic disorders, especially factor V Leiden, and possibly . Cigarette smoking is not a significant risk factor in oral contraceptive users. With the exception of avoiding oral contraceptive use among women with a either a personal history of venous thromboembolism or a strong family history (until evaluated for hemostatic abnormalities), and perhaps limiting the use of desogestrel- or gestodene-containing oral contraceptives, there is little clinicians can do to reduce the risk of this disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255125>Conservative management of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma with the  intrauterine system may be less effective in morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>•Endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma regression rates with LNG-IUS were examined by BMI.•Morbidly obese patients with EH/EHA/EC are more likely to progress.•Despite addition of oral progesterone to LNG-IUS, morbid  increases the odds of progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27537097>Hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight or obese women.</a></h2><p> has reached epidemic proportions around the world. Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in  or to greater body mass or body fat. Hormonal contraceptives include oral contraceptives (OCs), injectables, implants, hormonal intrauterine contraception (IUC), the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring. Given the prevalence of overweight and , the public health impact of any effect on contraceptive efficacy could be substantial.To examine the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives in preventing pregnancy among women who are overweight or obese versus women with a lower body mass index (BMI) or weight.Until 4 August 2016, we searched for studies in PubMed (MEDLINE), CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. We examined reference lists of pertinent articles to identify other studies. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional published or unpublished studies.All study designs were eligible. The study could have examined any type of hormonal contraceptive. Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive methods used. The primary outcome was pregnancy. Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for weight or BMI (kg/m(2)).Two authors independently extracted the data. One entered the data into RevMan and a second verified accuracy. The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower weight or BMI. We examined the quality of evidence using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Where available, we included life-table rates. We also used unadjusted pregnancy rates, relative risk (RR), or rate ratio when those were the only results provided. For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI).With 8 studies added in this update, 17 met our inclusion criteria and had a total of 63,813 women. We focus here on 12 studies that provided high, moderate, or low quality evidence. Most did not show a higher pregnancy risk among overweight or obese women. Of five COC studies, two found BMI to be associated with pregnancy but in different directions. With an OC containing norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol (EE), pregnancy risk was higher for overweight women, i.e. with BMI ≥ 25 versus those with BMI < 25 (reported relative risk 2.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13). In contrast, a trial using an OC with  and EE reported a Pearl Index of 0 for obese women (BMI ≥ 30) versus 5.59 for nonobese women (BMI < 30). The same trial tested a transdermal patch containing  and EE. Within the patch group, obese women in the "treatment-compliant" subgroup had a higher reported Pearl Index than nonobese women (4.63 versus 2.15). Of five implant studies, two that examined the six-capsule  implant showed differences in pregnancy by weight. One study showed higher weight was associated with higher pregnancy rate in years 6 and 7 combined (reported P < 0.05). In the other, pregnancy rates differed in year 5 among the lower weight groups only (reported P < 0.01) and did not involve women weighing 70 kg or more.Analysis of data from other contraceptive methods indicated no association of pregnancy with overweight or . These included depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (subcutaneous),  IUC, the two-rod  implant, and the etonogestrel implant.The evidence generally did not indicate an association between higher BMI or weight and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. However, we found few studies for most contraceptive methods. Studies using BMI, rather than weight alone, can provide information about whether body composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness. The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when used according to the recommended regimen.We considered the overall quality of evidence to be low for the objectives of this review. More recent reports provided evidence of varying quality, while the quality was generally low for older studies. For many trials the quality would be higher for their original purpose rather than the non-randomized comparisons here. Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI or contraceptive effectiveness. Newer studies included a greater proportion of overweight or obese women, which helps in examining effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9198174>Oral contraceptives and thrombotic disease: risk of venous thromboembolism.</a></h2><p>Studies conducted in the first three decades after discovery of a link between venous thromboembolism and oral contraceptive users showed a relative risk of first thrombosis during oral contraceptive use of 2.9 (95% CI 0.5-17). In recent studies in which the sub-50 micrograms ethinyl estrodiol containing pills were investigated comparing current users with non-users, the RR is 3.8 for non-fatal deep VTE and 2.7 for superficial VTE, deep VTE and pulmonary embolism (PE) together and 2.1 for fatal VT and PE together. The association is attributed to the estrogenic component and not related to duration of pill use. The risk disappears once the pill has been stopped, and it is not elevated among past users. Smoking does not appear to be risk factor for VTE;  and varicose veins are, at the most, weak risk factors. Since a causal relationship between OC use and VTE is tempting, clues for unraveling the mechanism were sought in the hemostatic system. Studies of the coagulation system found changes in the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic compartments, but within the normal range. An epidemiologic study showed that the risk of VTE among women using OCs is 30-fold increased by the presence of a mutation of factor V, called Factor V Leiden (5% prevalence in the Caucasian population). Selective screening for the mutated factor V should be limited to women with a personal or family history of VTE. Four epidemiologic studies showed a two-fold increase in risk of VTE with the use of OCs containing third-generation progestins (gestodene and desogestrel), relative to second-generations products (). Biases cannot devaluate the conclusion that the increased risk of VTE in especially first-time and younger users of third-generation OCs is highly likely. The clinical consequence is therefore that second-generation OCs are the first choice in prescription to first-time users.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24402597>Low-dose  and ethinyl estradiol patch and pill: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To compare a new low-dose  and ethinyl estradiol contraceptive patch (Patch) with a combination oral contraceptive (Pill; 100 micrograms , 20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol) regarding efficacy, safety, compliance, and unscheduled uterine bleeding.Women (17-40 years; body mass index 16-60) were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to one of two groups: Patch only (13 cycles) or Pill (six cycles) followed by Patch (seven cycles).

Many procedures such as IUD insertion are more challenging in overweight and obese women. The objective of this study was to describe LNG-IUD insertion, continuation, and complications in overweight and obese women in an ethnically diverse population in Hawai'i. A retrospective cohort study of women who had a LNG-IUD inserted at the University of Hawai'i, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Resident and Faculty practice sites between January 2009 and December 2010 was performed. A total of 149 women were followed. The most commonly reported races were Asian (32%), Native Hawaiian (26%), and non-Hawaiian Pacific Islander (20%). The mean BMI of the study population was 28.4 (standard deviation 7.2) with 37% classified as normal weight, 30% as overweight, and 33% as obese. Overall, 76% of women continued the LNG-IUD 12 months after insertion. No statistically significant difference emerged in 12-month IUD continuation between the BMI groups. Difficult (5%) and failed (3%) IUD insertions were rare for all BMI groups. IUD complications occurred in 9% of women and included expulsion and self-removal.

When available, tissue blocks were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining for progesterone receptor expression.A total of 41 patients received treatment for AH/EC with the  intrauterine device. Follow up sufficient to assess response occurred in 36 women (88%). Complete response was documented in 18 of 36 women (50%), no response in 8 patients (22%), partial response in 3 women (8%) and progression of disease in 7 patients (19%). Four of 18 patients with complete response (22%) later experienced relapse of hyperplasia or cancer. Four patients (10%) died during the study period: none had evidence of metastatic disease and 1 of the 4 woman died of perioperative complications following hysterectomy for stage I disease. Patients responding to treatment had significantly lower progesterone receptor expression on post-treatment biopsies.Intrauterine  is a viable treatment option for post-menopausal women with AH/EC who are poor candidates for standard surgical management.

Combined OC formulations (COCs) are safe and effective for healthy women up to the age of the menopause. The use of OCs in women who do not smoke does not result in an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Since the risk of thromboembolism increases with age and the level of  in women of 40 and over, it is wise to prescribe the lowest available dose of ethinyl-estradiol in the COCs. Some authors prefer  to any third-generation progestogen in COCs, but the excess risk of venous thromboembolism associated with the use of third-generation products can be balanced by the reduced risk of myocardial infarction associated with the same products. When OCs are considered for perimenopausal women, it is important to take into account progestogen-only pills. In consequence of the reduced fecundity, these have a better contraceptive efficacy in this age group than in women aged below 35 years. Their only important possible adverse effect is an unpredictable bleeding pattern; further, they do not alleviate climacteric symptoms if these are present. In such cases, progestogen-only pills can be combined with cyclic hormone replacement therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25070547>Correcting oral contraceptive pharmacokinetic alterations due to : a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To determine if increasing the hormone dose or eliminating the hormone-free interval improves key pharmacokinetic (PK) alterations caused by  during oral contraceptive (OC) use.Obese [body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m(2)], ovulatory, otherwise healthy, women received an OC containing 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/100 mcg  (LNG) dosed cyclically (21 days active pills with 7-day placebo week) for two cycles and then were randomized for two additional cycles to the following: continuous cycling (CC, a dose neutral arm using the same OC with no hormone-free interval) or increased dose (ID, a dose escalation arm using an OC containing 30 mcg EE/150 mcg LNG cyclically). During Cycles 2, 3 and 4, outpatient visits were performed to assess maximum serum concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC0-∞) and time to steady state as well as pharmacodynamics. These key PK parameters were calculated and compared within groups between baseline and treatment cycles.A total of 31 women enrolled and completed the study (CC group, n=16; ID group, n=15). Demographics were similar between groups [mean BMI: CC, 38 kg/m(2) (S.D. 5.1); ID, 41 kg/m(2) (S.D. 7.6)]. At baseline, the key LNG PK parameters were no different between groups; average time to reach steady state was 12 days in both groups; Cmax were CC: 3.82±1.28 ng/mL and ID: 3.13±0.87 ng/mL; and AUC0-∞ were CC: 267±115 h ng/mL and ID: 199±75 h ng/mL. Following randomization, the CC group maintained steady-state serum levels whereas the ID group had a significantly higher Cmax (p<.001) but again required 12 days to achieve steady state.

A major factor for this increased malignancy risk is prolonged exposure of the endometrium to unopposed estrogen that results from anovulation. Additionally, secretory endometrium of some women with PCOS undergoing ovulation induction or receiving exogenous progestin exhibits progesterone resistance accompanied by dysregulation of gene expression controlling steroid action and cell proliferation. Endometrial surveillance includes transvaginal ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy to assess thickened endometrium, prolonged amenorrhea, unopposed estrogen exposure or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Medical management for abnormal vaginal bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia consists of estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, cyclic or continuous progestins or a -releasing (Mirena) intrauterine device. Lifestyle modification with caloric restriction and exercise is appropriate to treat  as a concomitant risk factor for developing endometrial disease. An increased risk of ovarian cancer may also exist in some women with PCOS. There are strong data to suggest that oral contraceptive use is protective against ovarian cancer and increases with the duration of therapy. The mechanism of this protection may be through suppression of gonadotropin secretion rather than the prevention of "incessant ovulation". There is no apparent association of PCOS with breast cancer, although the high prevalence of metabolic dysfunction from  is a common denominator for both conditions. Recent data suggest that the use of metformin may be protective for both endometrial and breast cancer. There are insufficient data to evaluate any association between PCOS and vaginal, vulvar and cervical cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Women who have undergone a bariatric surgical procedure are currently advised to delay conception for up to 2 years.We conducted a systematic review of the literature, from database (PubMed) inception through February 2009, to evaluate evidence on the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive use among women with a history of bariatric surgery.From 29 articles, five met review inclusion criteria. One prospective, noncomparative study reported 2 pregnancies among 9 (22%) oral contraceptive (OC) users following biliopancreatic diversion, and one descriptive study reported no pregnancies among an unidentified number of women taking OCs following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Of two pharmacokinetic studies, one found lower plasma levels of norethisterone and  among women having had a jejunoileal bypass, as compared to nonoperated, normal-weight controls. The other study found no difference in plasma levels of D-norgestrel between women having a jejunoileal bypass of either 1:3 or 3:1 ratio between the length of jejunum and ileum left in continuity, but women with a 1:3 ratio had significantly higher plasma levels of D-norgestrel than extremely obese controls not operated upon.Evidence regarding OC effectiveness following a bariatric surgical procedure is quite limited, although no substantial decrease in effectiveness was identified from available studies.

Monkeys were monitored for changes in body weight, levels of physical activity (measured by a triaxial Actical accelerometer), food/caloric intake, percent body fat (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) and metabolism (24 h metabolic rate and serum metabolic substrate and hormone concentrations).All 10 monkeys completed the study protocol with no adverse events. While body weight (-0.73% change) and percent body fat (-1.78% change) of the normal BMI group did not significantly decrease from baseline, obese monkeys showed a significant decrease in body weight (-8.58% change, P < 0.01) and percent body fat (-12.13% change P = 0.02) with OC treatment. In both the obese (P = 0.03) and the normal BMI (P = 0.01) groups, there was a significant increase in basal metabolic rate with OC use. No changes were seen in food intake, activity level or % lean muscle mass with OC use for either BMI-based group.Overall, OC use appears to cause a slight increase in basal metabolic rate in female monkeys, leading to a decrease in body weight and percent body fat in obese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703352>Pharmacokinetics of the 1.5 mg  emergency contraceptive in women with normal, obese and extremely obese body mass index.</a></h2><p>To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  after 1.5 mg oral doses (LNG-EC) in women with normal, obese and extremely obese body mass index (BMI).The 1.5 mg LNG dose was given to healthy, reproductive-age, ovulatory women with normal BMI (mean 22.0), obese (mean 34.4), and extremely obese (mean 46.6 kg/m) BMI.

Perforation of the uterus by an LNG-IUS leading to small bowel obstruction (SBO) has not been reported in the literature.A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. CT scan revealed dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of SBO and an IUD that did not appear within the uterine cavity.

Two bowel loops were twisted around the adhesive band multiple times. The band was taken down at the IUD and the bowel loops were spontaneously freed. The LNG-IUS was removed.Use of the LNG-IUS is on the rise in the United States and is a recommended first-line contraceptive agent in the obese patient.

Oral contraceptive-induced changes in both carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors may contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors for coronary heart disease are reviewed, and oral contraceptive-induced changes in carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism, which may lead to altered risk status for coronary heart disease, are discussed. The importance of methodology in evaluating the results of studies assessing such oral contraceptive-induced changes is stressed. The role of progestins in influencing coronary heart disease risk factors is surveyed, and differences among progestins commonly used in oral contraceptive formulations are discussed. In addition, the effect of various combination oral contraceptives on risk factor status is outlined. Finally, the implications of available evidence for the selection of progestins for oral contraceptive formulations of the future are discussed. Current data indicate that medium- and low-fixed-dose oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen/norethindrone acetate have less metabolic impact than do comparable -containing formulations, including multiphasic formulations. Triphasic formulations may have less effect on coronary heart disease risk factors, although data are not yet conclusive. Novel progestins such as desogestrel may also have lesser effects on metabolic functions, but the reduced androgenicity of such compounds may expose women to an increased risk of estrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11102599>Venous thromboembolism and combined oral contraceptives: does the type of progestogen make a difference?</a></h2><p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is rare in young women but is associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives (OCs).

Adjustment for confounding variables included: body mass index, smoking, asthma, diastolic blood pressure, and a proxy for recent illness. The new analysis of the GPRD showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of VTE among users of third-generation OCs compared with second-generation OCs containing  150 microg plus ethinylestradiol 30 microg. Important associations with idiopathic VTE included: age, , smoking, recent concurrent illness, and asthma.

Serum lipids and lipoproteins were determined in serum and after ultracentrifugation in HDL, LDL and VLDL fractions. In a comparative study on /ethinylestradiol (EE) (n = 10) versus desogestrel/ethinylestradiol (n = 10) the latter combination gave increases in SHBG capacity while the former did not. Similar increases in estrogen-sensitive proteins cortisol binding globulin (CBG) and ceruloplasmin indicated that the estrogenicity and "antiestrogenicity" was the same for the two combinations whereas the androgenicity of  was greater giving a reduction in the EE-induced increase in SHBG (SHBG is increased by estrogens and suppressed by androgens). When giving desogestrel 0.125-0.500 mg and lynestrenol 5 mg alone in daily doses to a group of regularly menstruating women (n = 8) strong suppression of SHBG was achieved while ceruloplasmin, CBG and thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) did not change. TBG is decreased and prealbumin increased by androgenic/anabolic activity but only a moderate increase in prealbumin was found during lynestrenol treatment. The changes in SHBG are probably the result of a dose-dependent receptor interaction related to 17 alpha-alkylation in 19-norsteroids. Twenty women with PCO were treated for 8 months with 0.150 mg desogestrel/0.030 mg EE. Evaluation was done before treatment and after 3 and 8 "pill" cycles regarding androgens, estradiol, SHBG, hirsutism and body weight. Spontaneous menstrual cycles were assessed after treatment. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were studied before treatment and at the end of the third "cycle". In PCO the suppression of increased total and free testosterone levels (in comparison to 22 healthy women) was evident during treatment, concordant with increases in SHBG capacity. Hirsutism was suppressed and body weight was reduced in obese women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23812445>Nonsurgical treatment of endometrial hyperplasia: is the road less traveled the one we should be taking more?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22402256>Quantitative  plasma level measurements in patients with regular and prolonged use of the -releasing intrauterine system.</a></h2><p>The -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is well accepted as an easy-to-use contraceptive with an excellent side-effect profile. It contains a reservoir of 52 mg of  (LNG) with continuous release of the steroid. Its contraceptive use is approved for 5 years. The aim of this study was to determine the plasma concentration of LNG and its variation with time in patients with in-dwelling LNG-IUS Mirena®.In this study, we determined LNG plasma concentrations in 110 women with LNG-IUS at different time points of use. Time from insertion of the system in the study population ranged from 20 days to 11.1 years. Quantitative LNG levels were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay.The mean±SD LNG plasma level in all women was 147±59 pg/mL. A highly significant negative correlation between LNG plasma level and LNG-IUS time of use could be demonstrated. In the first year of use, LNG plasma level was as high as 191±71 pg/mL, decreasing to 157±68 pg/mL in the second year and 134±41 pg/mL in the third year. Even after exceeding the recommended period of LNG-IUS use, systemic LNG concentrations were detectable: 133±38 pg/mL in the sixth year, 133±48 pg/mL in the seventh year and 117±45 pg/mL in the eighth year. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between LNG plasma level and body mass index could be shown.Systemic LNG concentrations can be found in all patients with LNG-IUS IUS. However, concentrations are much lower than in other forms of LNG application. Moreover, this study demonstrates that a systemic effect of LNG-IUS can also be found after the recommended contraceptive lifespan of 5 years.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Weight cycling and weight gain in middle age are risk factors for endometrial cancer. Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of endometrial cancer by up to 81% in obese women who attain and maintain a normal weight. Combined oral contraceptives provide durable protection against endometrial cancer for 30 years or more. Ever use of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and inert intrauterine devices reduce endometrial cancer risk. The first oestrogen-based non-progestin HRT for non-hysterectomised women that contains estradiol and bazedoxifene has an effective protective effect on endometrium. Bisphosphonates reduce endometrial cancer risk. Weight loss and LNG-IUS would seem to be an effective strategy for preventing the development of -driven endometrial cancer in the highest risk women. Future research may identify other safe and effective chemoprevention interventions, such as aspirin, bisphosphonates or metformin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23134558>Efficacy of the  intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in the prevention of the atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer: retrospective data from selected obese menopausal symptomatic women.</a></h2><p>The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of  intrauterine system-releasing (LNG-IUS) insertion in preventing atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) and endometrial cancer (EC) in symptomatic postmenopausal overweight/obese women. A total of 34 overweight/obese postmenopausal women, presenting abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and endometrial hyperplasia (EH), and who were submitted to LNG-IUS insertion, were identified from registry data. Endometrial histology at LNG-IUS insertion showed simple EH in 20 cases (58.8%), complex EH in 14 cases (41.2%). At 36 months, 91% of patients showed no recurrence of AUB and a significant reduction in the mean endometrial thickness (from 8.2 ± 2.2 to 3.2 ± 1.5 mm, p < 0.05) was observed. Histologic regression of EH was observed in 27 (79.4%) and 33 (97.5%) cases at 12 and 36 months, respectively. None of the women in which EH persisted, reported cellular atypia or cancer progression at 12 and 36 months of follow-up. LNG-IUS represents an effective treatment option to manage postmenopausal obese women affected by AUB and EH. The device seems to be able to prevent the onset of AH and EC in women at high risk.

To date, evidence of their long-term efficiency is available. The aim of the present paper was to briefly review beneficial prophylactic effects of the -releasing intrauterine system on the incidence of a variety of malignancies in women. Such an influence is of a particular importance in the light of the currently observed increased prevalence of endometrial and cervical adenocarcinomas. Low-dose releasing intrauterine systems are also available, but the hard evidence-based medical data have been derived primarily for Mirena® (Bayer) device, which topically releases from 20 to 14 pg of  daily. Consequently the risk of developing endometrial carcinoma in Mirena® users is lowered by as much as 50% compared with the general population risk To a lesser extent, the intrauterine system decreases the risk for cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as ovarian, pancreas, and lung carcinomas. In one population-based study Mirena® increased the risk for breast carcinoma by approximately 20%, whereas a number of other studies failed to demonstrate such a hazard. In the recent decades of the increased predominance of insulin resistance and  and an occurrence of hormone-dependent carcinomas at earlier age, a broad application of -releasing intrauterine systems may become a particularly important component of primary prevention of malignancies in women.

Progesterone acts physiologically to counteract the proliferative effects of estradiol during the menstrual cycle. In MHT, progestogens protect the endometrium against the proliferative effects of estrogens in women with a uterus. Recent data suggest that, whereas micronized progesterone is apparently safer for the breast, it could be less efficient than synthetic progestin on the endometrium.

While the mechanism is uncertain, precedence in the literature suggests that this is due to body weight-related differences in metabolism rates.

We investigated the influence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the body mass index (BMI) and serum leptin levels in 20 postmenopausal, nonobese women treated with transdermal HRT (delivery rate 50 microg 17beta-estradiol/24 h, 1 patch per week) for 6 months. Serum leptin levels were measured by ELISA and results were compared by means of the Student's paired t-test or Pearson's correlation. The mean patient age was 55+/-6.04 years. The mean body weight prior to the start of the study was 69.39+/-9.37 kg, and the BMI before HRT was 26.92+/-4.47 kg/m2. Both parameters remained unchanged under therapy. No significant change in absolute serum leptin values (18.8+/-8.4 ng/ml; 20.47+/-9.7 ng/ml; 17.92+/-8.7 ng/ml at 0, 4 and 6 months respectively) or in adiposity-corrected values (serum leptin/BMI) (0.68+/-0.24; 0.75+/-0.29; 0.67+/-0.26 at 0, 4 and 6 months respectively) were found. Serum leptin levels correlated well with BMI (r = 0.7193, p<0.0001). There was no significant correlation of estradiol with serum leptin levels before or during therapy. In summary, low dose, transdermal HRT exhibited no influence on serum leptin levels or BMI in postmenopausal women.

Out of 577 EC patients, 5.1% (n = 30) were ≤ 40 years of age. However, 10 patients had a history of infertility and had been diagnosed during evaluation for infertility. Patients' clinical and laboratory data were reviewed retrospectively.The mean age at diagnosis was 34.3 ± 4.5 years and the mean duration of infertility was 5.1 ± 4.7 years. Immediate staging surgery was performed on three patients. The others were treated with oral megestrol acetate and/or a -containing intrauterine device (IUD) for 6 months.

Participants underwent twice weekly phlebotomy during the study cycle and received up to $360 for participation. Along with other study assays, we analyzed 903 specimens from 181 women to measure LNG to assess OC compliance. Consistently undetectable LNG levels indicated noncompliance. To evaluate predictors of OC noncompliance during this study, we compared the characteristics of compliant and noncompliant participants using multivariable logistic regression. We assigned each participant to a relative poverty level based on US census data; all other individual characteristics came directly from participant responses during the baseline interview.One hundred eighty-one women completed the study; 31 were noncompliant (17%). In multivariable analyses, poverty level was the strongest predictor of noncompliance. Compared with those women in the quartile with the lowest level of residential poverty, other women were far more likely to be noncompliant, especially women in the quartile with the greatest prevalence of poverty (adjusted odds ratio, 8.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-46.1). Additional factors associated with noncompliance were education level less than a bachelor's degree and Hispanic ethnicity. Other demographic and psychometric measures were not associated with compliance.We found that noncompliance was strongly associated with residential poverty level, an indirect measure of individual income. In the United States, poverty is associated with female , Hispanic ethnicity and low education, which were also associated here with noncompliance. Study compensation may motivate poor individuals to participate in clinical trials for income.

To study binding and transport of the gestagens, sex hormone binding globulin levels were determined in these patients, in normal-weight controls, and in unoperated morbidly obese patients. The unoperated morbidly obese patients had significantly decreased levels of sex hormone binding globulin, compared to normal-weight controls and to the jejunoileal bypass patients, whose levels were similar to the controls. The jejunoileal bypass patients had a reduced capacity to absorb oral contraceptive gestagens, although the plasma levels were of the same magnitude found in normal subjects using lower doses of gestagens. However, the gestagen to sex hormone binding globulin ratio was lower in jejunoileal bypass patients, implying reduced biologic activity and thus reduced contraceptive efficiency of the gestagen. There were no enzymatic or morphologic signs of liver dysfunction. No correlations were found between plasma gestagen levels and number or volume of stools, fecal fat excretion, or intravenous C-cholic acid load.

The LNG and ethinyl estradiol (EE) PKs were analyzed utilizing a zero-order absorption (K), two-compartment PK model to evaluate key PK parameters in relation to a range of weights, BMI and body surface area (BSA).Increasing of body habitus metrics is correlated with decreasing C (p<.0001) and AUC (p<.05) for both LNG and EE, but no correlation was found for C (p≥.17). Increasing weight and BMI were associated with a modest increase (p≤.056) of clearance (CL) and appreciable increases of central volume (V, p<.05), distribution clearance (CLd, p≤.001) and peripheral volume (V, p<.0001) for LNG. For EE, increases in CL (p≤.009) were found with greater weight, BMI and BSA. Values of V, CLd and V also increased (p<.0001) in obese subjects. The half-life and steady-state volume were greater among obese women (p<.0001) for both LNG and EE. LNG and EE PK parameters correlated well (p≤.006 for all), indicating that individual subject physiology affected both drugs similarly.The primary effects of  on LNG and EE were a modest increase in CL and a marked increase in distribution parameters. We observed no -related differences in trough LNG and EE concentrations.This population PK analysis demonstrated reduced systemic exposure to LNG/EE oral contraceptives in obese subjects (C and AUC); these particular differences are unlikely to lower contraceptive effectiveness among obese women who are correctly using LNG-containing contraceptives.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Two main methods are currently available: oral pills or the copper-T intrauterine device. In recent years there has been some debate regarding the efficacy of oral therapy in obese women. In this brief commentary we review new evidence, published after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) referral of 2014, relating to the effect of  on the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of  EC in light of some of the concerns that have been raised.  A PubMed literature search ("" and "emergency contraception") was conducted between 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2018; results from the main clinical trials are discussed. Additional literature known to the authors and identified from the reference lists of cited publications was included.  Overall, it should be noted that, in studies which determined pregnancy rates across different weight or BMI categories, the overall pregnancy rate was low (1-2%) and there was no direct evidence that lower  plasma levels contributed to an increased pregnancy rate in obese women. This conclusion was reached by the EMA referral in 2014 and they concluded that emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) could be taken regardless of body weight or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI. Since the EMA review, additional evidence has been published regarding this topic. This includes PK data (which can neither support, nor deny the previously submitted meta-analyses during the Article 31 Referral procedure), or re-analyses of the previously submitted data.  Evidence published since the EMA referral in 2014 does not change the original conclusions of the agency, which recommended that ECPs could be taken regardless of body weight or BMI, as soon as possible after UPSI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569277>Menorrhagia and severe menstrual pain related to the use of adalimumab in a psoriatic.</a></h2><p>The case is reported of a 32-year-old morbidly obese white woman who used adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 4 months for psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis vulgaris and inverse psoriasis with total clearance of her psoriasis who developed menorrhagia (at least twice the number of pads used daily for 4-6 days as opposed to 3-5 days previously) and severe menstrual pain.

Involvement of lipids in chronic cardiovascular conditions, plus long-term use of oral contraceptive tablets, prompted this first 24-cycle study of the effect of triphasic formulations on young women.69 women assigned randomly to an ethinyl estradiol/ formulation (Triphasil) or an ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone formulation (Ortho 7/7/7) and 25 control women (no hormonal contraception) had blood sampled for lipids and lipoproteins pre-trial, and at 3- or 6-cycle intervals for 24 cycles.At cycle 24, control women experienced no significant change from baseline in any variable except apolipoprotein B (apo B). Plasma apo B increased 42% (P < .01), reflecting the LDL apo B increase (42%, P < .01). Both combination formulations significantly increased apo B (plasma, VLDL, IDL and LDL); the increases ranged between 47% and 84%. Plasma apo A1 rose (15%, P < .001) in the Ortho 7/7/7 group only.

Serum samples obtained at several time points during active pill use and hormone-free intervals were analyzed for AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and inhibin B.AMH levels did not differ by OC cycle day in either BMI group. On average, AMH levels were 34% lower in the obese group (2.9+/-2.1 vs. 4.4+/-1.8 ng/mL, p<.05). Modeling to determine differences in AMH throughout the cycle based on  status demonstrated significantly lower levels (p<.05), whereas serum AMH, FSH, LH, estradiol and inhibin B levels revealed no correlations when all time points were included.In reproductive-age women, serum AMH levels do not appear to fluctuate during OC use, but AMH levels are significantly lower in obese women. Lower levels do not appear to be due to differences in gonadotropin levels or ovarian activity.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Both access and available options for emergency contraception have changed over the last several years.Emergency contraceptive pills can be less effective in obese women. The maximum achieved serum concentration of  (LNG) is lower in obese women than women of normal BMI, and doubling the dose of LNG (3 mg) increases its concentration maximum, approximating the level in normal BMI women receiving one dose of LNG. Repeated use of both LNG and ulipristal acetate (UPA) is well tolerated. Hormonal contraception can be immediately started following LNG use, but should be delayed for 5 days after UPA use to avoid dampening the efficacy of UPA. The copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the only IUD approved for emergency contraception (and the most effective method of emergency contraception), but use of LNG IUD as emergency contraception is currently being investigated. Accurate knowledge about emergency contraception remains low both for patients and healthcare providers.Emergency contraception is an important yet underutilized tool available to women to prevent pregnancy. Current options including copper IUD and emergency contraceptive pills are safe and well tolerated.

Therefore, our aim was to examine the effect of COC usage on CYP3A4/5 activity in obese women.Thirty-four, obese (body mass index, BMI > 30 kg m(-2)) women of reproductive age (18-35 years old) were placed on a COC pill containing 20 µg ethinylestradiol/100 µg  for 21 days starting at the onset of menses. A midazolam pharmacokinetic study was conducted prior to initiation and after 21 days of COC treatment. Serial blood samples were collected and plasma concentrations of midazolam were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a non-compartmental method.Midazolam clearance, a surrogate measure of CYP3A4/5 activity, was significantly decreased upon COC use (63.3 l h(-1) vs. 53.9 l h(-1), P < 0.05). A median decrease of 5.6 l h(-1) (95% CI -4.1, 13.3 l h(-1)) was observed.
