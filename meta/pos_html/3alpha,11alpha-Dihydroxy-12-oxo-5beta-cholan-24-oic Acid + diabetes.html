Steroid 5β-reduction is required for the biosynthesis of bile- and the metabolism of all steroid hormones that contain a Δ-3-ketosteroid functionally to yield the 5β-reduced metabolites. In mammalian AKR1D enzymes the conserved catalytic tetrad found in all AKRs (Y55, H117, K84 and D50) has changed in that the conserved H117 is replaced with a glutamic  (E120). E120 may act as a "superacid" to facilitate enolization of the Δ-ketosteroid. In addition, the absence of the bulky imidazole side chain of histidine in E120 permits the steroid to penetrate deeper into the active site so that hydride transfer can occur to the steroid C5 position. In murine steroid 5β-reductase AKR1D4, we find that there is a long-form, with an 18 amino- extension at the N-terminus (AKR1D4L) and a short-form (AKR1D4S), where the latter is recognized as AKR1D4 by the major data-bases. Both enzymes were purified to homogeneity and product profiling was performed. With progesterone and cortisol, AKR1D4L and AKR1D4S catalyzed smooth conversion to the 5β-dihydrosteroids. However, with Δ-androstene-3,17-dione as substrate, a mixture of products was observed which included, 5β-androstane-3,17-dione (expected) but 3α-hydroxy-5β- androstan-17-one was also formed. The latter compound was distinguished from its isomeric 3β-hydroxy-5β-androstan-17-one by forming picolinic  derivatives followed by LC-MS. These data show that AKR1D4L and AKR1D4S also act as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases when presented with Δ-androstene-3,17-dione and suggest that E120 alters the position the steroid to enable a correct trajectory for hydride transfer and may not act as a "superacid".Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the progression of diabetes. In the present study, a high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) analysis was performed to detect potential biomarkers and pathways regulating the mode of onset by comparing subjects who developed and did not develop type 2 DM at the second year in a 3-year prospective cohort study. Metabolic profiles correlated with progression to DM were examined. The subjects (n=98) were classified into four groups: Control (did not develop DM for 3 years), DM (diagnosed with DM at the start of the study), DM onset at the third year and DM onset at the second year. The focus was on the comparison of serum samples of the DM groups with onset at the second and third year from the first year, where these two groups had not developed DM, yet. Analyses involved sample examination using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based HRM and multivariate statistical analysis of the data. Metabolic differences were identified across all analyses with the affected pathways involved in metabolism associated with steroid biosynthesis and bile  biosynthesis. In the first year, higher levels of cholesterol {mass-to charge ratio (m/z) 369.35, (M+H-H2O)+}, 25-hydroxycholesterol [m/z 403.36, (M+H)+], 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestane [m/z 443.33, (M+K)+], 4α-methylzymosterol-4-carboxylate [m/z 425.34, (M+H‑H2O)+], and lower levels of 24,25-dihydrolanosterol [m/z 429.40, (M+H)+] were evident in the group with DM onset at the second year compared with those in the group with DM onset at the third year. These results, with a focus on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, point to important aspects in the development of DM and may aid in the development of more effective means of treatment and prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141356>Bioactivity-Guided Isolation and Identification of Antiadipogenic Compounds in Shiya Tea (Leaves of Adinandra nitida).</a></h2><p> is a worldwide epidemic contributing to a higher risk of developing maladies such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Shiya tea (leaves of Adinandra nitida), a traditional Chinese tea, is widely consumed due to its palatable flavor and various curative effects, such as reducing blood pressure and blood lipids, as well as anti-inflammation, etc. However, no relevant research on the antiobesity effects of Shiya tea has been reported. In particular, no health-benefiting compounds, other than flavonoids, in Shiya tea have been reported. Thus, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have been used as a bioactivity-guided identification model to verify the inhibitory effects of Shiya tea on adipogenesis, as well as to identify antiadipogenic compounds. Four triterpenoid saponins (1-4), including one new compound (2α,3α-dihydroxyursolic  28- O-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, compound 1), and a flavonoid (5) have been identified using NMR (1D and 2D NMR) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS techniques. Compound 1, the major antiadipogenic constituent with an IC value of 27.6 μg/mL, has been identified for the first time in Shiya tea. To understand the structure-activity relationship, three hydrolytic compounds (1s, 2s, and 5s) were obtained to provide an inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. The inhibitory effect of the triterpenoid (1s) possessing no sugar group decreased significantly, while the flavonoid (5s) also without a sugar group showed increased activity. In addition, the hydroxyl group position may also play a role in inhibitory efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro- Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause  and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584465>Interleukin-4 Boosts Insulin-Induced Energy Deposits by Enhancing Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis as the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia, is closely associated with chronic inflammation. We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free   uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the  were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26364215>An evaluation of indirubin analogues as phosphorylase kinase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Phosphorylase kinase (PhK) has been linked with a number of conditions such as glycogen storage diseases, psoriasis, type 2  and more recently, cancer (Camus et al., 2012 [6]). However, with few reported structural studies on PhK inhibitors, this hinders a structure based drug design approach. In this study, the inhibitory potential of 38 indirubin analogues have been investigated. 11 of these ligands had IC50 values in the range 0.170-0.360μM, with indirubin-3'-acetoxime (1c) the most potent. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (13b), an antitumor compound which induces caspase-independent cell-death (Ribas et al., 2006 [20]) is revealed as a specific inhibitor of PhK (IC50=1.8μM). Binding assay experiments performed using both PhK-holo and PhK-γtrnc confirmed the inhibitory effects to arise from binding at the kinase domain (γ subunit). High level computations using QM/MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations were in good agreement with experimental binding data, as determined using statistical analysis, and support binding at the ATP-binding site. The value of a QM description for the binding of halogenated ligands exhibiting σ-hole effects is highlighted. A new statistical metric, the 'sum of the modified logarithm of ranks' (SMLR), has been defined which measures performance of a model for both the "early recognition" (ranking earlier/higher) of active compounds and their relative ordering by potency. Through a detailed structure activity relationship analysis considering other kinases (CDK2, CDK5 and GSK-3α/β), 6'(Z) and 7(L) indirubin substitutions have been identified to achieve selective PhK inhibition. The key PhK binding site residues involved can also be targeted using other ligand scaffolds in future work.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We here explored whether the levels of neuroactive steroids (i.e., neuroprotective agents) in the hippocampus may be altered by short-term diabetes (i.e., one month). To this aim, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry we observed that in the experimental model of the rat raised diabetic by streptozotocin injection, one month of pathology induced changes in the levels of several neuroactive steroids, such as pregnenolone, progesterone and its metabolites (i.e., tetrahydroprogesterone and isopregnanolone) and testosterone and its metabolites (i.e., dihydrotestosterone and 3α-diol). Interestingly these brain changes were not fully reflected by the plasma level changes, suggesting that early phase of diabetes directly affects steroidogenesis and/or steroid metabolism in the hippocampus. These concepts are also supported by the findings that crucial steps of steroidogenic machinery, such as the gene expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (i.e., molecule involved in the translocation of cholesterol into mitochondria) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (i.e., enzyme converting cholesterol into pregnenolone) and 5α-reductase (enzyme converting progesterone and testosterone into their metabolites) are also affected in the hippocampus. In addition, cholesterol homeostasis as well as the functionality of mitochondria, a key organelle in which the limiting step of neuroactive steroid synthesis takes place, are also affected. Data obtained indicate that short-term diabetes alters hippocampal steroidogenic machinery and that these changes are associated with impaired cholesterol homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus, suggesting them as relevant factors for the development of diabetic encephalopathy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighteen young (19-29 yr; n = 9 males and 9 females) and 20 middle- to older-aged (57-82 yr; n = 10 males and 10 females) individuals underwent a 2-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Plasma samples were obtained at baseline and at 30, 50, 90, and 120 min for analysis of lactate, and skeletal muscle biopsies were performed at 60 min for analysis of protein associated with glucose metabolism. In response to insulin, plasma lactate was elevated in aged individuals when normalized to insulin action. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of skeletal muscle PDH on serine sites 232, 293, and 300 decreased in young individuals only. Changes in insulin-stimulated PDH phosphorylation were positively related to changes in plasma lactate. No age-related differences were observed in skeletal muscle phosphorylation of LDH, GSK-3α, or GSK-3β in response to insulin or PDP1, PDP2, PDK2, PDK4, or MPC1 total protein. Twelve weeks of endurance- or strength-oriented exercise training improved insulin-stimulated PDH dephosphorylation, which was related to a reduced lactate response. These findings suggest that impairments in insulin-induced PDH regulation in a sedentary aging population contribute to impaired glucose metabolism and that exercise training is an effective intervention for treating metabolic inflexibility.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28467654>Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C knockout mice show altered neuroactive steroid levels in sciatic nerve.</a></h2><p>Neuroactive steroid levels are altered in several experimental models of peripheral neuropathy, and on this basis, they have been proposed as protective agents. For the first time, the levels of these molecules were assessed here in sterol regulatory element binding protein -1c knock-out male mice (i.e., an experimental model of peripheral neuropathy) and compared with observations in wild type animals. The levels of neuroactive steroids have been evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and sciatic nerve at 2 and 10 months of age and these analyses were implemented analyzing the gene expression of crucial steroidogenic enzymes in sciatic nerve. Data obtained at 2 months of age showed high levels of pregnenolone in sciatic nerve, associated with low levels of its first metabolite, progesterone, and further metabolites (i.e., 5α-pregnane-3,20-dione and 5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one). High levels of testosterone and 17β-estradiol were also observed. At 10 months of age, the neuroactive steroid profile showed some differences. Indeed, low levels of pregnenolone and high levels of 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one and 5α-pregnan-3β-ol-20-one were observed. The analysis of the gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes considered here generally followed these changes. Interestingly, the levels of pregnenolone and progesterone were unmodified in plasma suggesting a specific effect of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c on neurosteroidogenesis. Because this peripheral neuropathy is due to altered   biosynthesis, data reported here support the belief that the cross-talk between this biosynthetic pathway and neuroactive steroids may represent a possible therapeutic strategy for peripheral neuropathy.© 2017 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022842>Capsaicin Analogues Derived from -3 Polyunsaturated Fatty  (PUFAs) Reduce Inflammatory Activity of Macrophages and Stimulate Insulin Secretion by β-Cells In Vitro.</a></h2><p>In this study, two capsaicin analogues, -eicosapentaenoyl vanillylamine (EPVA) and -docosahexaenoyl vanillylamine (DHVA), were enzymatically synthesized from their corresponding -3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty  eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), both dietary relevant components. The compounds significantly reduced the production of some lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (CCL20) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2), by RAW264.7 macrophages. Next to this, only EPVA increased insulin secretion by pancreatic INS-1 832/13 β-cells, while raising intracellular Ca and ATP concentrations. This suggests that the stimulation of insulin release occurs through an increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio in the first phase, while is calcium-mediated in the second phase.

The metabolic products generated by some of these intestinal bacteria have been linked to a number of systemic diseases including  with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, some forms of inflammation, and more recently, systemic hypertension. In this review, we primarily focus on the potential role selected gut bacteria play in metabolizing the endogenous glucocorticoids corticosterone and cortisol. Those generated steroid metabolites, when reabsorbed in the intestine back into the circulation, produce biological effects most notably as inhibitors of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) types 1 and 2. Inhibition of the dehydrogenase actions of 11β-HSD, particularly in kidney and vascular tissue, allows both corticosterone and cortisol the ability to bind to and activate mineralocorticoid receptors with attended changes in sodium handling and vascular resistance leading to increases in blood pressure. In several animal models of hypertension, administration of gut-cleansing antibiotics results in transient resolution of hypertension and transfer of intestinal contents from a hypertensive animal to a normotensive animal produces hypertension in the recipient. Moreover, fecal samples from hypertensive humans transplanted into germ-free mice resulted in hypertension in the recipient mice. Thus, it appears that the intestinal microbiome may not just be an innocent bystander but certain perturbations in the type and number of bacteria may directly or indirectly affect hypertension and other diseases.</p></html>
