Metabolism encompasses the synthesis and breakdown of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids; the generation of energy (ATP); and oxidative phosphorylation. In cancer cells, metabolism can be commandeered to promote tumor growth and cellular proliferation. These alterations in metabolism have emerged as an additional hallmark of various cancers. In this review we focus on metabolic alterations in multiple myeloma (MM) - a malignancy of plasma cells - including derangements in glycolysis, , the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid/amino acid synthesis and degradation. Particular focus is given to metabolic alterations that contribute to myeloma cell growth, proliferation and drug resistance. Finally, novel approaches that target metabolic pathways for the treatment of MM are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591586>Low metformin causes a more oxidized mitochondrial NADH/NAD redox state in hepatocytes and inhibits  by a redox-independent mechanism.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms by which metformin (dimethylbiguanide) inhibits hepatic  at concentrations relevant for type 2 diabetes therapy remain debated. Two proposed mechanisms are 1) inhibition of mitochondrial Complex 1 with consequent compromised ATP and AMP homeostasis or 2) inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) and thereby attenuated transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, resulting in a raised lactate/pyruvate ratio and redox-dependent inhibition of  from reduced but not oxidized substrates. Here, we show that metformin has a biphasic effect on the mitochondrial NADH/NAD redox state in mouse hepatocytes. A low cell dose of metformin (therapeutic equivalent: <2 nmol/mg) caused a more oxidized mitochondrial NADH/NAD state and an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio, whereas a higher metformin dose (≥ nmol/mg) caused a more reduced mitochondrial NADH/NAD state similar to Complex 1 inhibition by rotenone. The low metformin dose inhibited  from both oxidized (dihydroxyacetone) and reduced (xylitol) substrates by preferential partitioning of substrate toward glycolysis by a redox-independent mechanism that is best explained by allosteric regulation at phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and/or fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) in association with a decrease in cell glycerol 3-phosphate, an inhibitor of PFK1, rather than by inhibition of transfer of reducing equivalents. We conclude that at a low pharmacological load, the metformin effects on the lactate/pyruvate ratio and glucose production are explained by attenuation of transmitochondrial electrogenic transport mechanisms with consequent compromised malate-aspartate shuttle and changes in allosteric effectors of PFK1 and FBP1.© 2019 Alshawi and Agius.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890173>Precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli for efficient tyrosine production from acetate.</a></h2><p>Acetate is one of promising feedstocks owing to its cheap price and great abundance. Considering that tyrosine production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from acetate can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production.Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of tyrosine from acetate. Initially, the acetate uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward tyrosine. As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/L tyrosine with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain.Tyrosine production from acetate requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and ' untranslated regions (UTRs). This is the first demonstration of tyrosine production from acetate. Our strategies would be widely applicable to the production of various chemicals from acetate in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082009>Diabetic Perioperative Management.</a></h2><p>In both diabetic and non-diabetic population, hyperglycemia in the perioperative period is an independent marker of poor surgical outcomes (delayed wound healing, increased rate of infection, prolonged hospital stay, higher postoperative mortality).[1][2][3][4] Hyperglycemia (greater than 140 mg/dl) is a frequent occurrence with a prevalence of 20 to 40% in the general surgery and 80 to 90% in the cardiac surgery population.[2][4][][6] The stress of surgery, anesthesia, and illness increases secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, catecholamines), which in turn causes decreased insulin secretion, increased insulin resistance, decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased lipolysis and proteolysis.

Understanding the genetic regulation of biofilm formation in S. aureus is central to a precise definition of the conditions and genes involved in development of chronic biofilm-associated infections. Biofilm-related genes have been detected by comparing mutants using the classical submerged biofilm formation assay, in which cells adhere to the bottom of a well containing culture medium. We recently developed an alternative biofilm formation model for S. aureus, based on macrocolony formation on agar plates, comparable to an assay used to study biofilm formation in a few other bacterial species. As organism features are the result of environmental conditions as well as of genes, we used a genome-wide collection of transposon-mapped mutants in this macrocolony assay to seek S. aureus developmental genes and pathways not identified by the classical biofilm formation assay. We identified routes related to glucose and purine metabolism and clarified their regulatory link to macrocolony formation. Our study demonstrates that formation of microbial communities must be correlated to specific growth conditions, and the role of metabolism must be considered in S. aureus biofilm formation and thus, in the development of chronic infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717766>PCK1 negatively regulates cell cycle progression and hepatoma cell proliferation via the AMPK/p27 axis.</a></h2><p>Altered glucose metabolism endows tumor cells with metabolic flexibility for biosynthesis requirements. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), a key enzyme in the  pathway, is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and predicts poor prognosis. Overexpression of PCK1 has been shown to suppress liver tumor growth, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.mRNA and protein expression patterns of PCK1, AMPK, pAMPK, and the CDK/Rb/E2F pathway were determined using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Cell proliferation ability and cell cycle were assessed by MTS assay and flow cytometric analysis. The effect of PCK1 on tumor growth was examined in xenograft implantation models.Both gain and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that PCK1 deficiency promotes hepatoma cell proliferation through inactivation of AMPK, suppression of p27 expression, and stimulation of the CDK/Rb/E2F pathway, thereby accelerating cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase under glucose-starved conditions. Overexpression of PCK1 reduced cellular ATP levels and enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and p27 expression but decreased Rb phosphorylation, leading to cell cycle arrest at G1. AMPK knockdown significantly reversed G1-phase arrest and growth inhibition of PCK1-expressing SK-Hep1 cells. In addition, the AMPK activator metformin remarkably suppressed the growth of PCK1-knockout PLC/PRF/ cells and inhibited tumor growth in an orthotropic HCC mouse model.This study revealed that PCK1 negatively regulates cell cycle progression and hepatoma cell proliferation via the AMPK/p27 axis and supports a potential therapeutic and protective effect of metformin on HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862092>Dietary Eriodictyol Alleviates Adiposity, Hepatic Steatosis, Insulin Resistance, and Inflammation in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity effect of flavonoid eriodictyol (ED) supplementation in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were fed with normal diet (ND), HFD (40 kcal% fat), or HFD + 0.005% (/) ED for 16 weeks. In HFD-induced obese mice, dietary ED supplementation significantly alleviated dyslipidemia and adiposity by downregulating the expression of lipogenesis-related genes in white adipose tissue (WAT), while enhancing fecal lipid excretion. ED additionally improved hepatic steatosis and decreased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by downregulating the expression of hepatic enzymes and the genes involved in lipogenesis and upregulating the expression of hepatic fatty acid oxidation-related enzymes and genes. In addition, ED improved insulin resistance (IR) by suppressing hepatic , enhancing glucose utilization, and modulating the production and release of two incretin hormones, namely gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Taken together, the current findings indicated that ED can protect against diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disturbances, including dyslipidemia, inflammation, fatty liver disease, and IR in diet-induced obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30969662>Physiology, Neonatal.</a></h2><p>The neonatal period is the period of the most dramatic physiologic changes that occur during human life. While the respiratory and cardiovascular systems change immediately at birth, other organ systems evolve slowly with time until the transition from intrauterine to adult physiology is complete. The transitional period of the newborn is a critical time for humans to adapt to life outside the womb.  There are distinct physiologic changes that take place during this period, especially regarding the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The loss of the low-pressure placenta and its ability to facilitate gas exchange, circulation and waste management for the fetus creates a need for physiologic adaptation. Premature birth can significantly thwart these physiologic changes from occurring as they should.  The endocrine system, specifically the release of cortisol via the hypothalamus, is responsible for lung maturation of the fetus and the neonate. There is a “cortisol surge” that begins with cortisol levels of  to 10mcg/ml at 30 weeks gestational age, 20 mcg/ml at 36 weeks, 46mcg/ml at 40 weeks, and 200mcg/ml during labor.[1]  Cortisol is responsible for lung maturation, thyroid hormone secretion, hepatic , catecholamine secretion, and the production of digestive enzymes.  Mature thyroid function is thought to help prepare the neonatal cardiovascular system as well as aid in the regulation of temperature.  Following clamping of the umbilical cord and the first breath of life, arterial oxygen tension increases and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases facilitating gas exchange in the lungs.  Subsequent pulmonary blood flow will cause an increase in left atrial pressure and a reduction in right atrial pressure.  Changes in the PO2, PCO2, and pH are contributing factors to these physiologic changes in the newborn.  Lung surfactant plays a critical role in these changes allowing the lungs to mature upon delivery.  Remnants of fetal circulation (ductus arteriosus, foramen ovale, ductus venosus) will also gradually recede during this neonatal period, defined as up to 44 weeks postconceptual age.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966751>Integrated Tear Proteome and Metabolome Reveal Panels of Inflammatory-Related Molecules via Key Regulatory Pathways in Dry Eye Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a growing public health concern with a high global prevalence; however, the fundamental processes involved in its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we applied nanoscale liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) and ultraperformance LC/Q-TOF-MS/MS technologies on tear samples obtained from 18 dry eye patients and 19 healthy controls for integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Overall, 1031 tear proteins were detected, while 190 proteins were determined to be significantly expressed in dry eye patients. Further functional analysis suggested that various biological processes were highly expressed and involved in the pathogenesis of DES, especially immune and inflammatory processes. In total, 156 named metabolites were identified, among which 34 were found to be significantly changed in dry eye patients. The results highlighted the key elements, especially inflammatory-related proteins and metabolites that played important roles in the development of DES. Further, the regulatory roles of primary pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades, glycolysis/, and amino acid metabolism, were also identified as processes involved in DES. Collectively, our work not only provided insight into the potential biomarkers of DES for diagnostic and prognostic purposes but extended our knowledge of the physiopathology of this syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798914>Fructose-associated hepatotoxicity indexed by the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-.</a></h2><p>Modern diets have become increasingly rich in fructose, for example through the addition of high-fructose corn syrup to many foods and drinks. It has been suggested that this might lead to hepatotoxicity, including the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. After entering hepatocytes via insulin-independent glucose transporter 2 transmembrane carrier proteins, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate in a reaction catalysed by fructokinase (ketohexokinase). In turn, fructose-1-phosphate is hydrolysed by aldolase B to glyceraldehydes. Glyceraldehydes may enter  via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehydes may also enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate. The last pathway involves conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate may be converted, via the action of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-, into lactate. In liver damage, the LDH- isoenzyme becomes elevated, predominantly in serum/plasma. We therefore hypothesised that if dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity, there should be a positive correlation between erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and plasma LDH-. This hypothesis was tested by assaying venous blood samples taken from 39 patients at rest, three hours after eating. Quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis was used to assay erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate levels. Similarly, plasma LDH- concentrations were spectrophotometrically analysed, using the pyruvate-lactate reaction, following electrophoretic separation of the LDH isoenzymes. A significant positive correlation was found between the two variables (r = 0.44, p = 0.0047). This result, which supports our hypothesis, is evidence in favour of the possibility that dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition to being a marker of hepatic damage, LDH- may play a more direct epigenetic role in causing liver damage; acute hepatic injury is associated with nuclear translocation of LDH, causing the production of lactate from pyruvate in the nucleus; in turn, the lactate inhibits histone deacetylase and is associated with upregulation of genes associated with the damage response, leading to cell death.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Several recent studies demonstrated that ginsenosides have potential anti-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) properties. To evaluate the anti-T2DM effect of G-Rk3 and verify its potential mechanism, a high-fat-diet/streptozocin (HFD/STZ) induced model of T2DM in C57BL/6 mice and a high glucose induced insulin resistance model of HepG2 cells were applied in this research. Our analysis indicated that G-Rk3 reduced HFD/STZ induced hyperglycemia, and serum insulin and inflammation levels, and ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, and prevented liver histological changes. Furthermore, it also significantly reduced lipid accumulation as shown by lower TG, LDL-C and TC serum concentrations and Oil Red O staining in liver tissues. The hypoglycemic effect of G-Rk3 seemed to be partially mediated via the inhibition of hepatic , which was supported by the activated p-Akt, p-FoxO1 and GLUT2 and inhibited FoxO1, PEPCK and G6pase protein expressions in the liver as well as increased glucose uptake in high glucose induced HepG2 cells. The gene expressions of hepatic  were also down-regulated by G-Rk3 in HFD/STZ induced T2DM mice. In addition, G-Rk3 suppressed HFD/STZ induced lipid accumulation by regulating related gene and protein expressions such as p-ACC, FAS and SREBP-1, which are the downstream targets of AMPK. AMPK and Akt inhibitors significantly reversed G-Rk3 mediated hepatic  and lipid accumulation. Thus, our study is the first to illustrate that G-Rk3 mediates hepatic  and lipid accumulation via activating the AMPK/Akt signaling pathway in HFD/STZ induced T2DM mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30196592>Transcriptional Response and Enhanced Intestinal Adhesion Ability of  GG after Acid Stress.</a></h2><p> GG (LGG) is a probiotic commonly used in fermented dairy products. In this study, RNA-sequencing was performed to unravel the effects of acid stress on LGG. The transcriptomic data revealed that the exposure of LGG to acid at pH 4. (resembling the final pH of fermented dairy products) for 1 h or 24 h provoked a stringent-type transcriptomic response wherein stress response- and glycolysis-related genes were upregulated, whereas genes involved in , amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism were suppressed.

Since the rate of protein synthesis is relatively low in the post-absorptive state, the aim of this research was to determine whether leucine supplementation could increase the post-absorptive essential amino acid (EAA) utilization and protein synthesis in the skeletal muscle. Ten male neonatal dairy calves (38 ± 3 kg) were randomly assigned to either the control (CON, no leucine supplementation, n = ) or supplementation with 1.435 g leucine/L milk (LEU, n = ). Results showed that leucine significantly increased the length and protein concentration in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle, whereas it decreased creatinine concentration and glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) activity. Compared to the control group, leucine supplementation also reduced the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity. Supplementation of leucine improved the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and substrates ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K). Supplementation of leucine resulted in increased concentrations of glucose, methionine, threonine, histidine and EAAs and decreased concentration of arginine in serum. Liver glucose concentration was higher and pyranic acid was lower in LEU compared to CON. In conclusion, leucine supplementation can promote post-absorptive EAA utilization and hepatic , which contributes to protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of dairy calves.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369364>Comparative proteomic analysis of plant-pathogen interactions in resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes infected with .</a></h2><p>Poplar are important forestry species in China, but the  pathogen causes serious economic losses worldwide. To identify candidate  resistance proteins and explore the molecular mechanisms involved in poplar-pathogen interactions, proteomic responses of stem samples from resistant and susceptible poplar ecotypes to  were investigated using nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with label-free quantitative analysis. We identified 588 proteins, divided into 21 biological process categories including 48 oxidoreductases, 72 hydrolytic enzymes, 80 metabolic enzymes, and 29 proteins of unknown function. Differential proteome analysis revealed large differences between resistant P. tomentosa and susceptible  Hsu ecotypes before and after inoculation. Among 102 identified proteins, 22 were highly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated in the susceptible genotype. Proteins induced in P. tomentosa in response to B. dothidea are associated with plant defenses including oxidoreductase activity (catalase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism (alcohol dehydrogenase), photosynthesis (ATP synthase subunit alpha, ATP synthase gamma chain, photosystem I P700 chlorophyll a apoprotein A2, photosystem II CP47 chlorophyll apoprotein), carbon fixation (pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, malic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase, ribulose-1,-bisphosphate carboxylase, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain), and glycolysis/ (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase).

The process of GABA formation in wheat bran also led to an increased level of phenolic compounds with enhanced antioxidant capacity 2 times higher than the untreated status. The interventional effect of a diet containing GABA-enriched bran on hyperinsulinemia induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) was investigated in a rat model. The results showed that, when compared with animals fed with HFD-containing untreated bran (NB group), the consumption of HFD-containing GABA-enriched bran (GB group) demonstrated a greater improvement of insulin resistance/sensitivity as revealed by the changes in the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). The expression of hepatic genes, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp7a1) and ubiquitin C (Ubc), which are involved in the adipogenesis-associated PPAR signalling pathway, was found to be significantly down-regulated in the GB group compared with the HFD group (P = 0.0055). Meanwhile, changes in the expression of a number of genes associated with lipid metabolism and  were also noted in the GB group versus the HFD group, but not in the NB group, indicating different regulatory patterns between the two brans in a high-fat diet.

We identified 5932 high-confidence proteins; 1494 were differentially abundant between the two samples, including 749 up- and 745 down-regulated proteins. The up- and down-regulated proteins that could be essential for anther development and male sterility in sterile buds were mainly involved in (1) carbohydrate and energy metabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase, /gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism), (2) pollen wall synthesis and regulation (pectinesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, beta-galactosidase, glycosyl hydrolase), (3) protein synthesis and degradation (proteasome subunits, ribosome proteins, ABC transporters, RNA transport, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum), (4) flavonoid biosynthesis, and () plant hormone signal transduction. We identified 10 genes/proteins that were both up-regulated and 122 that were both down-regulated in a conjoint analysis. Multiple reaction monitoring and qRT-PCR validation showed that the iTRAQ results were accurate and reliable. These findings will provide valuable information on proteins involved in anther development, and will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie male sterility in Chinese cabbage. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chinese cabbage is an allogamous plant with bisexual flowers that displays significant heterosis. The application of male sterile lines is a very efficient way to produce hybrid seeds, which can generate stronger plants that develop more rapidly and produce higher yield. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage is unknown. In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach (iTRAQ) to identify DAPs between fertile and sterile buds of the GMS line 'AB01'. Subsequently, we also performed conjoined analysis of the iTRAQ results and our previously reported transcriptomics results. The aim of this research was to obtain the key DAPs and to identify the significantly enriched pathways involved in anther development and male sterility. These results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying multiple-allele-inherited male sterility in Chinese cabbage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

While physiological ketosis is often adaptive, chronic hyperketonemia may contribute to the metabolic dysfunction of NAFLD. To understand how β-OH butyrate signaling affects hepatic metabolism, we compared the hepatic fasting response in control and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase II (HMGCS2) knockdown mice that are unable to elevate β-OH butyrate production. To establish that rescue of ketone metabolic/endocrine signaling would restore the normal hepatic fasting response, we gave intraperitoneal injections of β-OH butyrate (.7 mmol/kg) to HMGCS2 knockdown and control mice every 2 h for the final 9 h of a 16-h fast. In hypoketonemic, HMGCS2 knockdown mice, fasting more robustly increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a protein critical for supporting fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. In turn, exogenous β-OH butyrate administration to HMGCS2 knockdown mice decreased fasting UCP2 mRNA expression to that observed in control mice. Also supporting feedback at the transcriptional level, β-OH butyrate lowered the fasting-induced expression of HMGCS2 mRNA in control mice. β-OH butyrate also regulates the glycemic response to fasting. The fast-induced fall in serum glucose was absent in HMGCS2 knockdown mice but was restored by β-OH butyrate administration. These data propose that endogenous β-OH butyrate signaling transcriptionally regulates hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, while modulating glucose tolerance.  Ketogenesis regulates whole body glucose metabolism and β-OH butyrate produced by the liver feeds back to inhibit hepatic β-oxidation and ketogenesis during fasting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141525>Glucose metabolism is differentially altered by choline and methionine in bovine neonatal hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Choline and methionine serve essential roles in the liver that may interact with glucose metabolism. Our objectives were to quantify glucose export, cellular glycogen, and expression of genes controlling oxidation and gluconeogenesis in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes exposed to increasing concentrations of choline chloride (CC) and D,L-methionine (DLM) with or without fatty acids (FA). Primary hepatocytes isolated from 3 Holstein calves were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before treatment with CC (61, 128, 2028, 4528 μmol/L) and DLM (16, 30, 100, 300 μmol/L) with or without a 1 mmol/L FA cocktail in a factorial design. After 24 h, media was harvested to quantify glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and cells harvested to quantify glycogen, DNA, and gene expression. No interactions between CC and DLM were detected. The potential two-way interaction between CC or DLM and FA was partitioned into three contrasts when P ≤ 0.20: linear without FA, linear with FA, difference of slope. Fatty acids did not affect glucose or cellular glycogen but increased pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKc, PEPCKm), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) expression. Increasing CC decreased glucose but increased cellular glycogen. Expression of PC and PEPCKc was increased by CC during FA treatment. Increasing DLM did not affect metabolites or PC expression, although PEPCKc was marginally decreased. Methionine did not affect G6PC, while CC had a marginal quadratic effect on G6PC. Oxidative and gluconeogenic enzymes appear to respond to FA in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes. Increased PC and PEPCKc by CC during FA treatment suggest increased gluconeogenic capacity. Changes in G6PC may have shifted glucose-6-phosphate towards cellular glycogen; however, subsequent examination of G6PC protein is needed. Unaltered PC and marginally decreased PEPCKc suggest increased oxidative capacity with DLM, although BHB export was unaltered.

We aimed to optimize a protocol that measures hepatic anaplerotic contribution for GNG, TG synthesis, and hepatic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity using a single dose of oral [UC]glycerol paired with an oral sugar tolerance test (OSTT) in a population with significant insulin resistance. The OSTT (75 g glucose + 25 g fructose) was administered to eight obese adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) followed by ingestion of [U-C]glycerol at  = 180 or  = 210 min. C-labeling patterns of serum glucose and TG-glycerol were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. C enrichment in plasma TG-glycerol was detectable and stable from 240 to 390 min with the [U-C]glycerol drink at  = 180 min(3.65 ± 2.3 to 4.47 ± 1.4%;  > 0.4), but the enrichment was undetectable at 240 min with the glycerol drink at  = 210 min. The relative contribution from anaplerosis was determined at the end of the OSTT [18. ±3.4% ( = 180 min) vs. 16.0 ± 3.% ( = 210 min);  = 0.27]. [U-C]glycerol was incorporated into GNG 390 min after the OSTT with an enrichment of 7.-12.%. Glucose derived from TCA cycle activity was 0.3-1%, and the PPP activity was 2.8-4.7%. In conclusion, it is possible to obtain relative measurements of hepatic anaplerotic contribution to both GNG and TG esterification following an OSTT in a highly insulin-resistant population using a minimally invasive technique. Tracer administration should be timed to allow enough de novo TG esterification and endogenous glucose release after the sugar drink.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383867>Glycerol supports growth of the Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms in the absence of glucose: Analysis of metabolic adaptations on glycerol-rich conditions.</a></h2><p>The bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei (BSF), the parasite protist causing sleeping sickness, primarily proliferate in the blood of their mammalian hosts. The skin and adipose tissues were recently identified as additional major sites for parasite development. Glucose was the only carbon source known to be used by bloodstream trypanosomes to feed their central carbon metabolism, however, the metabolic behaviour of extravascular tissue-adapted parasites has not been addressed yet. Since the production of glycerol is an important primary function of adipocytes, we have adapted BSF trypanosomes to a glucose-depleted but glycerol-rich culture medium (CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc) and compared their metabolism and proteome to those of parasites grown in standard glucose-rich conditions (CMM_Glc). BSF were shown to consume 2-folds more oxygen per consumed carbon unit in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc and were 11.-times more sensitive to SHAM, a specific inhibitor of the plant-like alternative oxidase (TAO), which is the only mitochondrial terminal oxidase expressed in BSF. This is consistent with (i) the absolute requirement of the mitochondrial respiratory activity to convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as deduced from the updated metabolic scheme and (ii) with the 1.8-fold increase of the TAO expression level compared to the presence of glucose. Proton NMR analysis of excreted end products from glycerol and glucose metabolism showed that these two carbon sources are metabolised through the same pathways, although the contributions of the acetate and succinate branches are more important in the presence of glycerol than glucose (10.2% versus 3.4% of the excreted end products, respectively). In addition, metabolomic analyses by mass spectrometry showed that, in the absence of glucose, 13C-labelled glycerol was incorporated into hexose phosphates through . As expected, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of glycerol kinase expression abolished glycerol metabolism and was lethal for BSF grown in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc. Interestingly, BSF have adapted their metabolism to grow in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc by concomitantly increasing their rate of glycerol consumption and decreasing that of glucose. However, the glycerol kinase activity was 7.8-fold lower in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc, as confirmed by both western blotting and proteomic analyses. This suggests that the huge excess in glycerol kinase that is not absolutely required for glycerol metabolism, might be used for another yet undetermined non-essential function in glucose rich-conditions. Altogether, these data demonstrate that BSF trypanosomes are well-adapted to glycerol-rich conditions that could be encountered by the parasite in extravascular niches, such as the skin and adipose tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195924>Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate-DNA nanoparticles to knockdown glutamate dehydrogenase expression impairs transdeamination and  in the liver.</a></h2><p>Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) plays a major role in amino acid catabolism. To increase the current knowledge of GDH function, we analysed the effect of GDH silencing on liver intermediary metabolism from gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Sequencing of GDH cDNA from S. aurata revealed high homology with its vertebrate orthologues and allowed us to design short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to knockdown GDH expression. Following validation of shRNA-dependent downregulation of S. aurata GDH in vitro, chitosan-tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid encoding a selected shRNA (pCpG-sh2GDH) were produced to address the effect of GDH silencing on S. aurata liver metabolism. Seventy-two hours following intraperitoneal administration of chitosan-TPP-pCpG-sh2GDH, GDH mRNA levels and immunodetectable protein decreased in the liver, leading to reduced GDH activity in both oxidative and reductive reactions to about 53-55 % of control values. GDH silencing decreased glutamate, glutamine and aspartate aminotransferase activity, while increased 2-oxoglutarate content, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase/fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity ratio. Our findings show for the first time that GDH silencing reduces transdeamination and  in the liver, hindering the use of amino acids as gluconeogenic substrates and enabling protein sparing and metabolisation of dietary carbohydrates, which would reduce environmental impact and production costs of aquaculture.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is also a well-known inhibitor of mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. MICA was extensively studied in the 1960s and 1970s and was once tested for its antidiabetic effect in diabetic Chinese hamsters, whereby MICA was shown to exhibit pronounced glucose-lowering ability while also leading to increased rate of death of the diabetic animals. Since then, MICA's potential ability in lowering blood glucose in diabetes has never been revisited. In my opinion, MICA should be comprehensively reexplored for its antidiabetic properties in a variety of rodent diabetes models. For a given animal model, its dose-dependent effect and the effects of different routes of administrations as well as its synergistic effects with other glucose-lowering drugs should also be investigated.

As the major SphK isoform in the liver, much less is known the role of SphK2 involved in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism.In this study, RNA interference, real time RT-PCR, western blot and immunoprecipitation method was used to investigate the regulation of SphK2 in hepatic glucose metabolism.Both siRNA and SphK2 inhibitor ABC294640 stimulated expression of gluconeogenetic gene PEPCK and G6Pase but not enzymes of hepatic glycogenolysis, glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. Inhibition of SphK2 also prevented insulin repressed PEPCK and G6Pase expression as well as glucose production levels. Furtherly, inhibition of SphK2 inactivated STAT3 by decreasing both phosphorylation on Tyr705 and acetylation on lysine residue, and led to stimulation of PEPCK and G6Pase expression. Inhibition of SphK2 also prevented IL-6 dependent activation of STAT3 and suppression of PEPCK and G6pase expression both in vitro and in vivo.Our study suggests that SphK2 participates in hepatic glucose metabolism related to activation of STAT3.Copyright © 2018 IMSS.

Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation: 21±2 years, ±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p<0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p<0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that p-values approached statistical significance for both myosin and actin (p = 0.052 and p = 0.055, respectively), and forced post hoc tests indicated concentrations for both proteins decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p<0.05 for each target). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p<0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the /gluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. <0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value <0.05): a)  (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis ( proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (+66%, p<0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~-50%, p<0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may: a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in  and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666474>The Effects of BCAAs on Insulin Resistance in Athletes.</a></h2><p>The toxic catabolic intermediates of branched chain amino acids can cause insulin resistance, and are involved in different mechanisms in different metabolic tissues. In skeletal muscle, 3-hydroxy-isobutyrate produced by valine promotes skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake, resulting in the accumulation of incompletely oxidized lipids in skeletal muscle, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In the liver, branched-chain α-keto acids decompose in large amounts, promote hepatic , and lead to the accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, which damages the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in the accumulation of incomplete oxidation products, oxidative stress in mitochondria, and hepatic insulin resistance. In adipose tissue, the expression of branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzymes (branched-chain amino acid transaminase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase) is reduced, resulting in an increased level of plasma branched-chain amino acids, thereby causing massive decomposition of branched-chain amino acids in tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver, and inducing insulin resistance. However, branched-chain amino acids, as a common nutritional supplement for athletes, do not induce insulin resistance. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that exercise can enhance the mitochondrial oxidative potential of branched-chain amino acids, alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid catabolic intermediates, and promotes branched-chain amino acids catabolism into beta-aminoisobutyric acid, increasing plasma beta-aminoisobutyric acid concentration, improving insulin resistance. This article reveals the mechanism of BCAA-induced insulin resistance and the relationship between exercise and BCAAs metabolism, adds a guarantee for the use of BCAAs, and provides a new explanation for the occurrence of diabetes and how exercise improves diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30065033>PDK4 Deficiency Suppresses Hepatic Glucagon Signaling by Decreasing cAMP Levels.</a></h2><p>In fasting or diabetes, gluconeogenic genes are transcriptionally activated by glucagon stimulation of the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA)-CREB signaling pathway. Previous work showed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibition in skeletal muscle increases pyruvate oxidation, which limits the availability of gluconeogenic substrates in the liver. However, this study found upregulation of hepatic PDK4 promoted glucagon-mediated expression of gluconeogenic genes, whereas knockdown or inhibition of hepatic PDK4 caused the opposite effect on gluconeogenic gene expression and decreased hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, PDK4 deficiency decreased ATP levels, thus increasing phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), which increased p-AMPK-sensitive phosphorylation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 4B (p-PDE4B). This reduced cAMP levels and consequently p-CREB. Metabolic flux analysis showed that the reduction in ATP was a consequence of a diminished rate of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). However, overexpression of PDK4 increased FAO and increased ATP levels, which decreased p-AMPK and p-PDE4B and allowed greater accumulation of cAMP and p-CREB. The latter were abrogated by the FAO inhibitor etomoxir, suggesting a critical role for PDK4 in FAO stimulation and the regulation of cAMP levels. This finding strengthens the possibility of PDK4 as a target against diabetes.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29960865>The role of kidney in the inter-organ coordination of endogenous glucose production during fasting.</a></h2><p>The respective contributions to endogenous glucose production (EGP) of the liver, kidney and intestine vary during fasting. We previously reported that the deficiency in either hepatic or intestinal  modulates the repartition of EGP via glucagon secretion (humoral factor) and gut-brain-liver axis (neural factor), respectively. Considering renal  reportedly accounted for approximately 50% of EGP during fasting, we examined whether a reduction in renal  could promote alterations in the repartition of EGP in this situation.We studied mice whose glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic subunit (G6PC) is specifically knocked down in the kidneys (K-G6pc mice) during fasting. We also examined the additional effects of intestinal G6pc deletion, renal denervation and vitamin D administration on the altered glucose metabolism in K-G6pc mice.Compared with WT mice, K-G6pc mice exhibited (1) lower glycemia, (2) enhanced intestinal but not hepatic G6Pase activity, (3) enhanced hepatic glucokinase (GK encoded by Gck) activity, (4) increased hepatic glucose-6-phosphate and () hepatic glycogen spared from exhaustion during fasting. Increased hepatic Gck expression in the post-absorptive state could be dependent on the enhancement of insulin signal (AKT phosphorylation) in K-G6pc mice. In contrast, the increase in hepatic GK activity was not observed in mice with both kidney- and intestine-knockout (KI-G6pc mice). Hepatic Gck gene expression and hepatic AKT phosphorylation were reduced in KI-G6pc mice. Renal denervation by capsaicin did not induce any effect on glucose metabolism in K-G6pc mice. Plasma level of 1,25 (OH) D, an active form of vitamin D, was decreased in K-G6pc mice. Interestingly, the administration of 1,25 (OH) D prevented the enhancement of intestinal  and hepatic GK activity and blocked the accumulation of hepatic glycogen otherwise observed in K-G6pc mice during fasting.A diminution in renal  that is accompanied by a decrease in blood vitamin D promotes a novel repartition of EGP among glucose producing organs during fasting, featured by increased intestinal  that leads to sparing glycogen stores in the liver. Our data suggest a possible involvement of a crosstalk between the kidneys and intestine (via the vitamin D system) and the intestine and liver (via a neural gut-brain axis), which might take place in the situations of deficient renal glucose production, such as chronic kidney disease.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We performed non-targeted, accurate semiquantitative metabolomic analysis of human whole blood, plasma, and red blood cells during 34-58 hr fasting of four volunteers. During this period, 44 of ~130 metabolites increased 1.~60-fold. Consistently fourteen were previously reported. However, we identified another 30 elevated metabolites, implicating hitherto unrecognized metabolic mechanisms induced by fasting. Metabolites in pentose phosphate pathway are abundant, probably due to demand for antioxidants, NADPH,  and anabolic metabolism. Global increases of TCA cycle-related compounds reflect enhanced mitochondrial activity in tissues during fasting. Enhanced purine/pyrimidine metabolites support RNA/protein synthesis and transcriptional reprogramming, which is promoted also by some fasting-related metabolites, possibly via epigenetic modulations. Thus diverse, pronounced metabolite increases result from greatly activated catabolism and anabolism stimulated by fasting. Anti-oxidation may be a principal response to fasting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920846>Intestinal serine protease inhibition increases FGF21 and improves metabolism in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Trypsin is the major serine protease responsible for intestinal protein digestion. An inhibitor, camostat (CS), reduced weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rats; however, the mechanisms for these are largely unknown. We reasoned that CS creates an apparent dietary protein restriction, which is known to increase hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Therefore, metabolic responses to CS and a gut-restricted CS metabolite, FOY-251, were measured in mice. Food intake, body weight, blood glucose, branched-chain amino acids (LC/MS), hormone levels (ELISA), liver pathology (histology), and transcriptional changes (qRT-PCR) were measured in , lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice. In  mice, CS in chow (9-69 mg/kg) or FOY-251 (46 mg/kg) reduced food intake and body weight gain to a similar extent as pair-fed mice. CS decreased blood glucose, liver weight, and lipidosis and increased FGF21 gene transcription and plasma levels. In lean mice, CS increased liver FGF21 mRNA and plasma levels. Relative to pair feeding, FOY-251 also increased plasma FGF21 and induced liver FGF21 and integrated stress response (ISR) transcription. In DIO mice, FOY-251 (100 mg/kg po) did not alter peak glucose levels but reduced the AUC of the glucose excursion in response to an oral glucose challenge. FOY-251 increased plasma FGF21 levels. In addition to previously reported satiety-dependent (cholecystokinin-mediated) actions, intestinal trypsin inhibition engages non-satiety-related pathways in both leptin-deficient and DIO mice. This novel mechanism improves metabolism by a liver-integrated stress response and increased FGF21 expression levels in mice.  Trypsin inhibitors, including plant-based consumer products, have long been associated with metabolic improvements. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested this was due to satiety hormones and caloric wasting by loss of protein and fatty acids in feces. This work suggests an entirely new mechanism based on the lower amounts of digested protein available in the gut. This apparent protein reduction may cause beneficial metabolic adaptation by the intestinal-liver axis to perceived nutrient stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199413>Synergistic effect of sea cucumber saponins and EPA-enriched phospholipids on insulin resistance in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sea cucumber saponins (SCS) exhibit a significant effect on ameliorating glucose and lipid disorders by inhibiting fatty acid biosynthesis; however, high cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity limit their application. Eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched phospholipids (EPA-PL) significantly ameliorate insulin resistance and elevate the level of hepatic lipolysis, which may have a synergistic effect with SCS in alleviating obesity-related insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms. In the present study, high-fat diet-induced male C57BL/6J mice with obesity-related insulin resistance were used to evaluate the synergistic effect of SCS and EPA-PL on alleviating the insulin resistance. Results show that the combination of SCS and EPA-PL at a half dose exhibited a significant improvement on glucose intolerance and systematic insulin sensitivity than SCS or EPA-PL alone. Moreover, the half dose-combination remarkably inhibited the macrophage infiltration (F4/80) to white adipose tissue (WAT) and significantly down-regulated the level of MCP1, TNF-α and IL-6 compared with SCS and EPA-PL alone. Consequently, the combined administration not only decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis (P < 0.05), but also stimulated the glucose uptake in WAT and muscle (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, neither SCS or EPA-PL alone exhibited any effect on the glucose uptake. The combination of SCS and EPA-PL contributed to a synergistic effect on alleviating the obesity-related insulin resistance due to the amelioration of an inflammation-centric peripheral insulin response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31460269>Rubrofusarin as a Dual Protein Tyrosine Phosphate 1B and Human Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitor: An in Vitro and in Silico Study.</a></h2><p>A number of nature-derived biologically active compounds comprise glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity; however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic parameters. The patterns of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin 6--β-d-glucopyranoside (), rubrofusarin 6--β-d-gentiobioside (), rubrofusarin triglucoside (), and cassiaside B2 () were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin, isolated from  seeds. Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced activity (IC; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for  and >100 μM for -) than did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC value of .90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of . Our overall results show that glycosylation retards activity; however, it reduces toxicity. Thus,  seed as functional food and rubrofusarin as a base can be used for the development of therapeutic agents against comorbid diabetes and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825730>Changes in protein expression in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis dietarily exposed to PVP/PEI coated silver nanoparticles at different seasons.</a></h2><p>Potential toxic effects of Ag NPs ingested through the food web and depending on the season have not been addressed in marine bivalves. This work aimed to assess differences in protein expression in the digestive gland of female mussels after dietary exposure to Ag NPs in autumn and spring. Mussels were fed daily with microalgae previously exposed for 24 h to 10 μg/L of PVP/PEI coated  nm Ag NPs. After 21 days, mussels significantly accumulated Ag in both seasons and Ag NPs were found within digestive gland cells and gills. Two-dimensional electrophoresis distinguished 104 differentially expressed protein spots in autumn and 142 in spring. Among them, chitinase like protein-3, partial and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, that are involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, carbon metabolism, glycolysis/ and the biosynthesis of amino acids KEGG pathways, were overexpressed in autumn but underexpressed in spring. In autumn, pyruvate metabolism, citrate cycle, cysteine and methionine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were altered, while in spring, proteins related to the formation of phagosomes and hydrogen peroxide metabolism were differentially expressed. Overall, protein expression signatures depended on season and Ag NPs exposure, suggesting that season significantly influences responses of mussels to NP exposure.Copyright © 2019.

This study investigated the effect of ad libitum versus restrictive feeding (85% of ad libitum) on the serum metabolome and white blood cell composition in chickens of diverging residual feed intake (RFI; metric for feed efficiency). Blood samples were collected between days 33 and 37 post-hatch. While serum glucose was similar, serum uric acid and cholesterol were indicative of the nutritional status and chicken's RFI, respectively. Feed restriction and RFI rank caused distinct serum metabolome profiles, whereby restrictive feeding also increased the blood lymphocyte proportion. Most importantly, 10 amino acids were associated with RFI rank in birds, whereas restrictive feeding affected almost all detected lysophosphatidylcholines, with 3 being higher and 6 being lower in restrictively compared to ad libitum fed chickens. As indicated by relevance networking, isoleucine, lysine, valine, histidine, and ornithine were the most discriminant for high RFI, whereas 3 biogenic amines (carnosine, putrescine, and spermidine) and 3 diacyl-glycerophospholipids (38:4, 38:, and 40:) positively correlated with feed intake and body weight gain, respectively. Only for taurine, feed intake mostly explained the RFI-associated variation, whereas for most metabolites, other host physiological factors played a greater role for the RFI-associated differences, and was potentially related to insulin-signaling, phospholipase A2, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Alterations in the hepatic synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and the need for precursors for  due to varying energy demand may explain the marked differences in serum metabolite profiles in ad libitum and restrictively fed birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178969>Antistress Effects of  Decoction on Restraint-Stressed Mice Revealed by H NMR-Based Metabolomics and Biochemistry Analysis.</a></h2><p> decoction (SHXXD), composed of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Scutellariae Radix, is a representative antipyretic and detoxifying prescription in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we investigated the antistress effects and underlying mechanisms of  decoction (SHXXD) on restraint-stressed mice by H NMR-based metabolomics combined with biochemistry assay. A total of 48 male mice ( weeks old, 18-22 g) were divided randomly into 6 groups ( = 8), including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, vitamin C group (positive drug, 17 mg/kg), and 3-dosage groups of SHXXD (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg). The stress model was induced by restraining mice in a polypropylene centrifuge tube for 6 h every day. The rotarod test was performed, and several biochemical indicators were measured. Moreover, other 24 animals were divided into 3 groups ( = 8) including the normal group, restraint-stressed group, and SHXXD group (800 mg/kg) for H NMR-based metabolomics analysis. Our results showed that SHXXD significantly increased the rotarod time, thymus index, spleen index, and the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and interleukin- (IL-) 2, but decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) , corticosterone (CORT), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in restraint-stressed mice. Moreover, the contents of eight endogenous metabolites that were changed by restraint stress were significantly reversed by SHXXD. The results of both metabolomics and biochemical analysis indicated that SHXXD (800 mg/kg, p.o.) could improve the biochemical changes and metabolic disorders in restraint-stressed mice by antioxidation and anti-inflammation, enhancing the body's immune function and restoring several disturbed metabolic pathways (i.e., lipid metabolism,  and gluconeogenesis, inflammatory injury, and energy metabolism). Taken together, these results indicated that SHXXD has a potential antistress effect in restraint-stressed mice and could be considered as a candidate drug for stress-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282100>Exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia alters hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Exposure to recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) is common in diabetic patients receiving glucose-lowering therapies and is implicated in causing cognitive impairments. Despite the significant effect of RH on hippocampal function, the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. Our goal was to determine the effect of RH exposure on hippocampal metabolism in treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats.Hyperglycemia was corrected by insulin pellet implantation. Insulin-treated diabetic (ITD) rats were exposed to mild/moderate RH once a day for  consecutive days.The effect of RH on hippocampal metabolism revealed 65 significantly altered metabolites in the RH group compared with controls. Several significant differences in metabolite levels belonging to major pathways (eg, Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism) were discovered in RH-exposed ITD rats when compared to a control group. Key glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase were affected by RH exposure.Our results demonstrate that the exposure to RH leads to metabolomics alterations in the hippocampus of insulin-treated streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Understanding how RH affects hippocampal metabolism may help attenuate the adverse effects of RH on hippocampal functions.© 2019 The Authors.

The effect of WISP1 on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and  was investigated in hSkMCs and murine hepatocytes, respectively.Circulating WISP1 levels were higher in obese men (independent of diabetes status) than in normal-weight men (mean [95% CI]: 70.8 [55.2, 86.4] ng/l vs 42.6 [28., 56.6] ng/l, respectively; p < 0.05). VAT WISP1 expression was 1.9-fold higher in obese men vs normal-weight men (p < 0.05). Circulating WISP1 levels were positively associated with blood glucose in the OGTT and circulating haem oxygenase-1 and negatively associated with adiponectin levels. In hSkMCs and AML12 hepatocytes, recombinant WISP1 impaired insulin action by inhibiting phosphorylation of insulin receptor, Akt and its substrates glycogen synthase kinase 3β, FOXO1 and p70S6 kinase, and inhibiting insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and suppression of gluconeogenic genes.Circulating WISP1 levels and WISP1 expression in VAT are increased in obesity independent of glycaemic status. Furthermore, WISP1 impaired insulin signalling in muscle and liver cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30172809>A study of Bos taurus muscle specific enolase; biochemical characterization, homology modelling and investigation of molecular interaction using molecular docking and dynamics simulations.</a></h2><p>Tropical theileriosis caused by Theileria annulata obligate parasite that infect ruminant animals, including Bos taurus. The disease results massive economic losses in livestock production worldwide. Here we describe cloning, expression and both biochemical and structural characterization of beta enolase from Bos taurus in vitro and in silico. The interconversion of 2‑phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate was catalyzed by enolase is a metalloenzyme in glycolytic pathway and . Enolase from Bos taurus was cloned, expressed and the protein was purified at 95% purity using cobalt column by affinity chromatography. The optimum enzymatic activity was calculated at pH 6.. For the first time in the literature, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, Vmax and Km, were measured as 0.1141 mM/min and 0.514 mM, respectively. Besides, Bos taurus enolase 3-dimensional structure was built by homology modelling to be used in silico analyses. The interactions of the enzyme-substrate complex were elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations for 100 ns. These interactions were found to be the same as experimentally determined interactions in yeast.

However, high incidence and severity of side-effects on the structure and functions of the kidney, liver and intestine limits its clinical use. The present study tested the hypothesis that IndoM causes multi-organ toxicity by inducing oxidative stress that alters the structure of various cellular membranes, metabolism and hence functions. The effect of IndoM was determined on the enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, brush border membrane (BBM) and oxidative stress in the rat kideny, liver and intestine to understand the mechanism of IndoM induced toxicity. Adult male Wister rats were given IndoM (20 mg/kg) intra-peritoneally in sodium bicarbonate twice a day for 3 d. The body weights of the rats were recorded before and after experimental procedure. IndoM administration significantly increased blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase but inorganic phosphate indicating IndoM induced renal, hepatic and intestinal toxicity. Activity of lactate dehydrogenase along with glucose-6- and fructose-1, 6-bis phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADP-malic enzyme increased but malate dehydrogenase decreased in all tissues. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) significantly increased whereas the antioxidant enzymes decreased in all rat tissues studied. The results indicate that IndoM administration caused severe damage to kidney, liver and intestine by icreasing LPO, suppressing antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting oxidative metablolism.

They can be represented as primary, secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structures, but from a nutritional viewpoint only the primary (amino acid) sequence is of interest. Similarly, although there are many compounds in the body that can be chemically defined as amino acids, we are only concerned with the 20 canonical amino acids encoded in DNA, plus  others-ornithine, citrulline, γ-aminobutyrate, β-alanine, and taurine-that play quantitatively important roles in the body. We consume proteins, which are digested in the gastrointestinal tract, absorbed as small peptides (di- and tripeptides) and free amino acids, and then used for the resynthesis of proteins in our cells. Additionally, some amino acids are also used for the synthesis of specific (nonprotein) products, such as nitric oxide, polyamines, creatine, glutathione, nucleotides, glucosamine, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other factors. Again, such functions are not quantitatively important for most amino acids, and the bulk of amino acid metabolism is directly related to protein turnover (synthesis and degradation). For an individual in nitrogen balance, an amount of protein equal to that of the daily protein (nitrogen) intake is degraded each day with the nitrogen being excreted as urea and ammonia (with limited amounts of creatinine and uric acid). The carbon skeletons of the amino acids degraded to urea and ammonia are recovered through  or ketone synthesis, or oxidized to carbon dioxide. Of the 20 amino acids present in proteins, 9 are considered nutritionally indispensable (essential) in adult humans because the body is not able to synthesize their carbon skeletons. These 9 amino acids are leucine, valine, isoleucine, histidine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. In addition, 2 others are made from their indispensable precursors: cysteine from methionine, and tyrosine from phenylalanine. Although arginine is needed in neonates, it appears that adults, with the possible exceptions of pregnancy in females and spermatogenesis in males, can synthesize sufficient arginine to maintain a nitrogen balance. The others, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, asparagine, serine, glycine, proline, and alanine, can all be synthesized from glucose and a suitable nitrogen source. Under some conditions, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, proline, and arginine may be considered as conditionally indispensable, meaning that the body is not capable of synthesizing them in sufficient quantities for a specific physiologic or pathologic condition (1). Thus, any discussion of dietary protein must consider not only quantity but also quality (ratio of indispensable amino acids).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30250231>PHD3 regulates glucose metabolism by suppressing stress-induced signalling and optimising  and insulin signalling in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-mediated gene transcription in the liver is critical for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Promoting the induction of gluconeogenic genes and blocking that of insulin receptor substrate (Irs)2 in hepatocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanism by which glucagon signalling regulates hepatocyte metabolism is not fully understood. We previously showed that a fasting-inducible signalling module consisting of general control non-repressed protein , co-regulator cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein/p300-interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2, and protein kinase A is required for glucagon-induced transcription of gluconeogenic genes. The present study aimed to identify the downstream effectors of this module in hepatocytes by examining glucagon-induced potential target genes. One of these genes was prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)3, which suppressed stress signalling through inhibition of the IκB kinase-nuclear factor-κB pathway in a proline hydroxylase-independent manner to maintain insulin signalling. PHD3 was also required for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α-induced , which was dependent on proline hydroxylase activity, suggesting that PHD3 regulates metabolism in response to glucagon as well as insulin. These findings demonstrate that glucagon-inducible PHD3 regulates glucose metabolism by suppressing stress signalling and optimising  and insulin signalling in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344838>The Administration of Chitosan-Tripolyphosphate-DNA Nanoparticles to Express Exogenous SREBP1a Enhances Conversion of Dietary Carbohydrates into Lipids in the Liver of .</a></h2><p>In addition to being essential for the transcription of genes involved in cellular lipogenesis, increasing evidence associates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) with the transcriptional control of carbohydrate metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overexpression SREBP1a, a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, on the intermediary metabolism of , a glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish. Administration of chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles complexed with a plasmid driving expression of the N-terminal transactivation domain of SREBP1a significantly increased SREBP1a mRNA and protein in the liver of . Overexpression of SREBP1a enhanced the hepatic expression of key genes in glycolysis- (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), fatty acid synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2), elongation (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein ) and desaturation (fatty acid desaturase 2) as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate production (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase) and cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), leading to increased blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels.

In the present study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of C-PC on  and glycogenesis in insulin resistant hepatocytes. Insulin resistance was induced by high glucose (HG) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells.

The objective was to quantify gene expression of key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and FA transport into the mitochondria in primary hepatocytes in response to exposure to an FA mixture mimicking what is circulating in a transition dairy cow with or without enrichment of C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 4 Holstein bull calves 3 d of age (± standard deviation 2 d) and cultured. Twenty-four hours after plating, treatments were applied to the cells for 24-h incubation. Treatments consisted of (1) control (1% BSA), (2) 0.75 mM FA cocktail (3% C14:0, 27% C16:0, 23% C18:0, 31% C18:1, 8% C18:2, and 8% C18:3 to mimic the FA profile of dairy cattle at calving), (3) 0.90 mM FA cocktail, (4) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C16:0, () 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:0, and (6) 0.75 mM FA cocktail + 0.15 mM C18:1. After harvest in Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), samples were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction, purification, and reverse transcription. Abundance of mRNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of genes of interest [carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, pyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase] was calculated relative to the average abundance of 2 reference genes (ribosomal protein L32 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), which were the most stable out of 3 tested. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with the fixed effect of treatment and calf in the random statement. The addition of FA compared with the 1% BSA treatment increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A and cytosolic PCK1. Enrichment with individual FA did not further regulate pyruvate carboxylase or PCK1 beyond that achieved by the basal profile. These results suggest that shifts in circulating FA profile within a biological range, without a difference in the total FA concentration, have minimal effects on transcriptional regulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes in primary bovine hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, the direct target and the underlying mechanisms by which metformin increases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues remain uncharacterized. Lipid phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol--phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is upregulated in diabetic rodent models and suppresses insulin signaling by reducing Akt activation, leading to insulin resistance and diminished glucose uptake. Here, we demonstrate that metformin directly binds to and reduces the catalytic activity of the recombinant SHIP2 phosphatase domain in vitro. Metformin inhibits SHIP2 in cultured cells and in skeletal muscle and kidney of db/db mice. In SHIP2-overexpressing myotubes, metformin ameliorates reduced glucose uptake by slowing down glucose transporter 4 endocytosis. SHIP2 overexpression reduces Akt activity and enhances podocyte apoptosis, and both are restored to normal levels by metformin. SHIP2 activity is elevated in glomeruli of patients with T2D receiving nonmetformin medication, but not in patients receiving metformin, compared with people without diabetes. Furthermore, podocyte loss in kidneys of metformin-treated T2D patients is reduced compared with patients receiving nonmetformin medication.

It is characterized by episodic, often life-threatening metabolic acidosis, liver dysfunction, and hyperlactatemia. Without a high index of suspicion, it may remain undiagnosed with devastating consequences. Accurate diagnosis can be achieved either by enzyme assay or gene studies. Enzyme assay requires a liver biopsy and is tedious, invasive, expensive, and not easily available. Therefore, genetic testing is the most appropriate method to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular studies were performed on 18 suspected cases presenting with episodic symptoms. Seven different pathogenic variants were identified. Two common variants were noted in two subpopulations from the Indian subcontinent; p.Glu281Lys (E281K) occurred most frequently (in 10 patients) followed by p.Arg158Trp (R158W, in 4 patients). Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis and helped in managing these patients by providing appropriate genetic counseling. In conclusion, genetic studies identified two common variants in the Indian subcontinent, thus simplifying the diagnostic algorithm in this treatable disorder.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/University College London.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108523>Molecular Mechanisms of Metformin for Diabetes and Cancer Treatment.</a></h2><p>Metformin has been the first-line drug treatment for hyperglycemia and insulin resistance for over 50 years. However, the molecular basis of its therapeutic role remained incompletely understood. Recent advances demonstrate that metformin could exert its glucose-lowering effect by multiple mechanisms, including activation of '-AMP-activated protein kinase, decreasing production of cyclic AMP, suppressing mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain, targeting glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and altering the gut microbiome. In addition, epidemiological and clinical observation studies suggest that metformin reduced cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and improved survival outcome of human cancers. Experimental studies have shown that this drug can inhibit cancer cell viability, growth, and proliferation through inhibiting mTORC1 signaling and mitochondrial complex I, suggesting that it may be a promising drug candidate for malignancy.

Hepatic  is controlled through allosteric regulation of gluconeogenic enzymes and by glucagon/cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathways. We aimed to elucidate the role of FXR in the regulation of fasting hepatic .The role of FXR in hepatic  was assessed in vivo and in mouse primary hepatocytes. Gene expression patterns in response to glucagon and FXR agonists were characterized by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and microarray analysis. FXR phosphorylation by protein kinase A was determined by mass spectrometry. The interaction of FOXA2 with FXR was identified by cistromic approaches and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. The functional impact of the crosstalk between FXR, the PKA and FOXA2 signaling pathways was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis, transactivation assays and restoration of FXR expression in FXR-deficient hepatocytes in which gene expression and glucose production were assessed.FXR positively regulates hepatic glucose production through two regulatory arms, the first one involving protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of FXR, which allowed for the synergistic activation of gluconeogenic genes by glucagon, agonist-activated FXR and CREB. The second arm involves the inhibition of FXR's ability to induce the anti-gluconeogenic nuclear receptor SHP by the glucagon-activated FOXA2 transcription factor, which physically interacts with FXR. Additionally, knockdown of Foxa2 did not alter glucagon-induced and FXR agonist enhanced expression of gluconeogenic genes, suggesting that the PKA and FOXA2 pathways regulate distinct subsets of FXR responsive genes.Thus, hepatic glucose production is regulated during physiological fasting by FXR, which integrates the glucagon/cAMP signal and the FOXA2 signal, by being post-translationally modified, and by engaging in protein-protein interactions, respectively.Activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR regulates gene expression networks, controlling lipid, cholesterol and glucose metabolism, which are mostly effective after eating. Whether FXR exerts critical functions during fasting is unknown. The results of this study show that FXR transcriptional activity is regulated by the glucagon/protein kinase A and the FOXA2 signaling pathways, which act on FXR through phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions, respectively, to increase hepatic glucose synthesis.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Recognition of novel biomarkers in malignant ascites could be favorable for establishing a diagnosis for the HCC patients with ascites, and even predicting prognosis, such as risk of distant metastasis. To distinguish the proteomic profiles of malignant ascites in HCC patients from those with nonmalignant liver cirrhosis, an iTRAQ pipeline was built up to analyze the differentially distributed proteins in the malignant ascites from HCC patients (n=10) and benign ascites from hepatic decompensation (HD) controls (n=9). In total, 112 differentially distributed proteins were identified, of which 69 proteins were upregulated and 43 proteins were downregulated (ratio <0.667 or >1.3, respectively) in the malignant ascites. Moreover, 19 upregulated proteins (including keratin 1 protein and rheumatoid factor RF-IP20, ratio>1.) and 8 downregulated proteins (including carbonic anhydrase 1, ratio<0.667) were identified from malignant ascites samples. Functional categories analyses indicated that membrane proteins, ion regulation, and amino acid metabolism are implicated in the formation of HCC malignant ascites.

To reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying macrovascular invasion (MaVI) in HCC, we performed an iTRAQ based proteomic study to identify notably dysregulated proteins from eight HCC patients with differential vascular invasion and further confirmed them in the other 53 HCC patients. Forty-seven proteins were found significantly down-regulated in HCC with MaVI. More importantly, 30 of them were not changed in HCC without MaVI. Gene ontology analysis of these 47 proteins shows the top three enriched biological processes are urea cycle, , and arginine biosynthetic process. We validated nine remarkably dysregulated candidates in HCC patients with MaVI by Western blot including eight down-regulated proteins (CPS1, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, BHMT, DMGDH, Annexin A6, and CES1) and one up-regulated protein (CKAP4). Furthermore, dysregulation of CPS1, ASL, and ARG1, key enzymes involved in urea cycle, together with Annexin A6 and CES1, major proteins in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid ester metabolism, was verified using immunohistochemical staining.

Ketoacidosis is attributed in part to the massive release of ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate; βOHB) from the liver into the systemic circulation. To date, the impact of ethanol consumption on systemic ketone concentration, glycemic control, and hepatic  and glycogenesis remains largely unknown, especially in the context of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, ethanol intake (36% ethanol- and 36% fat-derived calories) by type 2 diabetic db/db mice for 9 days resulted in significant decreases in weight gain (∼19.% ↓) and caloric intake (∼30% ↓). This was accompanied by a transition from macrovesicular-to-microvesicular hepatic steatosis with a modest increase in hepatic TG (∼37% ↑). Importantly, ethanol increased systemic βOHB concentration (∼8-fold ↑) with significant decreases in blood glucose (∼4-fold ↓) and plasma insulin and HOMA-IR index (∼3-fold ↓). In addition, ethanol enhanced hepatic βOHB content (∼-fold ↑) and hmgcs2 mRNA expression (∼3.7-fold ↑), downregulated key gluconeogenic mRNAs (e.g., Pcx, Pck1, and G6pc), and depleted hepatic glycogen (∼4-fold ↓). Furthermore, ethanol intake led to significant decreases in the mRNA/protein expression and allosteric activation of glycogen synthase (GS) in liver tissues regardless of changes in the phosphorylation of GS, GSK-3β, or Akt. Together, our findings suggest that ethanol-induced ketonemia may occur in concomitance with significant lowering of blood glucose concentration, which may be attributed to suppression of  in the setting of glycogen depletion in type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To provide insights into its lignocellulose hydrolysate utilization, we performed C-pathway tracing, C-pulse-tracing, transcriptional profiling, biomass composition analysis, and metabolite profiling in conjunction with C-metabolic flux analysis (C-MFA) of phenol metabolism. We found that 1) phenol is metabolized mainly through the ortho-cleavage pathway; 2) phenol utilization requires a highly active TCA cycle; 3) NADPH is generated mainly via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 4) active cataplerotic fluxes increase plasticity in the TCA cycle; and ) gluconeogenesis occurs partially through the reversed Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP). We also found that phenol-fed R. opacus PD630 generally has lower sugar phosphate concentrations (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) compared to metabolite pools in C-glucose-fed Escherichia coli (set as internal standards), while its TCA metabolites (e.g., malate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate) accumulate intracellularly with measurable succinate secretion. In addition, we found that phenol utilization was inhibited by benzoate, while catabolite repressions by other tested carbon substrates (e.g., glucose and acetate) were absent in R. opacus PD630. Three adaptively-evolved strains display very different growth rates when fed with phenol as a sole carbon source, but they maintain a conserved flux network.

In Period 1 27 German Holstein cows were assigned to two groups and fed a control or mycotoxin-contaminated diet with 50% concentrate for 11 weeks. In Period 2 each group was further divided and fed either a diet containing 30% or 60% concentrate for 16 weeks. Blood samples were collected in week 0, 4, 8, 15, 21, and 27 for calculation of the Revised Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index and biopsy samples of skeletal muscle and the liver in w 0, 15, and 27 for analysis by real-time RT-qPCR. The DON-fed groups presented lower insulin sensitivities than controls at week 27. Concomitantly, muscular mRNA expression of insulin receptors and hepatic mRNA expression of glucose transporter 2 and key enzymes for  and fatty acid metabolism were lower in DON-fed cows compared to the control. The study revealed no consistent evidence that DON effects were modified by dietary concentrate levels. In conclusion, long-term dietary DON intake appears to have mild effects on energy metabolism in lactating dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393724>Effect of 1-Deoxynojirimycin Isolated from Mulberry Leaves on Glucose Metabolism and Gut Microbiota in a Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) exerts hypoglycemic effects. However, the traditional method for DNJ extraction is inefficient, and the hypoglycemic mechanism of DNJ remains unclear. In this study, the mixed fermentation by  and  was used to enhance DNJ extraction efficiency. It was found that this strategy was more efficient than the traditional method as the yield improved from the original 3.24 mg/g to .97 mg/g. The purified DNJ significantly decreased serum glucose ( < 0.01) and insulin levels ( < 0.05), improved serum lipid levels ( < 0.05), and reversed insulin resistance ( < 0.05) in diabetic mice.

In mammals, rapid clearance of a glucose load is mainly achieved through insulin-mediated inhibition of hepatic glucose production ( R) and stimulation of glucose disposal ( R), but the effects of insulin on R and R glucose have never been measured in fish. The goal of this study was to characterize the impact of insulin on the glucose kinetics of rainbow trout in vivo. Glucose fluxes were measured by continuous infusion of [6-H]glucose before and during 4 h of insulin administration. The phosphorylated form of the key signaling proteins Akt and S6 in the insulin cascade were also examined, confirming activation of this pathway in muscle but not liver. Results show that insulin inhibits trout R glucose from 8.6 ± 0.6 to .4 ± 0. µmol kg min: the opposite effect than classically seen in mammals. Such a different response may be explained by the contrasting effects of insulin on gluco/hexokinases of trout versus mammals. Insulin also reduced trout R from 8. ± 0.7 to 4.8 ± 0.6 µmol·kg·min, whereas it can almost completely suppresses R in mammals. The partial inhibition of R glucose may be because insulin only affects  but not glycogen breakdown in trout. The small mismatch between the responses to insulin for R (-37%) and R glucose (-43%) gives trout a very limited capacity to decrease glycemia. We conclude that the glucose intolerance of rainbow trout can be explained by the inhibiting effect of insulin on glucose disposal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970232>Baicalein improves glucose metabolism in insulin resistant HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) is the primary pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, often used in the clinical treatment of T2DM. Baicalein which is considered to have anti-IR effects is one of its active ingredients. IR-induced HepG2 cells were used to investigate the effect of baicalein on glucose metabolism and insulin-signaling pathway, using metformin as a positive control. We found that the use of both baicalein and metformin increased the glucose consumption of IR cells, as well as increasing the pyruvate kinase (PK) and glucokinase (GCK) activity. Also increased was the expression levels of insulin receptor (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) pathway and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Reduced expression levels were found in that of glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA. The results confirmed that baicalein (10 and 10 mol/L) promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis, inhibits  of hepatocytes to improve glucose metabolism, and may be as a result from regulation of InsR/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, baicalein has large concentration range on inhibiting IR, and at lower concentrations has strong anti-IR hepatocyte activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Treatments to reduce hyperglycemia and reestablish normal insulin signaling are much sought after. Any agent which could be orally administered to restore INSR function, in an insulin-independent manner, would have major implications for the management of this global disease. We have discovered a non-peptidyl small molecule, adenosine, '-Se-methyl-'-seleno-, 2',3'-diacetate [referred to as non-peptidyl compound #43 (NPC43)], which restores INSR signaling in the complete absence of insulin. Initial screening of numerous compounds in human HepG2 liver cells revealed that NPC43 significantly inhibited glucose production. The compound was potently anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperinsulinemic in vivo, in insulin-resistant T2D Lepr mice, following either acute or chronic treatment by oral gavage and intraperitoneal injection, respectively. The compound acted at the level of INSR and activated it in both liver and skeletal muscle of Lepr mice. In cell culture, the compound activated INSR in both liver and skeletal muscle cells; furthermore, it cooperated with insulin to depress glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6pc) expression and stimulate glucose uptake, respectively. Our results indicated that the compound directly interacted with INSRα, triggering appropriate phosphorylation and activation of the receptor and its downstream targets. Unlike insulin, NPC43 did not activate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in either liver or skeletal muscle. We believe this compound represents a potential oral and/or injectable insulin replacement therapy for diabetes and diseases associated with insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30317645>Integrated analysis of proteomics-delineated and metabolomics-delineated hepatic metabolic responses to (-)-hydroxycitric acid in chick embryos.</a></h2><p>(-)-Hydroxycitric acid [(-)-HCA] is widely used as a nutritional supplement to control body weight and fat accumulation in animals and humans, whereas the underlying biochemical mechanism is unclear. Broiler chicken was used as a model for studies of obesity due to its natural hyperglycemia and being insulin resistant. The current study aimed to obtain a systematic view of serum metabolites and hepatic proteins and well understand the mechanism of hepatic metabolic response to (-)-HCA treatment in chick embryos. The results showed that 22, 90, and 82 of differentially expressed proteins were identified at E14d, E19d, and H1d in chick embryos treated with (-)-HCA, respectively. Meanwhile, , 83, and 88 of serum metabolites significantly changed at E14d, E19d, and H1d in chick embryos after (-)-HCA treatment. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the key proteins and metabolites, which were significantly altered in chick embryos treated with (-)-HCA, were mainly involved in the citrate cycle, glycolysis/, fatty acid metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. Our data indicated that (-)-HCA treatment might promote fat metabolism via regulating the key protein expression levels and metabolite contents in the citrate cycle, glycolysis/, and oxidative phosphorylation during chicken embryonic development. These results will deepen our understanding of the mechanism of fat reduction by (-)-HCA and provide substantial information for (-)-HCA as a nutritional supplement to control body weight gain and curb obesity-related diseases.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29574025>Effects of Multi-Electrode Renal Denervation on Insulin Sensitivity and Glucose Metabolism in a Canine Model of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effects of multi-electrode catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in a type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) canine model.Thirty-three dogs were divided equally into 3 groups: bilateral renal denervation (BRDN) group, left renal denervation (LRDN) group, and sham operation (SHAM) group. Body weight and blood biochemistry were measured at baseline, 20 weeks, and 32 weeks, and renal angiography and computerized tomographic (CT) angiography were determined before the procedure and 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after the procedure. Western blot was used to identify the activities of gluconeogenic enzymes and insulin-signaling proteins.Fasting plasma glucose (9.64 ± 1.57 mmol/L vs .12 ± 1.08 mmol/L; P < .0001), fasting insulin (16.19 ± 1.43 mIU/mL vs .07 ± 1.13 mIU/mL; P < .0001), and homeostasis-model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 6.95 ± 1.33 vs 1.15 ± 0.33; P < .0001) in the BRDN group had significantly decreased at the 3-month follow-up compared with the SHAM group. Western blot analyses showed that RDN suppressed the gluconeogenetic genes, modulated insulin action, and activated insulin receptors-AKT signaling cascade in the liver.

A critical unmet need in this field is to understand the pathways and biomarkers underlying fetal hepatic lipotoxicity and whether maternal dietary intervention during pregnancy is an effective countermeasure.We utilized a well-established non-human primate model of chronic, maternal, Western-style diet induced obesity (OB-WSD) compared with mothers on a healthy control diet (CON) or a subset of OB-WSD mothers switched to the CON diet (diet reversal; OB-DR) prior to and for the duration of the next pregnancy. Fetuses were studied in the early 3rd trimester.Fetuses from OB-WSD mothers had higher circulating triglycerides (TGs) and lower arterial oxygenation suggesting hypoxemia, compared with fetuses from CON and OB-DR mothers. Hepatic TG content, oxidative stress (TBARs), and de novo lipogenic genes were increased in fetuses from OB-WSD compared with CON mothers. Fetuses from OB-DR mothers had lower lipogenic gene expression and TBARs yet persistently higher TGs. Metabolomic profiling of fetal liver and serum (umbilical artery) revealed distinct separation of CON and OB-WSD groups, and an intermediate phenotype in fetuses from OB-DR mothers. Pathway analysis identified decreased tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, increased amino acid (AA) metabolism and byproducts, and increased , suggesting an increased reliance on AA metabolism to meet energy needs in the liver of fetuses from OB-WSD mothers. Components in collagen synthesis, including serum protein -hydroxylysine and hepatic lysine and proline, were positively correlated with hepatic TGs and TBARs, suggesting early signs of fibrosis in livers from the OB-WSD group. Importantly, hepatic gluconeogenic and arginine related intermediates and serum levels of lactate, pyruvate, several AAs, and nucleotide intermediates were normalized in the OB-DR group. However, hepatic levels of CDP-choline and total ceramide levels remained high in fetuses from OB-DR mothers.Our data provide new metabolic evidence that, in addition to fetal hepatic steatosis, maternal WSD creates fetal hypoxemia and increases utilization of AAs for energy production and early activation of gluconeogenic pathways in the fetal liver. When combined with hyperlipidemia and limited antioxidant activity, the fetus suffers from hepatic oxidative stress and altered intracellular metabolism which can be improved with maternal diet intervention. Our data reinforce the concept that multiple "first hits" occur in the fetus prior to development of obesity and demonstrate new biomarkers with potential clinical implications for monitoring NAFLD risk in offspring.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Vice versa obesity is characterized as a state of low GH function. Here, we aimed to define the role of hepatic GH signaling and its metabolic consequences in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.In humans, GHR and IGF-1 levels were determined in liver samples of 29 obese patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or simple steatosis. Cellular effects of GH on insulin signaling were investigated in GH receptor (GHR) knockdown HepG2 cells.Hepatic IGF-1 expression levels reflecting GH action were significantly lower and fasting glucose concentrations higher in patients with NASH than in patients with simple steatosis. GHR knockdown in hepatocytes resulted in a scenario of high glucose output displayed by reduced glycogen content, increased  and diminished insulin signaling.Our data suggest that GH signaling in the liver is diminished in patients with NASH and associated with deteriorated hepatic insulin sensitivity and metabolic activity.

PTEN was first discovered as a tumor suppressor with growth and survival regulatory functions. In recent years, the function of PTEN as a metabolic regulator has attracted significant attention. As the lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, -phosphate (PIP), PTEN reduces the level of PIP, a critical 2nd messenger mediating the signal of not only growth factors but also insulin. In this review, we introduced the discovery of PTEN, the PTEN-regulated canonical and nuclear signals, and PTEN regulation. We then focused on the role of PTEN and PTEN-regulated signals in metabolic regulation. This included the role of PTEN in glycolysis, , glycogen synthesis, lipid metabolism as well as mitochondrial metabolism. We also included how PTEN and PTEN regulated metabolic functions may act paradoxically toward insulin sensitivity and tumor metabolism and growth. Further understanding of how PTEN regulates metabolism and how such regulations lead to different biological outcomes is necessary for interventions targeting at the PTEN-regulated signals in either cancer or diabetes treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29892262> Insulin-Like Peptides DILP2 and DILP5 Differentially Stimulate Cell Signaling and Glycogen Phosphorylase to Regulate Longevity.</a></h2><p>Insulin and IGF signaling (IIS) is a complex system that controls diverse processes including growth, development, metabolism, stress responses, and aging.  IIS is propagated by eight  insulin-like peptides (DILPs), homologs of both mammalian insulin and IGFs, with various spatiotemporal expression patterns and functions. DILPs 1-7 are thought to act through a single  insulin/IGF receptor, InR, but it is unclear how the DILPs thereby mediate a range of physiological phenotypes. We determined the distinct cell signaling effects of DILP2 and DILP5 stimulation upon  S2 cells. DILP2 and DILP5 induced similar transcriptional patterns but differed in signal transduction kinetics. DILP5 induced sustained phosphorylation of Akt, while DILP2 produced acute, transient Akt phosphorylation. Accordingly, we used phosphoproteomic analysis to identify distinct patterns of non-genomic signaling induced by DILP2 and DILP5. Across all treatments and replicates, ,250 unique phosphopeptides were identified, representing 1,575 proteins. Among these peptides, DILP2, but not DILP5, dephosphorylated Ser15 on glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP), and DILP2, but not DILP5, was subsequently shown to repress enzymatic GlyP activity in S2 cells. The functional consequences of this difference were evaluated in adult  mutants:  null adults have elevated GlyP enzymatic activity relative to wild type, while  mutants have reduced GlyP activity. In flies with intact insulin genes,  overexpression extended lifespan in a Ser15 phosphorylation-dependent manner. In  mutants, that are otherwise long-lived, longevity was repressed by expression of phosphonull  that is enzymatically inactive. Overall, DILP2, unlike DILP5, signals to affect longevity in part through its control of phosphorylation to deactivate glycogen phosphorylase, a central modulator of glycogen storage and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635361>Central IKK2 Inhibition Ameliorates Air Pollution-Mediated Hepatic Glucose and Lipid Metabolism Dysfunction in Mice With Type II Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies supported a role of hypothalamic inflammation in fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.) exposure-mediated diabetes development.

KKAy mice, a genetically susceptible model of type II diabetes mellitus, were administered intra-cerebroventricularly with IKK2 inhibitor (IMD-0354) and were exposed to either concentrated PM2. or filtered air (FA) for 4 weeks simultaneously via a versatile aerosol concentration exposure system. At the end of the exposure, fasting blood glucose and serum insulin were evaluated before epididymal adipose tissue and liver were collected, flow cytometry, quantitative PCR and Western blot were performed at euthanasia. We observed that intracerebroventricular administration of IMD-0354 attenuated insulin resistance, inhibited macrophage polarization to M1 phenotype in epididymal adipose tissue in response to PM2. exposure. Although the treatment did not affect hepatic inflammation or endoplasmic reticulum stress, it inhibited the expression of the enzymes for  and lipogenesis in the liver.

Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on  healthy and  ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P-values < 0.05 and fold changes >1. or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were glycolysis/, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by Western blot and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α (PDE1α), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1), 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK), were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 (PLIN1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and Regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits  and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty acid formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic acid (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo--nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin.

G6Pase and HK play an important role in insect growth by regulating the metabolism of glucose, leading to the efficient metabolism of other macromolecules. However, it is unclear whether these genes could be investigated for pest control through their actions on chitin metabolism. We studied the potential functions of G6Pase and HK genes in the regulation of chitin metabolism pathways by RNAi technology. Interference with G6Pase expression did not affect trehalose and chitin metabolism pathways in brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål). However, knockdown of the HK gene resulted in a significant decrease of expression of genes associated with the trehalose metabolic pathway but had no significant effect on trehalase activity, trehalose content, or glucogen content. Additionally, HK knockdown resulting in downregulation of the genes involved in chitin metabolism in the brown planthopper.

FoxO1-S253A/A mice displayed mild increases in feeding blood glucose and insulin levels but decreases in fasting blood glucose and glucagon concentrations, as well as a reduction in the ratio of pancreatic α-cells/β-cells per islet. FoxO1-S253A/A mice exhibited a slight increase in energy expenditure but barely altered food intake and glucose uptake among tissues. Further analyses revealed that FoxO1-S253A/A enhances FoxO1 nuclear localization and promotes the effect of glucagon on HGP. We conclude that dephosphorylation of S253 in FoxO1 may reflect a molecular basis of pancreatic plasticity during the development of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833709>Small molecule IVQ, as a prodrug of  inhibitor QVO, efficiently ameliorates glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p> is a major source of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), thus targeting  to suppress glucose production is a promising strategy for anti-T2DM drug discovery. In our preliminary in vitro studies, we found that a small-molecule (E)-3-(2-(quinoline-4-yl)vinyl)-1H-indol-6-ol (QVO) inhibited the hepatic glucose production (HGP) in primary hepatocytes. We further revealed that QVO suppressed hepatic  involving calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β- and liver kinase B1-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways as well as AMPK-independent mitochondrial function-related signaling pathway. To evaluate QVO's anti-T2DM activity in vivo, which was impeded by the complicated synthesis route of QVO with a low yield, we designed and synthesized 4-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)vinyl]quinoline (IVQ) as a prodrug with easier synthesis route and higher yield. IVQ did not inhibit the HGP in primary hepatocytes in vitro. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that IVQ was quickly converted to QVO in mice and rats following administration. In both db/db and ob/ob mice, oral administration of IVQ hydrochloride (IVQ-HCl) (23 and 46 mg/kg every day, for  weeks) ameliorated hyperglycemia, and suppressed hepatic  and activated AMPK signaling pathway in the liver tissues. Furthermore, IVQ caused neither cardiovascular system dysfunction nor genotoxicity. The good druggability of IVQ has highlighted its potential in the treatment of T2DM and the prodrug design for anti-T2DM drug development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30008136>Species-specific low plasma glucose in fish is associated with relatively high tissue glucose content and is inversely correlated with cardiac glycogen content.</a></h2><p>The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and intracellular glucose (liver, heart, brain, gill, gonad, intestine, kidney, spleen, white muscle) was determined in fish species with a range in plasma glucose (Atlantic cod, .06 mM; cunner, 3.8 mM; rainbow trout, 3.7 mM; lumpfish, 0.9 mM; short-horned sculpin, 0.6 mM; and winter flounder, 0.6 mM). The ratio of intracellular glucose/plasma glucose was always higher than one in liver for all species consistent with a diffusion gradient from the tissue to the plasma. In all other tissues in Atlantic cod, cunner, and rainbow trout the diffusion gradient was from the plasma to the intracellular space. In short-horned sculpin, the mean ratio in heart and white muscle exceeded one and in winter flounder the ratio was significantly greater than one at .97 and 2.92 for heart and muscle, respectively. The presence of an active glucose 6-phosphatase in white muscle could account for elevated amounts of free glucose. The white muscle of all species displayed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and in winter flounder the activity was as high in white muscle as in liver suggesting that  may be associated with a relatively high-muscle glucose content. The glycogen content was highest in liver followed by heart with lower amounts in all other tissues. There was an inverse correlation between heart glycogen content and plasma glucose concentration when all species were included. It is contended that in species with low plasma glucose, heart glycogen is accumulated at a slow rate under normoxia, to be called upon under hypoxic conditions when the gradient for inward diffusion is unfavourable for high rates of glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032430>Acute fructose intake suppresses fasting-induced hepatic  through the AKT-FoxO1 pathway.</a></h2><p>Excessive intake of fructose increases lipogenesis in the liver, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation and development of fatty liver disease. Metabolic alterations in the liver due to fructose intake have been reported in many studies, but the effect of fructose administration on hepatic  is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of fructose administration on fasting-induced hepatic . C57BL/6J mice were administered fructose solution after 14 h of fasting and plasma insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies were analysed. We also measured phosphorylated AKT and forkhead box O (FoxO) 1 protein levels and gene expression related to  in the liver. Furthermore, we measured glucose production from pyruvate after fructose administration. Glucose-administered mice were used as controls. Fructose administration enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the liver, without increase of blood insulin levels. Blood free fatty acids and ketone bodies concentrations were as high as those in the fasting group after fructose administration, suggesting that insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis did not occur in mice administered with fructose. Fructose also enhanced phosphorylation of FoxO1 and suppressed gluconeogenic gene expression, glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and glucose production from pyruvate. The present study suggests that acute fructose administration suppresses fasting-induced hepatic  in an insulin-independent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590832>Cold Acclimation of the Thermoacidophilic Red Alga Galdieria sulphuraria: Changes in Gene Expression and Involvement of Horizontally Acquired Genes.</a></h2><p>Galdieria sulphuraria is a unicellular red alga that lives in hot, acidic, toxic metal-rich, volcanic environments, where few other organisms survive. Its genome harbors up to % of genes that were most likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These genes probably contributed to G.sulphuraria's adaptation to its extreme habitats, resulting in today's polyextremophilic traits. Here, we applied RNA-sequencing to obtain insights into the acclimation of a thermophilic organism towards temperatures below its growth optimum and to study how horizontally acquired genes contribute to cold acclimation. A decrease in growth temperature from 42ï¿½C/46ï¿½C to 28ï¿½C resulted in an upregulation of ribosome biosynthesis, while excreted proteins, probably components of the cell wall, were downregulated. Photosynthesis was suppressed at cold temperatures, and transcript abundances indicated that C-metabolism switched from  to glycogen degradation. Folate cycle and S-adenosylmethionine cycle (one-carbon metabolism) were transcriptionally upregulated, probably to drive the biosynthesis of betaine. All these cold-induced changes in gene expression were reversible upon return to optimal growth temperature. Numerous genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer displayed temperature-dependent expression changes, indicating that these genes contributed to adaptive evolution in G.sulphuraria.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2018.

This study aims to investigate how microRNA-122-5p (miR-122) regulates the hepatic IR in vitro. We first found that the miR-122 level was upregulated in the liver of rats fed with a high-fat diet and injected with streptozotocin (T2D rats), while the expression level of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), a potential target of miR-122, was downregulated in the diabetic liver. In vitro, glucosamine-induced IR was introduced in HepG2 hepatic cells, and the levels of miR-122 and IGF-1R were further assessed. An increase of miR-122 level and a decrease of IGF-IR level were observed in IR hepatic cells, which was the same as that in the diabetic liver. Results of the luciferase reporter assay validated IGF-1R as a direct target of miR-122. Moreover, in IR HepG2 cells, antagonizing miR-122 with its specific inhibitor enhanced glucose uptake and suppressed the expression of glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, two key enzymes in regulating . Such alterations induced by the miR-122 inhibitor in IR hepatic cells were impaired when IGF-1R was simultaneously knocked down. In addition, the PI3K/Akt pathway was deactivated in IR cells, and then reactivated with miR-122 inhibitor transfection. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that miR-122 is able to regulate IR in hepatic cells by targeting IGF-1R.© 2019 International Federation for Cell Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714432>Systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormonal regulation of daily expression rhythms for gluconeogenic enzyme genes in the mouse liver.</a></h2><p> is de novo glucose synthesis from substrates such as amino acids and is vital when glucose is lacking in the diurnal nutritional fluctuation. Accordingly, genes for hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes exhibit daily expression rhythms, whose detailed regulations under nutritional variations remain elusive. As a first step, we performed general systematic characterization of daily expression profiles of gluconeogenic enzyme genes for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), cytosolic form (Pck1), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), catalytic subunit (G6pc), and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (Tat) in the mouse liver. On a standard diet fed ad libitum, mRNA levels of these genes showed robust daily rhythms with a peak or an elevation phase during the late sleep-fasting period in the diurnal feeding/fasting (wake/sleep) cycle. The rhythmicity was preserved in constant darkness, modulated with prolonged fasting, attenuated by Clock mutation, and entrained to varied photoperiods and time-restricted feedings. These results are concordant with the notion that gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of the intrinsic circadian oscillator, which is entrained by the light/dark cycle, and which in turn entrains the feeding/fasting cycle and also drives systemic signaling pathways such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. On the other hand, time-restricted feedings also showed that the ingestion schedule, when separated from the light/dark cycle, can serve as an independent entrainer to daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes. Moreover, nutritional changes dramatically modified expression profiles of the genes. In addition to prolonged fasting, a high-fat diet and a high-carbohydrate (no-protein) diet caused modification of daily expression rhythms of the genes, with characteristic changes in profiles of glucoregulatory hormones such as corticosterone, glucagon, and insulin, as well as their modulators including ghrelin, leptin, resistin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Remarkably, high-protein (60% casein or soy-protein) diets activated the gluconeogenic enzyme genes atypically during the wake-feeding period, with paradoxical up-regulation of glucagon, which frequently formed correlation networks with other humoral factors. Based on these results, we propose that daily expression rhythms of gluconeogenic enzyme genes are under the control of systemic oscillator-driven and nutrient-responsive hormones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616754> in Cancer: Function and Regulation of PEPCK, FBPase, and G6Pase.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells display a high rate of glycolysis in the presence of oxygen to promote proliferation. , the reverse pathway of glycolysis, can antagonize aerobic glycolysis in cancer via three key enzymes - phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase).

The cells were analyzed using mass spectrometry for proteomics/phosphoproteomics, AlamarBlue assay for mitochondrial activity, time-lapse video for cell migration, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for gene expression, and immunofluorescence for protein expression.Proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis showed inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin and casein kinase 2 pathways, cell motility-related networks, and multiple metabolic processes, including carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acid, /gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Functional analysis demonstrated inhibition of mitochondrial activities, cell migration, and mitosis. Expression of growth promoting insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibrosis-related genes, including transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and collagen type 1 ɑ2 chain diminished. Protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin, an important regulator of myofibroblast functions, was also suppressed.Low-level blue light exerted suppressive effects on AMDFs, including suppression of mitochondrial activity, metabolism, cell motility, proliferation, TGFβ1 levels, and collagen I production. Low-level blue light can be a potential treatment for the prevention and reduction of tissue fibrosis, such as hypertrophic scar and keloids. Lasers Surg.

Its widespread use resulted in constant human exposure including fetal development and postnatal life. Epidemiological and experimental data have shown that DEHP has a negative influence on glucose homeostasis. However, the evidence regarding the effect of maternal DEHP exposure on hepatic glucose homeostasis is scarce. Hence, we investigated whether DEHP exposure during gestation and lactation disrupts glucose homeostasis in the rat F male offspring at adulthood. Pregnant rats were divided into three groups and administered with DEHP (10 and 100 mg/kg/day) or olive oil from gestational day 9 to postnatal day 21 (lactation period) through oral gavage. DEHP-exposed offspring exhibited hyperglycemia, impaired glucose and insulin tolerances along with hyperinsulinemia at postnatal day 80. DEHP exposure significantly reduced the levels of insulin signaling molecules such as insulin receptors, IRS1, Akt and its phosphorylated forms. GSK3β and FoxO1 proteins increased in DEHP-exposed groups whereas its phosphorylated forms decreased. Treated groups showed decreased glycogen synthase activity and glycogen concentration. Glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA level and enzyme activity increased in DEHP-treated groups. The interaction between FoxO1-glucose-6-phosphatase and FoxO1-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was also increased. This study suggests that DEHP exposure impairs insulin signal transduction and alters glucoregulatory events leading to the development of type 2 diabetes in F male offspring.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30824102>Dendrobium huoshanense polysaccharide regulates hepatic glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β-cell function in type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the hypoglycemic mechanism of a homogeneous Dendrobium huoshanense polysaccharide (GXG) was investigated using type 2 diabetic (T2D) mouse model. With a -week oral administration of GXG, the levels of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein and serum insulin in T2D mice were decreased, and the glucose tolerance and the insulin sensitivity were improved. The histological analysis, the periodic acid-schiff staining and the immunofluorescence staining of insulin, glucagon and apoptosis showed that the hypoglycemic effect of GXG was related to the improvement of pancreatic β-cell quantity and function and the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism. Western blot analysis indicated that the up-regulated IRS1-PI3K-Akt phosphorylation followed by the down-regulated FoxO1/GSK 3β phosphorylation contributed to the enhanced glycogen synthesis and the decreased  by GXG, suggesting that the response of insulin-mediated IRS1-PI3K-Akt-FoxO1/GSK 3β signaling to GXG might be the required mechanism for GXG-ameliorated development of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the postprandial response of  to a protein meal. We aimed to quantify the evolution of fractional  after a meat meal. Thirteen healthy subjects received oral doses of DO. After fasting overnight, they ingested a steak (120 g). Glycemia, insulinemia, and H enrichments in glucose and plasma water were measured for 8 h after the meal. Fractional  was assessed using the average method. Glucose was stable for  h and then decreased. There was a slight increase of insulin 1 h after the meal. H enrichment in the carbon  position of glucose (C5) increased after 2 h, whereas it decreased in plasma water. Consequently, fractional  increased from 68.2 ± 7.2% before the meal to 75. ± .8% 8 h after the meal, the latter corresponding to 22 h without a glucose supply. These values are consistent with the exhaustion of glycogen stores after 24 h but represent the highest among values in the literature.

Goats were fasted for 24 h followed by a 9-h intravenous infusion of an AA mixture plus glucose. Milk yield was recorded and samples were taken in h 2 to 8 of the infusion period, and mammary biopsy was performed in the last hour. Treatments were graded removal of Met from the infused AA mixture to achieve Met content in the infusate of 100 (complete), 60, 30, or 0% of that in casein. Graded Met removal decreased yield of milk, milk protein, and lactose linearly and tended to decrease yield of milk fat linearly. Milk protein yield decreased to 82, 78, and 69% that of complete mixture infusion, respectively, when the 60, 30, and 0% Met infusate was infused. Circulating Met decreased linearly with graded Met removal. Arterial and venous Met decreased to 36 and 23% that of complete mixture infusion, respectively, when all Met was removed out of the mixture. Concomitant with the decreased circulating concentration was a similar increase in mammary Met affinity as reflected by the linearly increased mammary Met clearance rate. The increased affinity plus the linearly increased mammary blood flow totally offset the negative effect of decreased circulating Met concentration on mammary Met uptake. The overall result was similar mammary Met uptakes across treatments ranging from 285.9 to 339. μmol/h. Mammary uptakes of the other AA measured were generally not affected by treatments except for a linearly decreased Thr uptake and a trend of linearly increased Glu uptake. Consistent with the behavior of an AA mainly catabolized in the liver and mainly used for protein synthesis in peripheral tissues, mammary uptake to milk output ratios of Met measured in the present study ranged from 1.25 to 1.49 and was not affected by treatments. For the other AA measured, the ratio of Thr was linearly decreased and that of Glu was linearly increased by graded Met removal. Graded Met removal linearly elevated circulating urea N and glucose concentrations, indicating enhanced whole-body catabolism of AA and hepatic . Treatments had no significant effects on circulating insulin, growth hormone, and the other hormones and metabolites measured. Phosphorylation status of eIF4E binding protein 1 tended to decrease linearly and that of p70S6k was linearly decreased by graded Met removal, indicating depressed signal in the intracellular mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. In conclusion, results of the present study indicated that the mTORC1 pathway and whole-body AA catabolism rather than mammary uptake appeared the drivers for changes in milk protein synthesis in response to varying Met supply.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The ligand complexes cryotrapped in native or mutant  aldolase crystals enabled a novel mechanistic description of FBP C3-C4 bond cleavage. The reaction mechanism uses active site remodeling during the catalytic cycle, implicating relocation of the Zn cofactor that is mediated by conformational changes of active site loops. Substrate binding initiates conformational changes triggered upon P1 phosphate binding, which liberates the Zn-chelating His-180, allowing it to act as a general base for the proton abstraction at the FBP C4 hydroxyl group. A second zinc-chelating His-83 hydrogen bonds the substrate C4 hydroxyl group and assists cleavage by stabilizing the developing negative charge during proton abstraction. Cleavage is concerted with relocation of the metal cofactor from an interior to a surface-exposed site, thereby stabilizing the nascent enediolate form. Conserved residue Glu-142 is essential for protonation of the enediolate form prior to product release. A d-tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate enzymatic complex reveals how His-180-mediated proton abstraction controls stereospecificity of the cleavage reaction. Recognition and discrimination of the reaction products, dihydroxyacetone-P and d-glyceraldehyde 3-P, occurs via charged hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups of the triose-Ps and conserved residues, Asp-82 and Asp-255, respectively, and are crucial aspects of the enzyme's role in . Conformational changes in mobile loops β-α7 and β6-α8 (containing catalytic residues Glu-142 and His-180, respectively) drive active site remodeling, enabling the relocation of the metal cofactor.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073563>Transcriptome profiling and identification of functional genes involved in HS response in grapevine tissue cultured plantlets.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide (HS), a small bioactive gas, has been proved functioning in plant growth and development as well as alleviation of abiotic stresses, which including promoting seed germination, accelerating embryonic root growth, regulating flower senescence, inducing stomatal closure, and defending drought, heat, heavy metals and osmotic stresses etc. However, the molecular functioning mechanism of HS was still unclear.

This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid, classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract.

Mice were then euthanized, hepatic glycogen was isolated and derivatized to monoacetone glucose, and  H-enrichment of positions 2, , and 6 were measured by  H NMR. From these data, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance from the direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling and indirect pathway were estimated. Indirect pathway fractions were resolved into Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources-the latter including contributions from fructose metabolism.After overnight feeding, the fraction of overnight glycogen appearance derived from direct pathway and/or glycogen cycling in glucose-fed-mice was 63 ± 1%. For the indirect pathway, Krebs cycle and triose-phosphate sources contributed 22 ± 1% and 15 ± 1%, respectively. For fructose-fed-mice, glycogen appearance was dominated by triose-phosphate sources (60 ± 2%) with lesser contributions from Krebs cycle (14 ± 1%) and direct and/or glycogen cycling (26 ± 2%). H NMR analysis of hepatic glycogen  H enrichment from  H O provides realistic profiles of dietary glucose and fructose contributions to hepatic glycogen synthesis in mice fed with diets containing 1 or the other sugar as the sole carbohydrate source.© 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415856>Antibacterial mechanism of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg's polysaccharides by metabolomics based on HPLC/MS.</a></h2><p>Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg (THDG) is used as a Chinese traditional anti-inflammatory medicine for about thousands of years. In this work, Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg's polysaccharide (TP) can inhibit E. coli's growth in initial dosing period. Compared with the antibacterial effect of Achyranthe's polysaccharide (AP) from their metabolic profile, it's obviously that their metabolic sites for E. coli were inconsistent. Moreover, TP could not only increase the level of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), decrease the level of fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FBP), but also charge the amount of the two differential metabolic with the change of the concentration and the dosing time. Actually, F6P could transform into FBP by catalyze of 6-phosphofructokinase-1(6-PFK-1), which is an important process in glycolysis. Furthermore, FBP was considered have positively correlated with E. coli's growth rate. Therefore, TP can inhibit the E. coli's proliferation by interfering with the process for glycolysis and . Based on the experimental result, we proposed a new mouthwash method to evaluate the anti-bacterial activity. Compared with AP, TP can inhibit the E. coli's growth within 2 h with a low concentration (0.%) and a short dosing time ( min).

Here, we demonstrate that  plays an important role in the process and nutrient-starvation adaptation before the pathogen host invasion. Deletion of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene BcPCK1 in  in Botrytis cinerea, the causative agent of grey mould, resulted in the failure of the ΔBcpck1 mutant conidia to germinate on hard and hydrophobic surface and penetrate host cells in the absence of glucose, reduction in conidiation and slow conidium germination in a nutrient-rich medium. The wild-type and ΔBcpck1 conidia germinate similarly in the presence of glucose (higher concentration) as the sole carbon source. Conidial glucose-content should reach a threshold level to initiate germination and host penetration. Infection structure formation by the mutants displayed a glucose-dependent fashion, which corresponded to the mutant virulence reduction. Exogenous glucose or complementation of BcPCK1 completely rescued all the developmental and virulence defects of the mutants. Our findings demonstrate that BcPCK1 plays a crucial role in B. cinerea pathogenic growth and virulence, and provide new insights into  mediating pathogenesis of plant fungal pathogens via initiation of conidial germination and host penetration.© 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896970>Portal milieu and the interplay of multiple antidiabetic effects after gastric bypass surgery.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a worldwide health problem. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leads to rapid resolution of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Decreased hepatic insulin resistance is key, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that changes in intestinal function and subsequent changes in portal venous milieu drive some of these postoperative benefits. We therefore aimed to evaluate postoperative changes in portal milieu. Two rat strains, healthy [Sprague-Dawley (SD)] and obese diabetic [Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)] rats, underwent RYGB or control surgery. After 4 wk, portal and systemic blood was sampled before and during an intestinal glucose bolus to investigate changes in intestinal glucose absorption (G) and utilization (G), and intestinal secretion of incretins and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Hepatic activity of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), which degrades incretins, was also measured. RYGB decreased G in both rat strains. G increased in SD rats and decreased in ZDF rats. In both strains, there was increased expression of intestinal hexokinase and  enzymes. Systemic incretin and GLP-2 levels also increased after RYGB. This occurred without an increase in secretion. Hepatic DPP4 activity and expression were unchanged. RYGB perturbs multiple intestinal pathways, leading to decreased intestinal glucose absorption and increased incretin levels in both healthy and diabetic animals. In diabetic rats, intestinal glucose balance shifts toward glucose release. The portal vein as the gut-liver axis may integrate these intestinal changes to contribute to rapid changes in hepatic glucose and hormone handling. This fresh insight into the surgical physiology of RYGB raises the hope of less invasive alternatives.  Portal milieu after gastric bypass surgery is an underinvestigated area. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass perturbs multiple intestinal pathways, reducing intestinal glucose absorption and increasing incretin levels. In diabetic rats, the intestine becomes a net releaser of glucose, increasing portal glucose levels. The portal vein as the gut-liver axis may integrate these intestinal changes to contribute to changes in hepatic glucose handling. This fresh insight raises the hope of less invasive alternatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31012869>Impaired ketogenesis and increased acetyl-CoA oxidation promote hyperglycemia in human fatty liver.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent, and potentially morbid, disease that affects one-third of the U.S. population. Normal liver safely accommodates lipid excess during fasting or carbohydrate restriction by increasing their oxidation to acetyl-CoA and ketones, yet lipid excess during NAFLD leads to hyperglycemia and, in some, steatohepatitis. To examine potential mechanisms, flux through pathways of hepatic oxidative metabolism and  were studied using five simultaneous stable isotope tracers in ketotic (24-hour fast) individuals with a wide range of hepatic triglyceride contents (0-52%). Ketogenesis was progressively impaired as hepatic steatosis and glycemia worsened. Conversely, the alternative pathway for acetyl-CoA metabolism, oxidation in the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle, was upregulated in NAFLD as ketone production diminished and positively correlated with rates of  and plasma glucose concentrations. Increased respiration and energy generation that occurred in liver when β-oxidation and TCA cycle activity were coupled may explain these findings, inasmuch as oxygen consumption was higher during fatty liver and highly correlated with . These findings demonstrate that increased glucose production and hyperglycemia in NAFLD is not a consequence of acetyl-CoA production per se, but how acetyl-CoA is further metabolized in liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31307210>Ileal interposition surgery targets the hepatic TGF-β pathway, influencing  and mitochondrial bioenergetics in the UCD-T2DM rat model of diabetes.</a></h2><p>Ileal interposition (IT) is a surgical procedure that increases the delivery of incompletely digested nutrients and biliary and pancreatic secretions to the distal intestinal mucosa. Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in 2-mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1. mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], lipogenesis, and . Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (,  and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation improves insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake (via increased glucose transporter type 4 [GLUT4] translocation and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]/ atypical protein kinase C [aPKC] pathway), and increasing fatty acid oxidation (via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 [ACC]), while downregulating  (via induction of small heterodimer partner [SHP] and subsequent downregulation of the gluconeogenic enzymes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [PEPCK], glucose 6-phosphatase [G6PASE], fructose- 1,6-bisphosphatase 1 [FBP1], and forkhead box protein 1 [FOXO1]). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pharmacologic activation of AMPK with AICAR (-aminoimidazole-4-carboximide riboside) administration improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in preterm baboons. 11 baboons were delivered prematurely at 125±2 days (67%) gestation.  animals were randomized to receive  days of continuous AICAR infusion at a dose of 0. mg·g-1·day-1. 6 animals were in the placebo group. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed at ±2 and 14±2 days of life. Key molecules potentially altered by AICAR (AMPK, GLUT4, ACC, PEPCK, G6PASE, FBP1, and FOXO1), and the insulin signaling molecules: insulin receptor (INSR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), protein kinase B (AKT), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) were measured using RT-PCR and western blotting. AICAR infusion did not improve whole body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in preterm baboons (12.8±2.4 vs 12.4±2.0 mg/(kg·min), p = 0.8, placebo vs AICAR). One animal developed complications during treatment. In skeletal muscle, AICAR infusion did not increase phosphorylation of ACC, AKT, or AMPK whereas it increased mRNA expression of ACACA (ACC), AKT, and PPARGC1A (PGC1α). In the liver, INSR, IRS1, G6PC3, AKT, PCK1, FOXO1, and FBP1 were unchanged, whereas PPARGC1A mRNA expression increased after AICAR infusion.

Holstein cows and dairy buffaloes are the most important dairy animals, but their differences in the metabolic mechanism of thermotolerance remain elusive. In this study, we used serum metabolomics to evaluate the differences in thermotolerance between Holstein cows and crossbred dairy buffaloes under chronic heat stress (HS) and thermal-neutral conditions. In response to HS, the body temperatures and respiratory rates were increased more for Holstein cows than for dairy buffaloes (38.78 vs 38.24 °C, p < 0.001; 43.6 vs 32. breaths/min, p < 0.001). HS greatly affected serum metabolites associated with amino acids, fatty acids, and bile acids. The enriched metabolic pathways of these serum metabolites are closely related to HS. We demonstrated that buffaloes adapt to HS by adopting a metabolism of branched-chain amino acids and ketogenic amino acids and , but Holstein cows decrease the effect of HS with citrulline and proline metabolism.

Here we apply a C mass isotopic method (INST-MFA) to quantify instantaneous fluxes of metabolites during photoautotrophic growth. INST-MFA determines the globally most accurate set of absolute fluxes for each metabolite from a finite set of measured C-isotopomer fluxes by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between experimental and predicted mass isotopomers. We show that the widely observed shift in biomass composition in cyanobacteria, demonstrated here with Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, favoring glycogen synthesis during nitrogen starvation is caused by (1) increased flux through a bottleneck step in  (3PG → GAP/DHAP), and (2) flux overflow through a previously unrecognized hybrid -pentose phosphate (hGPP) pathway. Our data suggest the slower growth rate and biomass accumulation under N starvation is due to a reduced carbon fixation rate and a reduced flux of carbon into amino acid precursors. Additionally, C flux from α-ketoglutarate to succinate is demonstrated to occur via succinic semialdehyde, an alternative to the conventional TCA cycle, in Synechococcus 7002 under photoautotrophic conditions. We found that pyruvate and oxaloacetate are synthesized mainly by malate dehydrogenase with minimal flux into acetyl coenzyme-A via pyruvate dehydrogenase. Nutrient stress induces major shifts in fluxes into new pathways that deviate from historical metabolic pathways derived from model bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29710658>Guava leaf inhibits hepatic  and increases glycogen synthesis via AMPK/ACC signaling pathways in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Psidium guajava (PG) is a short shrub or tree cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The leaf extract of PG (guava leaf) has been used historically to cure many ailments. However, mechanisms of action of guava leaf in treating diabetes are not fully understood. Effects and underlying mechanisms of guava leaf on  and glycogenesis in hepatocytes, insulin signaling proteins, liver function markers, and lipid profile in streptozotocin (STZ) injected diabetic Wistar rats were investigated within the current study. PG was given orally at the dose of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg b.w to diabetic rats for the period of 45 days. The results reveal that oral administration of PG (200 mg/kg b.w) has considerably raised the levels of insulin, glycogen, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase and significant (p < 0.05) belittled hepatic markers, gluconeogenic enzymes, and OGTT fasting blood glucose levels. OGTT has shown least statistical significance between the group  (200 mg/kg b.w) and group 6 and vital difference between group  and group 4 (400 mg/kg). PG has attenuated the triglycerides, total cholesterol, phospholipids, free fatty acid, and LDL levels and raised HDL levels. PG considerably (p < 0.05) activated IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, p-Akt, PI3K, GLUT2, AMPK, p-AMPK, and p-ACC, which are the key effector molecules of the PI3K/Akt pathway in STZ rats. The results of our study specify that treatment with PG ameliorated glucose-metabolism and lipid profile in STZ evoked diabetic rats; the rationale ought to be the activation of PI3K/Akt, phosphorylation of AMPK pathway in liver and therefore has beneficial anti-diabetic activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The proportion of the aged population is markedly increasing worldwide. The kidney, as an essential organ with a high energy requirement, is one of the most susceptible organs to aging. It is involved in glucose metabolism via gluconeogenesis, glucose filtration and reabsorption, and glucose utilization. Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) depend on lipid metabolism to meet the high demand for ATP. Recent studies have shown that aging-related kidney dysfunction is highly associated with metabolic changes in the kidney. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator, plays a major role in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisomal biogenesis, and glucose and lipid metabolism. PGC-1α is abundant in tissues, including kidney PTECs, which demand high energy. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the activation of PGC-1α by genetic or pharmacological intervention prevents telomere shortening and aging-related changes in the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The activation of PGC-1α can also prevent kidney dysfunction in various kidney diseases. Therefore, a better understanding of the effect of PGC-1α activation in various organs on aging and kidney diseases may unveil a potential therapeutic strategy against kidney aging.© 2019 The Authors.

Following 3 d of acclimation, cows were enrolled in 2 experimental periods (P). During P1 (3 d), cows were fed ad libitum and baseline data were collected. In P2 (8 d), cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: (1) saline-infused and pair-fed (CON-PF; i.v. sterile saline at 40 mL/h; n = ) or (2) LPS-infused and fed ad libitum (LPS-AL; Escherichia coli O55:B5 at 0.017, 0.020, 0.026, 0.036, 0.055, 0.088, 0.148, and 0.148 µg/kg of body weight per hour for d 1 through 8, respectively; n = 6). During P2, CON-PF cows were pair-fed to LPS-AL cows to eliminate confounding effects of dissimilar nutrient intake. Blood samples were collected on d 1 and 2 of P1 and d 1, 3, , and 7 of P2. Following the P2 d 7 a.m. milking, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver biopsies were collected for reverse transcription quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. To assess whole-body nutrient trafficking, an i.v. glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed following the a.m. milking on P2 d 8; 4 h after the GTT, cows received an epinephrine challenge. During P2, there were no treatment differences in circulating glucose. Relative to P1, CON-PF cows had or tended to have decreased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and insulin (29 and 47%, respectively) during P2, whereas neither variable changed in LPS-AL cows, leading to an overall increase in β-hydroxybutyrate and insulin (41 and 140%, respectively) relative to CON-PF cows. Circulating nonesterified fatty acids were increased from d 1 to 3 and subsequently decreased from d 3 to 7 in cows from both treatments. Blood urea nitrogen gradually decreased in CON-PF cows and increased in LPS-AL cows from d 1 to  of P2, resulting in an overall 25% increase in LPS-AL versus CON-PF cows. In response to the GTT, the glucose and insulin area under the curve were increased 33 and 56%, respectively, in LPS-AL compared with CON-PF cows; changes reflective of whole-body insulin resistance. However, protein abundance of insulin signaling markers within muscle, liver, and adipose tissue were similar between treatments. There were no observable treatment differences in the glucose or nonesterified fatty acids response to the epinephrine challenge. No treatment differences were observed in hepatic mRNA abundance of key gluconeogenic or lipid export enzymes. In conclusion, chronic LPS exposure altered multiple parameters of basal and stimulated metabolism, but did not appear to affect the molecular machinery evaluated herein.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids.

The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino acid carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino acids during normal metabolism.

The control (group 1, n=) received normal saline (0.2 ml/kg) while groups 2-4(subdivided into two as low or high dose, n= each) received adrenaline (1 μg/kg or  μg/kg), glucagon (3 ng/kg or 8 ng/kg)and glucose (10 mg/kg/min or 20 mg/kg/min). Through a midline laparatomy, the upper jejunum was cannulated for IntestinalBlood Flow (IBF) measurement. Blood glucose and lactate levels were determined using glucose oxidase and lactatedehydrogenase methods, respectively. Intestinal Glucose/Lactate Uptake (IGU/ILU) was calculated as the product of IBFand arterio-venous glucose /lactate difference [(A-V) glucose/lactate]. Jejunal tissue samples were obtained for the determinationof Glycogen Content (GC) and activities of Glycogen Synthase (GS), Glycogen Phosphorylase 'a' (GPa), hexokinase andglucose-6-phosphatase. Anthrone method was used to determine GC while activities of GS, GPa, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase were determined spectrophotometrically. Data were subjected to descriptive statistics and analyzed usingstudent's t-test and ANOVA at α0.05. Arterial and venous blood glucose and lactate were increased by adrenaline, glucagonand glucose. Venous lactate was higher than arterial lactate in all groups. Intestinal blood flow, (A-V) glucose and (A-V)lactate were increased in all the experimental groups. Intestinal glucose uptake increased by 624% (adrenaline), 705%(glucagon) and 589% (glucose) while intestinal lactate release increased by 422%, 459% and 272% respectively.

Using this microbe, riboflavin is manufactured in a two-stage process based on a rich medium with vegetable oil, yeast extract and different precursors: an initial growth and a subsequent riboflavin production phase. So far, our knowledge on the intracellular metabolic fluxes of the fungus in this complex process is limited, but appears highly relevant to better understand and rationally engineer the underlying metabolism.

The studies included the use C of yeast extract, a key component used in the process.During growth, the TCA cycle was found highly active, whereas the cells exhibited a low flux through  as well as pentose phosphate pathway. Yeast extract was the main carbon donor for anabolism,  while vegetable oil selectively contributed to the proteinogenic amino acids glutamate, aspartate, and alanine. During the subsequent riboflavin biosynthetic phase, the carbon flux through the TCA cycle remained high. Regarding riboflavin formation, most of the vitamin's carbon originated from rapeseed oil (81 ± 1%), however extracellular glycine and yeast extract also contributed with 9 ± 0% and 8 ± 0%, respectively. In addition, advanced yeast extract-based building blocks such as guanine and GTP were directly incorporated into the vitamin.Intracellular carbon fluxes for growth and riboflavin production on vegetable oil provide the first flux insight into a  fungus on complex industrial medium. The knowledge gained therefrom is valuable for further strain and process improvement. Yeast extract, while being the main carbon source during growth, contributes valuable building blocks to the synthesis of vitamin B. This highlights the importance of careful selection of the right yeast extract for a process based on its unique composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423827>Pyruvate Treatment Restores the Effectiveness of Chemotherapeutic Agents in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma and Pleural Mesothelioma Cells.</a></h2><p>Emerging evidence supports the idea that a dysfunction in cell metabolism could sustain a resistant phenotype in cancer cells. As the success of chemotherapeutic agents is often questioned by the occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR), a multiple cross-resistance towards different anti-cancer drugs represent a major obstacle to cancer treatment. The present study has clarified the involvement of the carbon metabolites in a more aggressive tumor colon adenocarcinoma phenotype and in a chemoresistant mesothelioma, and the role of pyruvate treatment in the reversion of the potentially related resistance. For the first time, we have shown that human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT29) and its chemoresistant counterpart (HT29-dx) displayed different carbon metabolism: HT29-dx cells had a higher glucose consumption compared to HT29 cells, whereas human malignant mesothelioma (HMM) cells showed a lower glucose consumption compared to HT29 cells, accompanied by a lower pyruvate production and, consequently, a higher production of lactate. When treated with pyruvate, both HT29-dx and HMM cells exhibited a re-established accumulation of doxorubicin and a lower survival ability, a decreased activity of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and a restored mitochondrial respiratory chain function, improving the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agents in these resistant cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30132511>An impaired hepatic clock system effects lipid metabolism in rats with nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Hyperlipidemia is a key clinical feature in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) that is associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events. Recent studies have suggested that the disorders of triglycerides,  and liver glucose metabolism are associated with the abnormal transcription of clock genes. However, changes to the circadian rhythm of blood lipids in NS require further exploration, and the effects of NS on the hepatic clock system remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the impaired diurnal rhythm of the hepatic core clock genes (BMAL1, CLOCK, CRY1, CRY2, PER1 and PER2) significantly induced circadian rhythm abnormalities in liver‑specific clock‑controlled genes (LXR, CYP7A1, SREBP‑1, ABCA1, DEC1 and DEC2; all P<0.05), which were significantly associated with the abnormal diurnal rhythms of triglyceride, total cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (all P<0.05) in rats with Adriamycin‑induced nephropathy. Furthermore, a protein‑protein interaction network was identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses based on the human database was conducted to obtain signaling pathway and correlation prediction analyses of overall human clock and clock‑controlled gene correlations. Strong correlations of the aforementioned clock genes were detected (avg. local clustering coefficient, 0.849) which suggested significant enrichment in circadian rhythm signaling. The present results indicated that damage to hepatic clock systems may impact blood lipid circadian rhythm disorders in NS, and offer a starting point for understanding the crosstalk between peripheral organs and peripheral clock systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29654547>Serum Amino Acid Profiling in Citrin-Deficient Children Exhibiting Normal Liver Function During the Apparently Healthy Period.</a></h2><p>Citrin (mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter) deficiency causes the failures in both carbohydrate-energy metabolism and the urea cycle, and the alterations in the serum levels of several amino acids in the stages of newborn (NICCD) and adult (CTLN2). However, the clinical manifestations are resolved between the NICCD and CTLN2, but the reasons are still unclear. This study evaluated the serum amino acid profile in citrin-deficient children during the healthy stage.Using HPLC-MS/MS analysis, serum amino acids were evaluated among 20 citrin-deficient children aged -13 years exhibiting normal liver function and 35 age-matched healthy controls.The alterations in serum amino acids characterized in the NICCD and CTLN2 stages were not observed in the citrin-deficient children. Amino acids involved in the urea cycle, including arginine, ornithine, citrulline, and aspartate, were comparable in the citrin-deficient children to the respective control levels, but serum urea was twofold higher, suggestive of a functional urea cycle. The blood sugar level was normal, but glucogenic amino acids and glutamine were significantly decreased in the citrin-deficient children compared to those in the controls. In addition, significant increases of ketogenic amino acids, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), a valine intermediate 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and β-alanine were also found in the citrin-deficient children.The profile of serum amino acids in the citrin-deficient children during the healthy stage showed different characteristics from the NICCD and CTLN2 stages, suggesting that the failures in both urea cycle function and energy metabolism might be compensated by amino acid metabolism.In the citrin-deficient children during the healthy stage, the characteristics of serum amino acids, including decrease of glucogenic amino acids, and increase of ketogenic amino acids, BCAAs, valine intermediate, and β-alanine, were found by comparison to the age-matched healthy control children, and it suggested that the characteristic alteration of serum amino acids may be resulted from compensation for energy metabolism and ammonia detoxification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234024>Protective effects of melatonin on sepsis-induced liver injury and dysregulation of gluconeogenesis in rats through activating SIRT1/STAT3 pathway.</a></h2><p>Sepsis, a life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, usually leads to serious complications including liver damage and dysregulated metabolic homoeostasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of melatonin in rats with caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, which mimics critical infections in humans and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received CLP surgery under anaesthesia to induce polymicrobial sepsis. Melatonin (20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected every 12 h for 7 days after CLP, with or without intraperitoneal injection of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 ( mg/kg). Markers of glucose metabolism, inflammation, liver function and associated signaling pathway were measured. Septic rats exhibited marked inhibition of the hepatic SIRT1/STAT3 pathway, along with increased blood glucose levels and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Melatonin administration efficiently attenuated liver dysfunction and glucose metabolism disorders by promoting hepatic SIRT1 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by EX527 significantly diminished the protective effects of melatonin on sepsis induced liver injury, hyperglycaemia and STAT3 inactivation. These results emphasize that melatonin is a potential therapeutic agent for sepsis-associated liver injury and glucose metabolism disorders, possibly acting by targeting SIRT1-mediated STAT3 activation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The underlying mechanisms should be further revealed. In this study, male KM mice were exposed to tributyltin (TBT) at 0.,  and 50 μg/kg once every three days for 45 days. The TBT-treated mice exhibited an elevation of fasting blood glucose level and glucose intolerance. The fasting serum insulin levels were increased and reached a significant difference in the 50 μg/kg group; the glucagon levels were significantly decreased in all the treatments. Pancreatic β-cell mass was significantly decreased in all the treatments; α-cell mass showed a significant decrease in the  and 50 ug/kg groups. The transcription of pancreatic insulin gene (Ins2) showed an up-regulation and reached a significant difference in the  and 50 μg/kg groups, which would be responsible for the increased serum insulin levels. The transcription of glucagon gene (Gcg) in the pancreas was significantly down-regulated in the  and 50 ug/kg groups. The protein expression of hepatic glucagon receptor was down-regulated, while the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was up-regulated accompanied by increased hepatic glycogen content. These results indicated that hepatic  was enhanced during insulin resistance stage caused by TBT exposure, which would exert a potential risk inducing the development of diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To fill this gap, we captured House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) from rural and urban environments and hypothesized that increased access to human refuse in urban areas may significantly alter the gut microbiome and nutritional physiology of Sparrows. While there were no significant differences in circulating triglycerides or free glycerol concentrations between populations, urban birds had significantly greater blood glucose concentrations, which suggests greater circulating glucagon concentrations, accessibility to carbohydrates, and/or higher rates of  in an urban setting. Rural birds had significantly more plasma uric acid, suggesting that they may metabolize more proteins or experience lower inflammation than urban birds. Rural birds also had significantly higher liver free glycerol concentrations, indicating that they metabolize more fat than urban birds. There were no significant differences in the relative abundance of gut microbial taxa at the phyla level between the two populations, but linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that urban House Sparrows were more enriched with class- and order-level microbes from the phylum Proteobacteria, which are implicated in several mammalian intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. These findings demonstrate that urbanization significantly alters the nutritional physiology and the composition of the gut microbiome of House Sparrows.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the present study investigated the role of miR-99a in macrophage phenotype activation and adipose tissue inflammation. M2 BMDMs showed a significant increase in miR-99a expression when compared to the M0 and M1 phenotypes. Phenotype-switching experiments established an association between upregulated miR-99a expression and the M2 phenotype. Overexpression of miR-99a prevented M1 phenotype activation and attenuated bactericidal activity. Likewise, knockdown of miR-99a abolished M2 phenotype activation. By means of in silico target prediction tools and a luciferase reporter assay, TNFα was identified as a direct target of miR-99a. Knockdown of TNFα recapitulated the effect of miR-99a overexpression in M1 BMDMs. In a db/db mice model, miR-99a expression was reduced in eWAT and F4/80 ATMs. Systemic overexpression of miR-99a in db/db mice attenuated adipocyte hypertrophy with increased CD301 and reduced CD86 immunostaining. Flow cytometry analysis also showed an increased M2 and a reduced M1 macrophage population. Mimics of miR-99a also improved the diabetic dyslipidemia and insulin signaling in eWAT and liver, with an attenuated expression of  and cholesterol metabolism genes in the liver. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of miR-99a-overexpressing macrophages in the db/db mice recapitulated in vivo miR-99a mimic effects with increased M2 and reduced M1 macrophage populations and improved systemic glucose, insulin sensitivity, and insulin signaling in the eWAT and liver. The present study demonstrates that miR-99a mimics can regulate macrophage M1 phenotype activation by targeting TNFα. miR-99a therapeutics in diabetic mice reduces the adipose tissue inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577938>HS218 as an FXR antagonist suppresses  by inhibiting FXR binding to PGC-1α promoter.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a member of nuclear receptor is tightly associated with glucose metabolism. Accumulated evidence has addressed the potential of FXR antagonist in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), although the related mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we determined a specific FXR antagonist HS218 (N-benzyl-N-(3-(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,4-dichlorobenzamide), which exhibited high activities in suppressing  and ameliorating glucose homeostasis in db/db and HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. We would like to investigate the mechanisms underlying FXR antagonism in the regulation of  by using HS218 as a probe.HS218 was evaluated by glucose output assay. Binding affinity of HS218 to the ligand binding domain of FXR (FXR-LBD) was detected by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology-based Biacore and fluorescence quenching assays. Mammalian one-hybrid and transactivation assays were carried out to detect the antagonistic effect of HS218 on FXR. Real-time PCR assay was performed to measure the expressions of FXR-target and gluconeogenic genes. Anti-diabetic efficiencies of HS218 were determined in db/db and HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. Assays by promoter '-deletion analysis and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed to detect the binding of FXR to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) promoter. Western blot assay was used to determine the protein level in either cells or the liver tissues of mice.We determined that HS218 as a new FXR specific antagonist could FXR-dependently suppress  in mouse primary hepatocytes, and effectively improve glucose homeostasis in db/db and HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice. HS218 decreased  by inhibiting the FXR-induced increase in the promoter activity of the key gluconeogenic gene PGC-1α, leading to the repression of PGC-1α and its target gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα).To our knowledge, our work might be the first report on the mechanism underlying FXR antagonist in the regulation of , and all results have also highlighted the potential of HS218 in the treatment of T2DM.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The encoding gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the gene product was characterized. The recombinant protein was produced in soluble and active form. Phosphofructokinase activity of TK0376 was metal-ion dependent and the highest activity (5090 μmol min mg) was found in the presence of Co followed by Mg (3280 μmol min mg) at 90°C and pH 7.. TK0376 preferred ADP as phosphoryl donor, however, it could be replaced by ATP but with a -fold lower activity. It catalyzed the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate and dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In addition, it was able to phosphorylate glucose and nucleosides but with a much lower rate compared to that of fructose 6-phosphate. The apparent k and K values against fructose 6-phosphate were 4238 s and 0.74 mM, respectively. The rate of dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 3-times lower at 50°C than the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate. Similarly, the rate of phosphorylation of glucose was 450-fold lower than that of fructose 6-phosphate. Phosphofructokinase activity was not allosterically regulated, but it was slightly enhanced by phosphoenol pyruvate, and inhibited by ATP and AMP in a competitive manner.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Carnivorous fish are considered glucose intolerant, as they exhibit poor ability in using dietary carbohydrates. To increase the current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms by which metformin can improve glucose homeostasis in carnivorous fish, we addressed the effect of intraperitoneal administration of metformin, in the presence or absence of a glucose load, on metabolic rate-limiting enzymes and lipogenic factors in the liver of gilthead sea bream ( Sparus aurata). Hyperglycemia markedly upregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, PFK1)  h following glucose administration, while at 24 h posttreatment, it increased isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activity, a key enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the expression of lipogenic factors (PGC1β, Lpin1, and SREBP1). Metformin counteracted glucose-dependent effects, and downregulated glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and mammalian target of rapamycin  h posttreatment in the absence of a glucose load, leading to decreased long-term activity of PFK1 and IDH. The results of the present study suggest that hyperglycemia enhances lipogenesis in the liver of S. aurata and that metformin may exert specific metabolic effects in fish by decreasing hepatic transdeamination and suppressing the use of amino acids as gluconeogenic substrates. Our findings highlight the role of amino acid metabolism in the glucose-intolerant carnivorous fish model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30758974>Differential effects of intrauterine growth restriction and a hypersinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp on metabolic pathways and insulin action in the fetal liver.</a></h2><p>Intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetal sheep have increased hepatic glucose production (HGP) that is resistant to suppression during a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp (insulin clamp). We hypothesized that the IUGR fetal liver would have activation of metabolic and signaling pathways that support HGP and inhibition of insulin-signaling pathways. To test this, we used transcriptomic profiling with liver samples from control (CON) and IUGR fetuses receiving saline or an insulin clamp. The IUGR liver had upregulation of genes associated with /glycolysis, transcription factor regulation, and cytokine responses and downregulation of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis, amino acid degradation, and detoxification pathways. During the insulin clamp, genes associated with cholesterol synthesis and innate immune response were upregulated in CON and IUGR. There were 20-fold more genes differentially expressed during the insulin clamp in IUGR versus CON. These genes were associated with proteasome activation and decreased amino acid and lipid catabolism. We found increased , , and  expression and decreased  expression as molecular targets for increased HGP in IUGR. As candidate genes for resistance to insulin's suppression of HGP, expression of , , and  increased more during the insulin clamp in CON compared with IUGR. Metabolites were measured with H-nuclear magnetic resonance and support increased amino acid concentrations, decreased mitochondria activity and energy state, and increased cell stress in the IUGR liver. These results demonstrate a robust response, beyond suppression of HGP, during the insulin clamp and coordinate responses in glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism in the IUGR fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29796388>Spontaneous mutations in  and  suppress the short chronological lifespan of budding yeast lacking SNF1/AMPK.</a></h2><p>Chronologically aging yeast cells are prone to adaptive regrowth, whereby mutants with a survival advantage spontaneously appear and re-enter the cell cycle in stationary phase cultures. Adaptive regrowth is especially noticeable with short-lived strains, including those defective for SNF1, the homolog of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). SNF1 becomes active in response to multiple environmental stresses that occur in chronologically aging cells, including glucose depletion and oxidative stress. SNF1 is also required for the extension of chronological lifespan (CLS) by caloric restriction (CR) as defined as limiting glucose at the time of culture inoculation. To identify specific downstream SNF1 targets responsible for CLS extension during CR, we screened for adaptive regrowth mutants that restore chronological longevity to a short-lived ∆ parental strain. Whole genome sequencing of the adapted mutants revealed missense mutations in TPR motifs 9 and 10 of the transcriptional co-repressor Cyc8 that specifically mediate repression through the transcriptional repressor Mig1. Another mutation occurred in  itself, thus implicating the activation of Mig1-repressed genes as a key function of SNF1 in maintaining CLS. Consistent with this conclusion, the  TPR mutations partially restored growth on alternative carbon sources and significantly extended CLS compared to the ∆ parent. Furthermore,  TPR mutations reactivated multiple Mig1-repressed genes, including the transcription factor gene , which is responsible for activating genes of the glyoxylate and  pathways. Deleting  completely blocked CLS extension by the  TPR mutations on CLS, identifying these pathways as key Snf1-regulated CLS determinants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29864922>Vernonia amygdalina Delile extract inhibits the hepatic  through the activation of adenosine-'monophosph kinase.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that Vernonia amygdalina Delile(VA) presents an anti-diabetic effect, and the effect of VA on lowering glucose is formulated via suppressing the expression of the key hepatic  enzyme. Therefore, we further explored the probable mechanism of VA on dismissing hepatic  through the activation of adenosine-' monophosphate kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro.We developed type 2 diabetic mice with STZ and oral administration with VA (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) once a day for 6 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted. The expression levels of AMPK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) proteins in live were evaluated by western blot. Then, we further explored the mechanism of VA on hepatic  in vitro experiments. Glucose production and the expression of AMPK, PEPCK and G6Pase proteins were detected after VA treatment with the presence of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.VA reduced FBG and caused a significant improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in STZ-induced mice. VA inhibited the elevated expression of  key enzymes (PEPCK and G6Pase) and up-regulated AMPK activity in liver. In palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 cells, VA decreased glucose production and the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase proteins, also activated AMPK pathway. The effects of VA on  could be reversed by Compound C.These results reveal that VA suppresses hepatic  at least partially through activating the AMPK.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The median survival time for patients with GBM is 15 months. GBM resistance to treatment is associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). CD133 membrane glycoprotein is the best‑known marker of GBM CSCs. The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the proliferation of all stem cells. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to examine the expression levels of proteins associated with the Wnt signaling pathway in СD133+ CSCs of human GBM. Furthermore, potential targets that may regulate СD133+ CSCs in human GBM were investigated. The human GBM U‑87MG cell line was cultured in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor and no serum. Immunohistochemical characteristics of glioma spheres were investigated based on the expression of key markers of CSCs. CD133+ cells were extracted from glioma spheres by cell sorting and then lysed. High‑performance liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry was used for proteome analysis. Lysates of CD133‑ cells in GBM were used for comparison. The present study was the first to describe the conceptual proteome differences between GBM and CD133+ CSCs of the common pool. Major differences were identified in the glycolysis/, focal adhesion, tight junction and Wnt signaling pathways. This study aimed to analyze the crucial role that proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway play in stem cell proliferation. The identified proteins were analyzed for their association with the Wnt signaling pathway using the international open databases PubMed, Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. An increased expression of 12 proteins associated with the Wnt signaling pathway were identified in GBM CD133+ CSCs, which included catenin β‑1, disheveled associated activator of morphogenesis 1, RAC family small GTPase 2 and RAS homolog gene family member A, a number of which are also associated with adherens junctions. The Wnt signaling pathway is not upregulated in CSCs; however, the high expression levels of adenomatous polyposis coli, β‑catenin, C‑terminal binding protein (CtBP) and RuvB‑like AAA ATPase 1 (RUVBL1 or Pontin52) proteins suggest the possibility of alternative activation of specific genes in the nuclei of these cells. Calcyclin‑binding protein, casein kinase II α, casein kinase II β, CtBP1, CtBP2, CUL1 and RUVBL1 proteins may be used as targets for the pharmaceutical regulation of CSCs in complex GBM treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065987>Comparison of metabolomic responses of earthworms to sub-lethal imidacloprid exposure in contact and soil tests.</a></h2><p>Eisenia fetida earthworms were exposed to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid for 48 h via contact filter paper tests and soil tests. After the exposure, H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics was used to measure earthworm sub-lethal responses by analyzing the changes in the polar metabolite profile. Maltose, glucose, malate, lactate/threonine, myo-inositol, glutamate, arginine, lysine, tyrosine, leucine, and phenylalanine relative concentrations were altered with imidacloprid exposure in soil. In addition to these metabolites (excluding leucine and phenylalanine), fumarate, ATP, inosine, betaine, scyllo-inositol, glutamine, valine, tryptophan, alanine, tyrosine, and isoleucine relative concentrations shifted with imidacloprid exposure during contact tests. Metabolite changes in E. fetida earthworms exposed to imidacloprid showed a non-linear concentration response and an upregulation in . Overall, imidacloprid exposure in soil induces a less pronounced response in metabolites glucose, maltose, fumarate, adenosine-'-triphosphate (ATP), inosine, scyllo-inositol, lactate/threonine, and tyrosine in comparison to the response observed via contact tests. Thus, our study highlights that tests in soil can result in a different metabolic response in E. fetida and demonstrates the importance of different modes of exposure and the extent of metabolic perturbation in earthworms. Our study also emphasizes the underlying metabolic disruption of earthworms after acute sub-lethal exposure to imidacloprid.

The roles of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) in regulating cancer metabolism at the level of both glycolysis and  are mostly unknown. We previously showed that lncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) acts as a proto-oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated the role of MALAT1 in regulating cancer glucose metabolism. MALAT1 upregulated the expression of glycolytic genes and downregulated gluconeogenic enzymes by enhancing the translation of the metabolic transcription factor TCF7L2. MALAT1-enhanced TCF7L2 translation was mediated by upregulation of SRSF1 and activation of the mTORC1-4EBP1 axis. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mTOR and Raptor or expression of a hypophosphorylated mutant version of eIF4E-binding protein (4EBP1) resulted in decreased expression of TCF7L2. MALAT1 expression regulated TCF7L2 mRNA association with heavy polysomes, probably through the TCF7L2 '-untranslated region (UTR), as determined by polysome fractionation and 'UTR-reporter assays. Knockdown of TCF7L2 in MALAT1-overexpressing cells and HCC cell lines affected their metabolism and abolished their tumorigenic potential, suggesting that the effects of MALAT1 on glucose metabolism are essential for its oncogenic activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that MALAT1 contributes to HCC development and tumor progression by reprogramming tumor glucose metabolism. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that lncRNA MALAT1 contributes to HCC development by regulating cancer glucose metabolism, enhancing glycolysis, and inhibiting  via elevated translation of the transcription factor TCF7L2.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612029>Screening and identification of key biomarkers in lung squamous cell carcinoma by bioinformatics analysis.</a></h2><p>The high mortality rate of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is in part due to the lack of early detection of its biomarkers. The identification of key molecules involved in LUSC is therefore required to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment outcomes. The present study used the microarray datasets GSE31552, GSE6044 and GSE12428 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted to construct the protein-protein interaction network of DEGs and hub genes module using STRING and Cytoscape. The 67 DEGs identified consisted of 42 upregulated genes and 25 downregulated genes. The pathways predicted by KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of DEGs mainly included cell cycle, cell proliferation, glycolysis or , and tetrahydrofolate metabolic process. Further analysis of the University of California Santa Cruz and ONCOMINE databases identified 17 hub genes. Overall, the present study demonstrated hub genes that were closely associated with clinical tissue samples of LUSC, and identified TYMS, CCNB2 and RFC4 as potential novel biomarkers of LUSC.

Metformin functions in part by activating '-AMP-activated protein kinase, reducing hepatic  and blood glucose. Metformin also upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Several population studies have shown levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) positively correlate with insulin resistance. Because BCAA catabolic enzyme content is regulated by PGC-1α, we hypothesized metformin may alter BCAA catabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of metformin at varying concentrations on myotube metabolism and related gene and protein expression. C2C12 myotubes were treated with metformin at 30 uM (physiological) or 2 mM (supraphysiological) for up to 24 hours. Metabolic gene expression was measured via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, protein expression was measured using Western blot, and mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism were measured via oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate, respectively. Supraphysiological metformin upregulated PGC-1α mRNA expression along with related downstream targets, yet the reduced expression of electron transport chain components as well as basal and peak cell metabolism. Supraphysiological metformin also suppressed branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) and branched-chain-alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase E1a (BCKDHa) mRNA expression as well as BCAT2 protein expression and BCKDHa activity, which was accompanied by decreased Kruppel-like factor 15 protein expression. Physiological levels of metformin suppressed BCKDHa and cytochrome c oxidase mRNA expression at early time points (4-12 hours) but had no effect on any other outcomes. Together these data suggest metformin may suppress BCAA catabolic enzyme expression or activity, possibly reducing levels of circulating gluconeogenic substrates.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744350>Effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on metabolites, lipolysis and  in Holstein cows.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on metabolites, lipolysis and  in cows during the transition period.Thirty-nine Holstein dry cows were blocked and assigned randomly to three groups, fed a high energy density diet (HD, 1.62 Mcal of net energy for lactation [NEL]/kg dry matter [DM]), a medium energy density diet (MD, 1.47 Mcal NEL/kg DM), or a low energy density diet (LD, 1.30 Mcal NEL/kg DM) prepartum; they were fed the same lactation diet to 28 days in milk (DIM). All the cows were housed in a free-stall barn and fed ad libitum.The reduced energy density diets decreased the blood insulin concentration and increased nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration in the prepartum period (p<0.05). They also increased the concentrations of glucose, insulin and glucagon, and decreased the concentrations of NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate during the first 2 weeks of lactation (p<0.05). The plasma urea nitrogen concentration of both prepartum and postpartum was not affected by dietary energy density (p>0.05). The dietary energy density had no effect on mRNA abundance of insulin receptors, leptin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in adipose tissue, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α in liver during the transition period (p>0.05). The HD cows had higher mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase at 3 DIM compared with the MD cows and LD cows (p = 0.001). The mRNA abundance of hepatic pyruvate carboxykinase at 3 DIM tended to be increased by the reduced energy density of the close-up diets (p = 0.08).The reduced energy density diet prepartum was effective in controlling adipose tissue mobilization and improving the capacity of hepatic  postpartum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31133647>Activation of the unfolded protein response in high glucose treated endothelial cells is mediated by methylglyoxal.</a></h2><p>Metabolic dysfunction of endothelial cells in hyperglycemia contributes to the development of vascular complications of diabetes where increased reactive glycating agent, methylglyoxal (MG), is involved. We assessed if increased MG glycation induced proteotoxic stress, identifying related metabolic drivers and protein targets. Human aortal endothelial cells (HAECs) were incubated in high glucose concentration (20 mM versus  mM control) in vitro for 3-6 days. Flux of glucose metabolism, MG formation and glycation and changes in cytosolic protein abundances, MG modification and proteotoxic responses were assessed. Similar studies were performed with human microvascular endothelial HMEC-1 cells where similar outcomes were observed. HAECs exposed to high glucose concentration showed increased cellular concentration of MG (2.27 ± 0.21 versus 1.28 ± 0.03 pmol/10 cells, P < 0.01) and formation of MG-modified proteins (24.0 ± 3.7 versus 14.1 ± 3.2 pmol/10 cells/day; P < 0.001). In proteomics analysis, high glucose concentration increased proteins of the heat shock response - indicating activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) with downstream inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses. Proteins susceptible to MG modification were enriched in protein folding, protein synthesis, serine/threonine kinase signalling,  and gluconeogenesis. MG was increased in high glucose by increased flux of MG formation linked to increased glucose metabolism mediated by proteolytic stabilisation and increase of hexokinase-2 (HK-2); later potentiated by proteolytic down regulation of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) - the major enzyme of MG metabolism. Silencing of Glo1, selectively increasing MG, activated the UPR similarly. Silencing of HK-2 prevented increased glucose metabolism and MG formation. trans-Resveratrol and hesperetin combination (tRES-HESP) corrected increased MG and glucose metabolism by increasing expression of Glo1 and decreasing expression of HK-2. Increased MG glycation activates the UPR in endothelial cells and thereby may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction in diabetic vascular disease where tRES-HESP may provide effective therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626112>Physiological Analysis and Proteome Quantification of Alligator Weed Stems in Response to Potassium Deficiency Stress.</a></h2><p>The macronutrient potassium is essential to plant growth, development and stress response. Alligator weed () has a high tolerance to potassium deficiency (LK) stress. The stem is the primary organ responsible for transporting molecules from the underground root system to the aboveground parts of the plant. However, proteomic changes in response to LK stress are largely unknown in alligator weed stems. In this study, we investigated the physiological and proteomic changes in alligator weed stems under LK stress. First, the chlorophyll and soluble protein content and SOD and POD activity were significantly altered after 15 days of LK treatment. The quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that a total of 296 proteins were differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). The functional annotation analysis revealed that LK stress elicited complex proteomic alterations that were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, plant-pathogen interactions, glycolysis/, sugar metabolism, and transport in stems. The subcellular locations analysis suggested 104 proteins showed chloroplastic localization, 81 proteins showed cytoplasmic localization and 40 showed nuclear localization. The protein⁻protein interaction analysis revealed that 56 proteins were involved in the interaction network, including 9 proteins involved in the ribosome network and 9 in the oxidative phosphorylation network. Additionally, the expressed changes of  DAPs were similar between the proteomic quantification analysis and the PRM-MS analysis, and the expression levels of eight genes that encode DAPs were further verified using an RT-qPCR analysis. These results provide valuable information on the adaptive mechanisms in alligator weed stems under LK stress and facilitate the development of efficient strategies for genetically engineering potassium-tolerant crops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31099309>Is air pollution a potential cause of neuronal injury?</a></h2><p>: Fine particle pollution, including diesel exhaust particles (DEP), is a well-recognized and significant threat to public health. Cerebrovascular disease has been shown to be among the pathologies produced by fine particle exposure, and is thought to arise in this context through oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. The manner by which these mechanisms interface with normal cerebral metabolism in their promotion of cerebrovascular pathogenesis, however, remains to be elucidated. Recent evidence has emerged that implicates a new pathway in post-stroke oxidative injury: . Therefore, we investigated whether diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-mediated oxidative injury to brain cells was associated with upregulation of the gluconeogenic pathway. : Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 at 37°C. Cells were exposed to freshly dispersed DEP preparations at 0, 6.25, 12., 25, 50, 100, or 200 µg/ml for either 3 or 24 h. Cell survival was then gauged by MTT assay, intracellular oxidative stress was quantified by fluorescence, and expression of gluconeogenic enzymes was assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. : Exposure to increasing concentrations of DEP yielded proportional, significant decreases in cell viability in conjunction with proportional, significant increases in intracellular ROS generation. These findings occurred in the context of DEP-induced reactive , as demonstrated by significant transcriptional upregulation of the key regulatory gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK, PC, G6PC, and FBP. :  was induced in human neural cells exposed to fine particles (DEP), in association with cell damage and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular injury due to fine particle pollutant exposure may proceed through derangements in gluconeogenic metabolism.

The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effect of ethanolic extract (EE) from the green cocoon sericin layer of silkworm  on mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its hypoglycaemic mechanisms. The results showed that oral EE for 7 weeks had significant ameliorative effects on all the biochemical parameters studied . The levels of oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance were significantly improved. The hypoglycaemic rate in the 350 mg kg high dosage group was 39.38%. The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the high dosage EE-treated group were significantly reduced, while activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were obviously increased. The islet area and the number of insulin-positive beta cells increased significantly in the high dose group. Furthermore, expression levels of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p-Akt and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β) involved in insulin signalling were increased. Adenosine '-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) also were activated to regulate glucose metabolism in EE-treated groups. The levels of glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) decreased, while the glucokinase (GK) level increased to promote . The results clearly indicated that oral EE, especially at a high dose, could improve the glucose metabolism of T2DM by reducing inflammatory reactions, enhancing the antioxidant capacity and insulin sensitivity, and regulating the balance between  and gluconeogenesis, which means that EE has potential ameliorative effects on T2DM mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279144>SIRT5 deacylates metabolism-related proteins and attenuates hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice.</a></h2><p>Sirtuin  (SIRT5) is a NAD-dependent lysine deacylase. The SIRT5 deficiency mouse model shows that it is dispensable for metabolic homeostasis under normal conditions. However, the biological role of SIRT5 and acylation in pathological states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains elusive.The hepatic SIRT5-overexpressing ob/ob mouse model (ob/ob-SIRT5 OE) was established by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool Protein malonylation and succinylation lysine sites were identified by immunoprecipitation coupled lipid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods.The ob/ob-SIRT5 OE mice showed decreased malonylation and succinylation, improved cellular glycolysis, suppressed , enhanced fatty acid oxidation, and attenuated hepatic steatosis. A total of 955 malonylation sites on 434 proteins and 1377 succinylation sites on 429 proteins were identified and quantitated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that malonylation was the major SIRT5 target in the glycolysis/ pathway, whereas succinylation was the preferred SIRT5 target in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.Hepatic overexpression of SIRT5 ameliorated the metabolic abnormalities of ob/ob mice, probably through demalonylating and desuccinylating proteins in the main metabolic pathways. SIRT5 and related acylation might be potential targets for metabolic disorders.

However there is no current information about their activity on glucose metabolism, although the latex is used in folk medicine for treating diabetes. In this study the phytomodulatory proteins (LP) from C. procera latex were assessed on glycemic homeostasis. Control animals received a single intravenous dose ( mg/kg) of LP or saline solution (CTL). Four hours after treatment, the animals were euthanized and their livers were excised for analysis by western blot and RT-PCR AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In vivo tests of intraperitoneal tolerance to insulin, glucose and pyruvate were also performed, and the effect of LP administration on fed glycemia was studied followed by blood analysis to determine serum insulin levels. Treatment with LP reduced glycemia two hours after glucose administration (LP: 87.2 ± 3.70 mg/dL versus CTL: 115.6 ± 8.73 mg/dL). However, there was no change in insulin secretion (CTL: 14.16 ± 0.68 mUI/mL and LP: 14.96 ± 0.55 mUI/mL). LP improved the insulin sensitivity, represented by a superior glucose decay constant during an insulin tolerance test (kITT) (4.17 ± 0.94%/min) compared to the CTL group (0.82 ± 0.72%/min), and also improved glucose tolerance at 30 min (105.2 ± 12.4 mg/dL versus 154.2 ± 18.51 mg/dL), while it decreased hepatic glucose production at 15 and 30 min (LP: 75. ± 9.31 and 52. ± 12.05 mg/dL compared to the CTL: 79.0 ± 3.02 and 84. ± 7.49 mg/dL). Furthermore, there was a significant inhibition of gene expression of PEPCK (LP: 0.66 ± 0.06 UA and CTL: 1.14 ± 0.22 UA) and an increase of phosphorylated AMPK (LP: 1.342 ± 0.21 UA versus CTL: 0.402 ± 0.09 UA). These findings confirm the effect of LP on glycemic control and suggest LP may be useful in diabetes treatment. However, the pharmacological mechanism of LP in PEPCK modulation still needs more clarification.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Biotin deficiency is very rare in those who take in a normal balanced diet. Mammals obtain biotin from food. Foods rich in biotin are egg yolk, liver, cereals (wheat, oats), vegetables (spinach, mushrooms), and rice. Dairy items and breast milk also contain biotin.

A variety of antidiabetic drugs are available with different mechanisms of action, and multiple drugs are often used concomitantly to improve glycemic control. One of the newest classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents is the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or "flozins". Recent clinical guidelines have suggested the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as add-on therapy in patients for whom metformin alone does not achieve glycemic targets, or as initial dual therapy with metformin in patients who present with higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. The FDA has approved fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets with each of the three available SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) and metformin. Both drug classes are associated with the rare but serious life-threatening complications that result from metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis (with metformin) and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (with SGLT2 inhibitors). This review summarizes the current literature on the pharmacokinetics and the molecular targets of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors. It also addresses the common adverse effects and highlights the molecular mechanisms by which this dual antihyperglycemic therapy contributes to high anion gap metabolic acidosis. In conclusion, while the combination of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors would be a better option in improving glycemic control with a low risk of hypoglycemia, an increase in the risk of metabolic acidosis during combination therapy may be borne in mind.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The multifunctional GST pi-isoform (GSTP) catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione with acrolein and inhibits c-Jun NH-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Herein, we tested whether GSTP deficiency disturbs glucose homeostasis in mice. Hepatic GST proteins were downregulated by short-term high-fat diet in wild-type (WT) mice concomitant with increased glucose intolerance, JNK activation, and cytokine mRNAs in the liver. Genetic deletion of GSTP did not affect body composition, fasting blood glucose levels, or insulin levels in mice maintained on a normal chow diet; however, compared with WT mice, the GSTP-null mice were glucose intolerant. In GSTP-null mice, pyruvate intolerance, reflecting increased hepatic , was accompanied by elevated levels of activated JNK, cytokine mRNAs, and glucose-6-phosphatase proteins in the liver. Treatment of GSTP-null mice with the JNK inhibitor 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone (SP600125) significantly attenuated pyruvate-induced hepatic  and significantly altered correlations between hepatic cytokine mRNAs and metabolic outcomes in GSTP-null mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that hepatic GSTP plays a pivotal role in glucose handling by regulating JNK-dependent control of hepatic . Thus, hepatic GSTP-JNK dysregulation may be a target of new therapeutic interventions during early stages of glucose intolerance to prevent the worsening metabolic derangements associated with human obesity and its relentless progression to diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376605>Illuminated night alters behaviour and negatively affects physiology and metabolism in diurnal zebra finches.</a></h2><p>Light at night (LAN) negatively impacts the behaviour and physiology; however, very little is known about molecular correlates of LAN-induced effects in diurnal animals. Here, we assessed LAN-induced effects on behaviour and physiology, and examined molecular changes in the liver of diurnal zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Birds were exposed to dim LAN (dLAN: 12L = 150 lux: 12D =  lux), with controls on 12L (150 lux): 12D (0 lux). dLAN altered daily activity-rest and eating patterns, induced nocturnal eating and caused body fattening and weight gain, and reduced nocturnal melatonin levels. Concomitant increased nighttime glucose levels, decreased daytime thyroxine and triglycerides levels, and hepatic lipid accumulation suggested the impairment of metabolism under dLAN. Transcriptional assays evidenced dLAN-induced negative effects on metabolism in the liver, the site of metabolic homeostasis. Particularly, increased g6pc and foxo1 mRNA expressions suggested an enhanced , while increased egr1 and star expressions suggested enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism, respectively. Similarly, overexpressed sirt1 indicated protection from the metabolic damage due to elevated  and cholesterol biosynthesis under dLAN. However, no effect on genes involved in lipogenesis (fasn) and insulin signalling pathway (socs3 and insig1) might indicate for the post transcriptional/post translational modification effects or the involvement of other genetic pathways in LAN-induced effects. We also found daily rhythm in the hepatic expression of selected clock and clock-controlled genes (per2, bmal1 and reverb-beta), with an elevated mesor and amplitude of per2 oscillation, suggesting a role of per2 in the liver metabolism. These results demonstrate dLAN-induced negative effects on the behaviour and physiology, and provide molecular insights into metabolic risks of the exposure to illuminated nights to diurnal animals including humans in an urban setting.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the effects of AhR activation on hepatic transcriptome and metabolome rhythmicity in male C57BL/6 mice orally gavaged with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) every 4 days for 28 days. TCDD diminished the rhythmicity of several core clock regulators (e.g. Arntl, Clock, Nr1d1, Per1, Cry1, Nfil3) in a dose-dependent manner, involving either a ≥ 3.3-fold suppression in amplitude or complete loss of oscillation. Accordingly, protein levels (ARNTL, REV-ERBα, NFIL3) and genomic binding (ARNTL) of select regulators were reduced and arrhythmic following treatment. As a result, the oscillating expression of 99.6% of ,636 clock-controlled hepatic genes was abolished including genes associated with the metabolism of lipids, glucose/glycogen, and heme. For example, TCDD flattened expression of the rate-limiting enzymes in both  (Pck1) and glycogenesis (Gys2), consistent with the depletion and loss of rhythmicity in hepatic glycogen levels. Examination of polar hepatic extracts by untargeted mass spectrometry revealed that virtually all oscillating metabolites lost rhythmicity following treatment. Collectively, these results suggest TCDD disrupted circadian regulation of hepatic metabolism, altering metabolic efficiency and energy storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218961>Impairment of bisphenol F on the glucose metabolism of zebrafish larvae.</a></h2><p>Bisphenol F (BPF) is a substitute of bisphenol A in the production of epoxy resin and polycarbonate. Its extensive use in consumer products leads to a wide human exposure at high levels. Although the adverse effects of BPF on animal health are of increasing public concern, its risks on systematic glucose metabolism and blood glucose concentrations still remain largely unknown. Using zebrafish larvae as the model animal, we investigated the disturbance of BPF exposure on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanisms. Zebrafish larvae at 96 h post fertilization were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μg/L of BPF for 48 h. Compared with the control group, glucose levels of larvae increased significantly in the 10 and 100 μg/L exposure groups, which are associated with enhancement of  and suppression of glycolysis induced by high doses of BPF. Additionally, both mRNA expressions and protein levels of insulin increased significantly in the 10 and 100 μg/L exposure groups, while transcription levels of genes encoding insulin receptor substrates decreased significantly in these groups, indicating a possibly decreased insulin sensitivity due to impairment of insulin signaling transduction downstream of insulin receptor. Further, compared with BPF alone, co-exposure of larvae to BPF and rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, significantly attenuates increases in both glucose levels and mRNA expressions of a key  enzyme. Our data therefore indicate impairing insulin signaling transduction may be the main mechanism through which BPF disrupts glucose metabolism and induces hyperglycemia. Results of the present study inform the health risk assessment of BPF and also suggest the use of zebrafish larvae in large-scale screening of chemicals with possible glucose metabolism disturbing effect.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we describe that dynamic acetylation of PCK1 interconverts the enzyme between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic activities. Under high glucose, p300-dependent hyperacetylation of PCK1 did not lead to protein degradation but instead increased the ability of PCK1 to perform the anaplerotic reaction, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. Lys91 acetylation destabilizes the active site of PCK1 and favors the reverse reaction. At low energy input, we demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates PCK1 and fully restores the gluconeogenic ability of PCK1. Additionally, we found that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PCK1 decreases acetylation and increases ubiquitination. Biochemical evidence suggests that serine phosphorylation adjacent to Lys91 stimulates SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of PCK1. This work reveals an unexpected capacity of hyperacetylated PCK1 to promote anaplerotic activity, and the intersection of post-translational control of PCK1 involving acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Studies have reported its hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic effects inrats. In addition to these conflicting reports, the mechanisms for its effects on blood glucose remain inconclusive. Theobjective of this study was to investigate the mechanism involved in the increased blood glucose following treatment withT. occidentalis. Twenty five (25) male albino rats (200-250g) were randomly divided into  groups (n=/group). Rats in thecontrol group received normal saline while rats in other groups were orally treated with 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight ofthe extract for either 1 or 2 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the rats were anaesthetized and blood samples were collectedfor the estimation of some biochemical parameters. The results showed significant decreases in plasma glucose after 1 weekof treatment with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. However, after 2 weeks of treatment with both doses, plasma glucose levelsincreased significantly and were higher than those of the control and the rats treated for 1 week with both doses. There werealso dose- and duration-dependent decreases in glycogen concentration in the treated rats, especially those treated for twoweeks. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity and liver glycogen concentration were lower in rats treated for 2 weeks whencompared with those treated for 1 week with both doses. Moreover, plasma lactate concentration was lower in the treatedgroups when compared with control. The results suggest that Telfairia occidentalis-induced lowering of plasma glucose afterone week of treatment probably favoured lactate oxidation/ and elicited breakdown of liver glycogen whichresulted in increased plasma glucose after two weeks of treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29675004>The Fast-Growing  Biovar  Depends on Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase and Pyruvate Phosphate Dikinase but Not on Fbp and GlpX Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatases or Isocitrate Lyase for Full Virulence in Laboratory Models.</a></h2><p>Bacteria of the genus  infect a range of vertebrates causing a worldwide extended zoonosis. The best-characterized brucellae infect domestic livestock, behaving as stealthy facultative intracellular parasites. This stealthiness depends on envelope molecules with reduced pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as revealed by the low lethality and ability to persist in mice of these bacteria. Infected cells are often engorged with brucellae without signs of distress, suggesting that stealthiness could also reflect an adaptation of the parasite metabolism to use local nutrients without harming the cell. To investigate this, we compared key metabolic abilities of  2308 Wisconsin (2308W), a cattle biovar 1 virulent strain, and  513, the reference strain of the ancestral biovar  found in wild rodents.  513 used a larger number of C substrates and showed faster growth rates , two features similar to those of , a species phylogenomically close to  biovar  that infects voles. However, whereas  shows enhanced lethality and reduced persistence in mice,  513 was similar to  2308W in this regard. Mutant analyses showed that  513 and  2308W were similar in that both depend on phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis for virulence but not on the classical gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases Fbp-GlpX or on isocitrate lyase (AceA). However,  513 used pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PpdK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PckA) for phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis  while  2308W used only PpdK. Moreover, whereas PpdK dysfunction causes attenuation of  2308W in mice, in , 513 attenuation occurred only in the double PckA-PpdK mutant. Also contrary to what occurs in  2308, a  513 malic enzyme (Mae) mutant was not attenuated, and this independence of Mae and the role of PpdK was confirmed by the lack of attenuation of a double Mae-PckA mutant. Altogether, these results decouple fast growth rates from enhanced mouse lethality in the brucellae and suggest that an Fbp-GlpX-independent gluconeogenic mechanism is ancestral in this group and show differences in central C metabolic steps that may reflect a progressive adaptation to intracellular growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088359>Transcriptomic analysis between Normal and high-intake feeding geese provides insight into adipose deposition and susceptibility to fatty liver in migratory birds.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of adipogenesis causes metabolic diseases, like obesity and fatty liver. Migratory birds such as geese have a high tolerance of massive energy intake and exhibit little pathological development. Domesticated goose breeds, derivatives of the wild greyleg goose (Anser anser) or swan goose (Anser cygnoides), have high tolerance of energy intake resembling their ancestor species. Thus, goose is potentially a model species to study mechanisms associated with adipogenesis.Phenotypically, goose liver exhibited higher fat accumulation than adipose tissues during fattening (liver increased by 3.35 fold than 1.65 fold in adipose), showing a priority of fat accumulation in liver. We found the number of differentially expressed genes in liver (13.97%) was nearly twice the number of that in adipose (6.60%). These differentially expressed genes in liver function in several important lipid metabolism pathways, immune response, regulation of cancer, while in adipose, terms closely related to protein binding,  were enriched. Typically, genes like MDH2 and SCD, which have key roles in glycolysis and fatty acids metabolism, had higher fold change in liver than in adipose tissues. Three hundred two differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs involved in regulation of metabolism in liver were also identified. For example, lncRNA XLOC_292762, which was .7 kb downstream of FERMT2, a gene involved phosphatidylinositol-3,4,-trisphosphate binding, was significantly down-regulated after the high-intake feeding period. Further investigation of documented obesity-related orthologous genes in goose suggested that understanding the evolutionary split from mammals in adipogenesis will make goose fatty liver a better resource for future research.Our research reveals that goose uses liver as the major tissue to regulate a distinct lipid synthesis and degradation flux and the dynamic expression network analyses showed numerous layers of positive responses to both massive energy intake and possible pathological development.

Although metabolic adaptations of the adipose tissue are critical for a successful transition, beyond lipolysis, alterations within adipose tissue during ketosis are not well known. The objective of this study was to investigate the adipose tissue proteome of healthy or ketotic postpartum cows to gain insights into biological adaptations that may contribute to disease outcomes. Adipose tissue biopsy was collected on  healthy and  ketotic cows at 17 (±4) d postpartum and ketosis was defined according to the clinical symptoms and serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. Morphology micrographs stained by hematoxylin-eosin showed that adipocytes were smaller in ketotic cows than in healthy cows. The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification was applied to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEP) in the adipose tissue. We identified a total of 924 proteins, 81 of which were differentially expressed between ketotic and healthy cows (P < 0.05 and fold changes >1. or <0.67). These DEP included enzymes and proteins associated with various carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism processes. The top pathways differing between ketosis and control cows were /gluconeogenesis, glucagon signaling pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The identified DEP were further validated by western blot and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Key enzymes associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit α), lactate dehydrogenase A , phosphoglucomutase 1, and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 were upregulated in ketotic cows. The expression and phosphorylation state of critical regulators of lipolysis such as perilipin-1 and hormone-sensitive lipase were also upregulated in ketotic cows. Furthermore, key proteins involved in maintaining innate immune response such as lipopolysaccharide binding protein and regakine-1 were downregulated in ketotic cows. Overall, data indicate that ketotic cows during the transition period have altered carbohydrate, lipid metabolism, and impaired immune function in the adipose tissue. This proteomics analysis in adipose tissue of ketotic cows identified several pathways and proteins that are components of the adaptation to ketosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

CAR activators, including phenobarbital, are considered rodent non-genotoxic carcinogens. Recently, trans-3,4,,4´-tetramethoxystilbene(TMS), a potential anticancer drug (DMU-212), have been shown to alleviate N-nitrosodiethylamine/phenobarbital-induced liver carcinogenesis. We studied whether TMS inhibits mouse Car to protect from the PB-induced tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified TMS as a murine CAR agonist in reporter gene experiments, in mouse hepatocytes, and in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. TMS up-regulated Car target genes Cyp2b10, Cyp2c29 and Cyp2c55 mRNAs, but down-regulated expression of genes involved in  and lipogenesis. TMS did not change or down-regulate genes involved in liver proliferation or apoptosis such as Mki67, Foxm1, Myc, Mcl1, Pcna, Bcl2, or Mdm2, which were up-regulated by another Car ligand TCPOBOP. TMS did not increase liver weight and had no significant effect on Ki67 and Pcna labeling indices in mouse liver in vivo. In murine hepatic AML12 cells, we confirmed a Car-independent proapoptotic effect of TMS. We conclude that TMS is a Car ligand with limited effects on hepatocyte proliferation, likely due to promoting apoptosis in mouse hepatic cells, while controlling Car target genes involved in xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we evaluated the hypoglycemic effects of 12 individual anthocyanins purified from PSP (Korean variety Shinzami). We separated the anthocyanins using liquid chromatography with diode array detection and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI/MS). Three anthocyanins were selected through a radical scavenging activity test. We examined whether individual anthocyanins inhibited glucose secretion in HepG2 cells (hepatic ). Additionally, we determined the effect of each anthocyanin on fasting blood glucose levels in 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice fed a 60% high-fat diet for 14 weeks. Mice were evaluated at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h after oral administration of anthocyanins (80 mg/kg), an anthocyanin-rich-fraction (80 mg/kg), positive control (metformin, 80 mg/kg), and distilled water (control).

Several kinds of iridoid glucosides exhibit hypoglycemic effect, whereas the mechanism was not clear.In this study, the effects of geniposide and gentiopicroside, two natural iridoid glucosides, on hepatic  were investigated.Glucose uptake assay, MTT assay, q-PCR, luciferase assay and western blot assay were performed to investigate the pharmacological effect of geniposide and gentiopicroside on human liver cell line L02. Thereby the fast blood glucose and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance were measured in high fat diet induced hyperglycemic mice after geniposide or gentiopicroside administration.The results showed that geniposide and gentiopicroside inhibited the transcription of G6PC and PEPCK in L02 cells and in mice. Additional experimental data indicated that these two compounds were able to inhibit the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 by inducing phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473. Furthermore, we found that these two compounds alleviated high fat diet induced hyperglycemia in mice.Geniposide and gentiopicroside might reduce blood glucose and suppress hepatic  by regulating the AKT-FOXO1 pathway, and the potential use of these two iridoid glucosides as anti-diabetic agents merits further in-depth exploration.Copyright © 2018 IMSS.

The advent and continued development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced mortality, shifting the course of HIV infection to a chronic illness. However, this is associated with an increased incidence of comorbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular complications. Using a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection, previous studies have demonstrated that chronic binge alcohol (CBA) administration decreases whole body insulin responsiveness, irrespective of ART administration. The objective of the current study was to determine the effects of CBA and ART on insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues before the development of overt clinical symptoms of SIV disease. Our results show that CBA reduced omental adipocyte cell size, increased collagen expression, and decreased the in vitro differentiation potential of adipose-derived stem cells. In contrast, it did not alter skeletal muscle or omental or hepatic expression of insulin signaling proteins. However, ART significantly decreased skeletal muscle expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog, total mechanistic target of rapamycin, and ribosomal protein S6. In addition, ART increased hepatic phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α and increased gene expression of key enzymes required for  and fatty acid synthesis. These findings suggest that CBA and ART differentially promote adverse metabolic effects in an organ-specific manner that may underlie insulin resistance associated with alcohol, SIV, and ART. Whether this is translated in PLWH with AUD remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363904>Reprogramming of gene expression in Escherichia coli cultured on pyruvate versus glucose.</a></h2><p>Previous studies revealed important roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in regulation of bacterial metabolism, stress responses and virulence. However, only a minor fraction of sRNAs is well characterized with respect to the spectra of their targets, conditional expression profiles and actual mechanisms they use to regulate gene expression to control particular biological pathways. To learn more about the specific contribution of sRNAs to the global regulatory network controlling the Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism (CCM), we employed microarray analysis and compared transcriptome profiles of E. coli cells grown on two alternative minimal media supplemented with either pyruvate or glucose, respectively. Microarray analysis revealed that utilization of these alternative carbon sources led to profound differences in gene expression affecting all major gene clusters associated with CCM as well as expression of several known (CyaR, RyhB, GcvB and RyeA) and putative (C0652) sRNAs. To assess the impact of transcriptional reprogramming of gene expression on E. coli protein abundance, we also employed two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis. Our experimental data made it possible to determine the major pathways for pyruvate assimilation when it is used as a sole carbon source and reveal the impact of other key processes (i.e., energy production, molecular transport and cell resistance to stress) associated with the CCM in E. coli. Moreover, some of these processes were apparently controlled by GcvB, RyhB and CyaR at the post-transcriptional level, thus indicating the complexity and interconnection of the regulatory networks that control CCM in bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996047>Hypoglycemia in People with Type 2 Diabetes and CKD.</a></h2><p>Among people with diabetes mellitus, CKD may promote hypoglycemia through altered clearance of glucose-lowering medications, decreased kidney , and blunted counter-regulatory response. We conducted a prospective observational study of hypoglycemia among 105 individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or a sulfonylurea using continuous glucose monitors.We enrolled 81 participants with CKD, defined as eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m, and 24 control participants with eGFR≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m frequency-matched on age, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c, and glucose-lowering medications. Each participant wore a continuous glucose monitor for two 6-day periods. We examined rates of sustained level 1 hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) and level 2 hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dl) among participants with CKD. We then tested differences compared with control participants as well as a second control population (=73) using Poisson and linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and race.Over 890 total days of continuous glucose monitoring, participants with CKD were observed to have 255 episodes of level 1 hypoglycemia, of which 68 episodes reached level 2 hypoglycemia. Median rate of hypoglycemic episodes was .3 (interquartile range, 0.0-11.7) per 30 days and mean time spent in hypoglycemia was 28 (SD 37) minutes per day. Hemoglobin A1c and the glucose management indicator were the main clinical correlates of time in hypoglycemia (adjusted differences 6 [95% confidence interval, 2 to 10] and 13 [95% confidence interval, 7 to 20] fewer minutes per day per 1% higher hemoglobin A1c or glucose management indicator, respectively). Compared with control populations, participants with CKD were not observed to have significant differences in time in hypoglycemia (adjusted differences 4 [95% confidence interval, -12 to 20] and -12 [95% confidence interval, -29 to ] minutes per day).Among people with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe CKD, hypoglycemia was common, particularly with tighter glycemic control, but not significantly different from groups with similar clinical characteristics and preserved eGFR.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30551436>Effect of oral magnesium sulfate administration on blood glucose hemostasis via inhibition of  and FOXO1 gene expression in liver and muscle in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to investigate the possible role of Mg in suppression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) enzyme via inhibition of FOXO1gene expression in liver and we also examined whether Mg contributes to decrease blood glucose in muscle via inhibiting FOXO1 gene and protein expression. Fifty rats in five groups of experiment were considered as; non-diabetic control (NDC), Mg-treated non-diabetic control (Mg-NDC), chronic diabetic (CD), Mg-treated chronic diabetic (Mg-CD), and insulin-treated chronic diabetic (Ins-CD). Streptozotocin (STZ) was used for diabetes induction. The Mg-CD and Mg-NDC groups received 10 g/l of magnesium sulfate (MgSO) added to drinking water, and Ins-CD group received 2. U/kg of insulin. The blood glucose level and body weight were measured weekly. After 16 weeks, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was done and blood samples were taken to determine the plasma levels of Mg and gastrocnemius muscle legs, and liver were isolated for both Forkhead transcription factor (FOXO1) and PEPCK enzyme genes and proteins expression. Administration of MgSO improved IPGTT, lowered blood glucose levels and decreased FOXO1 and PEPCK genes and proteins expression in muscle and liver, while insulin just could decrease FOXO1 gene and protein expression in the muscle. These findings illustrated that MgSO improved hyperglycemia via inhibition of FOXO1 gene and protein level in the muscle and liver, and it also decreased blood glucose level by prohibition of  pathway in the liver. However, long time administration of insulin did not have any effect on liver.Copyright © 2018.

The liver, being the key metabolic organ, plays a major role in handling NEB. Dairy animals handling high lactation demands are better models to understand the liver adaptive mechanisms during this phase. Therefore, we analyzed the liver transcriptome of dairy buffaloes during early postpartum. Liver biopsies were performed on three lactating buffaloes on the 15th and the 30th days of early postpartum and three heifers (controls) at the diestrous stage. Paired-end Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) identified 509 significantly differentially expressed genes (SDE) in the liver among the three groups. The SDE with log2 fold change > 3 and the unique SDE revealed the promotion of immune suppression (e.g., TCR), apoptosis (e.g., CCDC103), PGF2α synthesis, fat accumulation (e.g., BGLAP) and liver regeneration (e.g., FGF10) pathways, and the downregulation of antigen presentation (e.g., BOLA-DQA) on the 15th day of lactation. Consistently upregulated genes on the 15th and 30th days of early postpartum indicated the promotion of immune tolerance (e.g., IFITM3), medium and long-chain fatty acids' oxidation (e.g., ACSM3), and lipid accumulation (e.g., INSIG1). However, consistently downregulated genes during early postpartum showed immunosuppression, the downregulation of  from amino acids (e.g., DDO), and the biosynthesis of taurine (e.g., CSAD) and unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., SCD). Functional annotation and network analyses also indicated the promotion of immune tolerance, fat accumulation and decreased  from amino acids, and estrogen metabolism on the 15th day of lactation. Overall, the liver showed immune tolerance as an adaptive mechanism during early postpartum of buffaloes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826550>Dietary arachidonic acid decreases the expression of transcripts related to adipocyte development and chronic inflammation in the adipose tissue of juvenile grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella.</a></h2><p>Overdevelopment of adipose tissue in cultured fish is one of the biggest issues plaguing current aquaculture industry, leading to unhealthy status of fishes and production losses. Diet supplemented with 0.30% arachidonic acid (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of  chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation, glycolysis and .

Although renal ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is known to protect the kidney from I/R injury, the precise renoprotective mechanisms are not completely understood. The multiple renoprotective effects of IPC underscore the importance in understanding molecular mechanisms and the targets of action involved. This study aimed to identify the biochemical changes in renal I/R injury and investigate the renoprotective mechanisms of IPC. Herein, renal I/R was produced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats through the bilateral ligation of renal pedicles for 45 min, followed by reperfusion for 24 h. For the IPC group, rats were subjected to three cycles of 2-min ischemia, followed by a -min reperfusion, 15 min prior to renal I/R. Our data confirmed the beneficial effects that IPC has on renal I/R injury. IPC-mediated renoprotection was associated with the resolution of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and hyperglycemia. Among the numerous signaling molecules involved in the renoprotective mechanisms of IPC, an elevated protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, LC3 II conversion, along with Atg12 and protein phosphorylation of AMPK, as well as a decreased protein phosphorylation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and Akt and NF-κB DNA binding activity were identified. Importantly, the post renal I/R overproduction of counter-regulatory hormones, impaired hepatic insulin action, and augmented hepatic  were improved through IPC. As counter-regulatory hormones have been implicated in the induction of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, impaired insulin action, hyperglycemia, and tissue destruction, our findings suggest that counter-regulatory hormones may well be valuable targets of IPC for combatting renal I/R injury.© 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(3):321-329, 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29932877>Nutritional recovery with a soybean diet impaired the glucagon response but did not alter liver  in the adult offspring of rats deprived of protein during pregnancy and lactation.</a></h2><p>Nutritional recovery of early malnutrition with a soybean diet reduces liver glycogen stores in the fed state and produces liver insulin resistance. We investigated whether nutritional recovery on a soybean flour diet alters hepatic  in the adult offspring of rats deprived of protein during pregnancy and lactation. Male rats from mothers that were fed either 17% (C) or 6% (L) protein during pregnancy and lactation were maintained on a 17% casein (CC, n = 16 and LC, n = 17), 17% soybean flour (CS, n = 10 and LS, n = 10), or 6% casein (LL, n = 10) diet after weaning. The soybean diet reduced basal serum glucose (soybean diet, .6 ± 0.6 mmol/L vs. casein diet, 6.2 ± 0.6 mmol/L; p < 0.05) but increased alanine aminotransferase mRNA/GAPDH (soybean diet, 0.062 ± 0.038 vs. casein diet, 0.024 ± 0.011; p < 0.01), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA/GAPDH (soybean diet, 1.53 ± 0.52 vs. casein diet, 0.95 ± 0.43; p < 0.05), and glycerokinase protein content (soybean diet, 0.86 ± 0.08 vs. casein diet, 0.75 ± 0.11; p < 0.05).

The notothenioid group is metabolically specialized to low-temperature environments and may be vulnerable to the climatic changes imposed on the Antarctic continent. However, gradual temperature changes potentially allow an opportunity for plasticity adjustments. The present study evaluated the effect of gradual increase of temperature on the enzymatic and nonenzymatic parameters of energy metabolism in renal, branchial, hepatic, and encephalic tissue of Notothenia rossii subjected to a gradual temperature change of 0. °C/day until reaching 2 °C, 4 °C, 6 °C, and 8 °C. Under the effect of an acclimation rate of 0. °C/day, the gill tissue showed increased phosphofructokinase (PFK) enzyme activity. In the kidney, there was increased activity of the malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PDH), and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) enzymes. There was an increase in lactate concentration in the liver and an increase in GP enzyme activity in the brain. The specific tissue responses indicate the presence of thermal plasticity and an attempt to regulate energy metabolism to mitigate thermal stress in this species under these experimental conditions, possibly through the activation of glycolysis, , and glycogenolysis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The hypothesis of the present study is that HMB is a safe supplement for muscle mass gain by strength training. Based on this, the objective was to measure changes in body composition, glucose homeostasis and hepatic metabolism of HMB supplemented mice during strength training. Two of four groups of male mice (n = 6/group) underwent an 8-week training period session (climbing stairs) with or without HMB supplementation (190 mg/kgBW per day). We observed lower body mass gain (4.9 ± 0.43% versus 1.2 ± 0.43, p < 0.001) and increased liver mass (40.9 ± 0.9 mg/gBW versus 44.8 ± 1.3, p < 0.001) in the supplemented trained group compared with the non-supplemented groups. The supplemented trained group had an increase in relative adipose tissue mass (12.4 ± 0.63 mg/gBW versus 16.1 ± 0.88, P < 0.01) compared to the non-supplemented untrained group, and an increase in fasting blood glucose (111 ± 4.58 mg/dL versus 122 ± 3.70, P < 0.05) and insulin resistance (3.79 ± 0.19 % glucose decay/min versus 2.45 ± 0.28, P < 0.05) comparing with non-supplemented trained group. Adaptive heart hypertrophy was observed only in the non-supplemented trained group (4.82 ± 0.05 mg/gBW versus .12 ± 0.13, P < 0.05). There was a higher hepatic insulin-like growth factor-1 expression (P = 0.002) in supplemented untrained comparing with non-supplemented untrained group. Gene expression of  regulatory factors was increased by training and reduced by HMB supplementation.

Here, we fed breeder cocks five different diets containing 0, 0.25, 1.25, 2.50 and .00 mg kg folate throughout life. Paternal folate supplementation (FS) was beneficial to the growth and organ development of broiler offspring. Most importantly, the lipid and glucose metabolism of breeder cocks and broiler offspring were affected by paternal FS, according to biochemical and metabolomic analyses. We further employed global analyses of hepatic and spermatozoal messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA). Some key genes involved in the glycolysis or  pathway and the PPAR signalling pathway, including ,  and , were regulated by differentially expressed hepatic and spermatozoal miRNAs and lncRNAs in breeder cocks and broiler offspring. Moreover, the expression of  could also be regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in spermatozoa via competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms.

This study shows that a disruption of the intestinal barrier in CKD promotes leakage of LPS from the gut, subsequently decreasing insulin sensitivity. Butyrate treatment improved the intestinal barrier function by increasing colonic mucin and tight junction (TJ) proteins. This modulation further ameliorated metabolic functions such as insulin intolerance and improved renal function.Renal failure was induced by /6th nephrectomy (Nx) in rats. A group of Nx and control rats received sodium butyrate in drinking water. The Nx groups were compared with sham-operated controls.The Nx rats had significant increases in serum creatinine, urea and proteinuria. These animals had impaired glucose and insulin tolerance and increased , which corresponded with decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. The Nx animals suffered significant loss of intestinal TJ proteins, colonic mucin and mucin 2 protein. This was associated with a significant increase in circulating LPS, suggesting a leaky gut phenomenon. 'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, known to modulate epithelial TJs and glucose metabolism, was significantly reduced in the intestine of the Nx group. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 10, anti-bacterial peptide and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide were also lowered in the Nx cohort. Butyrate treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation, improved renal function and controlled hyperglycemia.Butyrate improves AMPK phosphorylation, increases GLP-1 secretion and promotes colonic mucin and TJ proteins, which strengthen the gut wall. This decreases LPS leakage and inflammation. Taken together, butyrate improves metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and markers of renal failure in CKD animals.© The Author(s) 2018.

If specific genetic characteristics were found to be related to FDG uptake in iCCA, we can predict molecular features based on the FDG uptake patterns and to distinguish different types of treatments. In this purpose, we analyzed RNA sequencing in iCCA patients to evaluate gene expression signatures associated with FDG uptake patterns.We performed RNA sequencing of 22 cases iCCA who underwent preoperative F-FDG-PET, and analyzed the clinical and molecular features according to the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). Genes and biological pathway which are associated with SUVmax were analyzed.Patients with SUVmax higher than 9.0 (n = 9) had poorer disease-free survival than those with lower SUVmax (n = 13, P = 0.035). Genes related to glycolysis and , phosphorylation and cell cycle were significantly correlated with SUVmax (r ≥ 0.). RRM2, which is related to the toxicity of Gemcitabine was positively correlated with SUVmax, and SLC27A2 which is associated with Cisplastin response was negatively correlated with SUVmax. According to the pathway analysis, cell cycle, cell division, hypoxia, inflammatory, and metabolism-related pathways were enriched in high SUVmax patients.The genomic features of gene expression and pathways can be predicted by FDG uptake features in iCCA. Patients with high FDG uptake have enriched cell cycle, metabolism and hypoxic pathways, which may lead to a more rational targeted treatment approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30878016>Short-term strength training reduces  and NAFLD in obese mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a positive correlation with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The aerobic training is an important tool in combating NAFLD. However, no studies have demonstrated the molecular effects of short-term strength training on the accumulation of hepatic fat in obese mice. This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term strength training on the mechanisms of oxidation and lipid synthesis in the liver of obese mice. The short duration protocol was used to avoid changing the amount of adipose tissue. Swiss mice were separated into three groups: lean control (CTL), sedentary obese (OB) and strength training obese (STO). The obese groups were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and the STO group performed the strength training protocol 1 session/day for 15 days. The short-term strength training reduced hepatic fat accumulation, increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and controlling hepatic glucose production. The obese animals increased the mRNA of lipogenic genes Fasn and Scd1 and reduced the oxidative genes Cpt1a and Ppara. On the other hand, the STO group presented the opposite results. Finally, the obese animals presented higher levels of lipogenic proteins (ACC and FAS) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), but the short-term strength training was efficient in reducing this condition, regardless of body weight loss. In conclusion, there was a reduction of obesity-related hepatic lipogenesis and inflammation after short-term strength training, independent of weight loss, leading to improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity and glycemic homeostasis in obese mice. Key points: (1) Short-term strength training (STST) reduced fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver; (2) Hepatic insulin sensitivity and HPG control were increased with STST; (3) The content and activity of ACC and content of FAS were reduced with STST; (4) STST improved hepatic fat accumulation and glycemic homeostasis; () STST effects were observed independently of body weight change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30517676>Adipose Tissue Exosomal Proteomic Profile Reveals a Role on Placenta Glucose Metabolism in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.</a></h2><p>Molecules produced by adipose tissue (AT) function as an endocrine link between maternal AT and fetal growth by regulating placental function in normal women and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).We hypothesized that AT-derived exosomes (exo-AT) from women with GDM would carry a specific set of proteins that influences glucose metabolism in the placenta.Exosomes were isolated from omental AT-conditioned media from normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women (n = 65) and pregnant women with GDM (n = 82). Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry was used to construct a small ion library from AT and exosomal proteins, followed by ingenuity pathway analysis to determine the canonical pathways and biofunctions. The effect of exosomes on human placental cells was determined using a Human Glucose Metabolism RT2 Profiler PCR array.The number of exosomes (vesicles/μg of tissue/24 hours) was substantially (1.7-fold) greater in GDM than in NGT, and the number of exosomes correlated positively with the birthweight Z score. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the exosomal proteins revealed differential expression of the proteins targeting the sirtuin signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, and mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling pathway in GDM compared with NGT. GDM exo-AT increased the expression of genes associated with glycolysis and  in placental cells compared with the effect of NGT exo-AT.Our findings are consistent with the possibility that AT exosomes play an important role in mediating the changes in placental function in GDM and might be responsible for some of the adverse consequences in this pregnancy complication, such as fetal overgrowth.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779881>Loss of growth hormone-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription  (STAT5) signaling in mice results in insulin sensitivity with obesity.</a></h2><p>Growth hormone (GH) has an important function as an insulin antagonist with elevated insulin sensitivity evident in humans and mice lacking a functional GH receptor (GHR). We sought the molecular basis for this sensitivity by utilizing a panel of mice possessing specific deletions of GHR signaling pathways. Metabolic clamps and glucose homeostasis tests were undertaken in these obese adult C57BL/6 male mice, which indicated impaired hepatic . Insulin sensitivity and glucose disappearance rate were enhanced in muscle and adipose of mice lacking the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)  the GHR (-391) as for GHR-null () mice. These changes were associated with a striking inhibition of hepatic glucose output associated with altered glycogen metabolism and elevated hepatic glycogen content during unfed state. The enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity was associated with increased insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 activation along with activated downstream protein kinase B signaling cascades. Although phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ()- expression was unchanged, its inhibitory acetylation was elevated because of decreased sirtuin-2 expression, thereby promoting loss of PCK1. Loss of STAT5 signaling to defined chromatin immunoprecipitation targets would further increase lipogenesis, supporting hepatosteatosis while lowering glucose output. Finally, up-regulation of IL-15 expression in muscle, with increased secretion of adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor 1 from adipose tissue, is expected to promote insulin sensitivity.-Chhabra, Y., Nelson, C.

The challenge is to identify the metabolic pathways affected by the excessive consumption of these dietary components when they are consumed in excess, to unravel the molecular mechanisms leading to metabolic pathologies and identify novel therapeutic targets to manage them. Mechanistic (mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as one of the key molecular nodes that integrate extracellular signals, such as energy status and nutrient availability, to trigger cell responses that could lead to the above-mentioned diseases through the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. By activating mTOR signalling, excessive consumption of simple sugars (such as fructose and glucose), could modulate hepatic , lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake and catabolism and thus lipid deposition in the liver. In the present review we will discuss some of the most recent studies showing the central role of mTOR in the metabolic effects of excessive simple sugar consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533629>Uncovering sperm metabolome to discover biomarkers for bull fertility.</a></h2><p>Subfertility decreases the efficiency of the cattle industry because artificial insemination employs spermatozoa from a single bull to inseminate thousands of cows. Variation in bull fertility has been demonstrated even among those animals exhibiting normal sperm numbers, motility, and morphology. Despite advances in research, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the causes of low fertility in some bulls have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profile of bull spermatozoa using non-targeted metabolomics. Statistical analysis and bioinformatic tools were employed to evaluate the metabolic profiles high and low fertility groups. Metabolic pathways associated with the sperm metabolome were also reported.A total of 22 distinct metabolites were detected in spermatozoa from bulls with high fertility (HF) or low fertility (LF) phenotype. The major metabolite classes of bovine sperm were organic acids/derivatives and fatty acids/conjugates. We demonstrated that the abundance ratios of five sperm metabolites were statistically different between HF and LF groups including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), carbamate, benzoic acid, lactic acid, and palmitic acid. Metabolites with different abundances in HF and LF bulls had also VIP scores of greater than 1. and AUC- ROC curves of more than 80%. In addition, four metabolic pathways associated with differential metabolites namely alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, β-alanine metabolism, glycolysis or , and pyruvate metabolism were also explored.This is the first study aimed at ascertaining the metabolome of spermatozoa from bulls with different fertility phenotype using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We identified five metabolites in the two groups of sires and such molecules can be used, in the future, as key indicators of bull fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31067716>Exploring Differential Transcriptome between Jejunal and Cecal Tissue of Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>The study proposed an exploratory functional analysis on differential gene expression of the jejunum and of cecum in chickens. For this study, 150 Ross 308 male chickens were randomly allotted in six pens (25 birds/pen) and fed the same commercial diet. From 19 birds of 42 days of age, jejunum and cecum mucosae were collected for RNA extraction for transcriptome microarray analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) submitted to DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software evidenced enriched gene clusters for biological functions differentiated in the tissues. DAVID analysis in the jejunum showed enriched annotations for cell membrane integral components, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) signaling pathway, and peroxisome and lipid metabolism, and showed DEGs for , not previously reported in chicken jejunum. The cecum showed enriched annotations for disulfide bond category, cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycoprotein category, cell cycle, and extracellular matrix (ECM). GSEA analysis in the jejunum showed peroxisome and PPAR signaling pathway-related gene sets, as found with DAVID, and gene sets for immune regulation, tryptophan and histidine metabolism, and renin-angiotensin system, like in mammals. The cecum showed cell cycle and regulation processes, as well as ECM receptor interaction and focal adhesion-related gene sets.

However, the underlying mechanism by which liraglutide improves liver insulin resistance remains to be elucidated. The proto‑oncogene Wnt (Wnt) signaling pathway has been reported to be associated with glucose and lipid metabolism. Using in vivo and in vitro models of diabetes and insulin resistance, it was investigated whether the beneficial effects of liraglutide on liver glucose metabolism are mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway. The results of the present study demonstrate that body weight, fasting blood glucose, insulin levels and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance were markedly decreased in db/db mice treated with liraglutide compared with control mice. Liraglutide also improved liver morphology and reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets. Furthermore, the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was downregulated, whereas the expression of phosphorylated forkhead box O1, Wnt signaling pathway‑associated molecules, β‑catenin, transcription factor 7‑like 2 and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β was upregulated in the liver of mice treated with liraglutide. In the in vitro study, increased  and decreased glucose uptake rates were observed in insulin resistant hepatocytes; treatment with liraglutide significantly reversed this effect. Furthermore, transfection of insulin resistant hepatocytes with β‑catenin small interfering RNA attenuated the effects of liraglutide, suggesting that liraglutide improves insulin resistance via activating the β‑catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggest a novel mechanism underlying liraglutide‑mediated improvements in insulin resistance in the liver. The Wnt signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of altered hepatic physiology in insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035454>Influence of Resveratrol on the Immune Response.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol is the most well-known polyphenolic stilbenoid, present in grapes, mulberries, peanuts, rhubarb, and in several other plants. Resveratrol can play a beneficial role in the prevention and in the progression of chronic diseases related to inflammation such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancers among other conditions. Moreover, resveratrol regulates immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. At the molecular level, it targets sirtuin, adenosine monophosphate kinase, nuclear factor-κB, inflammatory cytokines, anti-oxidant enzymes along with cellular processes such as , lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Resveratrol can suppress the toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. The antioxidant activity of resveratrol and the ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute to its anti-inflammation properties. The effects of this biologically active compound on the immune system are associated with widespread health benefits for different autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. This review offers a systematic understanding of how resveratrol targets multiple inflammatory components and exerts immune-regulatory effects on immune cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788311>Adipose tissue proteomic analyses to study puberty in Brahman heifers.</a></h2><p>The adipose tissue has been recognized as an active endocrine organ which can modulate numerous physiological processes such as metabolism, appetite, immunity, and reproduction. The aim of this study was to look for differentially abundant proteins and their biological functions in the abdominal adipose tissue between pre- and postpubertal Brahman heifers. Twelve Brahman heifers were divided into 2 groups and paired on slaughter day. Prepubertal heifers had never ovulated and postpubertal heifers were slaughtered on the luteal phase of their second estrous cycle. After ensuring the occurrence of puberty in postpubertal heifers, abdominal adipose tissue samples were collected. Mass spectrometry proteomic analysis identified 646 proteins and revealed that 171 proteins showed differential abundance in adipose tissue between the pre- and postpuberty groups (adjusted P-value < 0.05). Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009452. Using a list of 51 highly differentially abundant proteins as the target (adjusted P-value < 10-), we found 14 enriched pathways. The results indicated that  was enhanced when puberty approached. The metabolism of glucose, lipids, and AA in the adipose tissue mainly participated in oxidation and energy supply for heifers when puberty occurred. Our study also revealed the differentially abundant proteins were enriched for estrogen signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, which are known integrators of metabolism and reproduction. These results suggest new candidate proteins that may contribute to a better understanding of the signaling mechanisms that relate adipose tissue function to puberty. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified 4 hub proteins that had the highest degrees of connection: PGK1, ALDH5A1, EEF2, and LDHB. Highly connected proteins are likely to influence the functions of all differentially abundant proteins identified, directly or indirectly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253108>Temperature and serine phosphorylation regulate glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle of hibernating Richardson's ground squirrels.</a></h2><p>Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) bridges carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by interconverting glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). This reversible reaction converts G3P derived from triglyceride hydrolysis to DHAP that can then enter glycolysis or  and, in the reverse reaction, makes G3P for use in triglyceride biosynthesis. Small hibernating mammals rely almost exclusively on triglyceride reserves as their fuel for energy production during torpor and the recovery of glycerol after lipolysis is an important source of carbohydrate over the nonfeeding winter months. G3PDH (∼37 kDa) was purified from skeletal muscle of euthermic and hibernating Richardson's ground squirrels (Urocitellus richardsonii) using three column chromatography steps. Analysis of enzyme kinetic properties revealed that G3PDH from hibernator muscle had higher affinities for G3P and NAD at low ( °C) assay temperature compared with high (21 or 37 °C) and a greater stability in the presence of denaturing agents (urea, guanidine hydrochloride) or high temperature (50 °C). Immunoblotting showed that hibernator muscle G3PDH had a higher phosphoserine content than the enzyme from euthermic controls and incubation studies showed that enzyme affinity for G3P changed significantly by stimulating endogenous protein kinases or phosphatases. Overall, this study suggests that the properties of ground squirrel muscle G3PDH are modulated by temperature and post-translational phosphorylation to alter enzyme function under euthermic versus hibernating states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162534>Disturbances in Insulin-Glucose Metabolism in Patients With Advanced Renal Disease With and Without Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Use of insulin in patients with diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD; stages 4 to ) is challenging and shows great variability among individuals. We explored the mechanisms underlying this variability.PubMed was searched for articles in English from 1960 to 2018 for advanced CKD and diabetes, glucose and insulin metabolism, insulin clearance, secretion and resistance, plasma insulin concentration, glycemic control, hypoglycemia, insulin dosage, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in CKD.The evidence shows that in most patients the daily dose of insulin needs to be significantly reduced with a high degree of variability; in some the dose remains unchanged, and rarely it is increased. The premise that the marked reduction in insulin requirement is essentially attributable to decreased insulin clearance by kidneys leading to prolongation of its plasma half-life, elevated blood insulin concentration, and hypoglycemia is not entirely correct. Other factors including decreases in food intake, insulin secretion, insulin clearance by peripheral tissues, and renal gluconeogenesis play important roles. There is also heightened resistance to insulin due to metabolic acidosis, uremic toxins, inflammatory state, and vitamin D deficiency. Importantly, the magnitude of changes in each of these factors varies between individuals with the same degree of CKD.In the presence of diabetes with advanced CKD, the insulin regimen should be individualized based on knowledge of the daily glucose patterns. The use of CGM is promising for safer glycemic control in patients with advanced CKD and diabetes and helps prevent extremes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594368>Liver transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of preweaning lambs are modified by milk replacer restriction.</a></h2><p>Prenatal and early postnatal nutrition may promote long-term effects on both feed efficiency and health of animals. Therefore, moderated milk replacer restriction during the artificial rearing period might negatively affect feed efficiency during the postweaning phases in dairy ewes. The aim of this work was to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes by RNA sequencing and differentially accumulated proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the liver of artificially reared Assaf lambs to identify modified metabolic pathways as a consequence of milk replacer restriction in order to find possible solutions to correct any detrimental effect caused by this factor. Forty female Assaf lambs were used in this experiment. The animals were penned individually and assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatments groups (n = 20 per treatment). The first group of lambs was fed ad libitum (AL), whereas the second (restricted, RES) only received approximately 62.% of the level of intake measured in the AL group. Eight 35-d-old lambs from each group (16 lambs in total) were harvested and a piece of liver of 8 lambs (4 AL and 4 RES lambs) was excised for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Differential gene expression analysis identified 386 DE genes [198 of them being annotated genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway], with 176 downregulated and 210 upregulated in the early feed-restricted group relative to the AL group. A total of 26 spots were also differentially accumulated proteins in the liver of the 2 groups of lambs, 10 of them being down-accumulated whereas the other 16 evolved in the opposite way in the liver of RES relative to AL lambs. Collectively, both the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches revealed an upregulation of genes participating in oxidation of fatty acids in the early feed-restricted lambs. The expression of many genes involved in the degradation of several AA (e.g. alanine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine) was also modified in the RES lambs, probably to render substrates for . Moreover, other genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, or hepatic oxidative pathways were upregulated in these lambs. Finally, the expression of genes implicated in oxidative phosphorylation was modified in RES animals. Altogether all these modifications suggest that the partitioning and utilization of nutrients in the early feed-restricted lambs might have been modified, being partially responsible for changes during the replacement phase later in life.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The purpose of the current study was to determine the molecular effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on hepatic insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, and whether c-Jun NH2-terminal-kinase (JNK) contributed to metabolic responses to IH in liver cells.The human HepG2 cells and rat FAO cells were exposed to 10, 30, 120, 240 or 360 cycles of IH (1% O2 for 60 s followed by 21% O2 for 60s, 7. cycles per hour) or normoxia as a control. In a subgroup, we exposed cells to 360 cycles of IH with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. After IH exposure, cell glycogen content and glucose output were measured using colorimetric assay kits. Canonical insulin signaling and gluconeogenic genes were measured by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.IH decreased insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, while inhibiting forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) expression and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) transcription independent of insulin signaling. JNK inhibitor SP600125 partially restored AKT/ GSK-3β phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, but did not affect other IH-induced glucose metabolic changes.IH in vitro impaired insulin signal transduction in liver cells as assessed by inhibited AKT/GSK-3β phosphorylation via JNK activation.

The causes of these differences are unknown. We investigated the influence of circulating concentrations of lactate (NADH generator) and NADH on GN in perfused livers of TB rats. Lactate, at concentrations similar to those found on days  (3.0 mM), 8 (. mM), and 12 (8.0 mM) of the tumor, prevented the reduction of GN from 2.0 mM lactate (lactatemia of healthy rat) in TB rats. NADH, 50 or 75 μM, but not 25 μM, increased GN from 2.0 mM lactate in TB rats to higher values than healthy rats. High concentrations of pyruvate (no NADH generator, .0 and 8.0 mM) did not prevent the reduction of GN from 2.0 mM pyruvate in TB rats. However, 50 or 75 μM NADH, but not 25 μM, increased GN from 2.0 mM pyruvate in TB rats to similar or higher values than healthy rats. High concentration of glutamine (NADH generator, 2. mM) or 50 μM NADH prevented the reduction of GN from 1 mM glutamine in TB rats. Intraperitoneal administration of pyruvate (1.0 mg/kg) or glutamine (0. mg/kg) similarly increased the glycemia of healthy and TB rats. In conclusion, high lactate concentration, similar to hyperlactatemia, prevented the reduction of GN in perfused livers of TB rats, an effect probably caused by the increased redox potential (NADH/NAD ). Thus, the decreased GN in livers from TB rats is due, at least in part, to the absence of simulation of in vivo hyperlactatemia in liver perfusion studies.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836234>Synthesis of -methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-one's aryl Schiff base derivatives and investigation of carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterase (AChE, BuChE) inhibitory properties.</a></h2><p>Carbonic anhydrase enzymes (EC 4.2.1.1, CAs) are metalloenzyme families that catalyze the rapid conversion of HO and CO to HCO and H.

Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms and treatment strategies of this disease is required. Zinc finger protein 692 (ZNF692), also known as AREBP and Zfp692, was first reported to have an important role in . A recent study demonstrated that ZNF692 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues and that ZNF692 knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of ZNF692 in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains unclear. The present study revealed that ZNF692 was upregulated in COAD tissues and cells and that high ZNF692 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and tumor stage in COAD patients. Gain‑ and loss‑of‑function experiments were employed to identify the function of ZNF692 in COAD progression. In vitro and in vivo assays revealed that ZNF692 promoted COAD cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that the effects of ZNF692 were mediated by upregulating cyclin D1, cyclin‑dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9) and by downregulating p27Kip1 through the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/AKT signaling pathway. Collectively, these data indicated that ZNF692 may serve as a novel oncogene and a potential treatment target in COAD patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150719>Metformin reduces liver glucose production by inhibition of fructose-1-6-bisphosphatase.</a></h2><p>Metformin is a first-line drug for the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes, yet its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Metformin exerts its antihyperglycemic action primarily through lowering hepatic glucose production (HGP). This suppression is thought to be mediated through inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, and thus elevation of '-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), though this proposition has been challenged given results in mice lacking hepatic AMPK. Here we report that the AMP-inhibited enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 (FBP1), a rate-controlling enzyme in , functions as a major contributor to the therapeutic action of metformin. We identified a point mutation in FBP1 that renders it insensitive to AMP while sparing regulation by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P), and knock-in (KI) of this mutant in mice significantly reduces their response to metformin treatment. We observe this during a metformin tolerance test and in a metformin-euglycemic clamp that we have developed. The antihyperglycemic effect of metformin in high-fat diet-fed diabetic FBP1-KI mice was also significantly blunted compared to wild-type controls. Collectively, we show a new mechanism of action for metformin and provide further evidence that molecular targeting of FBP1 can have antihyperglycemic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168839>Some Musings About Differential Energy Metabolism With Ketogenic Diets.</a></h2><p>Ketogenic states are of 3 major types: total starvation and those resulting from the consumption of semistarvation, ketogenic diets, and eucaloric ketogenic diets. All are characterized by little or no dietary carbohydrate, resulting in a fat-based metabolism with sustained ketonemia of varying degrees in each state. The latter 2 diets are clinically useful with important impacts on both aspects of the energy balance equation with increased satiety and less hunger on the intake side and probably increased energy expenditure on the output side; both may have important implications for the successful long-term management of obesity. Consideration of older research regarding the hormonal response to carbohydrate-free dieting and recent findings on hepatic glycogen status that occurs with sustained ketonemia support the likelihood that there are profound differences in 24-hour  rates between ketogenic diets and balanced diets containing substantial carbohydrate. This metabolic distinction could have a meaningful impact to increase the thermic effect of feeding and daily energy expenditure amounting to 100 kcal/d or more with each of the ketogenic diets.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102881>Different roles of insulin receptor a and b in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>An inability of insulin to signal glycolysis and  would largely result in type 2 diabetes. In this study, the physiological roles of zebrafish insulin receptor a and b in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis were characterized. We observed that, though blood glucose in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish were comparable with the control siblings at 0 h postprandium (hpp), the most evident hyperglycemia have been observed in insra-/- fish from 1 hpp to 3 hpp. A mild increase of blood glucose in insrb-/- fish has been seen only at 1. hpp. The down-regulated expressions of glycolytic enzymes were observed in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish liver and muscle, together with the significantly decreased activities or concentrations of glycolytic enzymes. These results suggest that both Insra and Insrb were critical in glycolysis. Intriguingly, the up-regulated expressions of gluconeogenic enzymes, pck1 and g6pca.1, along with the elevated enzyme activities, were observed in insra-/- fish liver at 1 hpp and 1. hpp. Compared with the control fish, the elevated plasma insulin and lowered phosphorylated AKT were observed in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish, suggesting that there is an insulin resistance in insra-/- fish and insrb-/- fish. The increased levels of both transcriptions of foxo1a and Foxo1a protein abundance in the insra-/- fish liver have been found. When insra-/- fish treated with the Foxo1 inhibitor, the postprandial blood glucose levels could be normalized, accompanied with the normalized expression levels and enzyme activities of both pck1 and g6pca.1. Therefore, Insra and Insrb demonstrate a similar role in promoting glycolysis, but Insra is involved in inhibiting  via down-regulating the expression of foxo1a. Our results indicate that Insra and Insrb exhibit diversified functions in maintaining glucose homeostasis in zebrafish.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The TAG was mainly produced after nitrogen depletion alongside reduced cell proliferation. To obtain clues for enhancing the TAG production, cell metabolism during the TAG-producing phase was characterized by metabolomics with C labeling. The turnover analysis showed that the time constants of intermediates from glycerol to pyruvate (Pyr) were large, whereas those of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates were much smaller than that of Pyr. Surprisingly, the time constants of intermediates in  and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway were large, suggesting that a large amount of the uptaken glycerol was metabolized via the PP pathway. To synthesize fatty acids that make up TAG from acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), 14 molecules of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) per C16 fatty acid molecule are required. Because the oxidative PP pathway generates NADPH, this pathway would contribute to supply NADPH for fatty acid synthesis. To confirm that the oxidative PP pathway can supply the NADPH required for TAG production, flux analysis was conducted based on the measured specific rates and mass balances. Flux analysis revealed that the NADPH necessary for TAG production was supplied by metabolizing 48.2% of the uptaken glycerol through  and the PP pathway. This result was consistent with the result of the C-labeling experiment. Furthermore, comparison of the actual flux distribution with the ideal flux distribution for TAG production suggested that it is necessary to flow more dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) through  to improve TAG yield.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30449452>CRTC2 suppresses BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation via Smurf1 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells.</a></h2><p>CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein)-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC2) has been reported to act as a coactivator of CREB during . The role of CRTC2 in osteoblastic differentiation has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study is to identify the mechanism of CRTC2 in osteoblast differentiation.The mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR and qPCR. Protein levels were measured using Western blot assay. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was performed to evaluate ALP activity. Alizarin red S (ARS) staining was performed to measure extracellular mineralization. Transcriptional activity was detected using a luciferase assay.In the present study, TNF-α was found to stimulate CRTC2 expression. However, TNF-α did not increase the gene expression of osteoblast differentiation markers and inhibited BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Overexpression of CRTC2 decreased the expression of osteogenic genes, ALP activity and extracellular matrix mineralization. Knockdown of CRTC2 restored BMP2-induced osteogenic gene expression and ALP activity. CRTC2 increased Smurf1 mRNA expression, Smurf 1 promoter activity, and protein level. Furthermore, Smurf 1 decreased Smad 1//9 protein levels. These results suggest that CRTC2 decreased BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation via Smurf 1 expression.Our results indicate that CRTC2 regulates the expression of Smurf1 in osteoblast differentiation.Copyright © 2018.

We aim to study whether inhibition of endogenous fatty acid synthesis could decrease hepatic glucose production.Low-passage HepG2 cells derived from human liver tissue were cultured in medium supplemented with FFA to induce IR, the influences of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) silencing on glucose production of HepG2 cells were investigated, and genes responsible for fatty acid and glucose metabolism were detected by real-time PCR.Compared with HepG2 cells cultured in normal growth medium, glucose production of HepG2 cells treated by FFA was significantly increased {[(0.28 ± 0.01) vs (0.83 ± 0.02)] umol.ug protein, n = 6 wells, P < 0.01}; the mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) in HepG2 cells increased by more than -fold and 3-fold, respectively; the mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) increased by approximately 4-fold and 1.1-fold, respectively; the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) changed slightly. Compared with the scrambled siRNA control, glucose production of HepG2 cells treated by FFA significantly increased after SREBP-1c silencing {[(0.018 ± 0.001) vs (0.028 ± 0.002)] umol.ug protein, n = 6 wells, P < 0.01}; the mRNA expression of PEPCK and G6PC increased by approximately 1.-fold and -fold, respectively, but the mRNA expression of FAS, SCD1 and CPT-1 changed slightly.SREBP-1c silencing further augmented glucose production of HepG2 cells treated by FFA significantly, genes responsible for fatty acid synthesis and  played an important role in this process.

Vaccarin is an active flavonoid glycoside associated with various biological functions, but its effects on glucose and lipid metabolic disorder in T2DM are still unclear. In this study, glucosamine (GlcN) and free fatty acids (FFAs, oleate/palmitate, 2:1 ratio) were applied to mimic insulin resistance and lipid deposition in HepG2 cells, respectively. Type 2 diabetic mice were induced using a high-fat diet (HFD) together with streptozotocin (STZ). GlcN stimulation was found to upregulate glucose production and  but downregulate glycogen synthesis and phosphorylation of adenosine '-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in HepG2 cells, abnormal changes that were reversed by vaccarin. Furthermore, lipid accumulation was enhanced, but AMPK was inactivated in FFAs-exposed HepG2 cells, issues that were rectified by vaccarin treatment. These ameliorative effects of vaccarin on insulin resistance and steatosis were eliminated by AMPK inhibitor Compound C. In type 2 diabetic mice, chronic vaccarin administration decreased fasting blood glucose and lipid levels in both serum and the liver, and improved insulin sensitivity and steatosis in the liver. Taken together, these results suggest that vaccarin attenuates insulin resistance and steatosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

To evaluate the potential effect of mogrosides in type 2 diabetes, we herein investigated the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects and the underlying mechanism of mogroside-rich extract (MGE) using a high-fat diet in combination with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic model. MGE feeding for  weeks did not result in any obvious impact on the body weight and energy intake, but caused a moderate decrease of organ index in diabetic mice. MGE-supplemented diabetic mice showed a notable reduction of fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated serum protein (GSP), serum insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and serum atherogenic lipid profiles in a dose-dependent manner, whereas significant increases in the anti-atherogenic lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, glucose and insulin tolerance capacity with high dose (300 mg kg-1) MGE were observed (P < 0.01). Besides, hepatocyte polymorphism, lipid accumulation and steatosis were ameliorated and restored to near normal at the high dose. Furthermore, hepatic 'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling was dose-dependently activated. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of hepatic gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes were downregulated and fat oxidation-associated genes were upregulated. These findings suggest that the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities of MGE are probably attributed to the attenuation of insulin resistance and activation of hepatic AMPK signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31124166>Cis-9, Trans-11 Conjugated Linoleic Acid Reduces Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase Expression and Hepatic Glucose Production in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis is a hallmark of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Although existing drugs have been proven to improve gluconeogenesis, achieving this objective with functional food is of interest, especially using conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) found in dairy products. Both cis-9, trans-11 (c9,t11) and trans-10, cis-12 (t10,c12) isomers of CLA were tested in human (HepG2) and rat (H4IIE) hepatocytes for their potential effects on gluconeogenesis. The hepatocytes exposed for 24 h with 20 μM of c9,t11-CLA had attenuated the gluconeogenesis in both HepG2 and H4IIE by 62.% and 80.1%, respectively. In contrast, t10,c12-CLA had no effect. Of note, in HepG2 cells, the exposure of c9,t11-CLA decreased the transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) by 87.7%, and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) by 38.0%, while t10,c12-CLA increased the expression of G6PC, suggesting the isomer-specific effects of CLA on hepatic glucose production. In HepG2, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, rosiglitazone, reduced the glucose production by 72.9%. However, co-administration of c9,t11-CLA and rosiglitazone neither exacerbated nor attenuated the efficacy of rosiglitazone to inhibit glucose production; meanwhile, t10,c12-CLA abrogated the efficacy of rosiglitazone. Paradoxically, PPARγ antagonist GW 9662 also led to 70.2% reduction of glucose production and near undetectable PCK1 expression by abrogating CLA actions. Together, while the precise mechanisms by which CLA isomers modulate hepatic gluconeogenesis directly or via PPAR warrant further investigation, our findings establish that c9,t11-CLA suppresses gluconeogenesis by decreasing PEPCK on hepatocytes.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193751>Persistent Hypoglycemia in Children: Targeted Gene Panel Improves the Diagnosis of Hypoglycemia Due to Inborn Errors of Metabolism.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the role of next generation sequencing in genetic diagnosis of pediatric patients with persistent hypoglycemia.Sixty-four patients investigated through an extensive workup were divided in 3 diagnostic classes based on the likelihood of a genetic diagnosis: (1) single candidate gene (9/64); (2) multiple candidate genes (43/64); and (3) no candidate gene (12/64). Subsequently, patients were tested through a custom gene panel of 65 targeted genes, which included  disease categories: (1) hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, (2) fatty acid-oxidation defects and ketogenesis defects, (3) ketolysis defects, (4) glycogen storage diseases and other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, and () mitochondrial disorders. Molecular data were compared with clinical and biochemical data.A proven diagnosis was obtained in 78% of patients with suspicion for a single candidate gene, in 49% with multiple candidate genes, and in 33% with no candidate gene. The diagnostic yield was 48% for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, 66% per fatty acid-oxidation and ketogenesis defects, 59% for glycogen storage diseases and other carbohydrate disorders, and 67% for mitochondrial disorders.This approach provided a diagnosis in ~50% of patients in whom clinical and laboratory evaluation did not allow identification of a single candidate gene and a diagnosis was established in 33% of patients belonging to the no candidate gene class. Next generation sequencing technique is cost-effective compared with Sanger sequencing of multiple genes and represents a powerful tool for the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism presenting with persistent hypoglycemia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to discover and replicate metabolites reflecting pathways related to VAT . Methods and Results Associations between fasting serum metabolites and VAT area (by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed with cross-sectional linear regression of individual-level data from participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; discovery, N=1103) and the NEO (Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity) study (replication, N=2537). Untargeted H nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics profiling of serum was performed in MESA, and metabolites were replicated in the NEO study using targeted H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A total of 30 590 metabolomic spectral variables were evaluated. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, glucose/lipid-lowering medication, and body mass index, 2104 variables representing 24 nonlipid and 49 lipid/lipoprotein subclass metabolites remained significantly associated with VAT ( P=4.88×10-1.16×10). These included conventional metabolites, amino acids, acetylglycoproteins, intermediates of glucose and hepatic metabolism, organic acids, and subclasses of apolipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Metabolites mapped to 31 biochemical pathways, including amino acid substrate use/metabolism and glycolysis/. In the replication cohort, acetylglycoproteins, branched-chain amino acids, lactate, glutamine (inversely), and atherogenic lipids remained associated with VAT ( P=1.90×10-8.46×10), with most associations remaining after additional adjustment for surrogates of VAT (glucose level, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides), reflecting novel independent associations. Conclusions We identified and replicated a metabolite panel associated with VAT in 2 community-based cohorts. These findings persisted after adjustment for body mass index and appear to define a metabolic signature of visceral adiposity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29736189>Investigation of the influence of high glucose on molecular and genetic responses: an  study using a human intestine model.</a></h2><p>Dietary glucose consumption has increased worldwide. Long-term high glucose intake contributes to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Obese people tend to eat glucose-containing foods, which can lead to an addiction to glucose, increased glucose levels in the blood and intestine lumen, and exposure of intestinal enterocytes to high dietary glucose. Recent studies have documented a role for enterocytes in glucose sensing. However, the molecular and genetic relationship between high glucose levels and intestinal enterocytes has not been determined. We aimed to identify relevant target genes and molecular pathways regulated by high glucose in a well-established in vitro epithelial cell culture model of the human intestinal system (Caco-2 cells).Cells were grown in a medium containing . and 25 mM glucose in a bicameral culture system for 21 days to mimic the human intestine. Transepithelial electrical resistance was used to control monolayer formation and polarization of the cells. Total RNA was isolated, and genome-wide mRNA expression profiles were determined. Molecular pathways were analyzed using the DAVID bioinformatics program. Gene expression levels were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).Microarray gene expression data demonstrated that 679 genes (297 upregulated, 382 downregulated) were affected by high glucose treatment. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that intracellular protein export ( = 0.0069) and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis ( = 0.024) pathways were induced, whereas glycolysis/ ( < 0.0001), pentose phosphate ( = 0.0043), and fructose-mannose metabolism ( = 0.013) pathways were downregulated, in response to high glucose. Microarray analysis of gene expression showed that high glucose significantly induced mRNA expression levels of thioredoxin-interacting protein (,  = 0.0001) and lipocalin 15 (,  = 0.0016) and reduced those of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 1 (,  = 0.0004), and iroquois homeobox 3 (,  = 0.0001).To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of high glucose-regulated molecular responses in an intestinal enterocyte model. Our findings identify new target genes that may be important in the intestinal glucose absorption and metabolism during high glucose consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115741>RNA-seq and microRNA-seq analysis of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) larvae treated by thyroid hormones.</a></h2><p>Flatfish pigmentation is a complex process, affected by environmental factors including light, nutrients, and hormones. Of those, the thyroid hormone has been reported to increase the albinism rate of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and thiourea were introduced into P. olivaceus larvae from 16 to 57 days after hatching (DAH). By comparison of albinism rate, T3 treatment and control larvae of 42 DAH were chosen for mRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing analyses. A total of 337 miRNAs were identified via miRNA-seq, and 12 miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression patterns in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (TPM > 10, fold change ≥ 1. or ≤ 0.67 and q ≤ 0.05). These differentially expressed miRNAs targeted 3658 putative genes, which further enriched to 10 GO terms (q < 0.05). RNA-seq identified 146 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (|log fold change| > 1 and q < 0.005), including pigmentation-related genes such as the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3, pro-opiomelanocortin A, and melanotransferrin, and the growth-related gene somatotropin. These DEGs were significantly enriched to 15 GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways (q < 0.05), which included several sugar metabolic pathways (glycolysis/ and the pentose phosphate pathway). Integrated analysis revealed that 26 overlapping genes between DEGs and mRNAs were targeted by miRNAs. Furthermore, seven mRNA-miRNA pairs exhibited reversed regulation patterns. This provides important clues to understand the role of thyroid hormones in flatfish pigmentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30881311>Network Modeling of Liver Metabolism to Predict Plasma Metabolite Changes During Short-Term Fasting in the Laboratory Rat.</a></h2><p>The liver-a central metabolic organ that integrates whole-body metabolism to maintain glucose and fatty-acid regulation, and detoxify ammonia-is susceptible to injuries induced by drugs and toxic substances. Although plasma metabolite profiles are increasingly investigated for their potential to detect liver injury earlier than current clinical markers, their utility may be compromised because such profiles are affected by the nutritional state and the physiological state of the animal, and by contributions from extrahepatic sources. To tease apart the contributions of liver and non-liver sources to alterations in plasma metabolite profiles, here we sought to computationally isolate the plasma metabolite changes originating in the liver during short-term fasting. We used a constraint-based metabolic modeling approach to integrate central carbon fluxes measured in our study, and physiological flux boundary conditions gathered from the literature, into a genome-scale model of rat liver metabolism. We then measured plasma metabolite profiles in rats fasted for -7 or 10-13 h to test our model predictions. Our computational model accounted for two-thirds of the observed directions of change (an increase or decrease) in plasma metabolites, indicating their origin in the liver. Specifically, our work suggests that changes in plasma lipid metabolites, which are reliably predicted by our liver metabolism model, are key features of short-term fasting. Our approach provides a mechanistic model for identifying plasma metabolite changes originating in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29723221>Impact of silencing hepatic SREBP-1 on insulin signaling.</a></h2><p>Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a conserved transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family (bHLH-Zip) that plays a central role in regulating expression of genes of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism in the liver. SREBP-1 activity is essential for the control of insulin-induced anabolic processes during the fed state. In addition, SREBP-1 regulates expression of key molecules in the insulin signaling pathway, including insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) and a subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, PIK3R3, suggesting that feedback mechanisms exist between SREBP-1 and this pathway. Nevertheless, the overall contribution of SREBP-1 activity to maintain insulin signal transduction is unknown. Furthermore, Akt is a known activator of mTORC1, a sensor of energy availability that plays a fundamental role in metabolism, cellular growth and survival. We have silenced SREBP-1 and explored the impact on insulin signaling and mTOR in mice under fed, fasted and refed conditions. No alterations in circulating levels of insulin were observed. The studies revealed that depletion of SREBP-1 had no impact on IRS1Y612, AktS473, and downstream effectors GSK3αS21 and FoxO1S256 during the fed state. Nevertheless, reduced levels of these molecules were observed under fasting conditions. These effects were not associated with changes in phosphorylation of mTOR. Overall, our data indicate that the contribution of SREBP-1 to maintain insulin signal transduction in liver is modest.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311004>Assessment of mouse liver [1-13C]pyruvate metabolism by dynamic hyperpolarized MRS.</a></h2><p>Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy has the unique ability to detect real-time metabolic changes in vivo owing to its high sensitivity compared with thermal MR and high specificity compared with other metabolic imaging methods. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of hyperpolarized MR spectroscopy for quantification of liver pyruvate metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp in mice. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism in mice. Mice were divided into two groups: (i) non-stimulated -h fasted mice and (ii) hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamped mice. During clamp conditions, insulin and donor blood were administered at a constant rate, whereas glucose was infused to maintain isoglycemia. When steady state was reached, insulin-stimulated mice were rapidly infused with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate for real-time tracking of the dynamic distribution of metabolic derivatives from pyruvate, such as [1-13C]lactate, [1-13C]alanine and [13C]bicarbonate. Isotopomer analysis of plasma glucose confirmed 13C-incorporation from [1-13C]pyruvate into glucose was increased in fasted mice compared with insulin-stimulated mice, demonstrating an increased gluconeogenesis in fasted mice. The AUC ratios for [1-13C]alanine/[1-13C]pyruvate (38.2%), [1-13C]lactate/[1-13C]pyruvate (41.8%) and [13C]bicarbonate/[1-13C]pyruvate (169%) all increased significantly during insulin stimulation. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate can be used for in vivo MR spectroscopy of liver pyruvate metabolism during hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp conditions. Under these conditions, insulin decreased gluconeogenesis and increased [1-13C]alanine, [1-13C]lactate and [13C]bicarbonate after a [1-13C]pyruvate bolus. This application of in vivo spectroscopy has the potential to identify impairments in specific metabolic pathways in the liver associated with obesity, insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p></html>
