Platycodon () widely grows in Korea, Japan, and China. It has long been used for food and as a medicinal product. However, the mechanism of the improvement of obesity by platycodon was still not clear. Therefore, we investigated the detailed mechanisms of the antiobesity activity of platycodon extracts. Twenty mice (C57BL/6J) were placed into five groups. The test group received 1 g/kg platycodon extracts. The positive control group received 10 mg/kg orlistat, while the negative control and normal control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. The extracts were given orally daily for 8 weeks. The  treatment of platycodon extracts reduced body weight gain by 7.5%, improved plasma lipid profiles. In the groups given platycodon extracts, leptin was significantly decreased whereas adiponectin was increased. Furthermore, platycodon extracts downregulated lipogenic gene (, lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty  synthase) expression and increased lipolysis genes (, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, hormone-sensitive lipase, and uncoupling proteins 2) in liver and white adipose tissue. In addition, platycodon extracts inhibited the expression of key adipogenic transcriptional factors. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that platycodon extracts ameliorate high-fat diet-induced obesity and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways. Dietary supplementation of platycodon extracts as a functional food and medicinal ingredients may be suitable for prevention and treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31558861>Allyl isothiocyanate ameliorates lipid accumulation and inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a classic anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic agent, was recently identified as a potential treatment for obesity and insulin resistance. However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate  for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its  target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty  β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate -induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576746>Dose-Dependent Effects of Triclocarban Exposure on Lipid Homeostasis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Environmental exposure to triclocarban (TCC), a common antibacterial agent widely used in thousands of personal care products, poses a potential risk for human health. Previous in vitro studies about biological effects of TCC have yielded a variety of inconsistent results and apparently not been verified in vivo. In the current study, dose-dependent effects of TCC exposure on lipid homeostasis in rats were investigated using a combination of untargeted H NMR metabolomics, targeted metabolite profiling (LC/GC-MS), histopathological assessments, and biological assays. Our results revealed that TCC dose-dependently activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its transcriptional targets such as  and  in the liver of rats, suggesting that TCC may be a potent AHR agonist. Although TCC exhibited dose-dependent toxicity, oral exposure with relatively low dose TCC caused more significant hepatic  of rats than relatively high and moderate doses of TCC. It was mainly manifested by histopathological observations and promotion of de novo fatty , phospholipid, and ceramide biosynthesis and gut microbiota fermentation. Our findings provide new insights into health effects of TCC exposure with different dosages in vivo, especially on the induction and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and further our understanding in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases induced by environmental pollutants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646946> effect on Yan Yellow Cattle preadipocyte differentiation.</a></h2><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 () is a cytosolic enzyme that mainly catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde into acetic  and participates in the regulation of differentiation and gene expression in fat cell growth and development. However, the physiological role of  in the formation of fat cell precursors in the Yan Yellow Cattle is still not clear. Herein, we investigated the specific regulation of the gene encoding for  during the differentiation process of the adipocyte cells of the Yan Yellow Cattle by interfering or overexpressing the  gene. As a result, we found that the mRNA expression levels of  were significantly increased during the formation of progenitor cells. In addition, the expression levels of the Lipoprotein lipase ) and transcription factors (, ) were also significantly increased.  gene overexpression and RNA interfering promoted and inhibited respectively the lipid accumulation and triglyceride production in mature adipocytes, and the expression of the LPL and transcription factors (, ). The changes in the protein expression levels of  and adipogenic factors were in accord with the changes observed in the mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results indicate that  plays an important regulatory role in the differentiation of preadipocyte cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580832>Clinical implications of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 mRNA expression in melanoma subtypes.</a></h2><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is not only a valuable marker for cancer cells with stem-like features, but also plays a vital role in drug resistance and disease progression in many tumors including melanoma. However, the precise role of ALDH activity in patient prognosis remains unclear. In this study, using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing expression data, we analyzed gene expression of ALDH isozymes in melanoma tumors to define the expression patterns and the prognostic and predictive values of these enzymes. We found that ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 had both higher and broader expression ranges in melanoma patients, and that ALDH1A3 expression correlated with better overall survival in metastatic melanoma. Further, stratification of the TCGA cohorts by the mutational subtypes of melanoma specifically revealed that expression of ALDH1A3 correlated with better prognosis in metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma while expression of ALDH1A1 correlated with better prognosis in BRAF wild-type melanoma. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these cohorts identified upregulation in oxidative phosphorylation, , and fatty  metabolism signaling in ALDH1A patients, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance in that subset of patients. On the other hand, GSEA of ALDH1A3 cohorts revealed upregulation in glycolysis, hypoxia and angiogenesis, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor sensitivity in that subset of patients. Gene expression analysis using pre-treatment tumor samples supports high ALDH1A3 expression before BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment as predictive of better treatment response in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Our study provides evidence that high ALDH1A3 mRNA expression is not only a prognostic marker but also a predictive marker for BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment response in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating lipid metabolism include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing  were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239155>LncRNA NEAT1-MicroRNA-140 axis exacerbates nonalcoholic fatty liver through interrupting AMPK/SREBP-1 signaling.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a severe liver disease, which influences the health of people worldwide. However, the mechanism modulating the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains elusive. It was reported that nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and microRNA-140 (miR-140) could regulate , but whether they could influence NAFLD are still unknown.HepG2 cells were treated by free fatty  (FFA) to establish the model of NAFLD in vitro, and C57 mice were treated by high-fat diet to establish the model of NAFLD in vivo. Cell transfection was applied to regulate the expression of NEAT1 and miR-140. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were applied for measuring expression of protein and mRNA, respectively. HE staining and Oil Red O staining were used for observing liver tissues.NEAT1 and miR-140 are upregulated in hepacytes under the NAFLD conditions. NEAT1 directly binds to miR-140 and acts synergistically with miR-140 to exacerbate the progression of NAFLD. Reciprocally, silence of miR-140 or NEAT1 alleviates the severity of NAFLD. The mechanistical study shows that the axis of NEAT1-miR-140 inactivates AMPK/SREBP-1 signaling during the NAFLD. .The NEAT1-miR-140 axis play a crucial role in modulation of NAFLD via inactivation of AMPK/SREBP1 signaling.

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed . In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic  in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271850>Adipose lipidomics and RNA-Seq analysis revealed the enhanced mitochondrial function in UCP1 knock-in pigs.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a key role in nonshivering thermogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. In a previous study, we generated adipocyte-specific UCP1 knock-in (UCP1-KI) pigs, which exhibited improved thermoregulatory ability and decreased fat deposition. To investigate whether UCP1 knock-in alters the lipid composition of adipose tissues, lipidomics of inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT) and backfat from 6-month-old cold-treated UCP1-KI pigs and wild-type (WT) pigs were profiled. In addition, genome-wide RNA-sequencing of iWAT was performed to further study the genetic basis for lipid alterations. The results showed that iWAT and backfat from UCP1-KI pigs exhibited distinct lipidomic profiles, as the mild lipid alteration was observed in backfat of UCP1 knock-in pigs. Inguinal WAT from UCP1-KI pigs contained significantly decreased total triacylglycerol (p < 0.05), together with the downregulation of genes involved in fatty  metabolism, suggesting the decreased  in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Significantly increased levels of total sphingolipids (p<0.05) were also observed in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs. Notably, two mitochondrial-specific lipid species, cardiolipin CL72:8 (18:2) and CL74:9 (18:2), were found to be dramatically increased in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial function. This observation was further supported by the significant upregulation of numerous mitochondrial-related genes and significantly increased number of large mitochondria and mitochondrial cristae in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Taken together, these data illustrate the specific role of UCP1 in lipid metabolism of fat tissues in pigs and provide new data for characterization of fat traits in UCP1-KI pigs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Since its side effects include skin dryness, whereas its deficiency can be accompanied by dyssebacia, characterized by sebaceous gland enlargement, we asked if HCA is expressed on human sebocytes, and if NA influences sebocyte functions. By using human immortalized SZ95 sebocytes, we found that non-cytotoxic (≤100 μmol/L; MTT-assay) concentrations of NA had no effect on the homeostatic sebaceous  (SLG; Nile Red), but normalized excessive, acne-mimicking SLG induced by several lipogenic agents (arachidonic , anandamide, linoleic  + testosterone; Nile Red; 48-hr treatments). Moreover, it exerted significant anti-proliferative actions (CyQUANT-assay), and increased [Ca ] (Fluo-4 AM-based Ca -measurement). Although NA did not prevent the lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory response (up-regulation [Q-PCR] and release [ELISA] of several pro-inflammatory cytokines) of the sebocytes, collectively, these data support the concept that NA may be effective in suppressing sebum production in vivo. While exploring the mechanism of the sebostatic actions, we found that sebocytes express HCA (Q-PCR, immunofluorescent labelling), siRNA-mediated silencing of which prevented the NA-induced Ca -signal and the lipostatic action. Collectively, our data introduce NA, and HCA activators in general, as novel, potent and most likely safe sebostatic agents, with possible anti-acne potential.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we show that fructose and glucose supplementation of an HFD exert divergent effects on hepatic mitochondrial function and fatty  oxidation. This is mediated via three different nodes of regulation, including differential effects on malonyl-CoA levels, effects on mitochondrial size/protein abundance, and acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. HFD- and HFD plus fructose-fed mice have decreased CTP1a activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty  oxidation, whereas knockdown of fructose metabolism increases CPT1a and its acylcarnitine products. Furthermore, fructose-supplemented HFD leads to increased acetylation of ACADL and CPT1a, which is associated with decreased fat metabolism. In summary, dietary fructose, but not glucose, supplementation of HFD impairs mitochondrial size, function, and protein acetylation, resulting in decreased fatty  oxidation and development of metabolic dysregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to oleic and palmitic . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with oleic and palmitic  increased  and the content of different fatty . CeONPs reduced palmitic and stearic  and most fatty  consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393584>Increased bone marrow-specific  by clofazimine causes impaired fracture healing, osteopenia and osteonecrosis without extra-skeletal effects in rats.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium leprae infection causes bone lesions and osteoporosis, however, the effect of anti-leprosy drugs on the bone is unknown. We, therefore, set out to address it by investigating osteogenic differentiation from bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchyme stem cells (MSCs). Out of seven anti-leprosy drugs, only clofazimine (CFZ) reduced MSCs viability (IC50 ∼1μM) and their osteogenic differentiation but increased adipogenic differentiation on a par with rosiglitazone, and this effect was blocked by a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist, GW9662. CFZ also decreased osteoblast viability and resulted in impaired bone regeneration in a rat femur osteotomy model at 1/3rd human drug dose owing to increased callus  as GW9662 prevented this effect. CFZ treatment decreased BM-MSCs population and homing of MSCs to osteotomy site despite drug levels in BM being much less than it's in vitro IC50 value. In adult rats, CFZ caused osteopenia in long bones marked by suppressed osteoblast function due to enhanced  and increased osteoclast functions. A robust increase in marrow adipose tissue (MAT) by CFZ did not alter hematologic parameters but likely reduced BM vascular bed leading to osteonecrosis (ON) characterized by empty osteocyte lacunae. However, CFZ had no effect on visceral fat content and was not associated with any metabolic and hematologic changes. Levels of unsaturated fatty  in MAT were higher than saturated fatty  and CFZ further increased the former. From these data, we conclude that CFZ has skeletal toxicity and could be used for creating a rodent ON model devoid of extra-skeletal effects.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, knowledge of the cellular transition from BAT to white adipose tissue (WAT) and the potential role of lncRNAs in goat adipose tissue remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transformation from BAT to WAT using histological and uncoupling protein 1 () gene analyses. Brown adipose tissue mainly existed within the goat perirenal fat at 1 day and there was obviously a transition from BAT to WAT from 1 day to 1 year. The RNA libraries constructed from the perirenal adipose tissues of 1 day, 30 days, and 1 year goats were sequenced. A total number of 21,232 lncRNAs from perirenal fat were identified, including 5393 intronic-lncRNAs and 3546 antisense-lncRNAs. Furthermore, a total of 548 differentially expressed lncRNAs were detected across three stages (fold change ≥ 2.0, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05), and six lncRNAs were validated by qPCR. Furthermore,  analysis found lncRNAs that were transcribed close to 890 protein-coding genes. Additionally, a coexpression network suggested that 4519 lncRNAs and 5212 mRNAs were potentially in -regulatory relationships ( > 0.95 or  < -0.95).

Orbital fibroblasts are a key component in GO pathogenesis, which includes inflammation, , hyaluronic  (HA) secretion, and fibrosis. Macrophages are thought to participate in the immunological stage of GO, but whether they can directly affect the fibroblasts phenotype and modulate disease progression is unknown. We previously showed that GO adipogenic and fibrotic phenotypes could be modelled in a pseudo-physiological 3D environment in vitro. Here, we introduced macrophages in this 3D culture model to investigate role for macrophages in modulating , HA production, and contractility in orbital fibroblasts. Macrophages had a minimal effect on lipid droplet formation in fibroblasts, but significantly increased HA production and cell contractility, suggesting that they may promote the fibrotic phenotype. This effect was found to be mediated at least in part through phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and linked to an increase in actin polymerization and protrusive activity in fibroblasts. Overall our work shows for the first time a direct role for macrophages in modulating the fibroblasts' phenotype in GO, supporting a role for macrophages in the progression of the fibrotic phenotype through induction of HA production and stimulation of the contractile phenotype in orbital fibroblasts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400610>PPAR Gamma-Regulated MicroRNA 199a-5p Underlies Bone Marrow Adiposity in Aplastic Anemia.</a></h2><p>Increased propensity of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) toward adipogenic differentiation has been implicated in the fatty bone marrow and defective hematopoiesis of aplastic anemia (AA).

We recently show that systemic GSH deficiency in mice harboring a global disruption of the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm) gene confers protection against alcohol-induced steatosis. While several molecular pathways have been linked to the observed hepatic protection, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and AMP-activated protein kinase pathways, the precise mechanisms are yet to be defined. In this study, to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning the protective effects of loss of GCLM, global profiling of hepatic polar metabolites combined with liver microarray analysis was carried out. These inter-omics analyses revealed both low GSH- and alcohol-driven changes in multiple cellular pathways involving the metabolism of amino , fatty , glucose and nucleic . Notably, several metabolic changes were uniquely present in alcohol-treated Gclm-null mouse livers, including acetyl-CoA enrichment and diversion of acetyl-CoA flux from  to alterative metabolic pathways, elevation in glutamate concentration, and induction of the glucuronate pathway and nucleotide biosynthesis. These metabolic features reflect low GSH-elicited cellular response to chronic alcohol exposure, which is beneficial for the maintenance of hepatic redox and metabolic homeostasis. The current study indicates that fine-tuning of hepatic GSH pool may evoke metabolic reprogramming to cope with alcohol-induced cellular stress.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

So far, the lipogenic consequences of in vivo LXR activation, as characterized by a major hepatic steatosis, has constituted a limitation to the clinical development of pharmacological LXR agonists. However, recent studies provided a different perspective. Beyond the quantitative accumulation of FA, it appears that LXRs induce qualitative changes in the FA profile and in the distribution of FAs among cellular lipid species. Thus, LXRs activate the production of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) and their distribution into phospholipids via the control of FA desaturases, FA elongases, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT3), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). Therefore, LXRs control, in a dynamic manner, the PUFA composition and the physicochemical properties of cell membranes as well as the release of PUFA-derived lipid mediators. Recent studies suggest that modulation of PUFA and phospholipid metabolism by LXRs are involved in the control of  and lipoprotein secretion by the liver. In myeloid cells, the interplay between LXR and PUFA metabolism affects the inflammatory response.

The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the liver of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466350>Changes in Plasma Free Fatty  Associated with Type-2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased total plasma free fatty  (FFA) concentrations and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. The exact mechanisms by which the plasma FFA profile of subjects with T2DM changes is unclear, but it is thought that dietary fats and changes to lipid metabolism are likely to contribute. Therefore, establishing the changes in concentrations of specific FFAs in an individual's plasma is important. Each type of FFA has different effects on physiological processes, including the regulation of lipolysis and  in adipose tissue, inflammation, endocrine signalling and the composition and properties of cellular membranes. Alterations in such processes due to altered plasma FFA concentrations/profiles can potentially result in the development of insulin resistance and coagulatory defects. Finally, fibrates and statins, lipid-regulating drugs prescribed to subjects with T2DM, are also thought to exert part of their beneficial effects by impacting on plasma FFA concentrations. Thus, it is also interesting to consider their effects on the concentration of FFAs in plasma. Collectively, we review how FFAs are altered in T2DM and explore the likely downstream physiological and pathological implications of such changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677030>SIRT3 promotes the invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer cells by regulating fatty  synthase.</a></h2><p>Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) modulates mitochondria-localized processes and is implicated in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, especially fatty  (FA) synthesis. However, the relationship between SIRT3 and aberrant lipid synthesis in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance of SIRT3 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal tissues. To analyze the role of SIRT3 in CCSC in vitro, endogenous SIRT3 levels were up- and down-regulated in SiHa and C33a cells, respectively, via lentiviral-based transfection. Levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Acetylation levels for acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACC1) were measured with the anti-acetyllysine antibody. Knockdown of SIRT3 reduced levels of cellular lipid content in cells. To investigate the role of SIRT3 in cell proliferation, nude mice were xenografted with SIRT3-overexpressing or SIRT3-knockdown CCSC cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that SIRT3 significantly contributed to the reprogramming of FA synthesis in CCSC by up-regulating ACC1 to promote de novo  by SIRT3 deacetylation. Moreover, the findings show that the SIRT3-mediated regulation of FA synthesis played a critical role in the proliferation and metastasis of CCSC cells, suggesting that SIRT3 has therapeutic potential in CCSC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481722>Muscle transcriptome analysis reveals genes and metabolic pathways related to mineral concentration in Bos indicus.</a></h2><p>Mineral content affects the biological processes underlying beef quality. Muscle mineral concentration depends not only on intake-outtake balance and muscle type, but also on age, environment, breed, and genetic factors. To unveil the genetic factors involved in muscle mineral concentration, we applied a pairwise differential gene expression analysis in groups of Nelore steers genetically divergent for nine different mineral concentrations. Here, based on significant expression differences between contrasting groups, we presented candidate genes for the genetic regulation of mineral concentration in muscle. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses were carried out to search for gene regulatory processes concerning each mineral. The core genetic regulation for all minerals studied, except Zn, seems to rest on interactions between components of the extracellular matrix. Regulation of -related pathways was also significant in our results. Antagonistic patterns of gene expression for fatty  metabolism-related genes may explain the Cu and Zn antagonistic effect on fatty  accumulation. Our results shed light on the role of these minerals on cell function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284400>Intra-Abdominal Fat Adipocyte Hypertrophy through a Progressive Alteration of Lipolysis and  in Metabolic Syndrome Rats.</a></h2><p>This study evaluates the progressive participation of enzymes involved in lipolysis and , leading to adipocyte hypertrophy in a metabolic syndrome (MS) rat model caused by chronic consumption of 30% sucrose in drinking water. A total of 70 male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: C and MS. Each of these groups were then subdivided into five groups which were sacrificed as paired groups every month from the beginning of the treatment until 5 months. The intra-abdominal fat was dissected, and the adipocytes were extracted. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), protein kinases A (PKA), and perilipin A expressions were determined. The LPL and HSL activities were evaluated by spectrophotometry. Histological staining was performed in adipose tissue. Significant increases were observed in blood pressure, HOMA-IR, leptin, triglycerides, insulin, intra-abdominal fat, and number of fat cells per field ( = 0.001) and in advanced glycosylation products, adipocyte area, LPL, HSL activities and/or expression ( ≤ 0.01) in the MS groups progressively from the third month onward.  and lipolysis were increased by LPL activity and HSL activity and/or expression.

Apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5) has been shown to influence the prevalence and pathology of obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms remains to be unclarified.Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) were treated with 600 ng/ml ApoA5. The effect of ApoA5 on affecting intracellular TG content and adipogenic related factors expression were determined. Furthermore, the effect of ApoA5 on CIDE-C expression was also determined.During the AMSCs , ApoA5 could reduce the intracellular lipid droplets accumulation and the TG level; meanwhile, ApoA5 down-regulated the expression level of adipogenic related factors, including CCAAT enhancer binding proteins α/β (C/EBPα/β), fatty  synthetase (FAS) and fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4). Furthermore, the suppression of  by ApoA5 was mediated through the inhibition of CIDE-C expression, an important factor which could promote the process of human AMSCs . However, over-expressing intracellular expression of CIDE-C could lead to the loss-of-function of ApoA5 in inhibiting AMSCs .In conclusion, ApoA5 could inhibit human AMSCs  through, at least partly, down-regulating CIDE-C expression. The present study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the anti-obesity effect of ApoA5 and suggests that ApoA5 has the potential to prevent obesity by acting on AMSCs.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373507>Alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation leads to the accumulation of large, immobile lipid droplets.</a></h2><p>Although steatosis (fatty liver) is a clinically well-described early stage of alcoholic liver disease, surprisingly little is known about how it promotes hepatotoxicity. We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the lipid droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes , we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF-B cells treated with ethanol and/or oleic  (a fatty  associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased lipid droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol metabolism, and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic liver disease. Chronic alcohol consumption with the "Western diet" enhances the development of fatty liver and leads to impaired droplet motility, which may have serious deletrious effects on hepatocyte function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532890>Epigallocatechin Exerts Anti-Obesity Effect in Brown Adipose Tissue.</a></h2><p>Catechins in green tea are well-known to be effective in reducing the risk of obesity.

Treatment of 3T3-L1 mouse adipocyte during differentiation adipocytes with (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and gallic  (GA) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of . Specifically, EGC increased adiponectin and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription in mature adipocytes. Transcription levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) were not significantly impacted by either of the compounds. These results suggest that the EGC is the most effective catechin having anti-obesity activity.

Here we show that during chronic cold exposure (1 wk at 4 °C), genes controlling de novo  (DNL) including , the master transcriptional regulator of DNL, acquired high-amplitude circadian rhythms in thermogenic BAT. These conditions activated mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1), an inducer of  expression, and engaged circadian transcriptional repressors REV-ERBα and β as rhythmic regulators of  in BAT. SREBP was required in BAT for the thermogenic response to norepinephrine, and depletion of SREBP prevented maintenance of body temperature both during circadian cycles as well as during fasting of chronically cold mice. By contrast, deletion of REV-ERBα and β in BAT allowed mice to maintain their body temperature in chronic cold. Thus, the environmental challenge of prolonged noncircadian exposure to cold temperature induces circadian induction of SREBP1 that drives fuel synthesis in BAT and is necessary to maintain circadian body temperature during chronic cold exposure. The requirement for BAT fatty  synthesis has broad implications for adaptation to cold.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678070>Downregulation of PHGDH expression and hepatic serine level contribute to the development of fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Supplementation with serine attenuates alcoholic fatty liver by regulating homocysteine metabolism and . However, little is known about serine metabolism in fatty liver disease (FLD). We aimed to investigate the changes in serine biosynthetic pathways in humans and animal models of fatty liver and their contribution to the development of FLD.High-fat diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis animal models were employed. Human serum samples were obtained from patients with FLD whose proton density fat fraction was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transgenic mice overexpressing Phgdh (Tg-phgdh) were used to evaluate the role of serine metabolism in the development of FLD.Expression of Phgdh was markedly reduced in the animal models. There were significant negative correlations of the serum serine with the liver fat fraction, serum alanine transaminase, and triglyceride levels among patients with FLD. Increased lipid accumulation and reduced NAD and SIRT1 activity were observed in Phgdh-knockout MEF and primary hepatocytes incubated with free fatty ; these effects were reversed by overexpression of Phgdh. Tg-Phgdh mice showed significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared with wild-type littermates fed a HFD, which was accompanied by increased SIRT1 activity and reduced expression of lipogenic genes and proteins.Human and experimental data suggest that reduced Phgdh expression and serine levels are closely associated with the development of FLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Studies on SCD1 deficiency in mouse models demonstrated beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance. Even though, SCD1 represents a potential target to resolve obesity related metabolic diseases; SCD1 deficiency causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). The induction of ER stress in response to SCD1 deficiency is governed by the cofactor, PGC-1α. However, the mechanism by which SCD1 deficiency increases PGC-1α and subsequently induces ER stress still remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that despite reduced , liver specific SCD1 deficiency activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) along with induction of PGC-1α and ER stress. Further, mTORC1 inhibition attenuates SCD1 deficiency-mediated induction of both PGC-1α and ER stress. Similar observations were seen by restoring endogenously synthesized oleate, but not palmitoleate, suggesting a clear mTORC1-mediated regulation of ER stress during SCD1 deficiency. Overall, our results suggest a model whereby maintaining adequate levels of hepatic oleate is required to suppress mTORC1-mediated ER stress. In addition, the activation of mTORC1 by SCD1 deficiency reveals an important function of fatty  in regulating different cellular processes through mTORC1 signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31280138>Anti-hepatic steatosis activity of Sicyos angulatus extract in high-fat diet-fed mice and chemical profiling study using UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Recently, the inhibitory effects of flavone glycosides isolated from Sicyos angulatus extract on hepatic lipid accumulation in vitro were demonstrated. However, the effects of S. angulatus extract and its major flavonoid glycoside on in vivo hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet have not yet been established.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of S. angulatus extract and its major flavonoid glycoside, kaempferol 3-O-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)]-β-d-glucopyranosyl-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside, on hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-fed mice, which serves as a model of NAFLD. In addition, attempts have been made to chemically profile the metabolites involved in the activity of the S. angulatus extract.C57BL/6 J mice were divided into vehicle, total extract of S. angulatus (SA; 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) and major active component (20 mg/kg) groups. The mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without S. angulatus extract or its major single compound for 10 weeks. Chemical identification was carried out using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-qTOF-MS/MS) and then quantified by HPLC-DAD.Administration of S. angulatus extract significantly lowered plasma ALT and AST levels in HFD-fed mice compared to those of the vehicle group. The hepatic lipid content, as evidenced by oil-red O staining and quantification, was significantly lower in the S. angulatus-administered group, and the effect was dose dependent. These beneficial effects of S. angulatus extract were related to the decreased expression of hepatic genes involved in fatty  (ACC1, FAS and SCD1) and triglyceride (DGAT) synthesis. The expression levels of two key transcription factors regulating , SREBP-1c and PPARγ, were significantly suppressed in the liver by administration of S. angulatus extract with HFD. Treatment of the HFD-fed mice with the major compound isolated from S. angulatus extract resulted in improved liver function along with an anti-steatotic effect similar to the results seen with S. angulatus extract. For the standardization of the S. angulatus extract, 23 compounds were identified based on MS/MS fragmentation and UV spectroscopy. Quantitative analysis of the major compound showed that the major component was present in 15.35 ± 0.01 mg/g of total extract.These findings suggest that S. angulatus extract and its major component have the potential to improve liver function and hepatic steatosis in diet-induced obese mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The inflammation-dependent increase in  requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31476344>Deltamethrin promotes  via AMPKα and ER stress-mediated pathway in 3T3- L1 adipocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h2><p>Previous research has shown that deltamethrin, a Type-II pyrethroid, increases fat accumulation in adipocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans.

However, the role and molecular mechanism of IGFBP-7 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains largely unknown. Therefore, the potential function of IGFBP7 in the pathological progression of NAFLD was explored in this investigation. For in vivo experiments, an animal model of NAFLD was established in C57BL/6 mice by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD), and IGFBP7 was knocked down by injecting adeno-associated adenovirus (AAV)-mediated short-hairpin (sh)-IGFBP7 into the liver. We found that AAV-sh-IGFBP7 treatment significantly alleviated hepatocyte injury and inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation by reducing -associated gene expression. Furthermore, downregulation of IGFBP7 markedly ameliorated IR and restored impaired insulin signalling by elevating the phosphorylation levels of IRS-1, Akt and GSK3β in HFD-treated mice. Similar results were also confirmed by an in vitro study in a palmitic  (PA)-stimulated HepG2 cell model. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that IGFBP7 contributes to hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in NAFLD development, which might serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419033>Maternal Overfeeding during Lactation Impairs the Metabolic Response to Fed/Fasting Changing Conditions in the Postweaning Offspring.</a></h2><p>The metabolic response to fed/fasting changing conditions at early age in rats with different predisposition to obesity-related alterations due to maternal conditions during the perinatal period is studied.Offspring of dams made obese by a cafeteria diet and moved to a normal-fat diet 1 month before gestation (O-PCaf, with an apparently normal phenotype in adulthood), and offspring of cafeteria diet-fed dams during lactation (O-CAF, with a thin-outside-fat inside phenotype), together with the offspring of control dams (O-C), are studied at early age.

Mannose oligosaccharide (MOS) has been reported to be a potential prebiotic. The present study is aimed to determine the effects of MOS on western-diet-induced obesity and to uncover the mediating roles of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites.Three-month-old male ICR mice are fed with a high-fat and high-fructose diet for 8 weeks. The diet-induced obese mice are then orally administrated with MOS (100 and 200 mg kg  d ) for 4 weeks. MOS significantly reduces bodyweight gain, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and inflammatory responses in obese mice. MOS also stimulates lipolysis and inhibits  in the adipose tissues. Moreover, MOS restructures the gut microbiome by enhancing the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in obese mice. The microbial metabolite SCFAs are also increased in the feces and serum. Correlation analysis indicates that the appetite suppression and lipid-lowering effects of MOS are highly correlated with the butyrate levels.MOS suppresses the appetite, which results in less lipid deposition. The lower appetite is likely due to an altered gut microbiome and elevated SCFAs production.

Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic . Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of glycolysis with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of glycolysis inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and glycolysis dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to identify key regulators in thymic . We used rosiglitazone, a potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist, to induce adipogenic differentiation of OP9-DL1 cells, and investigated the differentially expressed proteins during adipogenic differentiation by using label-free quantitative proteomics. Furthermore, the effects of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) on rosiglitazone-induced adipogenic differentiation of OP9-DL1 cells as well as the underlying mechanisms were also investigated.Proteomic analysis identified 139 proteins differed significantly in rosiglitazone-treated cells compared with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)-treated cells. Rosiglitazone-induced adipogenic differentiation was inhibited by TGF-β1 treatment in OP9-DL1 cells and primary thymic stromal cells. Real-time PCR analysis showed significant increases in PPARγ and fatty  binding protein 4 mRNA levels in rosiglitazone-treated cells, which were inhibited by TGF-β1 treatment. TGF-β1 down-regulated PPARγ expression at both mRNA and protein levels in OP9-DL1 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that TGF-β1 enhanced the binding of Smad2/3 and histone deacetylase 1, but reduced the binding of H3K14ac to the promoter of PPARγ gene. TGF-β1 partially reversed the inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone on the expression of Axin2 and β-catenin protein levels. TGF-β1 inhibited rosiglitazone-induced adipogenic transformation in OP9-DL1 cells by down-regulation of PPARγ and activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.Taken together, activation of TGF-β pathway may serve as a useful strategy to prevent thymic adiposity in age-related thymic involution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644978>Cafestol increases fat oxidation and energy expenditure in Caenorhabditis elegans via DAF-12-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Cafestol, a coffee diterpene, is a known agonist of farnesoid X receptors (FXR), which are involved in cholesterol homeostasis. FXR plays critical roles in other lipid metabolic pathways, including fat oxidation; however, little is known about cafestol's effects on fatty  metabolism. Thus, the goal was to investigate cafestol's effects on fatty  metabolism using Caenorhabditis elegans. Cafestol at 60 µM reduced fat accumulation and increased locomotor activity (an indicator of energy expenditure) by 20% and 38%, respectively, compared to the control. Cafestol's effects were dependent on daf-12 (a functional homolog of the human FXR) with upregulation of ech-1.1 (a homolog of enoyl-CoA hydratase involved in fatty  β-oxidation) and tub-1 (an ortholog of the human TUBBY involved in the neurological regulation of energy expenditure) without any effects on , lipolysis or lipid uptake and transport. Therefore, cafestol increased fat oxidation and energy expenditure via DAF-12-dependent pathway in C. elegans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Small molecules originating from dietary food are considered suitable and attractive drug candidates for humans in terms of safety. In this study, an edible plant,  (LV), used as a traditional and medicinal food in East Asia was evaluated for  decreasing effects. Activity-guided fractionation was performed, and the isolated compounds were identified using spectroscopic methods. We conducted in vitro real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting as well as histological and biochemical analyses following in vivo treatments. Using a high-fat diet animal model, we confirmed that LV extracts (LVE) decreased lipogenic metabolism and restored liver function to control levels. To identify active components, we conducted activity-guided fractionation and then isolated compounds. Two compounds, loliolide and pinoresinol, were identified in the dichloromethane fraction, and they significantly attenuated the expression levels of lipogenic factors including sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), fatty  synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Importantly, loliolide and pinoresinol significantly accelerated the protein degradation of LXRs by enhanced ubiquitination, which inhibited . These results suggest that loliolide and pinoresinol might be potential candidate supplementary treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by reducing  through increased ubiquitination of LXRs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306969>Resveratrol shifts energy metabolism to increase lipid oxidation in healthy old mice.</a></h2><p>The objective of this work was to determine the specific mechanisms by which resveratrol inhibits  and stimulates lipolysis.Twelve male mice were individually introduced into a metabolic cage for 24 h to measure basal metabolic rate, prior to intervention. They were randomly divided into two groups, resveratrol (RSV) and control (C), and administered resveratrol intraperitoneally or vehicle, respectively, for two consecutive days. After 24 h, the metabolic energy expenditure was again determined for 24 h, before mice were sacrificed. Protein and gene expression of different enzymes related to metabolism in the hepatic tissue, adipose tissue and gastrocnemius of mice were analyzed by RT-PCR, western blot or ELISA.We report that resveratrol lowers the respiratory quotient in old mice and that this may be due to the activation of fatty  mobilization from white adipose tissue (because hormone-activated lipase expression is increased) and fatty  transport into mitochondria and eventual oxidation in muscle and liver (because transport enzymes and beta oxidation enzymes are also increased). Indeed, we have observed that resveratrol in vivo causes an increase in the expression and phosphorylation of AMPKα in liver, muscle and adipose tissue and an increase in the expression of acyl-CoA synthetase, of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 and of carnitine acylcarnitine translocase, all enzymes involved in lipid catabolism. On the other hand, the levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase as well as those its product, i.e. malonyl CoA, are decreased.We conclude that a controlled dose of resveratrol activates fatty  mobilization and degradation and inhibits fatty  synthesis in old mice. This is the first time that these effects of resveratrol in lipid metabolism in healthy old (non-obese) animals are reported.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Male C57BL/6N mice were fed chow, a HFD, or a 0.025% filbertone-supplemented HFD for 14 weeks. We found that filbertone supplementation resulted in significant reductions in body weight gain and lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, with parallel improvements in plasma lipid levels (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty ) and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)). Molecular analysis revealed that filbertone treatment led to reprogramming of metabolic signatures in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. Filbertone supplementation significantly increased the cAMP level and increased downstream protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA) signaling in mouse adipose tissue. The mRNA level of -related genes was downregulated in the adipose tissue of filbertone-fed mice compared to control mice fed the HFD alone. Furthermore, filbertone treatment elevated the expression of thermogenic genes in mouse adipose tissue. Filbertone reduced intracellular lipid accumulation and increased the oxygen consumption rate in 3T3-L1 cells and these filbertone-induced changes were abrogated by the adenylate cyclases (ADCY) inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of filbertone on lipid accumulation may be associated with the activation of cAMP signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31395683>Leelamine Is a Novel  Inhibitor in Prostate Cancer Cells  and .</a></h2><p>Increased  synthesis of fatty  is implicated in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer, but a safe and effective clinical inhibitor of this metabolic pathway is still lacking. We have shown previously that leelamine (LLM) suppresses transcriptional activity of androgen receptor, which is known to regulate fatty  synthesis. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the effect of LLM on fatty  synthesis. Exposure of 22Rv1, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, but not RWPE-1 normal prostate epithelial cell line, to LLM resulted in a decrease in intracellular levels of neutral lipids or total free fatty . LLM was superior to another fatty  synthesis inhibitor (cerulenin) for suppression of total free fatty  levels. LLM treatment downregulated protein and/or mRNA expression of key fatty  synthesis enzymes, including ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty  synthase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) in each cell line. Consistent with these  findings, we also observed a significant decrease in ATP citrate lyase and SREBP1 protein expression as well as number of neutral lipid droplets  in 22Rv1 tumor sections of LLM-treated mice when compared with that of controls. LLM-mediated suppression of intracellular levels of total free fatty  and neutral lipids was partly attenuated by overexpression of SREBP1. In conclusion, these results indicate that LLM is a novel inhibitor of SREBP1-regulated fatty /lipid synthesis in prostate cancer cells that is not affected by androgen receptor status.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31579921>Dietary Garcinol Attenuates Hepatic Pyruvate and Triglyceride Accumulation by Inhibiting P300/CBP-Associated Factor in Mid-to-Late Pregnant Rats.</a></h2><p>Increased hepatic glycolysis and  are characteristic of pregnancy.The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of garcinol on the amelioration of hepatic pyruvate and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in mid-to-late pregnant rats.Forty Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats (aged 9 wk, n = 10/diet) were fed a basal diet (control) or that diet plus garcinol at 100 ppm (Low Gar), 300 ppm (Mid Gar), or 500 ppm (High Gar) for 14 d.

BCAA may promote insulin resistance through either mTOR-mediated suppression of insulin receptor substrate-1 or through the accumulation of toxic BCAA catabolites. Although the link between circulating BCAA and insulin resistance has been consistent, it has yet to be concluded if BCAA causally contribute to the development or worsening of insulin resistance. This work investigated the effect of leucine both with and without varying levels of insulin resistance on metabolism, metabolic gene expression, and insulin signaling. C2C12 myotubes were treated with and without varied concentrations of leucine up to 2mM for 24 hours both with and without varied levels of insulin resistance. Gene and protein expression were measured via qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Mitochondrial metabolism was measured via O consumption. Leucine at 2mM increased oxidative metabolism as well as gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis, which was associated with increased cellular lipid content. Despite increased lipid content of leucine-treated cells, neither acute nor chronic leucine treatment at 2mM affected insulin signaling in insulin sensitive, mildly insulin resistant, or severely insulin resistant cells. Similarly, leucine at lower concentrations (0.25mM, 0.5mM, and 1mM) did not alter insulin signaling either, regardless of insulin resistance. Leucine appears to improve myotube oxidative metabolism and related metabolic gene expression. And despite increased lipid content of leucine-treated cells, leucine does not appear to alter insulin sensitivity either acutely or chronically, regardless of level of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

ELOVL fatty  elongase 6 (Elovl6) is responsible for converting C16 saturated and monounsaturated fatty  (FAs) into C18 species. We have previously shown that Elovl6 contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance by modifying hepatic C16/C18-related FA composition. To define the precise molecular mechanism by which hepatic Elovl6 affects energy homeostasis and metabolic disease, we generated liver-specific Elovl6 knockout (LKO) mice. Unexpectedly, LKO mice were not protected from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. Instead, LKO mice exhibited higher insulin sensitivity than controls when consuming a high-sucrose diet (HSD), which induces . Hepatic patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) expression was downregulated in LKO mice, and adenoviral Pnpla3 restoration reversed the enhancement in insulin sensitivity in HSD-fed LKO mice. Lipidomic analyzes showed that the hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) content was lower in LKO mice, which may explain the effect on insulin sensitivity. Ceramide(d18:1/18:0) enhances protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity by interfering with the binding of PP2A to its biological inhibitor I2PP2A, leading to Akt dephosphorylation. Its production involves the formation of an Elovl6-ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a Pnpla3-CerS4 complex on lipid droplets (LDs). Consistent with this, liver-specific Elovl6 deletion in ob/ob mice reduced both hepatic ceramide(d18:1/18:0) and PP2A activity, and ameliorated insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the key role of hepatic Elovl6 in the regulation of the acyl-chain composition of ceramide, and that C18:0-ceramide is a potent regulator of hepatic insulin signaling linked to Pnpla3-mediated NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260678>Effects of short-term prednisolone treatment on indices of lipolysis and lipase signaling in abdominal adipose tissue in healthy humans.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoid (GC) excess increases lipolysis, circulating free fatty  concentrations and lipid oxidation rates in humans.

Adipose tissue biopsies were sampled from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue at the end of the basal period and the clamp.GC treatment increased serum FFA concentrations and comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) mRNA - an ATGL activator - and decreased G0/G1 switch 2 gene (G0S2) mRNA - an ATGL inhibitor - in adipose tissue biopsies. In addition, pro-lipolytic ser HSL phosphorylations and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of PLIN1 (Perilipin-1) increased. The transcripts of ANGPTL4 (Angiopoietin-like 4) mRNA - a regulator of circulating triglycerides - were elevated by GC; as were CIDE (Cell-death Inducing DNA fragmentation factor-α-like Effector)-A and CIDE-C mRNA transcripts indicative of concurrent stimulation of lipolysis and . Finally GCs reduced insulin receptor phosphorylation, and Akt protein levels.High dose GC administration to humans leads to pro-lipolytic alterations of CGI-58, G0S2 and ANGPTL4 mRNA transcripts, increases PKA signaling to lipolysis and inhibits the insulin signal in adipose tissue. The increased CIDE-A and CIDE-C mRNA levels suggest concomitant stimulation of lipolysis and lipid storage.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Since conventional therapies have not demonstrated desirable effectiveness and possess remarkable side effects, there is a growing interest in the use of herbal medicines for the management of acne vulgaris. In this study, plant-derived molecules investigated in acne vulgaris have been reviewed and their possible underlying mechanisms of action were discussed. For this purpose, different electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library and Google Scholar were searched to obtain any in vitro, in vivo, or human studies evaluating the phytochemicals in the management of acne vulgaris. Data were collected from 1980 to 2018 (up to October). Most of the phytochemicals investigated in acne were from the category of polyphenols including resveratrol, myricitrin, schisandrin, terchebulin, alpha-mangotin, curcumin, ellagic  and epigallocatechin 3-gallate. Moreover, alkaloids and terpenoids such as berberine, ursolic , lupeol were evaluated in acne vulgaris with less abundance. Various molecular mechanisms were involved in effects of phytochemicals including antioxidant (through down-regulation of HO, MDA, ROS and upregulation of SOD), anti-inflammatory (through reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, TNF-α, NF-κB), immunomodulatory, antibacterial (against Propionibacterium acnes and Propionibacterium granulosum), antiandrogenic, reducing sebum production, and  inhibitory activities. Therefore, phytochemicals seem to be a precious source for identifying new medicines for treatment of acne vulgaris; however, since most of studies are preclinical, further clinical studies are needed to achieve more conclusive and reliable results.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293337>Biomarkers and subtypes of deranged lipid metabolism in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a heterogeneous and complex disease that is imprecisely diagnosed by liver biopsy. NAFLD covers a spectrum that ranges from simple steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with varying degrees of fibrosis, to cirrhosis, which is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle and eating habit changes during the last century have made NAFLD the most common liver disease linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, with a global prevalence of 25%. NAFLD arises when the uptake of fatty  (FA) and triglycerides (TG) from circulation and de novo  saturate the rate of FA β-oxidation and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG export. Deranged lipid metabolism is also associated with NAFLD progression from steatosis to NASH, and therefore, alterations in liver and serum lipidomic signatures are good indicators of the disease's development and progression. This review focuses on the importance of the classification of NAFLD patients into different subtypes, corresponding to the main alteration(s) in the major pathways that regulate FA homeostasis leading, in each case, to the initiation and progression of NASH. This concept also supports the targeted intervention as a key approach to maximize therapeutic efficacy and opens the door to the development of precise NASH treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615399>Identification of differentially expressed genes and pathways between intramuscular and abdominal fat-derived preadipocyte differentiation of chickens in vitro.</a></h2><p>The distribution and deposition of fat tissue in different parts of the body are the key factors affecting the carcass quality and meat flavour of chickens. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is an important factor associated with meat quality, while abdominal fat (AbF) is regarded as one of the main factors affecting poultry slaughter efficiency. To investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and molecular regulatory mechanisms related to adipogenic differentiation between IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocytes, we analysed the mRNA expression profiles in preadipocytes (0d, Pre-) and adipocytes (10d, Ad-) from IMF and AbF of Gushi chickens.AbF-derived preadipocytes exhibited a higher adipogenic differentiation ability (96.4% + 0.6) than IMF-derived preadipocytes (86.0% + 0.4) (p < 0.01). By Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing, we obtained 4403 (2055 upregulated and 2348 downregulated) and 4693 (2797 upregulated and 1896 downregulated) DEGs between preadipocytes and adipocytes in the IMF and Ad groups, respectively. For IMF-derived preadipocyte differentiation, pathways related to the PPAR signalling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathway were significantly enriched. For AbF-derived preadipocyte differentiation, the steroid biosynthesis pathways, calcium signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway were significantly enriched. A large number of DEGs related to lipid metabolism, fatty  metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation, such as PPARG, ACSBG2, FABP4, FASN, APOA1 and INSIG1, were identified in our study.This study revealed large transcriptomic differences between IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocyte differentiation. A large number of DEGs and transcription factors that were closely related to fatty  metabolism, lipid metabolism and preadipocyte differentiation were identified in the present study. Additionally, the microenvironment of IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocyte may play a significant role in adipogenic differentiation.

However, transcriptional dynamic regulation of adipose differentiation driven by complex signal cascades remains largely unexplored in this model. This study aimed to explore adipogenic transcriptional dynamics before (proliferation) and after (differentiation) initial preadipocyte differentiation in ducks.Exogenous oleic  alone successfully induced duck subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation. We explored 36 mRNA-seq libraries in order to study transcriptome dynamics during proliferation and differentiation processes at 6 time points. Using robust statistical analysis, we identified 845, 652, 359, 2401 and 1933 genes differentially expressed between -48 h and 0 h, 0 h and 12 h, 12 h and 24 h, 24 h and 48 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively (FDR < 0.05, FC > 1.5). At the proliferation stage, proliferation related pathways and basic cellular and metabolic processes were inhibited, while regulatory factors that initiate differentiation enter the ready-to-activate state, which provides a precondition for initiating adipose differentiation. According to weighted gene co-expression network analysis, pathways positively related to adipogenic differentiation are significantly activated at the differentiation stage, while WNT, FOXO and other pathways that inhibit preadipocyte differentiation are negatively regulated. Moreover, we identified and classified more than 100 transcription factors that showed significant changes during differentiation, and found novel transcription factors that were not reported to be related to preadipoctye differentiation. Finally, we manually assembled a proposed regulation network model of subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation base on the expression data, and suggested that E2F1 may serve as an important link between the processes of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.For the first time we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome dynamics of duck subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation. The current study provides a solid basis for understanding the synthesis and deposition of subcutaneous fat in ducks. Furthermore, the information generated will allow future investigations of specific genes involved in particular stages of duck .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505325>Peroxiredoxin 5 ameliorates obesity-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through the regulation of oxidative stress and AMP-activated protein kinase signaling.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most common chronic liver disease globally. NAFLD-which can develop into liver fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma-is defined as an excess accumulation of fat caused by abnormal lipid metabolism and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in hepatocytes. Recently, we reported that Peroxiredoxin 5 (Prx5) plays an essential role in regulating  and suggested the need to further investigation on the potential curative effects of Prx5 on obesity-induced fatty liver disease. In the present study, we focused on the role of Prx5 in fatty liver disease. We found that Prx5 overexpression significantly suppressed cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS generation. Additionally, Prx5 regulated the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway and lipogenic gene (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and FAS) expression; it also inhibited lipid accumulation, resulting in the amelioration of free fatty -induced hepatic steatosis. Silence of Prx5 triggered de novo  and abnormal lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Concordantly, Prx5 knockout mice exhibited a high susceptibility to obesity-induced hepatic steatosis. Liver sections of Prx5-deletion mice fed on a high-fat diet displayed Oil Red O-stained dots and small leaky shapes due to immoderate fat deposition. Collectively, our findings suggest that Prx5 functions as a protective regulator in fatty liver disease and that it may be a valuable therapeutic target for the management of obesity-related metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The condition of the animal is reflected by multiple blood parameters. The newly discovered cytokine-apelin can pose one of them, however, so far, has not been studied in the horse population. Apelin is produced by adipocytes and myocytes and plays an important role in the energy metabolism of the body through the influence, for example, on the process of  and lipolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate if physical effort of various intensity affects the plasma concentration of apelin in horses. The study involved 20 purebred Arabian horses divided into two groups. The first group included 10 race horses, aged 3 years, and second group included 10 horses aged from 6 to 12 years, used in endurance rides. Blood samples were collected from each horse at rest and after exercise. The concentrations of apelin, lactic , cortisol, uric  (UA), triacylglycerols, total plasma protein, and glucose were determined in plasma samples. Race training sessions induced significant decreases in plasma apelin concentrations (P < .05). In endurance horses, significant correlations were found only between exercise-induced changes of apelin and cortisol (r = 0.55) and apelin and UA (r = 0.67) concentrations. In conclusion, the concentration of apelin in equine plasma decreases in response to short-time exercise unlike endurance exercise. Blood plasma apelin concentration determined at rest is lower in long-time regularly trained horses than in the ones at the beginning of their training process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of FAs and natural waxes on the  in 3T3-L1 cells. The 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated and treated with FAs and waxes. These FAs [Palmitic  (PA), Stearic  (SA), Oleic  (OA), Linoleic  (LA), and Alpha-linolenic  (ALA)] and waxes [beeswax (BW) and carnauba wax (CW)] were prepared at varying concentrations, and cell toxicity, triglyceride accumulation, lipid droplets size, and distribution inside of cells were determined. Adipogenic gene expression including , , , , and  was determined. Results showed that increasing the concentration of FAs and waxes led to a decrease in the adipocyte cells viability and metabolic performance. SA showed the highest level of triglyceride accumulation (p<0.05), whereas ALA showed the lowest (p<0.05). Both BW and CW at 3.0 ppm showed significantly higher lipid accumulation than in the control and other groups (p<0.05). ALA had significantly downregulated adipogenic gene expression levels, excluding those of , compared to the other treatment groups (p<0.05). Moreover, BW demonstrated similar adipogenic gene expression levels as ALA compared to CW.

The purpose of this study is to elucidate the expression profiles of these -related genes after rotator cuff detachment and reattachment in a rabbit model.We investigated gene expression profiles of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and wnt10b in different parts of rabbit supraspinatus (SSP) muscle after tendon detachment ( = 6 for each time point). In addition, we assessed expression of the same genes after SSP reattachment with different intervals from initial detachment ( = 6). Fatty degeneration of the SSP muscle was examined by Oil red-O staining. Gene expression profiles were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.After SSP detachment, Oil red-O-positive oil deposits increased after 3 weeks. In the SSP reattachment model, numerous Oil red-O-positive cells were present at 5-week reattachment, following 2- and 3-week detachment. PPARγ and C/EBPα messenger ribonucleic  expression exhibited a significant increase at 2 and 3 weeks after SSP detachment and remained increased at 5-week reattachment after 2- and 3-week detachment. A decreased expression of wnt10b was observed from 1 week after SSP detachment. Expression of wnt10b was recovered not in the central area of the SSP muscle but in the periphery after reattachment. Adipogenic change was not observed when SSP tendon was reattached after 1-week detachment.These results may suggest that once the adipogenic transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, were elevated, repair surgery after rotator cuff tear could not prevent the emergence of fat in the SSP muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381877>Maintenance of stem cell viability and differentiation potential following cryopreservation within 3-dimensional hyaluronic  hydrogels.</a></h2><p>While significant progress has been made in directing the behavior of cells encapsulated within three-dimensional (3D) covalently crosslinked hydrogels, the capacity of these materials to support in situ cryopreservation of cells directly within the gels has not been assessed.

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced obesity mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine lipid accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of  by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and total fat mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome.

Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with  and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease.

Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions.

These changes are importantly regulated by decreases in vitamin A and its retinoic  metabolites as well as increases in mitochondria estrogen receptor-beta and the N-acetylserotonin/melatonin ratio across development.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome.

Mitochondria are the major sites of fatty  β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of fatty . Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic fatty -induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial fatty  oxidation to inhibit hepatic fatty  accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573688>Resveratrol Inhibits Human Visceral Preadipocyte Proliferation and Differentiation in vitro.</a></h2><p>Visceral obesity is a high-risk factor for diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

To better understand the mechanistic actions of PPA on bone formation in vivo, we administered four doses of PPA (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day; daily i.p.) to 1-month-old female C57BL6/J mice for 30 days. We did not observe significant effects of PPA on cortical bone; however, there were significantly higher bone volume and trabecular thickness and increased osteoblastic cell number, but decreased osteoclastic cell number in PPA-treated groups compared to controls. These morphological and cellular outcomes of bone were reflected in changes of bone formation markers in serum and bone marrow plasma. PPA treatment reduced senescence signaling as evaluated by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, PPARγ, p53, and p21 expression in bone. In conclusion, PPA is capable of altering the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation program and bone cell senescence.

Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1, fatty  synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism. Moreover, TSB and TSF reduced TG contents, implying the therapeutic use of TSB and TSF in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327694>Human bone marrow adipocytes display distinct immune regulatory properties.</a></h2><p>The bone marrow (BM) is a major reservoir of resting memory T cells and long-lived plasma cells, capable of providing protection against recurrent infections. Whether the age-related accumulation of adipose tissue in the BM affects the functionality and maintenance of memory cells is not well understood.For the first time, we compare human femur marrow adipose tissue (fMAT) and subcutaneous white adipose tissue of the thigh (tsWAT) obtained from the same donors. Therefore, we used microarrays for comparative global gene expression analysis, and employed assays to analyse parameters of adipocyte biology, inflammation and oxidative stress.We show that fMAT adipocytes differ significantly from tsWAT adipocytes regarding specific gene expression profiles including inflammatory responses and /adipocyte phenotype. Concomitant with considerably lower levels of CD36, a membrane-associated protein important for long-chain fatty  uptake that is used as maturation marker, fMAT adipocytes are smaller and contain less triglycerides. fMAT adipocytes secrete similar levels of adiponectin and leptin as tsWAT adipocytes, and express increased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules concomitant with an elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired function of plasma cells in the BM.Our findings suggest that fMAT is a unique type of adipose tissue containing small adipocytes with lower CD36 protein and triglyceride levels than tsWAT but high adipokine secretion. Moreover, fMAT adipocytes secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to inflammation and impairment of plasma cell function in the BM, suggesting that fMAT has more immune regulatory functions than tsWAT.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Human LO2 cells nonalcoholic fatty liver models were established by using palmitic ( PA). Then psoralen and isopsoralen were administered for intervention. Intracellular triglyceride( TG) and total cholesterol( TC) content,the cell supernatant alanine aminotransferase( ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase( AST) levels were determined by enzyme method. Cell supernatant proinflammatory cytokines( IL-6,TNF-α) and chemokines( IL-8,MCP-1) were determined by ELISA method. Western blot method was conducted to detect the protein expression of intracellular nuclear factor( NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation( p-p65),nonphosphorylated protein( p65),and transforming factor TGF-β1. Result showed that as compared with the model group,intracellular TG and TC levels,the cell supernatant ALT and AST levels,proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased( P < 0. 01,P <0. 05); the p-p65/p65 ratio and TGF-β1 protein expression were also significantly decreased( P< 0. 01,P< 0. 05) in psoralen intervention group. As compared with the model cells,intracellular TG content had no significant changes,but all the other indexes were reduced( P<0. 01,P<0. 05) in the cells of isopsoralen intervention group. Psoralen exhibited better effect than isopsoralen( P< 0. 01,P<0. 05). It is concluded that psoralen could improve the  of LO2 cells induced by PA; both psoralen and isopsoralen are effective in ameliorating LO2 cells injury induced by PA,reducing inflammation via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and down-regulating the expression of TGF-β1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638999>Inhibition of the key metabolic pathways, glycolysis and , of oral cancer by bitter melon extract.</a></h2><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancer which favours rapid energy production, biosynthetic capabilities and therapy resistance. In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering glycolysis and lipid metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on glycolysis and lipid metabolism pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and  genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In  pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty  biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369706>Omega-3 Fatty  Responsive Proteins and Reduction in Breast Density in Obese Postmenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>We reported that breast density (BD) was inversely correlated with the plasma level of DHA in postmenopausal obese, but not in nonobese, women given Lovaza (n-3FA). To identify protein biomarkers for the possible differential effect of n-3FA on BD between obese and nonobese women, an iTRAQ method was performed to analyze plasma from obese and lean women at each time point (baseline, 12 and 24-months,  = 10 per group); 173 proteins with >95% confidence (Unuses Score >1.3 and local false discovery rate estimation <5%) were identified. Comparative analysis between various groups identified several differentially expressed proteins (hemopexin precursor, vitamin D binding protein isoform 1 precursor [VDBP], fibronectin isoform 10 precursor [FN], and α-2 macroglobulin precursor [A2M]). Western blot analysis was performed to verify the differential expression of proteins in the iTRAQ study, and those found to be altered in a tumor protective fashion by an n-3FA rich diet in our previous preclinical study; gelsolin, VDBP, and FN were altered by n-3FA in a manner consistent with reduction in inflammation in obese women.

The aims of present study were to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid levels on growth, enzymes activities, and expression of genes of lipid metabolism in hepatopancreas of juvenile swimming crab. Three isonitrogenous diets were formulated to contain crude lipid levels at 5.8 %, 9.9 % and 15.1 %, respectively. Crabs fed the diet containing 15.1 % lipid had significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and survival, and higher feed conversion ratio than those fed the 5.8 % and 9.9 % lipid diets. Crabs fed 5.8 % lipid had lower malondialdehyde concentrations in the hemolymph and hepatopancreas than those fed the other diets. Highest glutathione peroxidase in hemolymph and superoxide dismutase in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed 5.8 % lipid. The lowest fatty  synthase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in hepatopancreas were observed in crabs fed 15.1 % lipid, whereas crabs fed 5.8 % lipid had lower carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity than those fed the other diets. Crabs fed 15.1 % lipid showed lower hepatopancreas expression of genes involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis, lipoprotein clearance, fatty  uptake, fatty  oxidation, lipid anabolism and lipid catabolism than those fed the other diets, whereas expression of some genes of lipoprotein assembly and fatty  oxidation were up-regulated compared with crabs fed 5.8 % lipid. Overall, high dietary lipid level can inhibit growth, reduce feed utilization and reduce antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, dietary lipid influenced enzyme activities and gene expression involved in lipid metabolism of juvenile swimming crab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350637>Association between carbohydrate intake and fatty  in the de novo lipogenic pathway in serum phospholipids and adipose tissue in a population of Swedish men.</a></h2><p>Fatty  composition in blood and adipose tissue (AT) is a useful biomarker of dietary fat quality. However, circulating saturated fatty  (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) have been proposed to also reflect carbohydrate-induced de novo  (DNL) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity. We aimed to test the hypothesis that high carbohydrate intake is related to SFA and MUFA in serum or AT in a Swedish population.Fatty  composition was measured in serum phospholipids (PL) and AT by gas chromatography in 63-year-old men (n = 299). Carbohydrate and alcohol intake was assessed (validated 7-day food records) in relation to total SFA, 16:0 (palmitate), 16:1 (palmitoleate), and estimated SCD activity (16:1n-7/16:0-ratio) in serum PL and in AT, respectively.Total carbohydrate intake was inversely associated with 16:0 in PL (P = 0.005), independently of BMI. Disaccharides were non-linearly (restricted cubic splines) and weakly associated with 16:1 and SCD activity in PL (nonlinear trend, P ≤ 0.02) but not AT. Carbohydrate intake and SCD expression were not associated (P ≥ 0.08, n = 81). Alcohol intake was, however, linearly associated with 16:0 in PL (P < 0.001), and with 16:1 (P < 0.001) and SCD activity (P ≤ 0.005) in both PL and AT.Higher carbohydrate intake from sugar-rich foods or beverages was not clearly reflected by higher SFA or SCD activity in serum PL or AT.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic  (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and . At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322470>Gene expressions of de novo hepatic  in feline hepatic lipidosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate if de novo hepatic lipid synthesis contributes to fatty  overload in the liver of cats with feline hepatic lipidosis (FHL).Lipogenic gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (), fatty  synthase () and sterol regulatory element-binding factor () were evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR in liver tissue of six cats with FHL and compared with the liver tissue of eight healthy cats.In liver tissue  and  mRNA expression levels were not significantly different ( >0.12,  >0.89 and  >0.5, respectively) in the FHL group compared with the control group.  gene expression was downregulated around 10-fold in the FHL group vs the control group ( = 0.039).The downregulation of  in the liver tissue of cats with FHL does not support the hypothesis that de novo  in the liver is an important pathway of fatty  accumulation in FHL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668954>Prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM programmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease differently in adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is one of the leading preventable threats to public health. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic fatty accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal liver function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and liver function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased  and worsened fatty  oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved  and fatty  oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we found that hepatic steatosis is associated with robust hepatic sympathetic overactivity. Removal of hepatic sympathetic nerves reduced obesity-induced hepatic steatosis. Liver sympathetic innervation modulated hepatic lipid acquisition pathways during obesity.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 1 in 3 Americans and is a significant risk factor for type II diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and hepatic carcinoma. Characterized in part by excessive hepatic triglyceride accumulation (i.e. hepatic steatosis), the incidence of NAFLD is increasing - in line with the growing obesity epidemic. The role of the autonomic nervous system in NAFLD remains unclear. Here, we show that chronic hepatic sympathetic overactivity mediates hepatic steatosis. Direct multiunit recordings of hepatic sympathetic nerve activity were obtained in high fat diet and normal chow fed male C57BL/6J mice. To reduce hepatic sympathetic nerve activity we utilized two approaches including pharmacological ablation of the sympathetic nerves and phenol-based hepatic sympathetic nerve denervation. Diet-induced NAFLD was associated with a nearly doubled firing rate of the hepatic sympathetic nerves, which was largely due to an increase in efferent nerve traffic. Furthermore, established high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis was effectively reduced with pharmacological or phenol-based removal of the hepatic sympathetic nerves, independent of changes in body weight, caloric intake or adiposity. Ablation of liver sympathetic nerves was also associated with improvements in liver triglyceride accumulation pathways including free fatty  uptake and de novo . These findings highlight an unrecognized pathogenic link between liver sympathetic outflow and hepatic steatosis and suggest that manipulation of the liver sympathetic nerves may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), or saturated fatty  (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently, body weight gains, liver weights, and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty - and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

Fibrates, acting as PPARα agonists, have been widely used lipid-lowering agents for decades. However, the currently available PPARα targeting agents show low subtype-specificity and consequently a search for more potent agonists have emerged. In this study, previously isolated oxohexadecenoic  from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus were used to design a PPARα-specific analogue. Herein we report the design, synthesis, molecular modelling studies and biological evaluations of the novel 3,5-disubstituted isoxazole analogue 6-(5-heptyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)hexanoic  (1), named ADAM. ADAM shows a clear receptor preference and significant dose-dependent activation of PPARα (EC = 47 µM) through its ligand-binding domain (LBD). Moreover, ADAM induces expression of important PPARα target genes, such as CPT1A, in the Huh7 cell line and primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, ADAM exhibits a moderate ability to regulate PPARγ target genes and drive . Molecular modelling studies indicated that ADAM docks its carboxyl group into opposite ends of the PPARα and -γ LBD. ADAM interacts with the receptor-activating polar network of amino  (Tyr501, His447 and Ser317) in PPARα, but not in PPARγ LBD. This may explain the lack of PPARγ agonism, and argues for a PPARα-dependent adipogenic function.

The average α-glucosidase inhibitory activity and  inhibitory activity for the kochujang samples were 29.6% and 20.8%, respectively, while those of the doenjang samples were 46.3% and 11.6%, respectively. Therefore, antidiabetic activity is high in doenjang and antiobesity activity is high in kochujang. Kochujang and doenjang components responsible for suppressing the functional effects were investigated by metabolomic analysis. For kochujang, -coumaric , N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine, threonine, and methionine positively correlated with inhibition of  activity, whereas for doenjang, betaine and betaine aldehyde were thought to be responsible for the antidiabetic effects. As -coumaric  and betaine were the most probable candidates with functional effects, these two compounds were selected for further analysis. Inhibition of  was shown to be 14.0±1.85% for betaine chloride and 38.3±3.27% for -coumaric , suggesting that -coumaric  is more effective than betaine against obesity. However, betaine exhibited higher α-glucosidase inhibitory activity than -coumaric . Our results suggest that both kochujang and doenjang can be used against diabetes and obesity.

Moreover, the expression level and actions of leptin, a vast adipocytokine regulating energy metabolism, appear to be strongly associated with epigenetics. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge of the epigenetic regulation of leptin as well as the leptin-induced epigenetic modifications in metabolic disorders and associated phenomena. The collected data indicated that the deregulation of leptin expression and secretion that occurs during the course of metabolic diseases is underlain by a variation in the level of promoter methylation, the occurrence of histone modifications, along with miRNA interference. Furthermore, leptin was proven to epigenetically regulate several miRNAs and affect the activity of the histone deacetylases. These epigenetic modifications were observed in obesity, gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome and concerned various molecular processes like glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, liver fibrosis, obesity-related carcinogenesis,  or fetal/early postnatal programming. Moreover, the circulating miRNA profiles were associated with the plasma leptin level in metabolic syndrome, and miRNAs were found to be involved in hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. In summary, the evidence suggests that leptin is both a target and a mediator of epigenetic changes that develop in numerous tissues during metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430204>Hypoxia exacerbates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via the HIF-2α/PPARα pathway.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate whether hypoxia can affect nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and the associated mechanisms, specifically regarding the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α pathway in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have reported that, compared with HIF-1α, HIF-2α has different effects on lipid metabolism. We propose hypoxia may exacerbate NAFLD by the HIF-2α upregulation-induced suppression of PPARα in the liver. To verify this hypothesis, a steatotic human hepatocyte (L02) cell line treated with free fatty  and a mouse model of NAFLD fed a high-fat diet were used. Steatotic hepatocytes were treated with hypoxia, HIF-2α siRNA, PPARα agonists, and inhibitors, respectively. Meanwhile, the NAFLD mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia with PPARα agonists. The relative gene expression levels of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, mitochondrial function, fatty  β-oxidation and  were examined. Evidence of lipid accumulation was observed, which demonstrated that, compared with normal hepatocytes, steatotic hepatocytes exhibited higher sensitivity to hypoxia. This phenomenon was closely associated with HIF-2α. Moreover, lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was ameliorated by HIF-2α silencing or a PPARα agonist, despite the hypoxia treatment. HIF-2α overexpression under hypoxic conditions suppressed PPARα, leading to PGC-1α, NRF-1, ESRRα downregulation, and mitochondrial impairment. Additionally, β-oxidation genes such as CPT1α, CPT2α, ACOX1, and ACOX2 were downregulated and  genes including LXRα, FAS, and SCD1 were upregulated by hypoxia. Therefore, we concluded that HIF-2α overexpression induced by hypoxia aggravated NAFLD progression by suppressing fatty  β-oxidation and inducing  in the liver via PPARα.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31507325>Endoplasmic reticulum stress may be involved in insulin resistance and lipid metabolism disorders of the white adipose tissues induced by high-fat diet containing industrial trans-fatty .</a></h2><p>Consumption of industrially produced trans-fatty  (iTFAs) can result in alteration to lipid profile and glucose metabolism. Moreover, a diet high in iTFAs could increase the risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glucose and lipid metabolism are closely linked in white adipose tissue (WAT), yet the underlying mechanisms of the effect of iTFAs in WAT are poorly understood.Parameters of glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles and markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress of WAT were measured in rats maintained on a high-fat diet containing margarine (HFD-M) (n=10) compared to controls maintained on standard chow (n=10) over 16 weeks.Fat mass and body weight was significantly increased in rats maintained on the HFD-M compared to controls (<0.01). HFD-M rats had increased levels of insulin (INS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and serum lipid profile was significantly altered. The expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the phosphorylation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1-alpha and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were significantly increased in subcutaneous and retroperitoneal adipose depots of HFD-M-fed rats. In vitro, wider ER lumens were observed in 100μmol/L elaidic  (EA)-treated human mature adipocytes. We observed activation of ER stress markers, impaired INS receptor signaling and increased  in adipocytes after EA exposure. These effects could be alleviated by inhibiting ER stress in adipocytes in vitro.Collectively these data suggest that ER stress may be involved in INS resistance and lipid metabolism disorders induced by high-fat diet containing iTFAs. These findings suggest that WAT could be regarded as a key target organ for inhibiting ER stress to reverse the impaired INS receptor signaling, alleviate lipid metabolism disorders, and provide a novel approach to prevent and treat INS resistance and dyslipidemia-related chronic diseases such as T2MD and CVDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511221>[Risedronate inhibits rat bone marrow  and reduces RANKL expression in adipocytes].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effects of risedronate on bone marrow  and the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) in adipocytes in the bone marrow micro-environment.Primary cultured rat mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with or without adipogenic induction for 14 days were treated with 1, 5, 10, and 25 μmol/L risedronate.

Eight weeks later, the bone mineral density (BMD) of the rats and bone marrow histopathology of the femurs was examined to evaluate the effect of risedronate on the fat fraction in the bone marrow.Risdronate significantly inhibited adipogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs and suppressed RANKL expression in the adipocytes derived from the BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. In OVX rats, risdronate treatment significantly increased the BMD and decreased the fat content in the bone marrow.Risdronate can effectively inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs, decrease fat content in the bone marrow, and suppress the generation and function of osteoclasts by down-regulating the expression of RANKL, which can be an important mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of risedronate against osteoporosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31295363>Higher dietary protein intake preserves lean body mass, lowers liver lipid deposition, and maintains metabolic control in participants with long-chain fatty  oxidation disorders.</a></h2><p>Medical nutrition therapy for long-chain fatty  oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) currently emphasizes fasting avoidance, restricted dietary long-chain fatty  intake, supplementation with medium chain triglycerides, and increased carbohydrate intake. We hypothesize that increasing dietary protein intake relative to carbohydrate intake would preserve metabolic control yet induce physical benefits including reduced hepatic . Therefore, we compared two dietary approaches with similar fat intake but different carbohydrate to protein ratios in participants diagnosed with LC-FAODs. Thirteen participants were enrolled and randomized into either a high-protein (PRO) or a high-carbohydrate (CHO) diet for 4 months. Baseline and 4-month assessments included body composition, ectopic lipid deposition, and resting energy expenditure. End of study assessments also included total energy expenditure, metabolic responses to oral feedings, and whole-body fatty  oxidation capacity. At the end of the dietary intervention, both groups had similar energy expenditure, fat and glucose oxidation rates, and glucolipid responses to mixed meal and oral glucose loads. Neither dietary group experienced worsening symptoms related to their LC-FAOD. Compared to the CHO group, the PRO group exhibited increased blood levels of short-chain acylcarnitines, reduced intrahepatic lipid content, and maintained lean body mass while the CHO group lost lean mass. In patients with LC-FAODs, increasing protein intake maintained metabolic control, reduced liver fat without risk of metabolic decompensation, and helped preserve lean body mass. We propose that a modest increase in dietary protein along with fasting avoidance and fat restriction may improve body composition and energy expenditure in patients with LC-FAODs.© 2019 SSIEM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237701>The whole transcriptional profiling of cellular metabolism during  from hMSCs.</a></h2><p>Metabolism homeostasis plays an important role in progenitor-cell differentiation to adipocytes, but less is known about the whole transcriptional profiling of cellular metabolism during .

The rodent Slfn3 and its human analog Slfn12 are critical in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation. We sought to characterize intestinal function in Slfn3 knockout (KO) mice. Male and female pair-fed Slfn3KO mice gained less weight with decreased food efficiency than wild type (WT) mice, with more pronounced effects in females. RNA sequencing performed on intestinal mucosa of Slfn3KO and WT mice showed gene ontology decreases in cell adhesion molecule signaling, tumor necrosis factor receptor binding, and adaptive immune cell proliferation/functioning genes in Slfn3KO mice, with greater effects in females. qPCR analysis of fatty  metabolism genes, Pla2g4c, Pla2g2f, and Cyp3c55 revealed an increase in Pla2g4c, and a decrease in Pla2g2f in Slfn3KO females. Additionally,  genes, Fabp4 and Lpl were decreased and ketogenesis gene Hmgcs2 was increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Sequencing did not reveal significant changes in differentiation markers, so qPCR was utilized. Slfn3KO tended to have decreased expression of intestinal differentiation markers sucrase isomaltase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, villin 1, and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) vs. WT males, although these trends did not achieve statistical significance unless data from several markers was pooled. Differentiation markers, Glut2 and sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), did show statistically significant sex-dependent differences. Glut2 mRNA was reduced in Slfn3KO females, while SGLT1 increased in Slfn3KO males. Notch2 and Cdx2 were only increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Although Slfn3KO mice gain less weight and decreased food efficiency, their biochemical phenotype is more subtle and suggests a complex interplay between gender effects, Slfn3, and another regulatory pathway yet to be identified that compensates for the chronic loss of Slfn3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31369090>Overeating Saturated Fat Promotes Fatty Liver and Ceramides Compared With Polyunsaturated Fat: A Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty  (SFA) vs polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) may promote nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by yet unclear mechanisms.To investigate if overeating SFA- and PUFA-enriched diets lead to differential liver fat accumulation in overweight and obese humans.Double-blind randomized trial (LIPOGAIN-2).

We decipher the impact of short-chain CAD (SCAD) on adiposity and insulin resistance. BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases () gene. Adiposity, , and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high-fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. -deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced obesity results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in liver that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl-CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic  . Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC-ε activity and increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation in liver and skeletal muscle. Additionally, -deficient mice displayed significantly higher expression of the endoplasmic chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, which was further associated with the AKT activation in the primary hepatocytes.

Folic  was reported to be involved in lipid metabolism. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of folic  in reducing abdominal fat deposition. A total of 105 one-day-old healthy Arbor Acres broilers were randomly distributed into 3 treatments, including the control (Con), saline-perfusion group (NS), and folic  perfusion group (FA). The growth performance, biochemical characteristics in serum, and lipid metabolism in the liver and abdominal fat tissues were evaluated. Results have shown that folic  significantly reduced abdominal fat percentage (P < 0.05) and had no effects on BW, ADFI, ADG, and FCR (P > 0.05). Serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were lower in FA group but albumin concentration was higher (P < 0.05). Hepatic ACC, SCD, ELOVL6, PI3K, LDLR, HMGCR, and ABCA1 mRNA abundance were all down-regulated in FA group (P < 0.05) when compared with the Con and NS groups, while CPT1 and PPARα were not affected. In addition, MTTP mRNA abundance was higher in the liver of birds subjected to folic  (P < 0.05). There was no difference about TG deposition in the liver among all groups based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Oil Red O staining.

Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in 2-mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1.5 mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling  TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK-mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling  PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], , and gluconeogenesis. Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy-demanding pathways (, gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

This study was conducted to ascertain the relative level of expression of the FASN gene () in tissues from the yak (), and to search for variation in two regions of yak  using polymerase chain reaction single-stranded conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analyses; it also ascertains whether that variation is associated with yak milk traits. The gene was found to be expressed in twelve tissues, with the highest expression detected in the mammary gland, followed by subcutaneous fat tissue. Two regions of the gene were analyzed in 290 Gannan yaks: A region spanning exon 24-intron 24 and a region spanning exon 34. These regions both produced two PCR-SSCP patterns, which, upon sequencing, represented different DNA sequences. This sequence variation resulted from the presence of three nucleotide substitutions: c.4296+38C/T (intron 24), c.5884A/G, and c.5903G/A, both located in exon 34. The exon 34 substitutions would result in the amino  substitutions p.Thr1962Ala and p.Gly1968Glu if expressed. Four haplotypes spanning from the exon 24-intron 24 region to exon 34 were identified.

Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a newly identified adipokine, is potentially involved in lipid metabolism. Our previous study revealed that the ZAG content increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To clarify ZAG's possible effects on inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism, we used gene overexpression and knockout mice as models to investigate the function of ZAG during inflammation. The results showed that LPS increased plasma triglyceride, non-esterified fatty  and hepatic triglyceride, while ZAG overexpression decreased these effects. Furthermore, ZAG overexpression weakened inflammatory responses, suppressed , and improved mitochondrial function during inflammation. ZAG overexpression also increased β3-adrenoreceptor, protein kinase A, and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB), promoted the combination of CREB and CREB-binding protein (CBP), and competitively inhibited the combination of nuclear factor-κB and CBP. After ZAG knockout, LPS-induced the hyperlipidemia worsened. ZAG knockout aggravated inflammatory responses, promoted , and weakened mitochondrial function during inflammation.

This constraint is due to the fact that extrusion-based printing of synthetic polymers is commonly performed at very high temperatures in order to achieve desired mechanical properties and printing resolutions. Consequently, current methodology prevents printing scaffolds embedded with bioactive molecules, such as growth factors. With the wide use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine research, the integration of growth factors into 3D printed scaffolds is critical because it can allow for inducible MSC differentiation. We have successfully incorporated growth factors into extrusion printed poly (lactic-co-glycolic ) (PLGA) scaffolds by introducing dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for low temperature printing. Mechanical testing results demonstrated significantly different compressive and tensile properties for PLGA scaffold printed with or without DMSO. In particular, the PLGA-DMSO scaffold displayed a highly stretchable feature compared to the regular PLGA scaffold. The cellular response of growth factor introduction was evaluated  using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). By evaporating the DMSO after printing, we ensured that there was no cytotoxic effect on seeded hMSCs.

With the current study we aimed to verify the modulatory effect of endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1)-signaling on perilipin 2 (PLIN2)-mediated lipophagy. Here, we demonstrate that a global knockout of the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CB1) reduced the expression of the lipid droplet binding protein PLIN2 in the livers of CB1 and hepatitis B surface protein (HBs)-transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis. In addition, the pharmacologic activation and antagonization of CB1 in cell culture also caused an induction or reduction of PLIN2, respectively. The decreased PLIN2 expression was associated with suppressed  and triglyceride (TG) synthesis and enhanced autophagy as shown by increased colocalization of LC3B with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in HBs/CB1 mice. The induction of autophagy was further supported by the increased expression of LAMP1 in CB1 and HBs/CB1 mice. LAMP1 and PLIN2 were co-localized in HBs/CB1 indicating autophagy of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) i.e., lipophagy. Lipolysis of lipid droplets was additionally indicated by elevated expression of lysosomal  lipase. In conclusion, these results suggest that loss of CB1 signaling leads to reduced PLIN2 abundance, which triggers lipophagy.

It plays a master role in the differentiation and proliferation of adipose tissues. It has two major isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, encoded from a single gene using two separate promoters and alternative splicing. Among them, PPARγ2 is most abundantly expressed in adipocytes and plays major adipogenic and lipogenic roles in the tissue. Furthermore, it has been shown that PPARγ2 is also expressed in the liver, specifically in hepatocytes, and its expression level positively correlates with fat accumulation induced by pathological conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Knockout of the hepatic  gene ameliorates hepatic steatosis induced by diet or genetic manipulations. Transcriptional activation of  in the liver induces the adipogenic program to store fatty  in lipid droplets as observed in adipocytes. Understanding how the hepatic  gene expression is regulated will help develop preventative and therapeutic treatments for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have played a critical role in regulating the differentiation of BMSCs into particular lineage. However, the role of miR-149-3p in the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs has not been extensively discovered. In this study, we aimed to detect the expression levels of miR-149-3p during the differentiation of BMSCs and investigate whether miR-149-3p participated in the lineage choice of BMSCs or not. Compared with mimic-negative control (NC), miR-149-3p mimic decreased the adipogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs and increased the osteogenic differentiation potential. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of miR-149-3p repressed the expression of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene through binding to the 3' UTR of the FTO mRNA. Also, the role of miR-149-3p mimic in inhibiting adipogenic lineage differentiation and potentiating osteogenic lineage differentiation was mainly through targeting FTO, which also played an important role in regulating body weight and fat mass. In addition, BMSCs treated with miR-149-3p anti-miRNA oligonucleotide (AMO) exhibited higher potential to differentiate into adipocytes and lower tendency to differentiate into osteoblasts compared with BMSCs transfected with NC. In summary, our results detected the effects of miR-149-3p in cell fate specification of BMSCs and revealed that miR-149-3p inhibited the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs via a miR-149-3p/FTO regulatory axis. This study provided cellular and molecular insights into the observation that miR-149-3p was a prospective candidate gene for BMSC-based bone tissue engineering in treating osteoporosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo  and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519114>GS-0976 (Firsocostat): an investigational liver-directed acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</a></h2><p>:   (DNL) plays a major role in fatty  metabolism and contributes significantly to triglyceride accumulation within the hepatocytes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl CoA and is a rate-controlling step in DNL. Furthermore, malonyl-CoA is an important regulator of hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation through its ability to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. Therefore, inhibiting ACC pharmacologically represents an attractive approach to treating NASH. : This article summarizes preclinical and clinical data on the efficacy and safety of the liver-targeted ACC inhibitor GS-0976 (Firsocostat) for the treatment of NASH. In a phase 2 trial that included 126 patients with NASH and fibrosis, GS-0976 20 mg daily for 12 weeks showed significant relative reduction in liver fat by 29%; however, treatment was associated with an increase in plasma triglycerides with 16 patients having levels >500 mg/dL. : Preclinical and preliminary clinical data support the development of GS-0976 as treatment for NASH. ACC-induced hypertriglyceridemia can be mitigated by fish oil or fibrates, but the long-term cardiovascular effects require further investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472955>Vitexin alleviates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by activating AMPK in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a most common liver disorder characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver and currently there is no approved treatment for it. Obesity and diabetes being leading cause of NAFLD, compounds having anti-obesity activity and potential to reduce insulin resistance are considered suitable candidate for NAFLD treatment. In this study, we checked effect of vitexin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, on high fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. In presence of vitexin, significant reduction in body and liver weight, triglyceride and cholesterol content in serum and liver was observed. Serum Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were reduced significantly by vitexin which were elevated in HFD group whereas serum lipase activity remained unchanged. Vitexin suppressed de novo  by downregulating expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBP-α), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), Fatty  synthase (FAS) and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC). Additionally, it also enhanced fatty  oxidation and lipolysis by upregulating Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a) and Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Inhibition of  and activation of lipolysis and fatty  oxidation by vitexin was found to be mediated by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Vitexin also improved insulin signalling by activating insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and its downstream target AKT. AMPK activation of vitexin was possibly through binding of vitexin to leptin receptor (LepR) which was confirmed by molecular docking studies and by observed enhanced expression of LepR. Thus, we propose that vitexin alleviates NAFLD by activating AMPK possibly by binding to LepR.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-p70S6K-signaling kinases are known to drive feed-forward expression of SREBP-1c, the identity of the phosphorylated amino  residue(s) putatively involved in insulin-stimulated de novo  remains elusive. We obtained in silico and mass spectrometry evidence, that was combined with siRNA strategies, to discover that insulin-induced phosphorylation of serine 418, serine 419, and serine 422 in rat SREBP-1c was most likely mediated by p70S6 kinase. Here, for the first time, we show that insulin-induced phosphorylation of these 3 serine residues mainly impinged on the mechanisms of proteostasis of both full-length and mature SREBP-1c in the McArdle-RH7777 hepatoma cells. Consistent with this conclusion, nascent SREBP-1c, substituted with phosphomimetic aspartic  residues at these 3 sites, was resistant to proteasomal degradation. As a consequence, endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi migration and proteolytic maturation of pSREBP-1c was significantly enhanced which led to increased accumulation of mature nSREBP-1c, even in the absence of insulin. Remarkably, aspartic  substitutions at S418, S419 and S422 also protected the nascent SREBP-1c from ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation thus increasing its steady-state levels and transactivation potential in the nucleus. These complementary effects of p70S6K-mediated phosphorylation on proteostasis of pSREBP-1c were necessary and sufficient to account for insulin's ability to enhance transcription of genes controlling de novo  in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289228>Feedback regulation of Arid5a and Ppar-γ2 maintains adipose tissue homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Immune cells infiltrate adipose tissues and provide a framework to regulate energy homeostasis. However, the precise underlying mechanisms and signaling by which the immune system regulates energy homeostasis in metabolic tissues remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the AT-rich interactive domain 5A (Arid5a), a cytokine-induced nucleic  binding protein, is important for the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis. Long-term deficiency of Arid5a in mice results in adult-onset severe obesity. In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing Arid5a are highly resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Inhibition of Arid5a facilitates the in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and fibroblasts to adipocytes, whereas its induction substantially inhibits their differentiation. Molecular studies reveal that Arid5a represses the transcription of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (Ppar-γ2) due to which, in the absence of Arid5a, Ppar-γ2 is persistently expressed in fibroblasts. This phenomenon is accompanied by enhanced fatty  uptake in Arid5a-deficient cells, which shifts metabolic homeostasis toward prolipid metabolism. Furthermore, we show that Arid5a and Ppar-γ2 are dynamically counterregulated by each other, hence maintaining adipogenic homeostasis. Thus, we show that Arid5a is an important negative regulator of energy metabolism and can be a potential target for metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Multivariable logistic regression models with and without adjustment of insulin sensitivity were used to assess prospective associations of DNL fatty  with incident type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes incidence was 20.3% over 5 years.

A series of studies has questioned the ubiquity of  in parasitoid wasps suggesting that the vast majority of species have lost the ability to synthesize fatty  de novo. One such species is Nasonia vitripennis, which, like the congeneric species N. giraulti and N. longicornis, uses a fatty -derived male sex pheromone for sexual communication. Here we demonstrate by feeding fully C-labeled α-D-glucose and analyzing insect-derived fatty  methyl esters and the male sex pheromone by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry that both males and females of N. vitripennis as well as N. giraulti and N. longicornis are capable of synthesizing fatty  de novo. We furthermore show by a proteomics approach that predicted fatty  synthase, ATP-citrate synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, key enzymes of , are expressed in the male pheromone gland of N. vitripennis and N. giraulti. Labeling experiments with Urolepis rufipes, a closely related species producing a male sex pheromone independently of fatty  via the mevalonate pathway, revealed that both sexes are likewise able to synthesize fatty  de novo. We conclude that the parasitoid wasp species studied here, irrespective of the biosynthetic origin of their sex pheromones, are capable of responding flexibly to lipid shortage during their adult life by keeping enzymatic machinery for  running.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Pharmacological or bioactive food ingredients that suppress hepatic lipid accumulation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, which plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, are searched.It is found that tomatidine, the aglycone of α-tomatine abundant in green tomatoes, significantly inhibits palmitate-provoked lipid accumulation and stimulates phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) in human HepG2 hepatocytes. The results also indicate that tomatidine can enhance triglyceride turnover and decline in  by upregulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and downregulating fatty  synthase (FAS) via the AMPK signaling-dependent regulation of transcription factors, element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). Furthermore, mechanistic studies demonstrate that tomatidine-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation is due to CaMKKβ activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Finally, it is discovered that tomatidine functions as an agonist for vitamin D receptor to elicit AMPK-dependent suppression of lipid accumulation.The in vitro study suggests the potential efficacy of tomatidine as a preventive and therapeutic treatment in obesity-related fatty liver diseases.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We have previously shown that exercise may amplify energy expenditure through energetically expensive nutrient deposition. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exercise on hepatic de novo  (DNL) during WLM and relapse to obesity. Obese rats were calorically restricted with (EX) or without (SED) treadmill exercise (1 h/day, 6 days/wk, 15 m/min) to induce and maintain weight loss. After 6 wk of WLM, subsets of WLM-SED and WLM-EX rats were allowed ad libitum access to food for 1 day to promote relapse (REL). An energy gap-matched group of sedentary, relapsing rats (REL-GM) were provided a diet matched to the positive energy imbalance of the REL-EX rats. During relapse, exercise increased enrichment of hepatic DN-derived lipids and induced hepatic molecular adaptations favoring DNL compared with the gap-matched controls. In the liver, compared with both REL-SED and REL-GM rats, REL-EX rats had lower hepatic expression of genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis; greater hepatic expression of genes that mediate very low-density lipoprotein synthesis and secretion; and greater mRNA expression of , which encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of bile . Altogether, these data provide compelling evidence that the liver has an active role in exercise-mediated potentiation of energy expenditure during early relapse.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330134>AKR1D1 is a novel regulator of metabolic phenotype in human hepatocytes and is dysregulated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Steroid hormones and bile  are potent regulators of hepatic carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Steroid 5β-reductase (AKR1D1) is highly expressed in human liver where it inactivates steroid hormones and catalyzes a fundamental step in bile  synthesis.Human liver biopsies were obtained from 34 obese patients and AKR1D1 mRNA expression levels were measured using qPCR. Genetic manipulation of AKR1D1 was performed in human HepG2 and Huh7 liver cell lines. Metabolic assessments were made using transcriptome analysis, western blotting, mass spectrometry, clinical biochemistry, and enzyme immunoassays.In human liver biopsies, AKR1D1 expression decreased with advancing steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. Expression was decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes. In human liver cell lines, AKR1D1 knockdown decreased primary bile  biosynthesis and steroid hormone clearance. RNA-sequencing identified disruption of key metabolic pathways, including insulin action and fatty  metabolism. AKR1D1 knockdown increased hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation, insulin sensitivity, and glycogen synthesis, through increased de novo  and decreased β-oxidation, fueling hepatocyte inflammation. Pharmacological manipulation of bile  receptor activation prevented the induction of lipogenic and carbohydrate genes, suggesting that the observed metabolic phenotype is driven through bile  rather than steroid hormone availability.Genetic manipulation of AKR1D1 regulates the metabolic phenotype of human hepatoma cell lines, driving steatosis and inflammation. Taken together, the observation that AKR1D1 mRNA is down-regulated with advancing NAFLD suggests that it may have a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The Dysferlin null (Bla/J) mouse develops severe steatotic muscles upon aging. Here we report a marked increase in adipocytes, especially in psoas and gluteus, but not in soleus and tibialis anterior muscles in aged Bla/J mice compared to wild type mice. There is a robust upregulation in the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in  and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis pathways. Lipidomic analysis reveals that the increase in TAG is at the expense of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine. The adipocytes in steatotic muscles are extra-myocellular, as determined by the increased expression of caveolin1 (a cellular marker for adipocytes) and lipid-droplet protein, perilipin1. This increase in adipocytes occurs as a consequence of the loss of myocytes.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612177>Perigestational high folic : impact on offspring's peripheral metabolic response.</a></h2><p>Offspring of dams exposed to excess folic  during the perigestational period have been shown by us to be predisposed to metabolic dysfunction revealed by hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, increased insulin and decreased adiponectin in late adulthood. This work aims to characterize adipocyte phenotype and expression profile of genes in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in visceral adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. From mating until weaning, a recommended dose of folic  for pregnancy (C, 2 mg of folic  per kg of diet) or a high folic  dose (HFA, 40 mg of folic  per kg of diet) was administered to Sprague-Dawley females. At 10 months of age progeny were divided into groups fed the standard chow (C/STD and HFA/STD) and groups fed the standard chow plus drinking water with 10% fructose (C/FRU and HFA/FRU), as an additional metabolic challenge. Adipocyte morphology and quantification of key genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism were studied in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of 13 months old offspring. HFA exposure led to an enlargement of visceral adipose cells most likely mediated by an upregulation of lipoprotein lipase, and it tended to downregulate Glut4 in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Fructose exposure in a background of perigestational excess folic , but not in controls, induced an upregulation of  pathway genes and it decreased jejunal expression of the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft1). In addition, fructose exposure led to a downregulation of jejunal Sglt1 in control animals. Our data suggest that high folic  exposure during the perigestational period caused morphologic and genic alterations related to insulin resistant states indicating that this intervention may act as an effective programmer of long-term metabolic dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455870>Specific diacylglycerols generated by hepatic  stimulate the oncogenic androgen receptor activity in male hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Obesity-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more prevalent in males than in females, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

Here we investigated the role of hepatic , which is elevated in the livers of obese and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, in stimulating the AR pathway for the male preference of obesity induced HCC.Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a fructose-rich high carbohydrate diet (HCD) to induce hepatic . The effect of hepatic  on AR was examined by the expression of hydrodynamically injected AR reporter and the endogenous AR target gene; the mechanism was delineated in hepatoma cell lines and validated in male mice.The hepatic  induced by a fructose-rich HCD enhanced the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR in male mice, which did not happen when fed a high fat diet. This AR activation was blocked by sh-RNAs or inhibitors targeting key enzymes in , either acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunit alpha (ACCα), or fatty  synthase (FASN), in vivo and in vitro. Further mechanistic study identified that specific unsaturated fatty , the oleic  (C18:1 n-9), incorporated DAGs produced by hepatic  are the key molecules to enhance the AR activity, through activation of Akt kinase, and this novel mechanism is targeted by metformin.Our study elucidates a novel mechanism underlying the higher risk of HCC in obese/NAFLD males, through specific DAGs enriched by hepatic  to increase the transcriptional activity of hepatic AR, a confirmed risk factor for male HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384916>Chlorpyrifos exposure induces lipid metabolism disorder at the physiological and transcriptomic levels in larval zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used insecticide in pest control, and it can affect aquatic animals by contaminating the water. In this study, larval zebrafish were exposed to CPF at concentrations of 30, 100 and 300 μg/l for 7 days. In the CPF-treated group, lipid droplet accumulation was reduced in larval zebrafish. The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and pyruvate were also decreased after CPF exposure. Cellular apoptosis were significantly increased in the heart tissue after CPF exposure compared with the control. Transcription changes in cardiovascular genes were also observed. Through transcriptome analysis, we found that the transcription of 465 genes changed significantly, with 398 upregulated and 67 downregulated in the CPF-treated group, indicating that CPF exposure altered the transcription of genes. Among these altered genes, a number of genes were closely related to the glucose and lipid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, we also confirmed that the transcription of genes related to fatty  synthesis, TC synthesis, and  were significantly decreased in larval zebrafish after exposure to CPF.

The present study intended to reveal the effect and mechanism of AA on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with lipid accumulation by activating Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptors (LXRs) signaling. C57BL/6 mice were received a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet with 71% high-fat (L-D) and treated with AA (20 and 40 mg/kg) or equal volume of saline for 12 weeks. The regulation of AA on lipid accumulation was also detected in pro-steatotic stimulated AML12 cells with palmitic  (PA). When L-D diet-fed mice were treated with AA, loss in body weight, liver index, and liver lipid droplet were observed along with reduced triglyceride (TG) and serum transaminase. Furthermore, AA decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and target genes expression, regulated PPARα and PPARγ expressions, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis markers, enhanced hepatic FXR and LXR, and regulated AMPK-LKB1 and SIRT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, AA attenuated lipid accumulation via FXR and LXR activation in steatotic AML-12 cells, which was confirmed by guggulsterones (FXR antagonist) or GW3965 (LXR agonist). Activation of FXR and LXR signaling caused by AA might increase AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and then contribute to modulating lipid accumulation and fatty  synthesis, which suggested that activated FXR-LXR axis by AA represented an effective strategy for relieving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We thus generated fatty -binding protein 4 (Fabp4)-GDF5 transgenic (TG) mice and showed that GDF5 TG mice developed a relative lean phenotype on a high-fat diet (HFD) and showed increased insulin sensitivity. Over expression of GDF5 in adipose tissues greatly promoted the thermogenic process in sWAT after cold or β3-agonist treatment. In TG mice, sWAT showed an important thermogenic effect as the thermogenic gene expression was markedly increased, which was consistent with the typical features of beige adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of the protein GDF5 impaired browning program in sWAT after thermogenic stimuli. Enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) signaling was also identified in sWAT of HFD-fed GDF5 mice, and thermogenesis in mature adipocytes induced by GDF5 protein could be partly blocked by a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Taken together, our data suggest that GDF5 could improve insulin sensitivity and prevent metabolic syndrome, the adaptive thermogenesis in sWAT could mediate the obesity resistance effects of GDF5 in mice and partially resulted in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31360104>Specifically blocking the fatty  synthesis to inhibit the malignant phenotype of bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>Fatty  synthesis is regulated by transcription factors SREBPs and their escort protein SCAP.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on proliferating, differentiating and maturating human visceral pre/adipocytes (HPA-v). Three stages of cell culture were conducted under constant or variable glycemic conditions.  progress was assessed using BODIPY 505/515 staining. Lipid content typical for normal and hyperglycemic conditions of adipocytes was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and imaging. Expression of adipogenic markers, PPARγ and C/EBPα, was determined at the mRNA and protein levels. We also examined expression of miRNAs proven to target PPARγ (miR-34a-5p) and C/EBPα (miR-137-3p), employing TaqMan Low-Density Arrays (TLDA) cards. Hyperglycemia altered morphology of differentiating HPA-v in relation to normoglycemia by accelerating the formation of lipid droplets and making their numbers and volume increase. Raman results confirmed that the qualitative and quantitative lipid composition under normal and hyperglycemic conditions were different, and that the number of lipid droplets increased in (HG)-treated cells. Expression profiles of both examined genes markedly changed either during  under physiological and hyperglycemic conditions, orat particular stages of  upon chronic and/or variable glycemia. Expression levels of PPARγ seemed to correspond to some expression changes of miR-34a-5p. miR-137-3p, whose expression was rather stable throughout the culture, did not seem to affect C/EBPα. Our observations revealed that chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia change the morphology of visceral pre/adipocytes during .

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile  and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile  and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic  and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver. This study is of potential translational significance in determining the role of gut microbiota-mediated bile  metabolism in modulating diet-induced glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in the hamster.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569635> Wolf Extract Ameliorates Hepatic Steatosis through Regulation of Lipid Metabolism, Inhibition of ER Stress, and Activation of Autophagy via AMPK Activation.</a></h2><p> Wolf (PCW) is an edible, pharmaceutical mushroom with remarkable biological properties including anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-ageing, and anti-diabetic effects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)-palmitic and oleic -and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with , fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of -related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of lipid metabolism, inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246274>Postnatal triglyceride accumulation is regulated by mineralocorticoid receptor activation under basal and stress conditions.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) either enhance or reduce obesity in mammals, but limited information exists on the role of corticosteroid receptors in mediating the effect of GCs on lipid metabolism during postnatal development. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation leads to triglyceride (TG) accumulation post-feeding, whereas glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation reduces TG levels. The TG profile was inversely related to the lipoprotein lipase (lpl) transcript abundance, and this gene was downregulated by MR activation. Cortisol plays an important role in  during postnatal development in zebrafish, and this includes gene/pathway-specific signalling by GR, MR and GR/MR interactions. Ubiquitous MR and GR knockout in zebrafish provides an excellent model to study the mode of action of GCs in regulating lipid metabolism.Glucocorticoids (GCs) act through two receptors, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which differ in both their affinity to bind GCs and their function. As MR has 10-fold higher affinity for GCs compared to GR, it has been postulated that MR activation occurs at basal levels, while stress levels of these steroid hormones activate GR signalling. There is a growing body of evidence that both these receptors are involved in GC-mediated lipid metabolism. However, the role of GCs in  and lipolysis is controversial, as these steroids appear to both enhance and reduce obesity. As lipid synthesis is a critical part of early development, we hypothesized that both MR and GR contribute to lipid regulation by GCs during postnatal growth. Using MR and GR knockout zebrafish, we demonstrate that MR activation, but not GR activation, is involved in triglyceride (TG) accumulation during the larval development post feeding. Lack of MRs did not affect the gene expression of fatty  synthase (fas), or acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (dgat2), but increased lipoprotein lipase (lpl) transcript abundance. Activation of GR with exogenous cortisol decreased TG levels and increased lpl mRNA levels, but these responses require the presence of MR. Larval transcriptome revealed that MR was the primary regulator of genes involved in lipid synthesis, while GR activation favoured lipid catabolism. Our results underscore a key role for MR activation in mediating postnatal lipid accumulation, as well as cooperatively regulating GR-mediated lipolysis during postnatal stress.© 2019 The Authors.

Despite studies reporting potential interlinks between IDH2 and various diseases, there is lack of effort to comprehensively characterize signature(s) of IDH2 knockout (IDH2 KO) mice. A total of 6583 transcripts were identified from both wild-type (WT) and IDH2 KO mice liver tissues. Afterwards, 167 differentially expressed genes in the IDH2 KO group were short-listed compared to the WT group based on our criteria. The online bioinformatic analyses indicated that lipid metabolism is the most significantly influenced metabolic process in IDH2 KO mice. Moreover, the TR/RXR activation pathway was predicted as the top canonical pathway significantly affected by IDH2 KO. The key transcripts found in the bioinformatic analyses were validated by qPCR analysis, corresponding to the transcriptomics results. Further, an additional qPCR analysis confirmed that IDH2 KO caused a decrease in hepatic de novo  via the activation of the fatty  β-oxidation process. Our unbiased transcriptomics approach and validation experiments suggested that IDH2 might play a key role in homeostasis of lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422225>Galloyl esters of trans-stilbenes are inhibitors of FASN with anticancer activity on non-small cell lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Fatty  synthase (FASN) is a lipogenic enzyme that is selectively upregulated in malignant cells. There is growing consensus on the oncogenicity of FASN-driven  and the potential of FASN as a druggable target in cancer. Here, we report the synthesis and FASN inhibitory activities of two novel galloyl esters of trans-stilbene EC1 and EC5. Inhibition of FASN was accompanied by a loss in AKT activation and profound apoptosis in several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells at the growth inhibitory concentrations of EC1 and EC5. Both FASN and phospho-AKT levels were concurrently downregulated. However, addition of a lipid concentrate to the treated cells reinstated cell viability and reversed the loss of FASN and AKT protein levels, thus recapitulating the causal relationship between FASN inhibition and the loss in cell viability.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We hypothesized that dietary glycotoxins could impair hepatic lipid metabolism in obesity contributing to lipotoxicity-driven insulin resistance and thus to the onset of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In diet-induced obese rats with methylglyoxal-induced glycation, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography were used to assess liver composition in fatty acyl chains and phospholipids. High-fat diet-induced obesity increased liver lipid fraction and suppressed de novo  but did not change fatty  esterification and saturation or insulin sensitivity. Despite a similar increase in total lipid fraction when supplementing the high-fat diet with dietary glycotoxins, impairment in the suppression of de novo  and decreased fatty  unsaturation and esterification were observed. Moreover, glycotoxins also decreased polyunsaturated cardiolipins and caused oxidative stress, portal inflammation, and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-induced obese rats. Dietary glycated products do not change total lipid levels in the liver of obese rats but dramatically modify the lipidemic profile, leading to oxidative stress, hepatic lipotoxicity, and insulin resistance in obesity and thus contribute to the onset of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473320>Determining contributions of exogenous glucose and fructose to de novo fatty  and glycerol synthesis in liver and adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>The de novo synthesis of triglyceride (TG) fatty  (FA) and glycerol can be measured with stable isotope tracers. However, these methods typically do not inform the contribution of a given substrate to specific pathways on these synthetic processes. We integrated deuterated water (HO) measurement of de novo  (DNL) and glycerol-3-phosphate (GLY) synthesis from all substrates with a C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method that quantifies TG FA and glycerol enrichment from a specific [U-C]precursor. This allowed the [U-C]precursor contribution to DNL and GLY to be estimated. We applied this method in mice to determine the contributions of fructose and glucose supplemented in the drinking water to DNL and GLY in liver, mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT). In liver, fructose contributed significantly more to DNL of saturated fatty  (SFA) and oleate as well as to GLY compared to glucose. Moreover, its contribution to SFA synthesis was significantly higher compared to that of oleate. MAT and SCAT had lower fractional rates of total DNL and GLY compared to liver and glucose was utilized more predominantly than fructose for TG synthesis in these tissues. This novel HO/C integrated method revealed for the first time, tissue specific selection of substrates for DNL, particularly fructose in regard to glucose in liver. Also, this approach was able to resolve the distribution of specific FAs into the TG sn2 and sn1,3 sites. This stable isotope integrated approach yielded information so far uncovered by other lipidomic tools and should powerfully assist in other nutritional, pathological or environmental contexts.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Recent studies have indicated that the pomegranate (Punica granatum) seed oil (PSO) has many biologically active components that help in controlling diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. However, its impact on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HADMSC) remains unclear. Here we have attempted to study the anti-obesity potential of SHAMstat3pg, a fatty  composite extracted from PSO. It is composed of three dietary fatty : punicic  [(9Z,11E,13Z)-9,11,13-Octadecatrienoic ], oleic  [Cis-9-Octadecenoic ], and linoleic  [(9Z,12Z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic ]. In this study, we discuss the impact of the fatty  on , inflammation, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial ATP production. The impact of SHAMstat3pg on the expression of various obesity-associated protein and mRNA transcripts in HADMSC was also analyzed. The results indicate that exposure to 10 µg/ml of SHAMstat3pg (24 hr) inhibited  of HADMSC, ameliorated inflammation, attenuated ATP production, and glucose uptake. Also, the extract favorably regulated the mRNA expression of the studied obesity-associated gene transcripts. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: SHAMstat3pg has the potential to serve as a multi-targeted therapy for the management of obesity. This study demonstrated that the dietary fatty  inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes. SHAMstat3pg has also shown to have a favorable impact on the expression of the obesity-linked proteins and genes in HADMSC that are associated with , inflammation, satiety, energy intake/expenditure (central and peripheral signaling molecules).

What are the molecular underpinnings of seasonal metabolic plasticity during spring and autumn migrations in songbirds? What is the main finding and its importance? We report differences in mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of glucose and fat metabolism between photoinduced non-migratory and migratory states and between the spring and autumn migratory states. Higher expression of genes associated with fat mobilization and energy generation in the spring than in the autumn migration suggests differential activation of the metabolic pathways or alteration in the efficiency of existing functional machinery during annual journeys between nearly fixed destinations.The molecular underpinnings of metabolic plasticity underlying differential responses to spring and autumn migrations are not well understood. We investigated this by examining the differences in mRNA levels of metabolic genes in the liver, muscle and adipose tissues of night-migratory red-headed buntings between photostimulated non-migratory and migratory states and between spring and autumn migratory states. Buntings accumulated more subcutaneous fat and hepatic lipid, had higher body mass, larger adipose cells and higher circulating triglyceride and free fatty  levels and exhibited more intense Zugunruhe in the spring migratory state than in the autumn migratory state. More importantly, we found differences in the hepatic expression of pdc and pdk genes, indicating a differential acetyl-CoA requirement, and of the mdh and ogdh genes, suggesting differential oxidative phosphorylation between the non-migratory and migratory states and between the spring and autumn migratory states. Differences in fasn, bmal1 and glut1 mRNA levels were consistent with this and suggested seasonal differences in  and/or glucose uptake. Likewise, differences in mRNA levels of genes coding for lipases (atgl and lpl) suggested that adipose triglycerides and free fatty  serve largely as the metabolic substrate. Furthermore, changes in mRNA levels of genes coding for the fatty  binding protein (fabp3) and fatty  translocases (cd36) were consistent with differential fat fuel supply (via circulating free fatty ) to aerobically exercising flight muscles between the spring and autumn migrations. These results show seasonal adaptation of genetic pathway(s) underlying seasonal metabolic plasticity that seems to mediate differential responses to spring and autumn migrations in latitudinal migratory songbirds.© 2019 The Authors.

Variations in the 13C:12C ratio (δ13C) of palmitate (16:0) and linoleate (18:2n-6) were measured by CSIA.DHA supplementation reduced blood triglycerides (0.85 ± 0.04 mmol/L to 0.65 ± 0.03 mmol/L; P < 0.01), with no change seen with EPA supplementation.

The prevalence of CVD is closely linked to the prevalence of obesity because obesity is commonly associated with metabolic abnormalities that are important risk factors for CVD, including insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and type-2 diabetes, atherosclerotic dyslipidaemia, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Women have a more beneficial traditional CVD risk profile (lower fasting plasma glucose, less atherogenic lipid profile) and a lower absolute risk for CVD than men. However, the relative risk for CVD associated with hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia is several-fold higher in women than in men. The reasons for the sex differences in CVD risk associated with metabolic abnormalities are unclear but could be related to differences in the mechanisms that cause hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia in men and women, which could influence the pathogenic processes involved in CVD. In the present paper, we review the influence of a person's sex on key aspects of metabolism involved in the cardiometabolic disease process, including insulin action on endogenous glucose production, tissue glucose disposal, and adipose tissue lipolysis, insulin secretion and insulin plasma clearance, postprandial glucose, fatty , and triglyceride kinetics, hepatic lipid metabolism and myocardial substrate use.

Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD containing 0.2% or 0.6% PPF water extract for 8 weeks. PPF significantly reduced body weight, abdominal fat mass, serum glucose, alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and liver and spleen weights compared to the HFD control group. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that PPF suppressed lipogenic gene expression, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and -2 and fatty  synthase, and up-regulated the fatty  β-oxidation gene, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, in the liver.

This is explained by contributions of substrates other than exogenous glucose to DNL coupled with their extensive H-enrichment from HO prior to DNL.  Under such conditions, H-enrichment of fatty  from HO do not need correction.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422082>Double bond configuration of palmitoleate is critical for atheroprotection.</a></h2><p>Saturated and trans fat consumption is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Current dietary guidelines recommend low fat and significantly reduced trans fat intake. Full fat dairy can worsen dyslipidemia, but recent epidemiological studies show full-fat dairy consumption may reduce diabetes and CVD risk. This dairy paradox prompted a reassessment of the dietary guidelines. The beneficial metabolic effects in dairy have been claimed for a ruminant-derived, trans fatty , trans-C16:1n-7 or trans-palmitoleate (trans-PAO). A close relative, cis-PAO, is produced by de novo  and mediates inter-organ crosstalk, improving insulin-sensitivity and alleviating atherosclerosis in mice. These findings suggest trans-PAO may be a useful substitute for full fat dairy, but a metabolic function for trans-PAO has not been shown to date.Using lipidomics, we directly investigated trans-PAO's impact on plasma and tissue lipid profiles in a hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis mouse model. Furthermore, we investigated trans-PAO's impact on hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis progression in these mice.Oral trans-PAO supplementation led to significant incorporation of trans-PAO into major lipid species in plasma and tissues. Unlike cis-PAO, however, trans-PAO did not prevent organelle stress and inflammation in macrophages or atherosclerosis progression in mice.A significant, inverse correlation between circulating trans-PAO levels and diabetes incidence and cardiovascular mortality has been reported. Our findings show that trans-PAO can incorporate efficiently into the same pools that its cis counterpart is known to incorporate into. However, we found trans-PAO's anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects are muted due to its different structure from cis-PAO.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Clinical studies and animal models have shown a shift of gut microbiota from bacteroidetes to firmicutes in NAFLD patients and a diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that these 2 groups of bacteria may have differential effects on lipid metabolism in the liver, which further contributed to pathogenesis of NAFLD. To elucidate these effects, we inoculated two species of Bacteroidetes (B-group) or five species of Firmicutes (F-group) which were isolated from healthy individuals into germ-free mice. We found that the F-group induced elevated body weight, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis compared to the B-group under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The mRNA expression level of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) was elevated in the F-group compared to that in the B-group. Increased mRNA expression levels of fatty  synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were also seen under HFD conditions in the F-group compared to that in the B-group. In addition, the expression level of miR802-5p was only elevated in the F-group under HFD conditions. Taken together, our results suggested that these specific species of Firmicutes may induce more hepatic steatosis by modulating fatty  influx and  compared to those of Bacteroidetes.

Here we discuss the most recent progress and review studies highlighting both correlational and potentially causative role of BCAAs in the development of these disorders. Although we are just beginning to understand the intricate relationships between BCAAs and some of the most prevalent chronic diseases, current findings raise a possibility that they are linked by a similar putative mechanism.Copyright © 2019 Korean Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481463>Circadian rhythm-dependent induction of hepatic lipogenic gene expression in rats fed a high-sucrose diet.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome has become a global health challenge and was recently reported to be positively correlated with increased sucrose consumption. Mechanistic analyses of excess sucrose-induced progression of metabolic syndrome have been focused mainly on abnormal hepatic , and the exact contribution of excess sucrose to metabolic disorders remains controversial. Considering that carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms exhibit clear circadian rhythms, here we investigated the possible contribution of diurnal oscillations to responses of hepatic lipid metabolism to excess sucrose. We found that excess sucrose dose-dependently promotes fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in in rats fed a high-sucrose diet (HSD). We observed that excess sucrose enhances the oscillation amplitudes of the expression of clock genes along with the levels of hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related mRNAs that increase . We did not observe similar changes in the levels of the transcription factors regulating the expression of these genes. This suggested that the excess sucrose-induced, circadian rhythm-dependent amplification of  is post-transcriptionally regulated via the stability of metabolic gene transcripts. Of note, our findings also provide evidence that fructose causes some of the HSD-induced, circadian rhythm-dependent alterations in lipogenic gene expression. Our discovery of HSD-induced circadian rhythm-dependent alterations in  at the post-transcriptional level may inform future studies investigating the complex relationships among sucrose uptake, circadian rhythm, and metabolic enzyme expression. Our findings could contribute to the design of chrono-nutritional interventions to prevent or manage the development of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in sucrose-induced metabolic syndrome.© 2019 Sun et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263495>Probiotics for Alleviating Alcoholic Liver Injury.</a></h2><p>Many animal experiments and clinical trials showed that probiotics are effective for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise <0.1% of the tumor bulk and possess high self-renewal, tumor initiating properties, and are responsible for therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and tumor metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to understand the metabolic rewiring occurring in CSCs, especially their lipid metabolism, on which there have been recent reports. CSCs rely highly upon lipid metabolism for maintaining their stemness properties and fulfilling their biomass and energy demands, ultimately leading to cancer growth and invasion. Hence, in this review we will shed light on the aberrant lipid metabolism that CSCs exploit to boost their survival, which comprises upregulation in de novo , lipid droplet synthesis, lipid desaturation, and β-oxidation. Furthermore, the metabolic regulators involved in the process, such as key lipogenic enzymes, are also highlighted. Finally, we also summarize the therapeutic strategies targeting the key regulators involved in CSCs' lipid metabolism, which thereby demonstrates the potential to develop powerful and novel therapeutics against the CSC lipid metabolome.

Proinflammatory cytokine concentrations are increased in the early phase of the inflammatory response and during the early lactation period in cows. The aim of this study was to determine if ketoprofen treatment in the first days following parturition would decrease proinflammatory cytokine concentration and their correlation between lipid mobilization, ketogenesis and metabolic parameters in cows. The study was conducted on 30 cows divided into two groups of 15 cows each. The experimental group was treated with 3 mg × kg.bw.-1 ketoprofen for three consecutive days after parturition. The blood samples were collected on the first day of treatment and in the first and second week postpartum and they were analyzed for biochemical parameters such as non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), glucose, cholesterol and total bilirubine and inflammatory parameters such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). The results suggested that ketoprofen- treated cows had a significantly lower concentration of TNF-α, IL-1α, IFN-γ, NEFA and BHBA in the first and second postpartum week compared to the control group. Ketoprofen administration increased glucose levels (the first week, p⟨0.05), increased cholesterol levels (the second week, p⟨0.01) and decreased serum total bilirubin levels (second week, p⟨0.01) compared to the control group of cows. A positive correlation was found between TNF-α and NEFA and total bilirubin, significantly more expressed in the control than in experimental group of cows (p⟨0.01) and it was also found between IL-1α and NEFA (p⟨0.01). A negative correlation was found between TNF-α and glucose and cholesterol, significantly more expressed in the control than in experimental group of cows (p⟨0.01). A positive correlation was also found between IL-1α and glucose (p⟨0.01). Ketoprofen given parenterally to Holstein cows immediately after calving could reduce inflammation and decrease the relation between inflammatory response and  and ketogenesis in postpartum cows.Copyright© by the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31294974>Mechanistic Insight on the Mode of Action of Colletoic .</a></h2><p>The natural product colletoic  (CA) is a selective inhibitor of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which primarily converts cortisone to the active glucocorticoid (GC) cortisol.

However, data supporting IAA-mediated protection against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from an in vivo study is lacking. In this study, we assessed the role of IAA in attenuating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in male C57BL/6 mice. Administration of IAA (50 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection was found to alleviate HFD-induced elevation in fasting blood glucose and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index as well as plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity. Histological examination further presented the protective effect of IAA on liver damage induced by HFD feeding. HFD-induced an increase in liver total triglycerides and cholesterol, together with the upregulation of genes related to  including sterol regulatory element binding-protein 1 (Srebf1), steraroyl coenzyme decarboxylase 1 (Scd1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acaca), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, mitochondrial (Gpam), which were mitigated by IAA treatment. The results of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde (MDA) level along with superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content in liver tissue evidenced the protection of IAA against HFD-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, IAA attenuated the inflammatory response of liver in mice exposed to HFD as shown by the reduction in the F4/80-positive macrophage infiltration and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In conclusion, our findings uncover that IAA alleviates HFD-induced hepatotoxicity in mice, which proves to be associated with the amelioration in insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and oxidative and inflammatory stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525260>The homozygous variant c.245G > A/p.G82D in PNPLA2 is associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy phenotypic manifestations.</a></h2><p>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a familial cardiomyopathy featured by fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes. Responsible genetic factors are not discernible in approximately one-third of ACM probands. To investigate this further, we performed whole genome sequencing in 14 mutation-negative ACM probands who underwent cardiac transplantation, and we identified one ACM proband with a rare homozygous missense variant in PNPLA2 (c.245G > A, p.G82D), a rate-limiting enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty  and diacylglycerol. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that this missense variant may lead to loss of function and therefore impair lipid catabolism. Genetic screening in this proband's family also inferred that the homozygous variant cosegregated with disease. To validate the pathogenicity of this variant and confirm its association with ACM, we established a knockin mouse model carrying the orthologous human homozygous PNPLA2 variant. Interestingly, mice with the homozygous variant presented with arrhythmias and significant cardiac dysfunction at 12 weeks, whereas heterozygous mice were not affected. Moreover, those homozygous mice suffered sudden death and/or heart failure by the age of 14 weeks. Pathological examination showed that extensive  in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibrosis were prominent in the myocardium.

In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422916>Drosophila Snazarus Regulates a Lipid Droplet Population at Plasma Membrane-Droplet Contacts in Adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adipocytes store nutrients as lipid droplets (LDs), but how they organize their LD stores to balance lipid uptake, storage, and mobilization remains poorly understood. Here, using Drosophila fat body (FB) adipocytes, we characterize spatially distinct LD populations that are maintained by different lipid pools. We identify peripheral LDs (pLDs) that make close contact with the plasma membrane (PM) and are maintained by lipophorin-dependent lipid trafficking. pLDs are distinct from larger cytoplasmic medial LDs (mLDs), which are maintained by FASN1-dependent de novo . We find that sorting nexin CG1514 or Snazarus (Snz) associates with pLDs and regulates LD homeostasis at ER-PM contact sites. Loss of SNZ perturbs pLD organization, whereas Snz over-expression drives LD expansion, triacylglyceride production, starvation resistance, and lifespan extension through a DESAT1-dependent pathway. We propose that Drosophila adipocytes maintain spatially distinct LD populations and identify Snz as a regulator of LD organization and inter-organelle crosstalk.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The factors influencing adipose tissue-induced inflammation and the resulting pathophysiological events remain poorly understood. However, dietary fiber consumptions appear to be protective. Short-chain fatty  such as propionic  (PA) are the principal products of the dietary fiber fermentation by microbiota. Therefore, we aim to investigate the influence of PA on inflammation,  and glucose uptake markers from human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). We showed that the treatment of SAT with PA resulted in a significant downregulation of inflammatory parameters (e.g. TNF-α and IP-10) and macrophage markers (e.g. CD163 and MMP-9). The expression levels of PA receptors (i.e. G protein coupled receptor-41 and -43) in human primary adipocytes were very low in comparison with SAT and macrophages. Upon PA treatment, no anti-inflammatory effect was observed in human adipocytes. PA significantly upregulated the expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), sterol regulatory-element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4), which are associated with  and glucose uptake. We also showed that the observed anti-inflammatory effects of PA on SAT were partly mediated by Gi/o protein coupled receptor. Our data suggests that PA anti-inflammatory effects on SAT are mediated partly via Gi/o proteins, leading to the improved expression of factors associated with  and glucose uptake. These responses appeared to be not mediated by adipocytes; but most probably by macrophages. The current study provides new knowledge, which can be used as a potential new avenue for drug development in preventing obesity-related inflammation and metabolic disorders in future.

Our recent studies demonstrate important roles of kindlin-2 in regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and skeletal development. In this study, we generated adipose tissue-specific conditional knockout of kindlin-2 in mice by using Adipoq-Cre BAC-transgenic mice. The results showed that deleting kindlin-2 expression in adipocytes in mice caused a severe lipodystrophy with drastically reduced adipose tissue mass. Kindlin-2 ablation elevated the blood levels of nonesterified fatty  and triglycerides, resulting in massive fatty livers in the mutant mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Furthermore, HFD-fed mutant mice displayed type II diabetes-like phenotypes, including elevated levels of fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance, and peripheral insulin resistance. Kindlin-2 loss dramatically reduced the expression levels of multiple key factors, including PPARγ, mTOR, AKT, and β-catenin proteins, and suppressed adipocyte gene expression and differentiation. Finally, kindlin-2 loss drastically reduced leptin production and caused a high bone mass phenotype.

We found that p-synephrine suppressed the 3T3-L1 cell  by reducing the expression level of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which subsequently led to a reduction in the fatty -binding protein 4 (aP2) expression. p-Synephrine treatment markedly activated the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway and sequentially inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity. Inhibition of GSK3β activity by LiCl was found to partially ameliorate the above-mentioned effects. All these data suggested that p-synephrine exhibited the anti-adipogenic effects via the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the suppression of -related proteins. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Citrus aurantium often uses as herbal or dietary supplement in various countries around the world, including in Seville, Spain and South Africa. In traditional Chinese herbs, it is referred to as "Fructus aurantii immaturus," "Zhi shi," or "Zhi ke," and has been used for hundreds of years for various digestive problems. Its primary protoalkaloid, p-synephrine, exhibited lipolytic effects and energy expenditure, which has rapidly replaced ephedrine as an "ephedra-free" alternative dietary supplement. The current study firstly demonstrated the anti-adipogenic effects of p-synephrine in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which was due to the regulation of Akt signaling pathway and the subsequent suppression of -related proteins. The present study may offer invaluable opinions into the mechanisms of body weight/fat-losing activities of p-synephrine in theory, and scientific experimental evidence on dietary supplement in practice. p-Synephrine could be utilized for the preventive and therapeutic uses against metabolic syndrome.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422903>Acyl-CoA-Binding Protein Is a Lipogenic Factor that Triggers Food Intake and Obesity.</a></h2><p>Autophagy facilitates the adaptation to nutritional stress.

Importantly, ACBP levels were elevated in obese patients and reduced in anorexia nervosa. In mice, systemic injection of ACBP protein inhibited autophagy, induced , reduced glycemia, and stimulated appetite as well as weight gain. We designed three approaches to neutralize ACBP, namely, inducible whole-body knockout, systemic administration of neutralizing antibodies, and induction of antiACBP autoantibodies in mice. ACBP neutralization enhanced autophagy, stimulated fatty  oxidation, inhibited appetite, reduced weight gain in the context of a high-fat diet or leptin deficiency, and accelerated weight loss in response to dietary changes.

Their role in the reduction of lipid deposits in liver tissue is not unequivocal. CLA contain an equimolar mixture of two isomers of linoleic : trans-10,cis-12 CLA and cis-9,trans-11. Only one isomer - trans-10,cis-12 CLA exhibits fat-reducing properties, cis-9,trans-11 CLA does not. The main goal of this study was to determine if CLA isomers affect the activation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) in liver cells and tissue. FoxO1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulation of lipid and carbohydrates metabolism. In vitro and in vivo models of our study were HepG2 cells and C57BL/6J mice. Methods used in the study were qPCR - quantification of FoxO1 gene expression, Western blot - posttranslational phosphorylation of FoxO1, Oil Red O (ORO) - lipid staining and ELISA - quantification of apoB100. In both models trans-10,cis-12 CLA diminished FoxO1 gene expression: decrease by 44.1 ± 20.9% SD in the cells and 65.4 ± 29.8% SD in mice. The lowest accumulation of lipids (drop of 37.2 ± 1.7% SD) and the highest increase of apoB100 protein (74 ± 12.8% SD) were detected in the medium of cells cultured with trans-10,cis-12 CLA. Both isomers of linoleic  have different effects on lipid metabolism. Isomer c9,t11 CLA accelerates , whereas isomer t10,c12 CLA activates secretion of lipids in HepG2 cells. In contrast to the in vitro study, unfortunately this pro-health property of t10,c12 CLA was not confirmed in the in vivo model.

Its cellular and molecular investigation in humans is hampered by the limited availability of cell material and the heterogeneity of BAT between and within individuals. In this study, monoclonal lines of conditionally immortalized brown preadipocytes (iBPAs) of mouse and human origin were generated. Conditional immortalization was achieved by doxycycline-controlled expression of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (LT) with a repressor-based Tet-On system. In the presence of doxycycline, both the murine and human cell lines showed long-term proliferation capacity with a population doubling time of ~28 h. After switching off LT expression by doxycycline removal and exposure to adipogenic differentiation medium, cells from both species acquired brown adipocyte properties. This was evidenced by the accumulation of multilocular lipid droplets, the upregulation of brown adipocyte markers including uncoupling protein 1 and an increase in lipolysis and oxygen consumption following adrenergic stimulation. Switching off LT expression before the onset of adipogenic differentiation was only critical for inducing  in the human iBPAs, while their murine counterparts showed  upon exposure to the adipogenic differentiation cocktail regardless of LT expression. When switched to proliferation medium, cultures of adipogenically differentiated human iBPAs de-differentiated and resumed cell division without losing their adipogenic capacity. We suggest that iBPAs represent an easy-to-use model for fundamental and applied research into BAT offering unique experimental opportunities due to their capacity to switch between proliferative and differentiated states.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of zaluzanin C on differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.The cytotoxicity of zaluzanin C and its effect on cell proliferation was determined. For the induction of adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with differentiating medium containing 10 μg/mL insulin, 115 μg/mL methylisobutylxanthine, and 1 μM dexamethasone. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were subjected to Oil red O solution or used for Western blot analysis. Zaluzanin C was added to the cell culture medium at concentrations of 0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM.Zaluzanin C did not inhibit cell proliferation and showed no cytotoxicity at 10 μM concentration in 3T3-L1 cells. Therefore, concentration range of 0-10 μM zaluzanin C was used for subsequent experiments. Zaluzanin C inhibited accumulation of lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To understand the underlying mechanism of zaluzanin C, expression of  regulators was determined by Western blot analysis. Zaluzanin C suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression, an  related transcription factor, and inhibited aP2/fatty -binding protein-4 expression, a target gene of PPARγ. However, it did not affect expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha related with acquisition of insulin sensitivity.These data suggest that inhibitory effect of zaluzanin C on  of 3T3-L1 adipocytes could be partially caused by suppressing PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31379157>Role of Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase during Fatty  Accumulation in Oleaginous Fungus .</a></h2><p>In oleaginous micro-organisms, nitrogen limitation activates adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) and promotes  via the inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase.

Total fatty  content in the recombinant strain was 15.0-34.3% higher than that in the control, even though their biomass was similar. During the early fermentation stage, the intracellular AMP level reduced by 40-60%, together with a 1.9-2.7-fold increase in citrate content compared with the control, therefore provided more precursors for fatty  synthesis. Moreover, the decreased AMP level resulted in metabolic reprogramming, reflected by the blocked TCA cycle and reduction of amino , distributing more carbon to lipid synthesis pathways.

Under excess energy conditions, TG is synthesized by acylation of diacylglycerol (DG), whereas TG is broken down into DG and free fatty , which provide energy for mitochondrial lipid oxidation when needed. In this regard, DG is not merely an intermediate metabolite for TG metabolism; it also serves as a signaling molecule. DG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic  (PA). Consequently, DGK plays a pivotal role in the control of lipid metabolism and signal transduction pathway. Recently, a report has described that DGKε-knockout (KO) mice show expansion of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) together with the impairment of glucose clearance after short-term (40 days) high fat diet (HFD) feeding, an early presymptomatic phase of obesity in wild-type animals. Nevertheless, no report describes an investigation of their phenotype under long-term HFD feeding conditions. Remarkably, results obtained during long-term HFD feeding show that WAT mass is decreased significantly and that the blood glucose profile in response to glucose challenge is improved in DGKε-KO mice compared with wild-type, which contrast sharply against the phenotype shown for short-term HFD feeding. Morphological examination reveals that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular brown-like ("beige") adipocyte are induced in DGKε-deficient WAT after long-term HFD feeding, suggesting that beige adipocytes facilitate energy expenditure during prolonged HFD feeding. Administration of celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, abolishes the appearance of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes in DGKε-KO mice. These findings suggest that DGKε deficiency promotes visceral WAT remodeling in a COX-2-dependent manner under long-term HFD feeding conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We mutated proposed or characterized domains in the JMJD6 protein to better understand the requirement for JMJD6 in adipogenic differentiation. Mutation of JMJD6 amino  that mediate binding of iron and 2-oxogluterate, which are required cofactors for enzymatic activity, had no impact on JMJD6 function, showing that catalytic activity is not required for JMJD6 contributions to adipogenic differentiation. In addition, we documented the formation of JMJD6 oligomers and showed that catalytic activity is not required for oligomerization, as has been reported previously. We also observed no effect of mutations in the sumoylation site and in the poly-serine stretch. In contrast, mutation of the AT hook-like structure, which mediates interaction with DNA and/or RNA, compromised JMJD6 function by blocking its ability to interact with chromatin at genes that express regulators of . The ability of JMJD6 to interact with nucleic  may be a critical requirement for its function in adipogenic differentiation. The requirement for the AT hook-like domain and the lack of requirement for catalytic activity giving rise to the idea that co-activation of transcription by JMJD6 may be functioning as a scaffold protein that supports the interactions of other critical regulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678737>3D microtissue-derived human stem cells seeded on electrospun nanocomposites under shear stress: Modulation of gene expression.</a></h2><p>Different microenvironments trigger distinct differentiation of stem cells. Even without chemical supplementation, mechanical stimulation by shear stress may help to induce the desired differentiation. The cell format, such as three-dimensional (3D) microtissues (MTs), MT-derived cells or single cells (SCs), may have a pivotal impact as well. Here, we studied modulation of gene expression in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exposed to shear stress and/or after MT formation.Electrospun meshes of poly-lactic-co-glycolic  and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PLGA/aCaP) at a weight ratio of 60:40 were seeded with human ASCs as MTs or as SCs and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without chemical supplementation. After 2 weeks of static culture, the scaffolds were cultured statically for another 2 weeks or placed in a Bose® bioreactor with a flow rate per area of 0.16 mL cm min. Stiffness of the scaffolds was assessed as a function of time. After 4 weeks, minimum stem cell criteria markers and selected markers of osteogenesis, endothelial cell differentiation,  and chondrogenesis were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, cell distribution within the scaffolds and the allocation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry.MTs decayed completely within 2 weeks after seeding on PLGA/aCaP. The osteogenic marker gene alkaline phosphatase and the endothelial cell marker gene CD31 were upregulated in MT-derived ASCs compared with SCs. Shear stress realised by fluid flow perfusion upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 expression in MT-derived ASCs and in SCs. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of YAP expression was doubled under perfusion compared with that under static culture for MT-derived ASCs and SCs.Osteogenic and angiogenic commitments were more pronounced in MT-derived ASCs seeded on bone biomimetic electrospun nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP than in SCs seeded without induction medium. Furthermore, the static culture was superior to the perfusion regimen used here, as shear stress resulted in adipogenic commitment for MT-derived ASCs and SCs, although the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio indicated higher cell tensions under perfusion, usually associated with preferred osteogenic differentiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the study, the treatment of HLP on improving hyperlipidemia in rats was explored. Oral administration of HLP at 100 or 200 mg/kg body weight effectively alleviated serum lipid levels and liver histological abnormalities in high-fat-diet rats. HLP regulated abnormal mRNA, -related hormones and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-12) levels. HLP improved the ability of gut microbiota to produce short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). SCFAs have been found to ameliorate liver lesions. Therefore, HLP alleviated hyperlipidemia by improving the levels of SCFAs to regulate lipid metabolism. These results indicated that HLP could be used as beneficial polysaccharides to alleviate hyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31299104>Osajin displays potential antiprostate cancer efficacy via impairment of fatty  synthase and androgen receptor expression.</a></h2><p>Currently, antiprostate cancer (PCa) drugs, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), are initially effective; however, most patients with PCa who receive ADT eventually progress to deadly aggressiveness. There is an urgent need to seek alternative strategies to cure this lethal disease. Activation of  has been demonstrated to lead to PCa progression. Therefore, targeting the aberrant lipogenic activity could be developed therapeutically in PCa. The aim of this study is to investigate the molecular basis and efficacy of osajin, a bioactive prenylated isoflavonoid, in PCa.PCa cells, LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and C4-2 (androgen-insensitive/castration-resistant), were used in this study. Proliferation, migration, and invasion analyses were conducted by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, a wound healing assay, and the transwell method.  was determined by a Fatty  Quantification Kit and oil red O staining. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining, caspase enzymatic activity, and Western blot analyses.Osajin inhibited fatty  synthase (FASN) expression, a key enzyme for , in PCa cells. By inhibiting FASN, osajin decreased the fatty- levels and lipid accumulation. Significantly, osajin downregulated androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in PCa cells. Moreover, osajin suppressed PCa cell growth, migration, and invasion. Through activation of the caspase-dependent pathway, osajin induced apoptosis in PCa cells.These data provide a novel molecular basis of osajin in PCa cells, and cotargeting  and the AR axis via impairment of FASN and AR expression by osajin could be applied as a new and promising approach for the treatment of malignant PCa.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387306>High-Fat Feeding in Time-Dependent Manner Affects Metabolic Routes Leading to Nervonic  Synthesis in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in the liver. The disturbances in the fatty  composition of stored lipids are more important than the lipid species itself, which may influence the overall effect caused by these molecules. Thus, uncovering time-dependent changes in the fatty  composition of accumulated lipid fractions after a high fat diet seems to be a new marker of NAFLD occurrence. The experiments were conducted on high fat fed Wistar rats. The blood and liver samples were collected at the end of each experimental week and used to assess the content of lipid fractions and their fatty  composition by gas liquid chromatography. The expression of proteins from lipid metabolism pathways and of fatty  exporting proteins were detected by Western blotting. In the same high fat feeding period, decreased de novo , increased β-oxidation and lipid efflux were demonstrated. The observed effects may be the first liver protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity. Nevertheless, such effects were still not sufficient to prevent the liver from proinflammatory lipid accumulation. Moreover, the changes in liver metabolic pathways caused the plasma nervonic  concentration in sphingomyelin to decrease simultaneously with NAFLD development, which may be a steatosis occurrence prognostic marker.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430456>Pinolenic  ameliorates oleic -induced  and oxidative stress via AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Pinolenic  (PLA), a natural compound isolated from pine nut oil, has been reported to exert bioactivity against lipid anabolism. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms still poorly elucidated. The aim of this study is to comprehensively demonstrate the effects of PLA on oleic  (OA)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and their relationship with the lipid metabolic regulation. The results demonstrated that treatment with PLA dramatically inhibited lipid accumulation, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory responses induced by oleic  in HepG2 cells. PLA also obviously decreased the levels of cellular triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). As well as PLA stilled promoted the antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Furthermore, PLA could increase the expressions of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) to alleviate oxidative damage. It also could reduce -related transcription factors expression, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). PLA treatment resulted in increasing phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) expression. However, pretreatment with compound C (inhibitor of AMPK) inhibited the effect of PLA on promoting the expression of p-AMPK, SIRT1 and PPARα for lipolysis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PLA possessed the potential to prevent lipid accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cells via upregulating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, which supported the development of new drug candidate against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Serum lipids (406 from 18 classes) were quantified using mass spectrometry from baseline samples when iothalamate-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was at least 90 mL/min. Affymetrix GeneChip Array was used to measure renal transcript expression. DKD progression was defined as at least 40% decline in GFR during follow-up.RESULTSParticipants had a mean age of 45 ± 9 years and median urine albumin/creatinine ratio of 43 (interquartile range 11-144). The 32 progressors had significantly higher relative abundance of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) and a lower abundance of C16-C20 acylcarnitines (ACs) (P < 0.001). In a Cox regression model, the main effect terms of unsaturated free fatty  and phosphatidylethanolamines and the interaction terms of C16-C20 ACs and short-low-double-bond TAGs by categories of albuminuria independently predicted DKD progression. Renal expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-encoding gene (ACACA) correlated with serum diacylglycerols in the glomerular compartment (r = 0.36, and P = 0.006) and with low-double-bond TAGs in the tubulointerstitial compartment (r = 0.52, and P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONCollectively, the findings reveal a previously unrecognized link between lipid markers of impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation and enhanced  and DKD progression in individuals with preserved GFR. Renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation accompanies these lipidomic changes and suggests that it may be the underlying mechanism linking lipid abnormalities to DKD progression.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov, .FUNDINGNIH R24DK082841, K08DK106523, R03DK121941, P30DK089503, P30DK081943, and P30DK020572.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480627>Lyophilized Maqui () Berry Induces Browning in the Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue and Ameliorates the Insulin Resistance in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Maqui () berry features a unique profile of anthocyanidins that includes high amounts of delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside-5-O-glucoside and delphinidin-3-O-sambubioside and has shown positive effects on fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans and murine models of type 2 diabetes and obesity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo , fatty  oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein b (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling. Our evidence suggests that maqui dietary supplementation activates the induction of fuel storage and thermogenesis characteristic of a brown-like phenotype in scWAT and counteracts the unhealthy metabolic impact of an HFD.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty  9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic  did not alter de novo  but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and oleic  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678905>Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics reveals short-chain chlorinated paraffin-induced hepatotoxicity in male Sprague-Dawley rat.</a></h2><p>Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) used in various industrial applications have been listed as new POPs. Previous studies based on high-dose exposures indicate their hepatotoxicity. However, their mechanisms of toxicity or adverse outcome pathways and health risks remain largely unknown.This study aimed to evaluate metabolic consequences of chronic dietary exposure to SCCPs at low doses and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatotoxicity of SCCPs.A combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics, together with general pathophysiological tests were performed to assess the hepatic response of male rats exposed to SCCPs.Our results highlight two major modes of action: Inhibition of energy metabolism and activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Exposure to SCCPs suppressed oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and turnover of ATP-ADP-AMP and thus results in deficiencies of amino  and nucleotides in liver of the rat. Exposure to SCCPs affected expression levels of 13 genes downstream of PPARα that encode proteins associated with metabolism of fatty . As a result, peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, microsomal fatty  ω-oxidation, and  were accelerated.Results of this work strongly support the conclusion that low-dose exposure to SCCPs can result in adverse outcomes in the rat model. Significant SCCP-induced inhibition of energy metabolism occurs at environmentally relevant dosages, which suggests that SCCPs exhibit metabolic toxicity. Interactions of SCCPs with PPARα signaling pathway can explain the disruption of lipids and amino  metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased . The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and lipid-lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323923>Sub-Chronic Microcystin-LR Liver Toxicity in Preexisting Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Rats.</a></h2><p>Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is a hepatotoxic cyanotoxin reported to cause a phenotype similar to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a common progressive liver disease that advances in severity due to exogenous stressors such as poor diet and toxicant exposure. Our objective was to determine how sub-chronic MCLR toxicity affects preexisting diet-induced NASH. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of three diets for 10 weeks: control, methionine and choline deficient (MCD), or high fat/high cholesterol (HFHC). After six weeks of diet, animals received vehicle, 10 µg/kg, or 30 µg/kg MCLR via intraperitoneal injection every other day for the final 4 weeks. Incidence and severity scoring of histopathology endpoints suggested that MCLR toxicity drove NASH to a less fatty and more fibrotic state. In general, expression of genes involved in   and fatty  esterification were altered in favor of decreased steatosis. The higher MCLR dose increased expression of genes involved in fibrosis and inflammation in the control and HFHC groups. These data suggest MCLR toxicity in the context of preexisting NASH may drive the liver to a more severe phenotype that resembles burnt-out NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554925>Over-expression of miR-34c leads to early-life visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Overweight children and adolescents are at high risk for adult and late life obesity. This report investigates some underlying mechanisms contributing to obesity during early life in an animal model. We generated a strain of transgenic mice, cU2, overexpressing human microRNA 34c, a microRNA functionally implicated in . Male and female cU2 mice exhibit significant weight gain, accompanied by marked increase in abdominal fat mass and metabolic abnormalities, including reduction of both glucose clearance rate and insulin sensitivity, as early as two months of age.  derailment at this early age is suggested by decreased expression of adiponectin, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, and the adiponectin receptor R1, coupled with a reduction of the brown fat biomarker PAT2 and the  inhibitor SIRT1. Notably, adiponectin is an important adipokine and an essential regulator of glucose and fatty  homeostasis. cU2 mice may provide a crucial animal model for investigating the role of miR-34c in early onset insulin resistance and visceral fat mass increase, contributing to accelerated body weight gain and metabolic disorders. Intervention in this dysregulation may open a new preventive strategy to control early-life weight gain and abnormal insulin resistance, and thus prevalent adult and late life obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541119>2-Aminoadipic  (2-AAA) as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in childhood obesity.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is an important clinical feature of metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and type 2 diabetes. Increased adipose energy storage in obesity promote insulin resistance and other metabolic adverse effects. To identify a new link between adipocyte and insulin resistance, we performed targeted metabolite profiling of differentiated adipocytes and studied the association between adipogenic metabolites and insulin resistance. We found a correlation between 2-aminoadipic  (2-AAA) and adipogenic differentiation. Also, circulatory 2-AAA was positively associated with obesity-related factors (fat mass, fat percent, waist circumference, BMI, BMI z-score, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR) at baseline and after 2 years in the children cohort study. Of these factors, increased BMI z-score and HOMA-IR were the primary independent factors associated with higher 2-AAA levels, and the baseline 2-AAA level was an indicator of the BMI z-score after 2 years. To validate the relationship between 2-AAA and obesity-related factors, we analyzed changes in 2-AAA levels following obesity intervention programs in two independent studies. In both studies, changes in 2-AAA levels during the intervention period were positively correlated with changes in the BMI z-score and HOMA-IR after adjusting for confounders. Moreover, the 2-AAA levels were increased in cell and mouse models of obesity-related insulin resistance. Excess 2-AAA levels led to impaired insulin signaling in insulin-sensitive cells (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells) and caused abnormal gluconeogenesis.

Pearson correlations and principal component regressions were performed to find the contribution of phytochemicals and underlying mechanisms of action. Coffee husk and silverskin extracts were mainly composed of caffeine and chlorogenic . Major components in cocoa shell included theobromine and protocatechuic . Both coffee and cocoa by-product extracts effectively reduced inflammatory markers in macrophages and adipocytes (NO, PGE, TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-6) and the production of reactive oxygen species (21.5-66.4%). Protocatechuic and chlorogenic , together with caffeine, were suggested as main contributors against inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, extracts reduced lipid accumulation (4.1-49.1%) in adipocytes by regulating lipolysis and inducing adipocyte browning. Gallic and chlorogenic  were associated with reduced , and caffeine with adipocyte browning. Extracts from coffee and cocoa by-products also modulated the phosphorylation of insulin receptor signaling pathway and stimulated GLUT-4 translocation (52.4-72.9%), increasing glucose uptake.

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated mitochondria were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric  and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase-2 activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric , triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased liver de novo  program (fatty  synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation).

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during preadipocyte differentiation up to day 8 revealed 15,918 known and 586 novel genes. We detected 21, 144, and 394 DEGs, respectively, including 16 genes differentially expressed at days 2, 4 and 8 compared to day 0. Th number of DEGs increased time-dependently.

Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis obtained 26 clusters of differential gene expression patterns, and nine were significant ( < 0.05). Functional analysis showed many significantly enriched lipid deposition- and cellular process-related biological processes and pathways in profiles 9, 21, 22, and 24. Glycerolipid and fatty- metabolism, PPAR signaling, fatty- degradation, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), and TNF signaling were observed during preadipocyte differentiation in vitro.

The complex chemical mixtures that humans and wildlife are exposed to include a number of compounds that may have obesogenic properties. In this study we examined a mixture consisting of phthalate-monoesters, triclosan, and perfluorinated compounds. The mixture was designed within the EDC-MixRisk project based on serum levels of the compounds in pregnant women of a Swedish mother-child cohort. The compounds were negatively associated with birth weight of the children. We assessed whether developmental exposure to this mixture in combination with a calorie-rich diet affected metabolic rate, blood lipids,  and lipid storage, and the whole-body level of neutral lipids in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Wildtype zebrafish were exposed to the mixture from 3 h post fertilization to 5, 14 or 17 days post fertilization (dpf) at water concentrations corresponding to 1, 10, 20, or 100 times the geometrical mean of the serum concentration (hsc) in the women. Exposure to the mixture at 20 times hsc lowered metabolic rate at 2-5 dpf, and increased the number of adipocytes and the amount of visceral adipose tissue at 14 and 17 dpf respectively. Also, mRNA expression of fatty  binding protein 11a was increased at 17 dpf by 10 and 20 times hsc of the mixture. This study shows that a human-relevant mixture of environmental pollutants affects metabolic rate,  and lipid storage in young zebrafish fed a calorie-rich diet, thus demonstrating its potential to disrupt metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To date, the regulatory mechanism of tRFs governing fat deposition and  is completely unknown. In this study, high fat diet was employed to induce an obese rat model, and tRFs transcriptome sequencing was conducted to identify differentially expressed tRFs that response to obesity. We found out that tRF, which promoted preadipocyte proliferation by increasing expressions of cell cycle regulatory factors, had the highest fold change in the 296 differentially expressed tRFs. Moreover, tRF also suppressed preadipocyte differentiation by reducing triglyceride content and lipid accumulation, and by decreasing expressions of genes that related to fatty  synthesis. According to results of luciferase activity analysis, tRF directly targeted Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 9, KLF11, and KLF12, thus significantly suppressing mRNA expressions of these target genes. Moreover, tRF suppressed , accompanying by suppressing expressions of adipogenic transcription factors (, , and ).

Raw microarray data collected from these exposures were further analyzed using bioinformatic tools to generate a differentially expressed genes (DEGs) dataset associated with hepatic lipid dysfunction. Further analysis of the DEGs dataset resulted in 324 upregulated genes, and 275 genes that were down regulated. Meanwhile, 36 genes were either up regulated or down regulated in different chemical treatments. All identified genes were uploaded in the web application for Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for gene ontology enrichments and to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways. Some of the identified pathways included glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. The same DEGs dataset was also analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IPA identified several pathways including PXR/RXR activation, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, and xenobiotic metabolism signaling. Furthermore, the generated DEGs lists were uploaded into NCATS BioPlanet platform. Some of the identified pathways were related to fatty  omega oxidation, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, and . The enrichment and clarification of the pathways and biological networks obtained from the DEGs dataset provide prior knowledge on the underlying biological key events and molecular mechanisms for the computational development of putative adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for hepatic lipid dysfunction as a precursor to hepatic steatosis.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467530> Gene Affects  and Alters the Transcriptome Profile of Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have found an obesity-related single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10938397 near the glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 gene () encoding, an enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of the glucosamine-6-phosphate involved in the hexosamine signaling pathway, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the missing link between  and obesity remain elusive.As obesity is accompanied by an increase in the size and the number of adipocytes, the present study investigates the possible mechanism of the  in  using GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.We found that overexpression of  enhanced accumulation of lipid droplets, and knocking down the gene decreased accumulation of lipid droplets. GO term enrichment analysis indicated that most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) affected by deficiency of  have functions to lipid and glucose metabolism. Further KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the greatest proportion of DEGs are involved in thermogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, carbon metabolism, and fatty  metabolism including fatty  degradation, elongation, and biosynthesis.These findings suggest that  may be a critical gene for lipid and glucose metabolism, and the expression level of  alters the transcriptome profile of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408322>Deep Lipidomics and Molecular Imaging of Unsaturated Lipid Isomers: A Universal Strategy Initiated by mCPBA Epoxidation.</a></h2><p>Cellular lipidome is highly regulated through , rendering diverse double-bond positional isomers (C═C isomer) of a given unsaturated lipid species. In recent years, there are increasing reports indicating the physiological roles of C═C isomer compositions associated with diseases, while the biochemistry has not been broadly investigated due to the challenge in characterizing lipid isomers inherent to conventional mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. To address this challenge, we reported a universal, user-friendly, derivatization-based strategy,  (CPBA poxidation for ipid ouble-bond dentification), which enables both large-scale identification and spatial mapping of biological C═C isomers using commercial mass spectrometers without any instrument modification. With the developed liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomics workflow, we elucidated more than 100 isomers among monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty  and glycerophospholipids in human serum, where uncommon isomers of low abundance were quantified for the first time. The capability of MELDI-LC-MS in lipidome analysis was further demonstrated using the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing an insight into the cellular lipid reprogramming upon stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) inhibition. Finally, we highlighted the versatility of MELDI coupled with ambient mass spectrometry imaging to spatially resolve cancer-associated alteration of lipid isomers in a metastatic mouse tissue section. Our results suggested that MELDI will contribute to current lipidomics pipelines with a deeper level of structural information, allowing us to investigate the underlying lipid biochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630942>Novel anti-obesity peptide (RLLPH) derived from hazelnut (Corylus heterophylla Fisch) protein hydrolysates inhibits  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by regulating adipogenic transcription factors and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.</a></h2><p>Hazelnut proteins are an excellent source of bioactive peptides. Our previous study demonstrated that several novel peptides derived from Corylus heterophylla Fisch (C. heterophylla Fisch) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, we purified and identified anti-obesity peptides from hazelnut protein hydrolysates by chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Subsequently, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of the synthetic peptide on  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by Oil Red O staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. The results showed that a novel synthetic pentapeptide, Arg-Leu-Leu-Pro-His (RLLPH), derived from the C3 fraction, attenuated  by downregulating the expression of several mRNAs related to , including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty -binding protein 2 (aP2), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Moreover, RLLPH upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A stability study revealed that RLLPH was relatively stable during pepsin digestion. These findings suggest that RLLPH has potential anti-obesity effects and may help combat metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the anti-obesity effect and underlying mechanism of  extract (GPE) enriched in gypenoside L, gypenoside LI, and ginsenoside Rg3 and obtained using a novel extraction method. Five-week-old male C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet (CD), high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 100 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day GPE (GPE 100), HFD + 300 mg/kg BW/day GPE (GPE 300), or HFD + 30 mg/kg BW/day Orlistat (Orlistat 30) for 8 weeks. The HFD-fed mice showed significant increases in body weight, fat mass, white adipose tissue, and adipocyte hypertrophy compared to the CD group; but GPE inhibited those increases. GPE reduced serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, without affecting HDL-cholesterol. GPE significantly increased AMPK activation and suppressed  by decreasing the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c), PPARγ coactivator-1α, fatty  synthase (FAS), adipocyte protein 2 (AP2), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and by increasing that of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) and hormone- sensitive lipase (HSL). This study demonstrated the ameliorative effect of GPE on obesity and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492181>Adipokines secretion in feline primary adipose tissue culture in response to dietary fatty .</a></h2><p>Obesity in cats has been associated with alterations in adipokines including: adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  have multiple beneficial effects on obesity-associated disorders, and therefore may alleviate these alterations. This study aimed to determine the effects of body condition, fat depot, troglitazone, and different fatty  on secretion of adiponectin, IL6 and TNFα from adipose tissue of healthy cats. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue samples were collected from 18 healthy intact female cats, and body condition score (Range 3-7/9) was determined. Concentrations of adiponectin were measured in mature adipocytes cultures and concentrations of IL6 and TNFα were measured in stromovascular cells cultures following treatment with control medium, troglitazone at 10 μM, eicosapentaenoic , arachidonic , or palmitic , at 25, 50, or 100 μM.Stromovascular cells of visceral origin secreted higher concentrations of IL6 than corresponding cells of subcutaneous origin (P = 0.003). Arachidonic  treatment at 25, 50, and 100 μM increased IL6 secretion in subcutaneous (P = 0.045, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively) and visceral (P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) stromovascular cells. Eicosapentaenoic  treatment increased TNFα secretion in subcutaneous stromovascular cells at 25, 50, and 100 μM (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, and P = 0.015, respectively) and in visceral stromovascular cells at 50 μM (P < 0.001). No significant effect on medium adiponectin concentration was observed following troglitazone treatment (P = 0.4) or fatty  treatments at 25 (P = 0.2), 50 (P = 0.8), or 100 (P = 0.7) μM. Body condition score did not have significant effects on medium concentrations of adiponectin (P = 0.4), IL6 (P = 0.1), or TNFα (P = 0.8).This study demonstrated higher basal secretion of IL6 from visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue, a stimulatory effect of arachidonic  on secretion of IL6 and a stimulatory effect of eicosapentaenoic  on TNFα from feline adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547031> Root Extract Inhibits  by Promoting Lipolysis in High Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p> (AH) is widely consumed as a herbal medicine. It possesses biological activity against metabolic diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate effects of AH root water extract (AHR) on  in 3T3-L1 cells and in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. AHR inhibited lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation by downregulation of gene expression, such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and an adipogenic gene, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Oral administration of AHR significantly suppressed body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, serum leptin levels, and adipocyte cell size in HFD-induced obese mice. Moreover, AHR significantly decreased hepatic mRNA expression levels of cholesterol synthesis genes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBP)-2, and low-density lipoprotein receptor, as well as fatty  synthesis genes, such as SREBP-1c and fatty  synthase. Serum triglyceride levels were also lowered by AHR, likely as a result of the upregulating gene involved in fatty  β-oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, in the liver. AHR treatment activated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, which might have promoted HSL and LPL-medicated lipolysis, thereby reducing white adipose tissue weight. In conclusion, AHR treatment can improve metabolic alterations induced by HFD in mice by modifying expression levels of genes involved in , , and lipolysis in the white adipose tissue and liver.</p></html>
