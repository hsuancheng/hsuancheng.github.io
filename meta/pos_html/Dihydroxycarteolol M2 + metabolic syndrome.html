Thirty normal healthy adult volunteers of normal weight, 30 obese subjects, 20 obese newly diagnosed diabetics and 30 obese diabetics on Metformin were recruited for the study. Fasting blood samples were collected and PBMC were isolated from whole blood. Polarization markers (CD86, IL-6, TNFα, iNOS, CD36, CD11c, CD169, CD206, CD163, CD68, CD11b, CD16, and CD14) were measured by RT-qPCR. Gene expression fold changes were calculated using the 2 method for RT-qPCR.  Obesity and T2DM are associated an increased CD68 marker in PBMC. mRNA expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD169, and CD163 were significantly reduced in PBMC from T2DM subjects whereas CD11c was significantly inhibited in PBMC from obese subjects. On the other hand, macrophage M1-like phenotype was observed in T2DM circulation as demonstrated by increased mRNA expression of CD16, IL-6, iNOS, TNFα, and CD36. There were no significant changes in CD14 and CD86 in the obese and T2DM when compared to the lean subjects. Metformin treatment in T2DM reverted CD11c, CD169, IL-6, iNOS, TNFα, and CD36 to levels comparable to lean subjects. CD206 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in PBMC of T2DM while Metformin treatment inhibited CD206 expression levels.  These data support the notion that PBMC in circulation in T2DM express different pattern of phenotypic markers than the patterns typically present in M1 and  like cells. These phenotypic markers could be representative of metabolically activated macrophages (MMe)-like cells. Metformin, on the other hand, reduces MMe-like cells in circulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678388>Overweight as an Additional Risk Factor for Colorectal Neoplasia in Lean Population</a></h2><p>Overweight in Thailand is not as common as in Western countries. We sought to evaluate overweight as the additional risk factor that can increase the prediction of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) detection in Thais apart from the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score.We prospectively enrolled asymptomatic 338 subjects who underwent screening colonoscopy between November 2016 and September 2017. All risk factors according to APCS, BMI and the presence of  were collected. Overweight was defined as BMI ≥23 kg/. By APCS score, subjects were categorized into 1) high-risk and 2) average-risk. Using the combination of APCS score and overweight, subjects were stratified into 4 groups; high-risk with overweight (G1), average-risk with overweight (G2), high-risk with normal weight (G3) average-risk and with normal weight (G4). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of detecting CRN.The prevalence of CRN in the high-risk subjects was higher than that of in the average-risk subjects (49%vs.32%; OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.17-3.41). After adjustment for APCS risk factors and , overweight significantly increased the risk of detecting CRN (OR, 2.52; 95%CI, 1.57-4.05). Among the 4 groups, the detection rates of CRN were significantly different (G1=64%, G2=40%, G3=32% and G4=21%, p<0.01). The relative risk of detecting CRN increased when G1 (OR 6.49; 95%CI, 2.87-14.67), and G2 (2.42; 1.39-4.21) were compared with G4.In addition to the APCS score, overweight is an independent risk factor for detecting CRN. In Thai population, combining overweight and APCS score may be useful to improve the prediction for CRN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685366>Identifying quality-markers from Shengmai San protects against transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease using chinmedomics approach.</a></h2><p>Shengmai San (SMS), a Chinese classic herbal formula, has been widely used for the treatment of Qi-Yin deficiency  in Asia. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that SMS improves the cognitive function. However, the quality markers (Q-markers) for SMS still need further research.Using chinmedocmics strategy to systematically evaluate the efficacy of SMS in the treatment of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to discover the efficacy-related Q-markers.The effect of SMS on APP/PS1 mice was evaluated by behavioral test, immunohistochemistry and urine  profile, and the urine marker metabolites associated with SMS treatment of AD were characterized using metabolomics method. In the premise of efficacy, Serum Pharmacochemistry of Traditional Chinese Medicine was applied to investigate the in vivo constituents of SMS. A correlation analysis between marker metabolites of therapeutic effects and serum constituents was completed by chinmedomics approach.SMS had a therapeutic effect on APP/PS1 mice, and 34 potential urine biomarkers were reversed by SMS treatment. A total of 17 in vivo constituents were detected, including 14 prototype components and 3 metabolites. The correlation analysis showed that eight constituents were extremely correlated with protective effects of SMS in AD, and considered as potential Q-markers of SMS, including schisandrin, isoschisandrin, angeloylgomisin Q, gomisin D, angeloylgomisin H, gomisin , ginsenoside F1, 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3.This study has demonstrated that chinmedomics is novel strategy for discovering the potential effective constituents from herbal formula, which are recognized as Q-markers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the impact of GHD and GH treatment on low-grade inflammation is unknown. The aim of the study was to establish the level of the low-grade inflammation biomarker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in adults with GHD and the response to long-term GH treatment. Measurements of suPAR and CRP were performed in bio-bank serum samples from 72 adults, 34 males and 38 females, with GHD before and during at least 5 years of GH treatment. Mean age was 52.5 ± 15.5 years, BMI 27.3 ± 5 kg/. Clinical evaluations and blood sampling were performed at routine visits. Data on demography, anthropometry, lab results and clinical events were retrieved from post-marketing surveillance study databases and medical records. suPAR and high-sensitive (hs) CRP were analysed using ELISA and immunochemistry, respectively. At baseline blood pressure, lipid profile and fasting glucose were within the normal reference range. Baseline geometric mean and 95% CI of suPAR was 2.9 (2.7-3.3) ng/mL and of CRP 2.3 (0.6-4.0) mg/L. Mean follow-up was 8 ± 2 years. The suPAR levels remained stable during follow-up, although individual increases were seen on occurrence or presence of co-morbidities. In contrast, levels of CRP decreased. In conclusion, the decrease in CRP and indirectly the absence of an expected increase in suPAR over time indicates a favourable effect of GH on low-grade inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28423036>, serum uric acid and renal risk in patients with T2D.</a></h2><p> (Mets) and increased serum uric acid (SUA), are well known renal risk predictors and often coexist in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whether they independently contribute to the onset of CKD is at present unclear.Within the AMD Annals database we identified patients with T2D and normal renal function and urine albumin excretion at baseline and regular follow-up visits during a 4-year period. Blood pressure, BMI, HDL, triglycerides, and SUA were available in 14,267 patients. The association between Mets and/or hyperuricemia (HU, top fifth gender specific quintile) and the occurrence of renal outcomes were evaluated.At baseline 59% of patients (n = 8,408) showed Mets and 18% (n = 2,584) HU. Over the 4-year follow-up, 14% (n = 1,990) developed low eGFR (i.e. below 60 mL/min/1.73 ), and 26% (n = 3,740) albuminuria. After adjustment for confounders, BP≥130/85, low HDL, triglycerides ≥150 and HU were independently related to the development of low eGFR (1.57, P<0.001; 1.13, P = 0.056; 1.18, P = 0.008; 1.26, P = 0.001) and of albuminuria (1.35, P<0.001; 1.18, P = 0.001; 1.15, P = 0.002; 1.24, P = 0.001), respectively. The incidence of low eGFR was higher in patients with HU independent of the presence or absence of Mets (21%, OR 1.30, p = 0.009 and 20%, 1.57, p<0.000 respectively), while albuminuria occurred more frequently in those with Mets and HU (32%, OR 1.25, p = 0.005) as compared to the reference group.HU and Mets are independent predictors of CKD and its individual components in patients with T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352392>Kallmann  and ichthyosis: a case of contiguous gene deletion .</a></h2><p>Kallmann  is a genetically heterogeneous form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency and characterized by anosmia or hyposmia due to hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs; osteoporosis and  can develop due to longstanding untreated hypogonadism. Kallmann  affects 1 in 10 000 men and 1 in 50 000 women. Defects in 17 genes, including KAL1, have been implicated. Kallmann  can be associated with X-linked ichthyosis, a skin disorder characterized by early onset dark, dry, irregular scales affecting the limb and trunk, caused by a defect of the steroid sulfatase gene (STS). Both KAL1 and STS are located in the Xp22.3 region; therefore, deletions in this region cause a contiguous gene . We report the case of a 32-year-old man with ichthyosis referred for evaluation of excessive height (2.07 m) and weight (BMI: 29.6 kg/), microgenitalia and absence of secondary sex characteristics. We diagnosed Kallmann  with ichthyosis due to a deletion in Xp22.3, a rare phenomenon. Learning points: Kallmann  is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with anosmia or hyposmia associated with defects in the production or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs. Several genes have been implicated in Kallmann , including KAL1, located in the Xp22.3 region, which is responsible for X-linked Kallmann . KAL1 encodes the protein anosmin-1. X-linked ichthyosis is caused by deficiency of the steroid sulfatase enzyme, encoded by STS, which is also located in the Xp22.3 region. Deletions involving this region can affect both genes and result in contiguous gene syndromes. Phenotype can guide clinicians toward suspicion of a specific genetic mutation. KAL1 mutations are mostly related to microgenitalia, unilateral renal agenesis and synkinesia, although patients need not present all these abnormalities. Longstanding untreated hypogonadism is associated with poor sexual health, osteoporosis and  with the concomitant risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Treatment aims to promote the development of secondary sex characteristics, build and sustain normal bone and muscle mass and restore fertility. Treatment can also help minimize some psychological consequences. Treatments available for patients with congenital GnRH deficiency such as Kallmann  include gonadal steroid hormones, human gonadotropins and GnRH. The choice of therapy depends on the goal or goals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697714>Association Between Overweight and Renal Transplant Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>As the demand for kidney transplant allografts has increased, many centers are expanding the upper limit of acceptable body mass index for kidney donors. However, obesity is a risk factor for developing renal disease. Our goal was to quantify body mass index trends in donor nephrectomy patients and to institute nutrition counseling to promote sustainable weight loss to reduce the risk of -derived renal dysfunction.Ninety patients who underwent donor nephrectomy between 2007 and 2012 consented to having height and weight data collected at multiple time points. After data collection, each patient underwent a standardized nutrition counseling session. One year later, body mass index was reassessed.Preoperatively, 52% of the patients were overweight or obese. The percentage of overweight and obese patients remained stable for 2 years after surgery. However, at 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery, these rates increased to 59%, 69%, and 91%. Each patient was counseled about obesity-related comorbidities and provided information about lifestyle modification. One year later, 94% of previously overweight patients and 82% of previously obese patients had a decrease in mean body mass index from 27.2 ± 4.0 kg/ to 25.1 ± 3.6 kg/.Living-donor nephrectomy patients are at risk of developing obesity, similar to the adult population. Nutrition counseling may be beneficial to help normalize body mass index in patients who have become overweight or obese to potentially prevent obesity-related comorbidities. All patients were evaluated by a nutrition specialist after surgery to review our donor nephrectomy nutrition brochure. Body mass index monitoring and primary care follow-up appear to be appropriate surveillance methods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29131248>Body mass index and  impact differently on major clinical events in renal transplant patients.</a></h2><p>Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are bound to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD), and obesity represents a well-known risk factor for CVD. It has been reported that the  (MetS) is a frequent finding in KTRs, and MetS could develop even if body mass index (BMI) is only mildly increased. We compared the impact of BMI and MetS on the development of major clinical events (MCEs) in a cohort of 107 KTRs during a follow-up of 63 ± 31 months.Clinical characteristics were recorded at the time of enrollment and patients were classified on the basis of MCEs development. In a Cox model, MCEs were the dependent variable while age, sex, history of CVD, glomerular filtration rate, length of dialysis pre-transplantation, BMI classes and diagnosis of MetS were independent variables. Patients were classified into 3 groups: normal (BMI < 25 kg/), overweight (BMI of 25 to 30 kg/) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/).During follow-up, 55 MCEs were recorded: 16 patients died (15%), 19 (18%) had major cardiovascular events (CVEs), and 20 (19%) started dialysis due to graft failure. KTRs who had MCEs (n = 42) were older, had a lower renal function, longer dialysis vintage pre-transplantation, higher prevalence of history of CVD and higher BMI than those without MCEs. Cox regression analysis showed that length of dialysis pre-transplantation, renal function, previous CVD, and BMI classes (overweight and obesity) were related to MCEs.BMI, but not MetS, predicted MCEs in KTRs as well as non-traditional CVD risk factors such as length of dialysis pre-transplantation and graft function. Thus, a simple evaluation during clinic visits could identify KTRs at high risk for MCEs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773586>Diets Enriched with Conventional or High-Oleic Acid Canola Oils Lower Atherogenic Lipids and Lipoproteins Compared to a Diet with a Western Fatty Acid Profile in Adults with Central Adiposity.</a></h2><p>Novel oils high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are an alternative to partially hydrogenated oils high in trans-unsaturated fatty acids. There is widespread use of high-MUFA oils across the food industry; however, limited knowledge of their cardiovascular impact exists.We investigated the effects of diets containing canola oil, high-oleic acid canola oil (HOCO), and a control oil blend (diet formulated to emulate a Western fat profile) on lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apos), as secondary outcomes of the trial.In a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, 3-period crossover, controlled feeding trial, men (n = 44) and women (n = 75) with a mean age of 44 y, mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/) of 31.7, and an increased waist circumference plus ≥1  criteria consumed prepared, weight-maintenance diets containing canola oil [17.5% MUFAs, 9.2% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), 6.6% SFAs], HOCO (19.1% MUFAs, 7.0% PUFAs, 6.4% SFAs), or control oil (10.5% MUFAs, 10.0% PUFAs, 12.3% SFAs) for 6 wk with ≥4-wk washouts. Fasting serum lipids were assessed at baseline and 6 wk. Diet effects were examined using a repeated measures mixed model.Compared with the control, canola and HOCO diets resulted in lower endpoint total cholesterol (TC; -4.2% and -3.4%; P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (-6.6% and -5.6%; P < 0.0001), apoB (-3.7% and -3.4%; P = 0.002), and non-HDL cholesterol (-4.5% and -4.0%; P = 0.001), with no differences between canola diets. The TC:HDL cholesterol and apoB:apoA1 ratios were lower after the HOCO diet than after the control diet (-3.7% and -3.4%, respectively). There were no diet effects on triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, or apoA1 concentrations.HOCO, with increased MUFAs at the expense of decreased PUFAs, elicited beneficial effects on lipids and lipoproteins comparable to conventional canola oil and consistent with reduced cardiovascular disease risk in adults with central adiposity.

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea  (OSAS) has been recently reported to have cancer-promoting effects. The aim of our study was to observe the effect of OSAS on serum levels of CEA in patients with T2DM. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 401 T2DM patients in this study. There were 244 patients with OSAS and 157 patients without OSAS. RESULTS The CEA level in T2DM patients with OSAS was higher than that in those without OSAS (p<0.05). The participants with AHI scores ≥30 had higher CEA levels than those with 5≤ AHI scores <30 (p<0.05). The AHI score and ODI score were independently associated with increased risk of high CEA level in T2DM patients (odds ratio [OR]=1.052, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011~1.095) and (OR=1.214, 95% CI: 1.070~1.377). Moreover, among male T2DM patients, the AHI score and ODI score had a linear correlation with the CEA level; this association was also observed in T2DM patients who smoked, had an HbA1c level ≥7%, or had a BMI ≥28 kg/ (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The AHI score and ODI score were positively associated with the CEA level in T2DM patients. The relationship was stronger in male T2DM patients and in those who smoked, were obese, or had poor glycemic control. The mechanism may be related to  disorders, and the potential increased risk of colorectal cancer should be investigated in a prospective study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29324776>Effect of a lifestyle intervention in obese infertile women on cardiometabolic health and quality of life: A randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of obesity, an important cardiometabolic risk factor, is rising in women. Lifestyle improvements are the first step in treatment of obesity, but the success depends on factors like timing and motivation. Women are especially receptive to advice about lifestyle before and during pregnancy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the pre-pregnancy period provides the perfect window of opportunity to improve cardiometabolic health and quality of life of obese infertile women, by means of a lifestyle intervention.Between 2009-2012, 577 infertile women between 18 and 39 years of age, with a Body Mass Index of ≥ 29 kg/, were randomized to a six month lifestyle intervention preceding infertility treatment, or to direct infertility treatment. The goal of the intervention was 5-10% weight loss or a BMI < 29 kg/. Cardiometabolic outcomes included weight, waist- and hip circumference, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, lipids and . All outcomes were measured by research nurses at randomization, 3 and 6 months. Self-reported quality of life was also measured at 12 months. Three participants withdrew their informed consent, and 63 participants discontinued the intervention program. Intention to treat analysis was conducted. Mixed effects regression models analyses were performed. Results are displayed as estimated mean differences between intervention and control group. Weight (-3.1 kg 95% CI: -4.0 to -2.2 kg; P < .001), waist circumference (-2.4 cm 95% CI: -3.6 to -1.1 cm; P < .001), hip circumference (-3.0 95% CI: -4.2 to -1.9 cm; P < .001), BMI (-1.2 kg/ 95% CI: -1.5 to -0.8 kg/; P < .001), systolic blood pressure (-2.8 mmHg 95% CI: -5.0 to -0.7 mmHg; P = .01) and HOMA-IR (-0.5 95% CI: -0.8 to -0.1; P = .01) were lower in the intervention group compared to controls. Hs-CRP and lipids did not differ between groups. The odds ratio for  in the intervention group was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.85; P < .01) compared to controls. Physical QoL scores were higher in the lifestyle intervention group (2.2 95% CI: 0.9 to 3.5; P = .001) while mental QoL scores did not differ.In obese infertile women, a lifestyle intervention prior to infertility treatment improves cardiometabolic health and self-reported physical quality of life (LIFEstyle study: Netherlands Trial Register: NTR1530).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30328946>Serum Uric Acid Levels are Associated with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Healthy Young and Middle-Aged Adults.</a></h2><p>Observational studies have highlighted an association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the growing body of evidences, several studies were conducted in older individuals or in carriers of diseases susceptible to affect SUA levels and cardiometabolic risk markers.To evaluate the relationship of SUA with body adiposity,  profile, oxidative stress, inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure and endothelial function in healthy young and middle-aged adults.149 Brazilian adults aged 20-55 years, both sexes, underwent evaluation of body adiposity, SUA, fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile, malondialdehyde (MDA), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, blood pressure and endothelial function. Endothelial function was assessed by the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) derived from peripheral arterial tonometry method. Participants were allocated in two groups according to SUA levels: control group (CG; n = 130; men ≤ 7 mg/dL, women ≤ 6 mg/dL) and hyperuricemia group (HG; n = 19; men > 7 mg/dL, women > 6 mg/dL). A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.After adjustment for confounders, participants in HG compared with those in CG displayed higher body mass index (BMI): 34.15(33.36-37.19) vs.31.80 (26.26-34.42) kg/,p = 0.008, higher MDA: 4.67(4.03-5.30) vs. 3.53(3.10-4.07) ng/mL, p < 0.0001 and lower RHI: 1.68 ± 0.30 vs. 2.05 ± 0.46, p = 0.03). In correlation analysis adjusted for confounders, SUA was positively associated (p < 0.05) with BMI, waist circumference, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and MDA, and negatively associated (p < 0.05) with HDL-cholesterol, adiponectin and RHI.This study suggests that in healthy young and middle-aged adults higher SUA levels are associated with higher body adiposity, unfavorable lipid and inflammatory phenotype, higher oxidative stress and impaired endothelial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346409>The  ER stress sensor IRE1α suppresses alternative activation of macrophages and impairs energy expenditure in obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with  inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, both of which promote  disease progression. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are key players orchestrating  inflammation, and ER stress enhances macrophage activation. However, whether ER stress pathways underlie ATM regulation of energy homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we identified inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) as a critical switch governing M1- macrophage polarization and energy balance. Myeloid-specific IRE1α abrogation in Ern1; Lyz2-Cre mice largely reversed high-fat diet (HFD)-induced M1- imbalance in white adipose tissue (WAT) and blocked HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, WAT browning and energy expenditure were significantly higher in Ern1; Lyz2-Cre mice. Furthermore, IRE1α ablation augmented  polarization of macrophages in a cell-autonomous manner. Thus, IRE1α senses protein unfolding and  and immunological states, and consequently guides ATM polarization.

Procedures were part of the screening process for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating liraglutide vs placebo for improving glucose tolerance. For comparison, an age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy control group without psychiatric illness and prediabetes was included. Prediabetes was defined as elevated fasting plasma glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and/or elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c.Among 145 schizophrenia patients (age=42.1 years; males=59.3%) on clozapine or olanzapine (clozapine/olanzapine/both: 73.8%/24.1%/2.1%), prediabetes was present in 69.7% (101 out of 145). While schizophrenia patients with and without prediabetes did not differ regarding demographic, illness, or antipsychotic treatment variables,  abnormalities (waist circumference: 116.7±13.7 vs 110.1±13.6 cm, P=0.007; triglycerides: 2.3±1.4 vs 1.6±0.9 mmol/L, P=0.0004) and  (76.2% vs 40.9%, P&lt;0.0001) were significantly more pronounced in schizophrenia patients with vs without prediabetes. The age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls had significantly better glucose tolerance compared to both groups of patients with schizophrenia. The healthy controls also had higher levels of high-density lipoprotein compared to patients with schizophrenia and prediabetes.Prediabetes and  abnormalities were highly prevalent among the clozapine- and olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia, putting these patients at great risk for later type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Endothelial dysfunction was measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), oxidative stress parameters; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS), nitric oxide, and cell adhesion markers; von Willebrand factor, and e-selectin. Platelet aggregation (endothelial adenosine diphosphate), total platelet count, and mean platelet volume were additionally analyzed and demographic parameters were explored. Student's t- test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Chi-square test were used to analyze the results.The fasting blood glucose (z= 3.52, P= 0.001), hs-CRP (z = 3.23, P= 0.004), ox-LDL (z = 2.62, P= 0.013), and e-NOS (z = 2.22, P= 0.026) levels and cardiac risk score (z = 5.23, P< 0.001) were significantly higher in patients with MetS compared with the control group. Smoking was correlated with decreased FMD (χ2 = 9.26, P= 0.002) in MetS patients but not in the control group.Increased ox-LDL, hs-CRP, and e-NOS are likely to be a result of oxidative stress, a condition in which an imbalance occurs between the production and inactivation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. In addition, in patients with MetS, smoking is independently related to endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30010127>Cognitive Function in Individuals with Normal Weight Obesity: Results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).</a></h2><p>Normal weight obesity (NWO) is associated with increased risk of , cardiovascular- and all-cause mortality. However, no data have been reported on the relationship between adiposity and cognitive performance in NWO. We therefore studied the association between cognitive function and body fat percentage (BF%) in NWO, using a representative sample of the United States population.A cross-sectional study was performed using the nationwide 1988 to 1994 data set from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Cognitive function was measured by three validated cognitive tests: simple reaction time test (SRTT), symbol digit substitution test (SDST), and serial digit learning test (SDLT). The association between BF% and cognitive performance was evaluated in 2,039 adults aged 20-59 years and with a body mass index ranging from 18.5 to 24.9 kg/. Linear regression modeling was used to adjust for potential confounders.Increased BF% was significantly associated with poorer performance on SDLT in the entire study sample (coefficient [95% CI]: 0.15 [0.01, 0.29]) and with poorer performance on SDST in the age group 20-29 years (coefficient [95% CI]: 0.30 [0.10, 0.49]). Increased BF% did not significantly predict poorer performance on SRTT.Higher BF% is significantly associated with poorer cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of US adults with NWO. The identification of possible complications associated with increased adipose tissue underlines the need to measure body fat content in NWO individuals, whose  and cognitive dysfunction could go undetected for years due to their young age and normal body weight.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381382>The association of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and  in a Chinese population.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with features of . The aim of this study was to investigate the association between NAFLD and  in a Chinese population.Data from subjects were retrospectively collected from 2006 to 2009.

However, there is a war regarding the applicability of the diagnosis in different populations regarding the distinct criteria for the diagnosis of MS. Data about the prevalence rate of MS and its components in Jiangxi Province are limited. Thus, our goals were to compare the consistency rates and applicability of three criteria, i.e., those of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment PanelⅢ (ATPⅢ), and the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS).From September 2013 to March 2014, 5959 residents (age≥18 years) from Jiangxi Province were selected by multistage stratified cluster random sampling methods. The prevalence rate of MS and its components were calculated according to the IDF, ATPⅢ and CDS criteria, and the protocols of the different criteria were measured in terms of consistency with the kappa statistic and Youden's index. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to explore the optimal cut-off points of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC).The mean age of the participants was 50.52±13.92 years among the total of 5959 individuals (2451 male and 3508 female). The standardized prevalence rate of MS was 19.85%, 24.77% and 9.95% according to the IDF, ATPⅢ and CDS criteria, respectively. The order of the prevalence rates of the different components of MS according to the IDF or ATPⅢ criteria from high to low were as follows: elevated blood pressure, central obesity, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. The most prevalent component of MS, according to the CDS criterion, was being overweight or obese, followed by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. The Youden's index in IDF criterion was higher than which in CDS criterion (0.79 for IDF vs. 0.38 for CDS) referring to the ATPⅢ criterion. The agreement between the IDF and ATPⅢ criteria was good (kappa = 0.85), whereas the agreement of the CDS with the IDF and ATPⅢ criteria was moderate (kappa = 0.46 and 0.46, respectively). The ability to predict MS risk factors clusters was superior when the BMI cut-off point was 24/24kg/ (male/female), and the WC cut-off point was 87/80cm (male/female). Among the 18~59 years old male group, BMI was superior to WC in predicting clusters of risk factors for MS; while in the 60 years and above male group and all-age female group, WC was superior to BMI.Our results revealed that the prevalence rate of  among adults was high in Jiangxi Province. BMI and WC had different ability to predict clusters of risk factors for MS in different age groups and gender. Among the three criteria for MS, there was bigger difference in applicability for the adults of Jiangxi Province. The choice of the appropriate criteria should be based on the actual conditions of the site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306882>Adipocytokines in Non-functional Adrenal Incidentalomas and Relation with Insulin Resistance Parameters.</a></h2><p>Adrenal incidentalomas are diagnosed incidentally during radiological screenings and require endocrinological investigations for hormonal activity and malignancy. In certain studies, it has been reported that non-functional incidentalomas can be associated with high adipocytokines levels affecting the insulin resistance just like the adipose tissue with . Here, we studied serum adipocytokine levels including leptin, resistin, visfatin, omentin 1 and adiponectin in subjects with non-functional adrenal incidentaloma.Seventy-seven (77) patients (Female 57; Male 20) with non-functional adrenal incidentaloma (NFAI) were enrolled in the study. All patients' past medical history, physical examination including Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference were performed. The patients' demographic, radiologic, hormonal and biochemical parameters were recorded. To compare the parameters, a control group (CG) (n=30) was formed from healthy volunteers. Both groups were matched for age, gender, waist circumference and BMI. Serum adipocytokines including leptin, resistin, visfatin, omentin 1 and adiponectin were measured quantitatively by ELISA. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, sodium, potassium, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), lipid profiles, and dehidroepiandrostenedion sulphate (DHEAS) were measured.Mean age of the patients was 52.2±10.4 years. BMI and waist circumference of NFAI patients were 26.2±3.28 kg/ and 90.2 ±7.5cm, respectively. The mean age of the control group was 48.0±8.16. BMI and waist circumference values for the control group were 25.3±3.5 kg/ and 88.3±9.6 cm, respectively. When both groups were compared for age, gender, BMI and waist circumference were non-significant (p>0.05). Serum fasting insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride levels of the NFAI group were significantly higher than CG (p<0.05). The insulin resistance index (HOMAIR) values of the NFAI subjects were found to be higher than CG (2.5±1.37, 1.1±0.3 p=0.00). Resistin level of NFAI group was also found to be higher than CG [286.6 ng/L vs. 197 ng/L; (P=0,00)], respectively. Leptin levels of NFAI were significantly higher than CG [441.1 ng/mL vs. 186.5 ng/mL; (P=0.00)] respectively. Adiponectin levels were significantly reduced in the NFAI group than in the CG [10.7 mg/L vs. 30.8 mg/L; (P=0.00)]. Comparision of visfatin and omentin levels was nonsignificant.In this study on subjects with non-functional adrenal incidentaloma, we found not only significantly decreased serum adiponectin levels but also increased leptin, resistin levels as well as dyslipidemia, hypertension and high insulin resistance index. All of which could affect insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors. The underlying mechanisms of these findings are unknown, hence further studies are needed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29190720>Intramyocellular triacylglycerol accumulation across weight loss strategies; Sub-study of the CENTRAL trial.</a></h2><p>Intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) is utilized as  fuel during exercise and is linked to insulin resistance, but the long-term effect of weight loss strategies on IMTG among participants with abdominal fat, remain unclear.In an 18-month trial, sedentary participants with abdominal fat/dyslipidemia were randomized to either a low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet (including 28g·day-1 of walnuts). After 6-months, the participants were re-randomized to moderate intense physical activity (PA+) or non-physical activity (PA-). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to quantify changes of IMTG, abdominal sub-depots, hepatic and intermuscular fats.Across the 277 participants [86% men, age = 48 years, body-mass-index (BMI) = 31kg/, visceral fat = 33%] 86% completed the 18-m trial. At baseline, women had higher IMTG than men (3.4% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001) and increased IMTG was associated with aging and higher BMI, visceral and intermuscular fats, HbA1c%, HDL-c and leptin(p<0.05), but not with intra-hepatic fat. After 18 month of intervention and a -3 kg mean weight loss, participants significantly increased IMTG by 25%, with a distinct effect in the MED/LCPA+ group as compared to the other intervention groups (57% vs. 9.5-18.5%, p<0.05). Changes in IMTG were associated with visceral and intermuscular fat, , insulin and leptin (p<0.05 for all), however, these associations did not remain after adjustment for visceral fat changes.Lifestyle strategies differentially affect IMTG accumulation; combination of exercise with decreased carbohydrate/increased unsaturated fat proportion intake greatly increase IMTG. Our findings suggest that increased IMTG during diet-induced moderate weight loss may not be directly related to cardiometabolic risk.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30258444>Shrimp Antiviral mja-miR-35 Targets  in Human  Macrophages and Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis.</a></h2><p>Virus infection can change host's metabolism, while tumorigenesis results from  disorder. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), crucial regulatory factors overlaying transcriptional control mechanisms, can guide  homeostasis. In terms of  disorder, antiviral miRNAs may have anti-tumor activity. However, this issue has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, the results revealed that shrimp mja-miR-35, which showed antiviral activity in shrimp against white spot  virus (WSSV) infection, could suppress the metastasis of breast cancer by targeting human  gene of  macrophages in a cross-phylum manner. Furthermore, the feed expressing shrimp mja-miR-35 had antiviral capacity in shrimp and anti-tumor activity in humans, leading to the simultaneous control of virus infection and tumor progression. Therefore, our findings indicated that the antiviral miRNAs derived from shrimp stress responses against virus infection might be an important source of human anti-tumor drugs and miRNAs could bridge the control of aquaculture diseases and the prevention of human tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29350379> in HIV infected adults in Poland.</a></h2><p> (MS) is usually diagnosed based on the presence of abdominal obesity, elevated blood pres-sure (BP), elevated fasting plasma glucose, high serum triglycerides (TG), and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Whether HIV is associated with a higher prevalence of MS than in the general population remains unclear.The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of MS in the population of HIV-infected adults and its association with clinical, virological, and biochemical features.Two hundred and seventy HIV-infected Caucasian adult patients were enrolled in the study and evaluated based on clinical records in the years 2013-2015. was diagnosed in 60 of 270 (22%) patients, 47 (24%) males and 13 (17%) females, mostly (72%) aged above 40 years. The percentage of patients with diagnosed MS in specific age groups in comparison to the general Polish population for females aged < 40 years was 7% vs. 4%, and males in the same age - 18% vs. 9%, for females aged 40-59 years - 47% vs. 24.4%, and males - 33% vs. 28.3%. Particular components of MS in the MS population were found as follows: body mass index > 30 kg/ in 29%, waist circumference exceeding 94 cm in men and 80 cm in woman - 87.5%, TG ≥ 150 mg/dL - 82%, HDL cholesterol < 40/50 mg/dL (males/females) - 42%, systolic/diastolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg/≥ 85 mmHg - 83%, and fasting glucose > 100 mg/dL - 42%.

There are some interactions between CKD and other  disorders including  (MS) and obesity regarding coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes.A total of 2823 men and 3684 women aged 30 years and older, without cardiovascular disease, were followed for 10 years. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of CHD was estimated for those who developed CKD, MS or both by sex and body mass index levels below and above 27 kg/. The interaction term of CKD and MS and also CKD-MS components were assessed in the Cox proportional hazard models as well.Chronic kidney disease without MS, showed a significant effect on CHD only in participants with low body mass index (hazard ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.31 in the men and hazard ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 6.31 in the women). The joint effect of CKD and MS decreased to one-third of their multiplicative effect in this subgroup, indicating a negative interaction between CKD, MS, and Obesity. The same interaction was observed between CKD and hypertension in both sexes and CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the men.Our results showed that CKD was an independent risk factor for CHD only in nonobese individuals; however, its risk was wiped out when joined to MS.

Macrophages play key role in inflammation, and the balance between M1 (inflammatory) and  (anti-inflammatory) macrophages determines physiological/pathological outcomes. Here, we investigated if hyperandrogenism increases ovarian chemerin altering the balance of M1 and  macrophages and the granulosa cell death. Ovarian chemerin was upregulated by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in lean and overweight rats; while increased serum chemerin levels were only evident in overweight rats, suggesting that the serum chemerin may be reflective of a systemic response and associated with obesity, whereas increased ovarian chemerin expression is a localized response independent of the  status. DHT altered follicle dynamics while increased the M1:  macrophages ratio in antral and pre-ovulatory follicles. While ovarian M1 macrophages expressing chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) were increased, CMKLR1+ monocytes, which migrated toward chemerin-rich environment, were markedly decreased after 15 days of DHT. Androgen-induced granulosa cell apoptosis was dependent on the presence of macrophages. In humans, chemerin levels in follicular fluid, but not in serum, were higher in lean PCOS patients compared to BMI-matched controls and were associated with increased M1:  ratio. Our results support the concept that in PCOS, hyperandrogenemia increases chemerin expression while promotes CMKLR1+ monocytes recruitment and deregulates the immunological niche of ovaries. This study established a new immunological perspective in PCOS at the ovarian level. Hyperandrogenism is associated with upregulation of chemerin and macrophage unbalance in the ovaries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27709230> Is not an Independent Risk Factor for Hearing Impairment.</a></h2><p>We aimed to investigate the association between  (MS) and hearing impairment (HI) using nationally representative data from Korean adults.A total of 16,799 subjects (≥19 years old; 7,170 men and 9,629 women) who underwent pure tone audiometry testing were included in the analysis.

A critical feature associated with such risk is the functional impairment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 i) not only inhibit degradation of incretins to control blood glucose levels, but also improve EPC bioactivity and induce anti-inflammatory effects in tissues. In the present study, we investigated the effects of such an inhibitor, MK-06266, in an ischemia model of MS using diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. EPC bioactivity was examined in MK-0626-administered DIO mice and a non-treated control group, using an EPC colony-forming assay and bone marrow cKit+ Sca-1+ lineage-cells, and peripheral blood-mononuclear cells. Our results showed that, in vitro, the effect of MK-0626 treatment on EPC bioactivities and differentiation was superior compared to the control. Furthermore, microvascular density and pericyte-recruited arteriole number increased in MK-0626-administered mice, but not in the control group. Lineage profiling of isolated cells from ischemic tissues revealed that MK-0626 administration has an inhibitory effect on unproductive inflammation. This occurred via a decrease in the influx of total blood cells and pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, total macrophages, M1, total T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and B-cells, with a concomitant increase in number of regeneration-associated cells, such as /M ratio and Treg/T-helper. Laser Doppler analysis revealed that at day 14 after ischemic injury, blood perfusion in hindlimb was greater in MK-0626-treated DIO mice, but not in control. In conclusion, the DPP-4 i had a positive effect on EPC differentiation in MS model of DIO mice. Following ischemic injury, DPP-4 i sharply reduced recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells into ischemic tissue and triggered regeneration and reparation, making it a promising therapeutic agent for MS treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28412824>Assessment of Lean Patients with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in a Middle Income Country; Prevalence and Its Association with  Disorders: A Cross-sectional Study.</a></h2><p>Recent data has proven that the WHO (world health organization) cut-off for obesity is not applicable to the Asian population.

The participants were interviewed for baseline demographic and clinical information. They were subsequently referred for physical examination and blood sampling. NAFLD was diagnosed using abdominal ultrasonography by a single expert radiologist.Of 927 eligible participants who entered the study, 314 were lean; BMI (body mass index) <25 kg/. The prevalence of NAFLD was 17.52% (95% Exact CI: 13.48%-22.18%). BMI, SBP (systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and triglyceride were significantly different in patients with NAFLD. In the final multiple analysis, higher levels of triglyceride, upper SBP and higher BMI even in the range of less than 25 kg/ were independent predictors of NAFLD in lean participants. In lean participants with more components of , the prevalence of NAFLD increased significantly (all P < 0.01). BMI cut-offs in men and women along with waist circumference cut-off in men could significantly predict the presence of NAFLD in lean patients. After comparing these values, McNemar test showed that BMI cut-offs are more robust than waist circumference cut-offs for predicting the presence of NAFLD in lean subjects (P < 0.01).The prevalence of NAFLD in lean subjects in a sample of Iranian population is 17.52%.

Further evidences were needed.To report 5 cases of young patients with rapidly progressive NAFLD in conjunction with hypopituitarism, aiming to detect the associations.Clinical data of the 5 patients were analyzed retrospectively. All had decompensated liver cirrhosis that was finally attributed to NAFLD. Hypopituitarism was a result of pituitary stalk interruption  in 3 patients and craniopharyngioma in 2.4 patients were overweight (BMI, 24.2 to 28.4kg/). All had insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, 4.8 to 7.2). All suffered from at least one  disorder. All had decompensated liver cirrhosis. The average time duration was 6.9 years between the onset of abnormal liver function and decompensated liver cirrhosis. Fatty liver could be detected in all patients. All had anterior hypopituitarism, and 2 also had posterior pituitary dysfunction. The hormone supplements were insufficient.Hypopituitarism may be a rare cause of rapidly progressive NAFLD. Insulin resistance and  disorders caused by multiple hormonal deficiencies may contribute to it. Hormone supplement therapy, especially the growth hormone supplement, should be given at the early age to prevent the severe liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29280371>Improvement in anthropometric parameters after rational dietary intervention in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrom as the best method to support treatment</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary  (PCOS) is a disorder often occurring in women at reproductive age.

A total of 7 619 elderly people aged over 60 years, and local household registered in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province in 2016 were included as subjects to analyze the incidence rate, influencing factors and causes of death in patients with NAFLD and the relationship between MS and mortality rate in patients with NAFLD. According to different data, using Kruskal-Wallis H test, analysis of variance, t-test, chi-square test or logistic regression analysis were performed.  The prevalence of NAFLD was14.10% (1 074/7 619) among the elderly over 60 years in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province in 2016, and the female prevalence rate was significantly higher than that of males ( < 0.05). When the body mass index (BMI) was < 32 (kg/m(2)), the prevalence of NAFLD increased with the increase of BMI index. When BMI was 18.5-23.9 kg/, 24-27.9 kg/m(2) and > 32 kg/m(2), the prevalence of NAFLD was significantly higher in females than males ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference in prevalence between males and females with BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) and 28~31.9 kg/m(2) ( > 0.05). BMI gradually decreased ( < 0.05) with the increase of age, and the incidence of NAFLD showed a downward trend ( < 0.05). An independent risk factors for NAFLD ( < 0.01) were gender ( = 0.616), age ( = 0.970), waist circumference ( = 1.065), triglycerides ( = 1.162), BMI ( = 1.238), and diastolic blood pressure ( = 1.012). The probability of NAFLD combined with three and four kinds of MS was significantly higher than control group ( < 0.05). Subjects' mortality rate during the follow-up period was 1.94%, 2.23% in the NAFLD group, and 1.89% in the control group. Average life expectancy was 75.58 years in NAFLD group and 78.68 years in the control group. All deaths in NAFLD groups were associated with MS, and 70.83% combined with three or more MS. The primary cause of death in NAFLD group was tumors (37.5%), followed by cardiovascular disease (16.67%) and three cases died directly from MS.  The prevalence of NAFLD in the elderly population in Kunshan city, Jiangsu province is relatively low, which may be associated with local diet and high-intensity workouts. MS disorders represented by obesity and diabetes mellitus are closely associated to the onset of NAFLD. Obesity is the most important risk factor for the incidence of NAFLD in the local elderly population over 60 years old. However, the risk of NAFLD should not be neglected in people with normal BMI, especially in aged women, and the weight control should be the most important means to prevent and control NAFLD. NAFLD may increase mortality rate and reduce life expectancy in the elderly population. The main reason to cause death in the elderly with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease and malignant tumors.

Several studies have suggested that obesity is associated with early renal dysfunction. However, little is known about the relationship between obesity phenotypes and early renal function decline. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the relationship between obesity phenotypes and early renal function decline in adults without hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of clinical and anthropometric data from 1,219 patients who underwent a routine health checkup in 2014. We excluded adults with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or low glomerular filtration rate (<60 mL/min/1.73 ). Renal function was determined according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine-cystatin C equation.Age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, and fasting glucose had an association with the estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Epidemiological data indicate that MetS may increase the risks of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. However, it remains unknown whether MFE programs MetS-associated bladder dysfunction in adult offspring. Using Sprague-Dawley rats, we investigated the effects of MFE during pregnancy and lactation on developmental programming of MetS-associated bladder dysfunction. In addition, next generation sequencing technology was used to identify potential transcripts involved in the programmed bladder dysfunction in adult male offspring to MFE. We found that MFE programmed the MetS-associated OAB symptoms (i.e., an increase in micturition frequency and a shortened mean inter-contractile interval) in young adult male offspring, alongside significant alterations in bladder transcripts, including Chrm2, Chrm3, P2rx1, Trpv4, and Vipr2 gene expression. At protein level, the expressions of M-, M-muscarinic and P2X receptor proteins were upregulated in the MFE bladder. Functionally, the carbachol-induced detrusor contractility was reduced in the MFE offspring.

Anthropometry and 12-hour fasting blood samples were obtained by trained personnel. BMI of ≥25 kg/ was classified as obesity. MetS was defined as having elevated waist circumference (>90 and >80 cm in men and women, respectively) plus any two of the followings: triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL, HDL-C <40 in men or <50 mg/dL in women, blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg, and fasting blood sugar ≥100 mg/dL. CKD was defined as an impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the CKD-EPI equation). Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between obesity and MetS with the presence of CKD.A total of 32,616 diabetic patients were finally recruited from 997 hospitals. The mean age was 61.5±10.9 years with 67.5% women. Of the participants, 35.4% were CKD patients. The prevalence of obesity was 46.5% in CKD and 54.1% in non-CKD patients with T2DM (p<0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of MetS in CKD patients was higher than their non-CKD counterparts (71.3 vs 68.8%, p<0.001). Moreover, there was an association between the prevalence of MetS with CKD stage from 3a to 5 (70.1, 72.3, 73.4, and 72.7%, respectively, p trend = 0.02). MetS, but not obesity, had a significant association with CKD in T2DM patients after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities [OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.06-1.22, p<0.001]. When stratified by each component of MetS, only high serum triglyceride and low HDL-C levels were increased in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 compared with CKD stage 3 (p<0.001) and had a significant relationship with impaired renal function.There were relatively high prevalences of both obesity and MetS in T2DM patients. A higher prevalence of MetS, but lower prevalence of obesity, was observed among diabetic CKD group compared with their non-CKD counterparts. MetS, as a surrogate of insulin resistance, appeared to be more important than obesity in the development of impaired renal function in diabetic population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791227>Sarcopenic Obesity and  in Adult Caucasian Subjects.</a></h2><p>Recently  aspects linked to sarcopenic obesity (SO) were investigated. Extant studies involved especially older people from Asian or White-mixed American cohorts.to explore the prevalence of sarcopenia in Caucasian adult obese subjects using two different indices of sarcopenia, and to investigate the relationship among SO,  (MS), inflammation, and serum albumin concentrations.Cross- sectional study.The study was performed from 2011 to 2014 in a hospitalized care setting. Inclusion criteria were: age>18 and <65 years, BMI≥30 Kg/. Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were assessed by DXA. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) was calculated. Sarcopenia was defined as ASMM/height2 or ASMM/weight <2SD than the sex-specific mean of a young population. The cutoffs were ASMM/h2<6.54 Kg/ for men and 4.82 Kg/ for women, and ASMM/weight<0.2827 for men and 0.2347 for women. ISI-Matsuda was calculated. MS was diagnosed (NCEP-ATPIII).727 subjects (age: 45.72±13.56 years, BMI: 37.74±5.82 kg/) were enrolled. The prevalence of SO was 1.0% or 34.8% in men and 0.6% or 50.1% in women, using ASMM/height2 ratio or ASMM/weight. Subjects with SO based on ASMM/height2 were scarce, only data relying on ASMM/weight were considered. Subjects with SO had higher BMI, waist circumference, FM, and lower FFM and ASMM than nonsarcopenic obese individuals (all p<0.05). ISI-Matsuda was lower and hs-CRP levels were higher in subjects with SO (all p<0.05). MS was more prevalent in subjects with SO than nonsarcopenic obese subjects (47.6% vs 34.3%, p<0.001). ASMM/weight was decreased in subjects with MS (0.2522±0.0410 vs 0.2423±0.0352, p=0.001).SO is associated with MS and low- grade inflammation in adult Caucasian subjects.  profile evaluation should be recommended in subjects with SO.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606084>Effect of oral cinnamon intervention on  profile and body composition of Asian Indians with : a randomized double -blind control trial.</a></h2><p>Nutritional modulation remains central to the management of .

Vegetable oils with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles favorably affect multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors; however, their effects on cholesterol efflux remain unclear.The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of diets low in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles on serum-mediated cholesterol efflux and its association with the plasma lipophilic index and central obesity.The present study is a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Participants [men: n = 50; women: n = 51; mean ± SE age: 49.5 ± 1.2 y; body mass index (in kg/): 29.4 ± 0.4] at risk for or with  (MetS) were randomly assigned to 5 isocaloric diets containing the treatment oils: canola oil, high oleic acid-canola oil, DHA-enriched high oleic acid-canola oil, corn oil and safflower oil blend, and flax oil and safflower oil blend. These treatment oils were incorporated into smoothies that participants consumed 2 times/d. For a 3000-kcal diet, 60 g of treatment oil was required to provide 18% of total energy per day. Each diet period was 4 wk followed by a 2- to 4-wk washout period. We quantified cholesterol efflux capacity with a validated ex vivo high-throughput cholesterol efflux assay. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of the SAS mixed-model procedure.The 5 diets increased serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity from THP-1 macrophages similarly by 39%, 34%, 55%, 49% and 51%, respectively, compared with baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity (r = -0.25, P = 0.01, r = -0.33, P = 0.02, respectively).Diets low in SFAs with different monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid profiles improved serum-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity in individuals with or at risk for MetS. This mechanism may account, in part, for the cardiovascular disease benefits of diets low in SFAs and high in unsaturated fatty acids. Importantly, central obesity is inversely associated with cholesterol efflux capacity.

A link between PRCP protein concentrations in plasma and  disorders has been reported. In this study, we investigated the distribution of circulating PRCP activity and assessed its relation with body weight and adipose tissue in obese patients and patients who significantly lost weight.PRCP activity was measured using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in different isolated blood fractions and primary human cells to investigate the distribution of circulating PRCP. PRCP activity was measured in serum of individuals (n = 75) categorized based on their body mass index (BMI < 25.0; 25.0-29.9; 30.0-39.9; ≥ 40.0 kg/) and the diagnosis of . Differences in serum PRCP activity were determined before and six months after weight loss, either by diet (n = 45) or by bariatric surgery (n = 24). Potential correlations between serum PRCP activity and several  and biochemical parameters were assessed. Additionally, plasma PRCP concentrations were quantified using a sensitive ELISA in the bariatric surgery group.White blood cells and plasma contributed the most to circulating PRCP activity. Serum PRCP activity in lean subjects was 0.83 ± 0.04 U/L and increased significantly with a rising BMI (p<0.001) and decreased upon weight loss (diet, p<0.05; bariatric surgery, p<0.001). The serum PRCP activity alteration reflected body weight changes and was found to be positively correlated with several  parameters, including: total, abdominal and visceral adipose tissue. Plasma PRCP concentration was found to be significantly correlated to serum PRCP activity (0.865; p<0.001). Additionally, a significant decrease (p<0.001) in plasma PRCP protein concentration (mean ± SD) before (18.2 ± 3.7 ng/mL) and 6 months after bariatric surgery (15.7 ± 2.7 ng/mL) was found.Our novel findings demonstrate that white blood cells and plasma contributed the most to circulating PRCP activity. Additionally, we have shown that there were significant correlations between serum PRCP activity and various  parameters, and that plasma PRCP concentration was significantly correlated to serum PRCP activity. These novel findings on PRCP activity in serum support further investigation of its in vivo role and involvement in several  diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30211140>Ultrasound Grade of Liver Steatosis Is Independently Associated with the Risk of .</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to explore (a) prevalence and grade of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) among outpatients referred for abdominal ultrasound (US) examination and (b) relationship between the presence and severity of liver steatosis and  (MS). This was a retrospective analysis of patients without history of liver disease examined by abdominal US in the University hospital setting. US was used to detect and semiquantitatively grade (0-3) liver steatosis. Data on patients' age, gender, body mass index (BMI), impaired glucose metabolism (IGM), atherogenic dyslipidaemia (AD), raised blood pressure (RBP), transaminases, and platelet counts were obtained from medical records. MS was defined as having at least 3 of the following components: obesity, IGM, AD, and RBP. Of the 631 patients (median age 60 years, median BMI 27.4 kg/, and 57.4% females) 71.5% were overweight and 48.5% had NAFL. In the subgroup of 159 patients with available data on the components of MS, patients with higher US grade of steatosis had significantly higher BMI and increased prevalence of obesity, IGM, AD, RBP, and accordingly more frequently had MS, whereas they did not differ in terms of age and gender. NAFL was independently associated with the risk of having MS in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, and IGM. The grade of liver steatosis did not correlate with the presence of liver fibrosis. We demonstrated worrisome prevalence of obesity and NAFL in the outpatient population from our geographic region. NAFL is independently associated with the risk of having MS implying worse prognosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30020457>Youth With Type 1 Diabetes Have Adipose, Hepatic, and Peripheral Insulin Resistance.</a></h2><p>Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have difficulty obtaining optimal glucose control, which may relate to insulin resistance (IR), especially during puberty.

However, the tissue specificity of IR in adolescents with T1D has not been fully phenotyped.To assess adipose, hepatic, and peripheral insulin sensitivity in adolescents with and without T1D.Thirty-five youth with T1D [median age, 16 (first and third quartiles, 14, 17) years; 53% female; median body mass index (BMI) percentile, 82nd (55th, 96th); late puberty; median hemoglobin A1c, 8.3% (7.3%, 9.4%)] and 22 nondiabetic youth of similar age, BMI, pubertal stage, and level of habitual physical activity were enrolled. Insulin action was measured with a four-phase hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (basal and 10, 16, and 80 mU//min) with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers.Adolescents with T1D had a significantly higher rate of lipolysis (P < 0.0001) and endogenous glucose production (P < 0.001) and lower peripheral glucose uptake (glucose rate of disappearance, 6.9 ± 2.9 mg/kg/min for patients with T1D vs 11.3 ± 3.3 for controls; P < 0.0001) during hyperinsulinemia compared with controls. In youth with T1D, glucose rate of disappearance correlated with free fatty acid at the 80-mU//min phase (P = 0.005), markers of inflammation (IL-6; P = 0.012), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.001), and leptin (P = 0.008)], but not hemoglobin A1c.Adolescents with T1D have adipose, hepatic and peripheral IR. This IR occurs regardless of obesity and  features.

Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) gene is one of the candidate genes which have primary importance in T2DM development. Several studies revealed the association between ENPP1 polymorphisms, including rs997509, and T2DM, obesity, insulin resistance and  in different populations. The aim: To test the association between ENPP1 rs997509 polymorphism and T2DM development in patients with different risk factors in the Ukrainian population.Materials and methods: Venous blood of 317 unrelated T2DM patients and 302 healthy volunteers was used for analysis. ENPP1 rs997509 genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction with following restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis) method.Results: Our results revealed that ratio of C/C homozygotes, C/T heterozygotes and T/T homozygotes between case and control groups was significantly different (89.0 % , 11.0%, 0 % vs 94.4 %, 5.6 %, 0 %, P = 0.015). It was shown that risk of T2DM development in T allele carriers is significantly higher compared to C/C homozygotes (OR = 2.086; P= 0.027).

Previous studies have found ABSI is associated with total mortality and cardiovascular events. However, no study has specifically evaluated the joint contribution of ABSI and BMI to cardio- outcomes (high triglycerides, low HDL, high fasting glucose and high blood pressure). With this aim, we performed a retrospective study on 6081 Caucasian adults. Subjects underwent a medical interview, anthropometric measurements, blood sampling, measurement of blood pressure, and measurement of visceral abdominal fat thickness (VAT) by ultrasound. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to evaluate the sex and age adjusted association of ABSI with binary and continuous cardio- risk factors. Four pre-specified GLM were evaluated for each outcome: M1 = ABSI, BMI and ABSI*BMI interaction,  = ABSI and BMI, M3 = ABSI alone and M4 = BMI alone. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was calculated and used to identify the best predictive model. ABSI and BMI contributed independently to all outcomes. Compared to BMI alone, the joint use of BMI and ABSI yielded significantly improved associations for having high triglycerides (BIC = 5261 vs. 5286), low HDL (BIC = 5371 vs. 5381), high fasting glucose (BIC = 6328 vs. 6337) but not high blood pressure (BIC = 6580 vs. 6580). The joint use of BMI and ABSI was also more strongly associated with VAT than BMI alone (BIC = 22930 vs. 23479). In conclusion, ABSI is a useful index for evaluating the independent contribution of WC, in addition to that of BMI, as a surrogate for central obesity on cardio- risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297740>One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass/Minigastric Bypass in Patients with BMI < 35 kg/m and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Preliminary Report.</a></h2><p>Obesity in the world has been increasing, and the number of diabetic patients will increase by 114%, and the best treatment results are achieved through surgery.

However, the contribution of HI mediated ATI and its  consequences are yet to be explored. We induced chronic HI per se in mice by administration of exogenous insulin for 8 weeks through mini-osmotic pumps. For the reduction of circulating insulin in response to excess calorie intake, we have partially ablated β-cells by using streptozotocin (STZ) in the diet-induced obesity (DIO) and genetic mice models (db/db). Flow cytometry analysis was performed for the quantification of immune cells in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT). Our studies demonstrated that chronic HI augmented ATI in terms of elevated pro-inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages and NK-cells) and suppressed anti-inflammatory cells ( macrophages, eosinophils and regulatory T-cells). These results were correlated with altered obesity-associated  phenotype. Partial reduction of circulating insulin level attenuated excess calorie-induced ATI and improved insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, an imbalance in M1 and  macrophage proportions in eWAT promoted iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase): arginase-1 imbalance that resulted into extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and insulin resistance (IR) development. However, iNOS mice were protected from HI-induced M1: macrophage imbalance, ECM deposition and IR in adipose tissue. Overall, we conclude that chronic HI per se contributed in ATI and iNOS corroborated ECM deposition.Copyright © 2018.

WSD-induced adipose inflammation might result from endoplasmic reticulum stress in lipid-overloaded adipocytes and/or dissemination of gut bacterial products, resulting in activation of innate immune signaling. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota, and its detection by innate immune signaling pathways, in WSD-induced adipose inflammation.Mice were fed grain-based chow or a WSD for 8 weeks, assessed metabolically, and intestinal and adipose tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Microbiota was ablated via antibiotics and use of gnotobiotic mice that completely lacked microbiota (germ-free mice) or had a low-complexity microbiota (altered Schaedler flora). Innate immune signaling was ablated by genetic deletion of Toll-like receptor signaling adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response 88.Ablation of microbiota via antibiotic, germ-free, or altered Schaedler flora approaches did not significantly impact WSD-induced adiposity, yet dramatically reduced WSD-induced adipose inflammation as assessed by macrophage populations and cytokine expression. Microbiota ablation also prevented colonic neutrophil and CD103 dendritic cell infiltration. Such reduced indices of inflammation correlated with protection against WSD-induced dysglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and liver dysfunction. Genetic deletion of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 also prevented WSD-induced adipose inflammation.These results indicate that adipose inflammation, and some aspects of , are not purely a consequence of diet-induced adiposity per se but, rather, may require disturbance of intestine-microbiota interactions and subsequent activation of innate immunity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Obesity is characterised by low-grade systemic and adipose tissue inflammation. This is suggested to be implicated in the  and obesity. In the present review, we hypothesise that LPS directly and indirectly participates in the inflammatory reaction in adipose tissue during obesity. The experimental evidence shows that LPS is involved in the transition of macrophages from the  to the M1 phenotype. In addition, LPS inside adipocytes may activate caspase-4/5/11. This may induce a highly inflammatory type of programmed cell death (i.e. pyroptosis), which also occurs after infection with intracellular pathogens. Lipoproteins with or without LPS are taken up by adipocytes. Large adipocytes are more metabolically active and potentially more exposed to LPS than small adipocytes are. Thus, LPS might be involved in defining the adipocyte death size and the formation of crown-like structures. The adipocyte death size is reached when the intracellular concentration of LPS initiates pyroptosis. The mechanistic details remain to be elucidated, but the observations indicate that adipocytes are stimulated to cell death by processes that involve LPS from the gut microbiota. There is a complex interplay between the composition of the diet and microbiota. This influences the amount of LPS that is translocated from the gut. In particular, the lipid content of a meal may correlate with the amount of LPS built in to chylomicrons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29701774>Associations Between Plasma Chemerin Concentrations and Bone Quality in Adults From the General Population.</a></h2><p>Chemerin is an adipokine associated with parameters of inflammation and the . Small observational studies suggested that high circulating chemerin levels are also related to bone erosion. We aimed to determine whether plasma chemerin levels are related to bone quality in the general population and to investigate the influence of body mass index (BMI) on that relation. For our analyses, we obtained data from 3583 adults who participated in the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania-Trend. The participants were divided into three groups according to their BMI: lean (<25 kg/), overweight (25 to 30 kg/), and obese (≥30 kg/). Chemerin concentrations were determined in EDTA plasma. Bone quality was assessed using quantitative ultrasound at the heel. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS), stiffness index, and osteoporotic fracture risk were derived from this measurement. Sex- and BMI-specific linear regression models revealed inverse associations between chemerin levels and BUA in obese men. In obese women, inverse relations between chemerin levels and SOS or stiffness index were found. Logistic regression models revealed positive associations between chemerin levels and osteoporotic fracture risk. In lean or overweight subjects, no statistically significant associations were found. Our sex- and BMI-specific analyses showed that inverse associations between chemerin levels and bone quality are restricted to obese men and women. The observed association may be due to a chemerin-induced negative affect on bone metabolism, possibly due to abrogation of osteoblastogenesis or stimulation of adipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095010>[ and visceral fat in women with cardiovascular risk factor].</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in women after menopause, since after this stage there are profound  and hormonal changes which favor the development of .

When LSMs fail, the role of testosterone replacement treatment (TRT) is unclear. GLP1 receptor agonist liraglutide is linked to progressive and sustained weight loss. A potential direct impact of GLP1 on hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis was reported in animal models. We aimed to compare the effects of liraglutide and TRT on FH in obese men that had been poor responders to LSM, by means of reversal of FH and weight reduction. We designed a 16-week prospective randomized open-label study with 30 men (aged 46.5 ± 10.9 years, BMI 41.2 ± 8.4 kg/, mean ± s.d.) that were randomized to liraglutide 3.0 mg QD (LIRA) or 50 mg of 1% transdermal gel QD (TRT). Sexual function and anthropometric measures were assessed. Fasting blood was drawn for determination of endocrine and  parameters followed by OGTT. Model-derived parameters including HOMAIR and calculated free testosterone (cFT) were calculated. Total testosterone significantly increased in both arms (+5.9 ± 7.2 in TRT vs +2.6 ± 3.5 nmol/L in LIRA) and led to improved sexual function. LIRA resulted in a significant increase of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (P < 0.001 for between-treatment effect). Subjects treated with LIRA lost on average 7.9 ± 3.8 kg compared with a 0.9 ± 4.5 kg loss in TRT (P < 0.001).  was resolved in two patients in LIRA and in no subjects in TRT.

However, obesity is a risk factor for developing renal disease. Our goal was to quantify body mass index trends in donor nephrectomy patients and to institute nutrition counseling to promote sustainable weight loss to reduce the risk of -derived renal dysfunction.Ninety patients who underwent donor nephrectomy between 2007 and 2012 consented to having height and weight data collected at multiple time points. After data collection, each patient underwent a standardized nutrition counseling session. One year later, body mass index was reassessed.Preoperatively, 52% of the patients were overweight or obese. The percentage of overweight and obese patients remained stable for 2 years after surgery. However, at 3, 4, and 5 years after surgery, these rates increased to 59%, 69%, and 91%. Each patient was counseled about obesity-related comorbidities and provided information about lifestyle modification. One year later, 94% of previously overweight patients and 82% of previously obese patients had a decrease in mean body mass index from 27.2 ± 4.0 kg/ to 25.1 ± 3.6 kg/.Living-donor nephrectomy patients are at risk of developing obesity, similar to the adult population. Nutrition counseling may be beneficial to help normalize body mass index in patients who have become overweight or obese to potentially prevent obesity-related comorbidities. All patients were evaluated by a nutrition specialist after surgery to review our donor nephrectomy nutrition brochure.

In particular, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. Since it is unclear whether body fat distribution is also important in men and women with obesity we investigated the associations between measures of body fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk factors in men and women with obesity.In this cross-sectional analysis of obese men and women (BMI≥30 kg/) included in the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study, waist:hip ratio(WHR), waist circumference, and MRI-based abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (aSAT) and VAT were determined. Associations between measures of body fat distribution and presence of ≥1 risk factor, such as hypertension or hypertriglyceridemia, were examined using logistic regression analyses; stratified by sex and adjusted for age, ethnicity, education, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and depending on the association additionally for total body fat or VAT.We included 2,983 obese individuals (57% women) with a mean age of 56 and standard deviation (SD) of 6 and mean BMI of 34.0 kg/ (4.0), after exclusion of individuals with missing values of cardiometabolic risk factors (n = 33). 241 individuals were obese without other cardiometabolic risk factors. In obese women, all measures of body fat distribution except aSAT (OR per SD:0.76, 95%CI: 0.53, 1.10) were associated with having ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor, of which VAT most strongly associated (5.77; 3.02, 11.01).

Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in  disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1β, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel  (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/ macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with  disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145227>Glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance is related to macrophage visceral adipose tissue infiltration.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is frequently present in patients with glucocorticoid (GC) excess (Cushing's ) or treated with high doses of GCs. Furthermore, others similarities between  (visceral obesity, elevated blood glucose levels, dyslipidemia) and Cushing's  suggest that GCs could play a role in obesity-linked complications. Here we reported that long-term corticosterone (CORT) exposure in mice induced weight gain, dyslipidemia as well as hyperglycaemia and systemic insulin resistance. CORT-treated mice exhibited an increased 11β-Hsd1 expression and corticosterone levels in fat depots but a specific upregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase only in gonadal adipose tissue, suggesting that GC could act differentially on various fat depots. Despite fat accumulation in all depots, an increased expression of adipogenic (Pparγ, C/ebpα) and lipogenic (Acc, Fas) key genes was restricted to gonadal adipose tissue. Hypertrophied adipocytes observed in both visceral and subcutaneous depots also resulted from reduced lipolytic activity due to CORT treatment. Surprisingly, GC treatment promoted macrophage infiltration (F4/80, Cd68) within all adipose tissues along with predominant -like macrophage phenotype, and can directly act on macrophages to induce this phenotype. Moreover, macrophage infiltration preceded mass gain and adipocyte hypertrophy. Of note, specific macrophage depletion in gonadal fat preferentially reduced the -like macrophage content, and partially restored insulin sensitivity in mice with GC-induced obesity and insulin resistance. These data provide evidence that GCs act on adipose tissue in a depot-dependent manner and that gonadal adipose macrophages are key effectors of GC-associated insulin resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the impact of GLP-1 analogues and their potential underlying molecular mechanisms in insulin resistance and atherosclerosis are investigated.Atherosclerosis development was evaluated in Apoe  Irs2  mice, a mouse model of insulin resistance, the  and atherosclerosis, treated with the GLP-1 analogues lixisenatide or liraglutide. In addition, studies in Apoe  Irs2  mice and mouse-derived macrophages treated with lixisenatide were performed to investigate the potential inflammatory intracellular pathways.Treatment of Apoe  Irs2  mice with either lixisenatide or liraglutide improved glucose metabolism and blood pressure but this was independent of body weight loss. Both drugs significantly decreased atheroma plaque size. Compared with vehicle-treated control mice, lixisenatide treatment generated more stable atheromas, with fewer inflammatory infiltrates, reduced necrotic cores and thicker fibrous caps. Lixisenatide-treated mice also displayed diminished IL-6 levels, proinflammatory Ly6C monocytes and activated T cells. In vitro analysis showed that, in macrophages from Apoe  Irs2  mice, lixisenatide reduced the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 accompanied by enhanced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is a determinant for  macrophage differentiation. STAT1 activation, which is essential for M1 phenotype, was also diminished. Furthermore, atheromas from lixisenatide-treated mice showed higher arginase I content and decreased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, indicating the prevalence of the  phenotype within plaques.Lixisenatide decreases atheroma plaque size and instability in Apoe  Irs2  mice by reprogramming macrophages towards an  phenotype, which leads to reduced inflammation. This study identifies a critical role for this drug in macrophage polarisation inside plaques and provides experimental evidence supporting a novel mechanism of action for GLP-1 analogues in the reduction of cardiovascular risk associated with insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30916165>Epidemiological study of  in Brazilian soldiers.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to carry out an epidemiological analysis of  among Brazilian Army soldiers.Two thousand seven hundred and nineteen male soldiers of the Brazilian Army were evaluated from 2014 to 2016.

We investigated the association of kidney function with gait pattern in the general population and tested whether the association between impaired kidney function and fall is more pronounced in subjects with lower gait function.We included 1430 participants (mean age: 60 years) from the Rotterdam Study. Kidney function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). We assessed global gait, gait velocity and seven independent gait domains: Rhythm, Phases, Variability, Pace, Tandem, Turning and Base of Support. Regression models adjusted for cardiometabolic and neurological factors were used. We evaluated whether participants with impaired kidney function and impaired gait fell more in the previous year.The study population had a median (interquartile range) ACR of 3.6 (2.5-6.2) mg/g and mean ± SD eGFR of 87.6 ± 15 mL/min/1.73 . Higher ACR and lower eGFR were associated with lower global gait score [per doubling of ACR: -0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.14 to -0.06, and per SD eGFR:-0.09, 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.03] and slower gait speed (ACR: -1.44 cm/s, CI: -2.12 to -0.76; eGFR: -1.55 cm/s, CI: -2.43 to -0.67).

The high-risk groups exhibited a more severe course of flu-like  than did the patients outside the risk groups. The incidence of complications was higher, especially in the under 2-year-year-old children and in patients with endocrine, , or respiratory diseases, with a large proportion of complications being pneumonia. The efficacy of antiviral therapy was higher in the elderly, patients with chronic diseases, and pregnant women than in patients not at risk. In patients treated with umifenovir (provided that it was administered in the first 48 hours after disease onset), the duration of fever and frequency of complications proved to be lower than those in patients who did not receive antiviral therapy.The FRs for influenza and ARVI complications are patient's age (children under 3 years of age and adults older than 65 years), the presence of chronic somatic diseases, and pregnancy. Patients with endocrine, eating,  (including obesity), circulatory, and respiratory disorders are at high risk for influenza and ARVI complications.

In our study, diabetes and hypertension appear to contribute to the increase in ferritin levels described in obesity.Ferritin may not be a reliable index for evaluating iron stores in obese patients, particularly when associated with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

NAFLD is threatening to become a major public health problem in association with the . The association of NAFLD with outcomes in patients with advanced CKD has not been evaluated. In this study, the prevalence of NAFLD and its impact on cardiovascular and renal outcomes and mortality were determined in a large secondary care CKD cohort.The study was conducted on 1148 CKD patients within a cohort of 3061 CKD patients, who had undergone ultrasound imaging of the liver over a 15-year period. A propensity-matched population from within the cohort was also included. Cox regression analysis was used to study the association of NAFLD with cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease and mortality and linear regression analysis for CKD progression.The prevalence of NAFLD was 17.9%. The median duration of follow-up after scanning was 5.4 years, with a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 33.5 mL/min/1.73  in this population. NAFLD proved to be a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-3.13; P < 0.01] but it was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.58-1.08; P = 0.14) or CKD progression (P = 0.09 for rate of decline of eGFR slope). Patients with CKD are known to have high cardiovascular risk; the propensity-matched analysis showed that NAFLD increased this cardiovascular risk (HR 2.00; CI 1.10-3.66; P < 0.05).NAFLD has a strong independent association with cardiovascular events, even in an advanced CKD cohort with high comorbidity. The implication is that routine screening for NAFLD may be warranted in CKD populations to enable targeted interventions for CVD prevention in higher risk patients.© The Author(s) 2018.

Primary IR originates as consequence of rare monogenetic defects of insulin receptor or molecules includes to post-receptor insulin signal cascade. Secondary IR originates mainly as a result of  or hormonal changes, most commonly in visceral obesity by multifactorial postreceptor inhibition of insulin signal and it is associated with  and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also present in endocrinopathies with overproduction of contraregulatory insulin hormones (cortisol, growth hormone, catecholamines) and using of some drugs (mainly steroids, immunosuppressive treatment). In practice IR is usually diagnosed by glycemic parameters with confirmation of prediabetic states and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The healthy life style and physical activity associated with weight loss are the most important for type 2 diabetes prevention. According to actual international guidelines metformin is only antidiabetic drug which is possible to use in prediabetic states with high risk of type 2 diabetes development, mainly in obese subjects with BMI &gt; 35 kg/, age under 60 years and in women with history of gestational diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30484514>Is it Possible to Easily Identify Metabolically Healthy Obese Women?</a></h2><p>Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of several  complications. However, some obese individuals have a favorable  profile.The aim of this study was to identify an easy parameter for recognizing metabolically healthy obese (MHO) women.A total of 292 non-diabetic women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/ were selected, and 239 composed the final cohort. We classified the participants according to their  state determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) into MHO or metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Both groups were compared regarding biochemical, anthropometric, and body composition characteristics.The average age of the cohort was 43.9 ± 10.9 years and the average BMI was 37.2 ± 5.3 kg/. In total, 75.7% of the participants were classified as MHO by HOMA. A cutoff of 108.2 cm for waist circumference (WC) identified MHO participants with a sensitivity of 72.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 59.8-82.3%), specificity of 66.9% (95% CI: 59.71-73.3%), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.36-0.47). Additionally, a visceral adiposity index cutoff value of 99.2 identified MHO women with a sensitivity of 89.7% (95% CI: 79.2-95.2%), specificity of 48.6% (95% CI: 41.4-55.9%), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.15-0.30).Women classified as MHO exhibited smaller WC measurements and lower body fat percentages, as well as lower blood glucose and insulin levels.

SF induces activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), which might be involved in  disorders. We hypothesized that adult offspring of double mutant mice (DM) involving the critical ISR genes CHOP and GADD34 would be protected from developing obesity and insulin resistance following SF.Time-pregnant CHOP/GADD34 DM and wild type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to sleep control (SC) or SF conditions during the last 5days of gestation. At 24-weeks of age, body weight, fat mass, and HOMA-IR were assessed in the offspring. Tregs lymphocytes, Lyc6c, M1 and  macrophages were examined in visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) using flow cytometry. The effects of plasma exosomes on adipocyte cell line proliferation, differentiation and insulin sensitivity were also evaluated.SF-WT male showed significant increases in body weight, vWAT mass and HOMA-IR compared to SC-WT mice, while SF had no effect in SF-DM mice. Inflammatory macrophages (Ly-6c) and the ratio of M1/ macrophages were increased while FoxP3+ Tregs counts were decreased in SF-WT but not in SF-DM mice. Exosomes from SF-WT, but not from the SF-DM offspring increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and decreased in vitro adipocyte insulin sensitivity.Activation of the ISR during late gestation, as induced by late gestational SF, appears to underlie some of the transgenerational modifications in  genes ultimately contributing to a  phenotype in adult offspring.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

CRF (dyslipidemia, overweight [Ow], obesity [Ob], blood pressure [BP], hyperglycemia, insulin resistance [IR]) and renal impairment were defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula >130/120, <90 mL/min/1.73 , and proteinuria were measured in 18- to 25-year-old students (total n = 5,531). Adjusted ORs by sex were calculated using logistic regression.The mean SUA was 4.5 ± 1.04 and 6.2 ± 1.2 mg/dL in W and M respectively. High SUA was found in 13.9% (n = 767); prevalence of Ow/Ob 69% (528 of 767), high BP 9% (67), hyperglycemia 15% (112), IR 47% (214), hypertriglyceridemia 35% (269), high LDL-c 16% (120), low HDL-c 52% (399), and  33% (249). Prevalence of high GFR was 13% (103), low GFR 8% (62) and proteinuria 5% (37). All risk factors showed a positive relationship with the SUA quartiles with high LDL-c with lowest risk (OR 1.7) and Ow/Ob with highest risk (OR 4.1), independent of sex. Key Messages: High SUA concentrations (M ≥6.2/W ≥4.5 mg/dL) are associated with CRF and renal impairment in young adults.

In the current study, we tested whether consumption of luteolin, an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, could mitigate adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance in obese ovariectomized mice. Nine-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD supplemented with 0.005% luteolin (HFD+L) for 16 weeks. Results showed no difference in body weight or fat mass between mice fed HFD+L and those fed HFD. However, luteolin supplementation resulted in lower CD11c macrophages in gonadal adipose tissue, as well as a trend toward lower macrophage infiltration. Luteolin supplementation also significantly lowered mRNA expression of inflammatory and M1 markers MCP-1, CD11c, TNF-α and IL-6, while maintaining expression of  marker MGL1. Consistent with this, the in vitro luteolin treatment, with or without the presence of estrogen, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced polarization of RAW 264.7 cells toward M1 phenotype. We further found that luteolin supplementation protected mice from insulin resistance induced by HFD consumption; this improved insulin resistance was correlated with reductions in CD11c adipose tissue macrophages. Taken together, these findings indicate that dietary luteolin supplementation attenuates adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance found in mice with loss of ovarian function coupled with an HFD intake, and this effect may be partly mediated through suppressing M1-like polarization of macrophages in adipose tissue. These results have clinical implication in implementing dietary intervention for prevention of  associated with postmenopause and obesity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Caloric intake was reduced by 500 kcal/d in all participants and protein intake equated 25-30% of total calories (~1.4 g/kg/d). Exercise training consisted of 3 session/week of resistance training on pulley machines. Outcome measures included total and trunk fat mass (FM), total and appendicular lean body mass (LBM), fasting glucose level, lipid profile and blood pressure.

In renal transplant recipients, MS has been shown to be an independent risk factor for chronic allograft dysfunction, graft failure, new-onset diabetes, and CV disease. We performed a cross-sectional study on 106 stable renal transplant recipients to detect MS between January 2013 and August 2013. This  was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Patients with history of diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. In this group of patients, 56 (52.8%) had MS. There were 32 males (57.1%) and 24 females (42.9%). The mean age of the MS group was significantly higher than the non-MS group. The mean serum creatinine was higher in the MS group than the non-MS group, but there was no significant difference between them (P >0.05).

During the follow-up, a total of 693 subjects converted to type 2 diabetes and 351 were diagnosed with a new CVD event during the follow-up.The main outcome measures were incidence of type 2 diabetes and CVD.Height measured at baseline was significantly associated with lower levels of 2-hour glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test, an increase in insulin secretion, a decrease in the risk of type 2 diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83(confidence interval [CI] 0.77 to 0.90)] and CVD [HR = 0.75(CI 0.67 to 0.83)] during the follow-up.Short stature is associated with unfavorable changes in glucose metabolism and predicts an increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253638>Antipurinergic therapy for autism-An in-depth review.</a></h2><p>Are the symptoms of autism caused by a treatable  that traces to the abnormal persistence of a normal, alternative functional state of mitochondria? A small clinical trial published in 2017 suggests this is possible. Based on a new unifying theory of pathogenesis for autism called the cell danger response (CDR) hypothesis, this study of 10 boys, ages 5-14years, showed that all 5 boys who received antipurinergic therapy (APT) with a single intravenous dose of suramin experienced improvements in all the core symptoms of autism that lasted for 5-8weeks. Language, social interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive movements all improved. Two children who were non-verbal spoke their first sentences. None of these improvements were observed in the placebo group. Larger and longer studies are needed to confirm this promising discovery. This review introduces the concept of  (anti-inflammatory) and M1 (pro-inflammatory) mitochondria that are polarized along a functional continuum according to cell stress. The pathophysiology of the CDR, the complementary functions of M1 and  mitochondria, relevant gene-environment interactions, and the  underpinnings of behavior are discussed as foundation stones for understanding the improvements in ASD behaviors produced by antipurinergic therapy in this small clinical trial.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

It is assumed that these effects can be attributed to polyphenolic cocoa ingredients such as flavanols, especially to (-)-epicatechin. Nutritive intervention studies to prove this hypothesis are scarce.We aimed to evaluate whether regular consumption of 25 mg of pure (-)-epicatechin can affect increased cardiometabolic risk factors [blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation] in overweight-to-obese subjects.Forty-eight overweight or obese nonsmokers [body mass index (kg/) ≥25.0, ages 20-65 y] with clear signs of  (blood pressure ≥130/85 mm Hg, glucose >5.55 mmol/L, or triglycerides >1.69 mmol/L or cholesterol >5.2 mmol/L in fasting blood) and without chronic diseases were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Participants ingested daily 25 mg (-)-epicatechin (encapsulated) or placebo for 2-wk in random order (2-wk washout). After an overnight fast, blood pressure was monitored and blood samples were collected before and after both treatments. Anthropometric data were determined at each visit. Dietary intake was assessed by 3-d food records during both treatments and during run-in and washout phase.Supplementation of pure (-)-epicatechin did not significantly affect blood pressure, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, or total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol. Oxidized LDL, vitamins C and E, and β-carotene in plasma were not modulated. Body weight, fat mass, fat distribution, and the intake of energy, nutrients, and (-)-epicatechin from food remained stable throughout the study.Daily intake of 25 mg of pure (-)-epicatechin for 2 wk does not reduce cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight-to-obese adults. Thus, the hypothesis that the cardioprotective effects of regular cocoa consumption are exclusively ascribed to (-)-epicatechin should be reconsidered.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of white rice is positively associated with T2D risk, while intake of brown rice is inversely associated. Thus, we explored the effect of substituting brown rice for white rice on T2D risk factors among adults in urban South India. A total of 166 overweight (BMI ≥ 23 kg/) adults aged 25-65 years were enrolled in a randomised cross-over trial in Chennai, India. Interventions were a parboiled brown rice or white rice regimen providing two ad libitum meals/d, 6 d/week for 3 months with a 2-week washout period. Primary outcomes were blood glucose, insulin, glycosylated Hb (HbA1c), insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) and lipids. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was a secondary outcome. We did not observe significant between-group differences for primary outcomes among all participants. However, a significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in the brown rice group among participants with the  (-0·18 (se 0·08) %) relative to those without the  (0·05 (se 0·05) %) (P-for-heterogeneity = 0·02). Improvements in HbA1c, total and LDL-cholesterol were observed in the brown rice group among participants with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/ compared with those with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/ (P-for-heterogeneity &lt; 0·05). We observed a smaller increase in hs-CRP in the brown (0·03 (sd 2·12) mg/l) compared with white rice group (0·63 (sd 2·35) mg/l) (P = 0·04). In conclusion, substituting brown rice for white rice showed a potential benefit on HbA1c among participants with the  and an elevated BMI.

However, the phenotypes of human ATMs and regulatory mechanisms of their polarization have not been clearly described. In this study, we investigated human ATMs in both abdominal visceral AT and s.c. AT and proposed an 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1)-glucocorticoid receptor regulatory axis that might dictate M1/ polarization in ATMs. The accumulation of CD11cCD163 ATMs in both visceral AT and s.c. AT of obese individuals was confirmed at the cellular level and was found to be clearly correlated with body mass index and production of reactive oxygen species. Using our in vitro system where human peripheral blood monocytes (hPBMs) were cocultured with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel  adipocytes, M1/ polarization was found to be dependent on 11β-HSD1, an intracellular glucocorticoid reactivating enzyme. Exposure of hPBMs to cortisol-induced expression of CD163 and RU-486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, significantly abrogated CD163 expression through coculture of mature adipocytes with hPBMs. Moreover, 11β-HSD1 was expressed in crown ATMs in obese AT. Importantly, conditioned medium from coculture of adipocytes with hPBMs enhanced proliferation of human breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, the phenotypic switch of ATMs from  to mixed M1/ phenotype occurred through differentiation of adipocytes in obese individuals, and upregulation of intracellular 11β-HSD1 might play a role in the process.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352040>Long-term follow-up of gonadal dysfunction in morbidly obese adolescent boys after bariatric surgery.</a></h2><p>Background Elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with hypogonadism in men but this is not well described in adolescents. The aim is to evaluate gonadal dysfunction and the effects of weight loss after gastric banding in obese adolescent boys. Methods Thirty-seven of 54 boys (age 16.2±1.2 years, mean BMI 48.2 kg/) enrolled at the Center for Adolescent Bariatric Surgery at Columbia University Medical Center had low total testosterone for Tanner 5 <350 ng/dL. Sixteen had long-term hormonal data for analysis at baseline (T0), 1 year (T1) and 2 years (T2) post-surgery. T-tests, chi-squared (χ2) tests, correlation and linear mixed models were performed. Results At T0, the hypogonadal group had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) (75th vs. 57th percentile, p=0.02), fasting insulin (19 vs. 9 μIU/mL, p=0.0008) and homeostatic index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (4.2 vs. 1.9, p=0.009) compared to control group. Total testosterone was negatively correlated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the long-term analysis, BMI, weight, waist circumference (WC), and % excess weight decreased at T1 and T2 compared to T0. Mean total testosterone at T0, T1 and T2 were 268, 304 and 368 ng/dL, respectively (p=0.07). There was a statistically significant negative correlation between BMI and testosterone after 2 years (r=-0.81, p=0.003). Conclusions Low testosterone levels but unaltered gonadotropins are common in this group and associated with insulin resistance. While a significant increase in testosterone was not found over time, the negative relationship between BMI and testosterone persisted, suggesting there may be an optimal threshold for testosterone production with respect to BMI.

Elevated serum uric acid has been demonstrated to be associated with obesity in the adult population in many countries; however, there is still a lack of evidence for the Bangladeshi population. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of hyperuricemia and determine the relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and obesity among the Bangladeshi adults.In this cross-sectional study, blood samples were collected from 260 adults (142 males and 118 females) and analyzed for SUA and lipid profile. All participants were categorized as underweight (n = 11), normal (n = 66), overweight (n = 120) and obese (n = 63) according to the body mass index (BMI) scale for the Asian population. Based on SUA concentration the participants were stratified into four quartiles (Q1: < 232 μmol/L, Q2: 232-291 μmol/L, Q3: 292-345 μmol/L and Q4: > 345 μmol/L).The mean age and BMI of the participants were 32.5 ± 13.3 years and 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/, respectively. The average level of SUA was 294 ± 90 μmol/L with a significant difference between males and females (p < 0.001). Overall, the estimated prevalence of hyperuricemia was 9.3% with 8.4% in male and 10.2% in female participants. There were significant increases in the prevalence of obesity (17.4%, 22.2%, 28.6% and 31.8%, respectively, p < 0.01 for trend) across the SUA quartiles. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that SUA quartiles were independently associated with the presence of obesity (p < 0.01).Present study indicates a significant positive relationship between SUA and obesity among the Bangladeshi adults. Therefore, routine measurement of SUA is recommended in obese individuals to prevent hyperuricemia and its related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776378>Colonic diverticulosis and the : an association?</a></h2><p>Colonic diverticulosis (CD) is related to advanced age and a lack of dietary fiber. Recently, several studies have shown that  (MS) is also implicated in the etiopathogenesis of CD. This study aimed to assess the association between MS, obesity and CD.This was a prospective study of a one-year duration. The MS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III). Demographic data, risk factors for MS and endoscopic findings of patients who underwent a total colonoscopy in the department were collected. Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/. Informed consent was obtained. The local Ethics Committee and National Data Protection Committee approved the study. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21 and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.The study included 203 patients, 95 males with a mean age of 65.5 years. CD was diagnosed in 30.5% of patients. Univariate analysis showed that age, hypertension, increased waist circumference and hyperlipidemia were associated with colonic diverticulosis. There was no association with gender, obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Multivariate analysis showed that age and a greater waist circumference increased the risk of diverticulosis. Age-adjusted analysis showed that MS was associated with diverticulosis. The prevalence of adenoma in patients with CD was similar to that in patients without CD.In this series, MS was significantly associated with CD. The identification of risk groups is important since diverticulosis can have serious and potentially fatal complications. To our knowledge, this is the first Southern European prospective study evaluating the association between MS and CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30556500>Drug Development Strategy for Type 2 Diabetes: Targeting Positive Energy Balances.</a></h2><p>Newer classes of medications have been proven useful in glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D), but many do not appear capable to slow down the progressive loss of ß-cell function, or to improve population-level glycemic control. Positive energy balance, e.g. surplus energy intake over expenditure, is at the core for developing  and T2D. Currently available glycemic control drugs come to the market based on their 1-2 years risk-benefit profiles, but most of them do not correct positive energy balance and lose efficacy in the long-term. This denouement is destined by a positive energy balance of T2D. There is continuous endeavor/investment in new drugs for T2D. In this review, we compared the effects of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents on energy balance and discussed several novel therapeutic targets/approaches for T2D that could potentially correct positive energy balance: changing the composition of intestinal host-microbiota to alleviate excess caloric consumption, controlling chylomicron uptake into intestinal lacteals to reduce excessive caloric intake, and activating pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) to ameliorate glucose metabolism and increase energy expenditure. We further reviewed how nicotine affects body weight and ameliorates positive energy balance, and ways to encourage people to adopt a more healthy lifestyle by exercising more and/or decreasing caloric intake. These potential targets/approaches may hopefully correct positive energy balance, delay disease progression, reverse some pathophysiological changes, and eventually prevent and/or cure the disease. Drug development strategies applying new insights into T2D process and therapeutic index to correct positive energy balance need to be seriously considered.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474500>Vitamin D supplementation of a high fat high sugar diet ameliorates prediabetic phenotype in female LDLR and LDLR mice.</a></h2><p>Fatty liver disease is prevalent in populations with high caloric intake.

This analysis examines the association between Soldiers' BMI at accession and incident cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF) using longitudinal data from 731,014 Soldiers (17.0% female; age: 21.6 [3.9] years; BMI: 24.7 [3.8] kg/) who were assessed at Army accession, 2001-2011. CRF were defined as incident diagnoses through 2011, by ICD-9 code, of , glucose/insulin disorder, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or overweight/obesity (in those not initially overweight/obese). Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between BMI categories at accession and CRF. Initially underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/) were 2.4% of Soldiers, 53.5% were normal weight (18.5-<25), 34.2% were overweight (25-<30), and 10.0% were obese (≥30). Mean age range at CRF diagnosis was 24-29 years old, with generally low CRF incidence: 228 with , 3,880 with a glucose/insulin disorder, 26,373 with hypertension, and 13,404 with dyslipidemia. Of the Soldiers who were not overweight or obese at accession, 5,361 were eventually diagnosed as overweight or obese. Relative to Soldiers who were normal weight at accession, those who were overweight or obese, respectively, had significantly higher risk of developing each CRF after multivariable adjustment (HR [95% CI]: : 4.13 [2.87-5.94], 13.36 [9.00-19.83]; glucose/insulin disorder: 1.39 [1.30-1.50], 2.76 [2.52-3.04]; hypertension: 1.85 [1.80-1.90], 3.31 [3.20-3.42]; dyslipidemia: 1.81 [1.75-1.89], 3.19 [3.04-3.35]). Risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and overweight/obesity in initially underweight Soldiers was 40%, 31%, and 79% lower, respectively, versus normal-weight Soldiers.

Depletion of the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 reduced white adipose tissue inflammation and improved glucose metabolism in obese male mice. Siah2 is a transcriptional target of estrogen, but data is lacking about the effect of Siah2 on adipose tissue of females. We therefore evaluated the impact of Siah2 deficiency on white and brown adipose tissue in females of reproductive age.Body composition, adipose tissue morphology, brown adipose tissue gene, and protein expression and adipocyte sizing were evaluated in wild-type and Siah2KO female and male mice fed a low-fat or high-fat diet. Glucose and insulin tolerance, fasting glucose, insulin, fatty acids and triglycerides, and gene expression of inflammation markers in perigonadal fat were evaluated in wild-type and Siah2KO female mice. Microarray analysis of brown fat gene expression was carried out in both sexes. Statistical analysis was assessed by unpaired two-tailed t test and repeated measures ANOVA.Siah2 deficiency improves glucose and insulin tolerance in the presence of hypertrophied white adipocytes in high-fat-fed female mice with percent fat comparable to male mice. While previous studies showed Siah2KO reduces the white adipose tissue inflammatory response in male mice, the response in females is biased toward the upregulation of -like markers in white adipose tissue. In contrast, loss of Siah2 leads to increased whitening of brown fat in males, but not in females. This corresponded to increased expression of markers of inflammation (F4/80, Ccl2) and thermogenic genes (Pgc1alpha, Dio2, Ucp-1) and proteins (PGC-1α, UCP-1) in females. Contrary to expectations, increased expression of thermogenic markers in females was coupled with a downregulation of ERalpha and ERRgamma protein levels.The most striking sex-related effect of Siah2 deficiency is reduced whitening of brown fat in high-fat-fed females. Protection from accumulating unilocular adipocytes in the brown fat corresponds to increased expression of thermogenic genes and proteins in female, but not in male mice. These results raise the possibility that Siah2 contributes to the estrogen-related effects on brown fat function in males and females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28582862>Midlife  Profile and the Risk of Late-Life Cognitive Decline.</a></h2><p>Among  components, the effects of higher plasma glucose levels on cognitive decline (CD) have been considered in few studies. We evaluated the associations among midlife glycemia, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, midlife insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-index)], and CD in the older subjects of the population-based MICOL Study (Castellana Grotte, Italy) at baseline (M1) and at follow-ups seven () and twenty years later (M3). At M1, a dementia risk score and a composite cardiovascular risk score for dementia were calculated. For 797 subjects out of 833, we obtained a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at M3, subdividing these subjects in three cognitive functioning subgroups: normal cognition, mild CD, and moderate-severe CD. Mean fasting glycemia at baseline was significantly higher in moderate-severe CD subgroup (114.6±71.4 mg/dl) than in the normal cognition subgroup (101.2±20.6). Adjusting for gender, age, and other  components, higher fasting glycemia values both at M1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.59] and  (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.01-1.57) were associated with an increased risk of moderate-severe CD. Mean HOMA index value was significantly higher in the moderate-severe CD subgroup (5.7±9.4) compared to the normal cognition subgroup (2.9±1.4) at M1. The dementia risk probability (MMSE < 24) increased moving through higher categories of the dementia risk score and decreased as long as the cardiovascular score increased. The present findings highlighted the indication to control blood glucose levels, regardless of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, as early as midlife for prevention of late-life dementia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30411703>Screening for hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A transient elastography study.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential usefulness of transient elastography (TE), which is a technique that allows measuring both fibrosis and liver fat content simultaneously, as a screening tool for hepatic involvement in Turkish patients with T2DM.We obtained liver stiffness measurements (LSMs, as a measure of fibrosis) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP, as a marker of steatosis) in 124 (46 males and 78 females; mean body mass index (BMI): 33.2±6.6 kg/) Turkish patients with T2DM. The prevalence rates of overweight, obesity, and  in our sample were 28.2%, 64.5%, and 77.4%, respectively. Probe-specific LSM cut-off values were used to define advanced fibrosis (>F3) and cirrhosis (F4) (M probe: F3=9.6-11.4 kPa, F4 >11.5 kPa and XL probe: F3=9.3-10.9 kPa, F4 >11.0 kPa). Mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were defined as CAP 222-232 dB/m, CAP 233-289 dB/m, and CAP >290 dB/m, respectively.Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were identified in 21 (16.9%) and 10 (8.0%) patients, respectively. TE-defined hepatic steatosis (CAP>222 dB/m) was detected in 117 (94.3%) patients. Mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were identified in 0, 29, and 88 patients, respectively.TE is a useful non-invasive imaging modality to screen for liver involvement in Turkish patients with T2DM. High rates of TE-defined fibrosis and steatosis in our sample reflect the presence of an elevated mean BMI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053855>Rare GABRA3 variants are associated with epileptic seizures, encephalopathy and dysmorphic features.</a></h2><p>Genetic epilepsies are caused by mutations in a range of different genes, many of them encoding ion channels, receptors or transporters. While the number of detected variants and genes increased dramatically in the recent years, pleiotropic effects have also been recognized, revealing that clinical syndromes with various degrees of severity arise from a single gene, a single mutation, or from different mutations showing similar functional defects. Accordingly, several genes coding for GABAA receptor subunits have been linked to a spectrum of benign to severe epileptic disorders and it was shown that a loss of function presents the major correlated pathomechanism. Here, we identified six variants in GABRA3 encoding the α3-subunit of the GABAA receptor. This gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and has not been previously associated with human disease. Five missense variants and one microduplication were detected in four families and two sporadic cases presenting with a range of epileptic seizure types, a varying degree of intellectual disability and developmental delay, sometimes with dysmorphic features or nystagmus. The variants co-segregated mostly but not completely with the phenotype in the families, indicating in some cases incomplete penetrance, involvement of other genes, or presence of phenocopies. Overall, males were more severely affected and there were three asymptomatic female mutation carriers compared to only one male without a clinical phenotype. X-chromosome inactivation studies could not explain the phenotypic variability in females. Three detected missense variants are localized in the extracellular GABA-binding NH2-terminus, one in the -M3 linker and one in the M4 transmembrane segment of the α3-subunit. Functional studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed a variable but significant reduction of GABA-evoked anion currents for all mutants compared to wild-type receptors. The degree of current reduction correlated partially with the phenotype. The microduplication disrupted GABRA3 expression in fibroblasts of the affected patient. In summary, our results reveal that rare loss-of-function variants in GABRA3 increase the risk for a varying combination of epilepsy, intellectual disability/developmental delay and dysmorphic features, presenting in some pedigrees with an X-linked inheritance pattern.© The Author (2017).

Mets was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III report (ATPIII) criteria. Participants were categorized into four cardiometabolic phenotypes including metabolically healthy Lean (MHL), metabolically unhealthy lean (MUHL), metabolically healthy Obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) according to BMI cut-off point (25 kg/ ), and the presence of Mets.  Totally, the prevalence of Mets was 33.20% with the higher prevalence in women (40.1%). About 46.7% of participants were MHO and 1.6% of them were MHL. In both genders, MUHL had the highest prevalence of hyperglycemia, hypertrigliceridemia, hypo-HDL-cholestrolemia and Frahmingham 10-year CVD risk. In both MUHL and MUHO phenotypes, hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 31.97 [95% CI: 22.31, 45.81] and OR: 20.28 [95% CI: 17.32, 23.75]) and hypo-HDL cholestrolemia (OR:27.97 [95% CI: 17.35, 45.09] and OR:11.0 [95% CI: 9.62, 12.58]) are the strongest predictor of incidence of Mets. Also, the results of multinominal regression analyses indicated that in all cardiometabolic phenotypes, Framingham 10- year CVD risks had the lowest power for predicting of Mets incidence.  Based on the results, in addition to obese individuals, multiple  abnormalities were seen in normal weight individuals and these subjects are even at higher risk of developing Mets compared with metabolically obese individuals. So, it seems that decision on initiation of lifestyle interventions should not be only based on the BMI; rather  status seems to be even more important.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30113645>Sex Differences in the Prenatal Programming of Adult  by Maternal Androgens.</a></h2><p>Growing preclinical evidence suggests that hormonal programming by androgens in utero may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk in adult offspring. However, the effect of prenatal androgens on cardiometabolic outcomes in the human population, especially their potential differential impact on male vs female offspring, has not been well studied.Adult offspring (n = 274) of mothers enrolled in the New England birth cohorts of the Collaborative Perinatal Project were assessed at ages 39 to 50. Androgen bioactivity was measured in maternal serum during the third trimester using a receptor-mediated luciferase expression bioassay.  (MetS) using Adult Treatment Panel III criteria was assessed in adult offspring. Bioactive androgens were analyzed as quartiles, with the lowest quartile (Q1) defined as the reference. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the relationship of maternal bioactive androgens on offspring MetS risk overall and by sex, controlling for potential confounders and intrafamilial correlation.Mean age and body mass index of adult offspring were 44.7 ± 2.6 years and 29.7 ± 6.7 kg/, respectively. Participants born to mothers with the highest quartile (Q4) compared with Q1 of bioactive androgens had higher risk for MetS [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.53(1.07 to 6.02)]. Stratified by sex, this association was found to be significant among women [Q4 vs Q1; aOR: 4.06 (1.10 to 14.93)] but not men [Q4 vs Q1; aOR: 1.67 (0.53 to 5.26)]. Women born to mothers with the highest levels of maternal bioactive androgens also demonstrated a 4.84-fold increased odds for having hypertension [Q4 vs Q1; aOR: 4.84 (1.12 to 20.85)].Higher levels of maternal androgens were associated with increased risk for incident MetS in adult offspring, an effect that was significant in women but not men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322084>[Own and Parental Predictors of Hypertriglyceridemia in Children of Persons with Early Ischemic Heart Disease].</a></h2><p>to elucidate predictors of high level of basal triglycerides (TG) in blood of children of persons with early (onset: men ≤55, women ≤60 years) ischemic heart disease (EIHD).We examined 316 families: patients (probands) (n=295; 77.9 % after MI) with EIHD, their spouses (n=219; 83.1 % women) and native children of probands (n=413; 55.7 % men) aged 5-38 years.

PCOS Odense University Hospital (PCOS OUH, n = 1146) was an embedded cohort of women with PCOS and clinical and biochemical examination. Three age-matched controls were included for each woman with PCOS (n = 54,757). The main outcome measures were thyroid disease (hypothyroidism, Graves' disease, goiter, thyroiditis) according to hospital diagnosis codes and/or inferred from filled medicine prescriptions. Associations between baseline TSH and development of cardio- disease was examined in PCOS OUH.The median (quartiles) age at inclusion was 29 (23-35) years and follow-up duration was 11.1 (6.9-16.0) years. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for thyroid disease development was 2.5 (2.3-2.7) (P < 0.001). The event rate of thyroid disease was 6.0 per 1000 patient-years in PCOS Denmark versus 2.4 per 1000 patient-years in controls (P < 0.001). Women in PCOS OUH with TSH ≥2.5 mIU/L (n = 133) had higher BMI (median 29 vs 27 kg/), wider waist, higher triglycerides and free testosterone by the time of PCOS diagnosis compared to women in PCOS OUH with TSH <2.5 mIU/L (n = 588).

Among these, an elevated waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), ie a value higher than 0.5, that may identify abnormality, independently from height. An elevated WHtR provided the best correlation with MetS in a prior study in a large Italian population. In order to assess the validity of this conclusion, a long-term follow-up study re-examined this population, also in order to detect possible associations with cardiovascular (CV) risk.1,071 subjects with a complete follow-up of over 6 years were evaluated with a comparative assessment of the three anthropometric variables, namely WHtR, WC and body mass index (BMI). WHtR≥ 0.5 had the highest sensitivity for the identification of MetS, both in males and females (94.1% and 86.7% respectively). WHtR was of reduced specificity, occurring, yet less frequently (17.7% in males and 30% in females), in patients without MetS. By contrast, enlarged WC occurred with a lower frequency in male patients who developed MetS (30.2%) whereas in females, frequency was higher than in males (69.3%). Finally, a BMI≥ 25 kg/ had intermediate sensitivity and specificity regardless of gender. WC showed the highest odds ratio (2.62, 95%CI: 1.18-5.78) for the prediction of CV occurrence.The present study confirms WHtR as an excellent screening tool in identifying MetS carriers, but, different from reports in other countries, it shows a lower specificity in our population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624500>Homocysteine is the confounding factor of -confirmed by siMS score.</a></h2><p>Abdominal adiposity has a central role in developing insulin resistance (IR) by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Patients with  (MS) have higher values of homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia correlates with IR, increasing the oxidative stress. Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and atherosclerosis. The objective of the study was to examine the correlation of homocysteine with siMS score and siMS risk score and with other MS co-founding factors.The study included 69 obese individuals (age over 30, body mass index [BMI] >25 kg/), classified into two groups: I-with MS (33 patients); II-without MS (36 patients). Measurements included: anthropometric parameters, lipids, glucose regulation parameters and inflammation parameters. IR was determined by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). ATP III classification was applied for diagnosing MS. SiMS score was used as continuous measure of .A significant difference between groups was found for C-reactive protein (CRP) (p<0.01) apolipoprotein (Apo) B, HOMA-IR and acidum uricum (p<0.05). siMS risk score showed a positive correlation with homocysteine (p=0.023), while siMS score correlated positively with fibrinogen (p=0.013), CRP and acidum uricum (p=0.000) and homocysteine (p=0.08). Homocysteine correlated positively with ApoB (p=0.036), HbA1c (p=0.047), HOMA-IR (p=0.008) and negatively with ApoE (p=0.042).Correlation of siMS score with homocysteine, fibrinogen, CRP and acidum uricum indicates that they are co-founding factors of MS. siMS risk score correlation with homocysteine indicates that hyperhomocysteinemia increases with age.

The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate whether a Mediterranean (MD) or low-fat diet (LF) reduce weight and general health in survivors of stage 1-3 breast cancer through a six-month, six-session education package to support dietary change. A control dietary arm received no intervention. Outcome measures for weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood lipids, blood glucose, dietary adherence, 3-day food diary, and PREDIMED questionnaire and quality of life were assessed. Both dietary intervention arms, on average, lost weight over the course of the intervention, with significant (p < 0.05) decreases seen in BMI and waist circumference measurements. The control arm gained weight and significantly (p < 0.05) increased BMI and waist circumference measurements overall (1.10 ± 3.03 kg, 0.40 ± 1.65 kg/, and 1.94 ± 2.94 cm respectively).

Herein, we report the potential of 7, 8-diacetoxy-4-methylthiocoumarin (DAMTC) to mitigate RIII following total-body irradiation (TBI) in C57BL/6 mice and underlying mechanisms. Administration of DAMTC 24 hours post TBI facilitated structural reconstitution and restoration of functional absorption linked to alleviation of radiation-induced apoptotic death of intestinal crypt progenitor/stem (ICPS) and villus stromal cells through induction of Bcl-2 family-mediated anti-apoptotic signalling. Reduction in TBI-induced DNA damage accumulation coupled with inhibition of cell cycle arrest through stimulation of anti-p53- and anti-p21-dependent synergistic signalling protected ICPS cells from radiation injury. Enhanced proliferation of crypt stem cells, induction of anti-oxidant defence, subjugation of TBI-induced lipid peroxidation and phenotypic polarization of intestinal macrophages to anti-inflammatory  class underlie amelioration of RIII. Stimulation of multiple mitigative signalling processes by DAMTC appeared to be associated with enhanced protein acetylation, an important regulator of cellular responses to radiation damage. Our findings establish the mitigative potential of DAMTC against RIII by hyper-acetylation-mediated epigenetic regulation, which triggers axes of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival pathways, enabling proliferation and maintenance of ICPS cells leading to epithelial regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30701811>The role of systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and  in patients with chronic hepatitis C.</a></h2><p>To determine the role of nonspecific inflammation in the formation of IR and  in patients with chronic hepatitis C.The study included 205 patients with CHC aged 18 to 69 years.

Insulin resistance was assessed via the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (primary endpoint) and confirmed by [6-6-2H2]-glucose-labeled, 2-step hyperinsulinemic clamp (n = 20). Clinically relevant cardiometabolic endpoints [including flow-mediated dilatation, augmentation index, lipoprotein status (by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), and nitric oxide (NO)-related metabolite assay] and anthocyanin metabolism were assessed.A daily intake of 1 cup of blueberries improved endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation: +1.45%; 95% CI: 0.83%, 2.1%; P = 0.003), systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index: -2.24%; 95% CI: -3.97%, -0.61%; P = 0.04) and attenuated cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations.

Taking into account the ethnic differences, this study aimed to determine the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices in predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in Ahvaz.This study is part of a cohort study conducted at the Diabetes Research Center of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences on a population of over 20 in Ahvaz during 2009-2014. Of the 592 patients, 505 patients who were not diagnosed with MetS in 2009, were entered into this study. The data analyzed involved demographic information including age and sex, anthropometric information including height, weight, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and the ratios between them, laboratory data including blood levels of Triglyceride (TG), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and clinical data including systolic(S) and diastolic(D)blood pressure(BP). After 5 years, the subjects were re-evaluated for MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria and the most appropriate cut-off points of anthropometric indices for the prediction of the incidence of MetS using the Receiver Operative Characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained.Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) index with a cut-off point of 0.53 followed by WC with a cut-off point of 87.5 cm had the highest power to predict the incidence of MetS. The cut-off points of WC and Body mass index (BMI) were respectively 89.5 cm and 26 kg/ for men, and 83.5 cm and 27.5 kg/ for women. All anthropometric indices were able to predict the components of this  (with the exception of low HDL-C). The cut-off point of WC in predicting High FBS, High TG and High BP was 84.5, 84.8, and 86.5 cm, respectively.Overall, it seems that given its ease of measurement, the WC index is preferred to other indices for predicting the incidence of MetS and its components in clinical screening.Copyright © 2019 Diabetes India.

Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the  pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the  processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen. M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites.

T2DM remission, weight loss, postoperative nutrition status, and complications at 1- and 3-year follow-up were assessed. Remission of T2DM was defined as a fasting blood glucose <7 mmol/L and HbA1C <6.5% for 1 year without pharmacological intervention.At 1-year follow-up after LDJB-SG, the T2D remission rate was 75% (21/28), and the mean total weight loss was 23.6%. The 3-year T2D remission rate and percent of total weight loss were 68.4% (13/19) and 20.3%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that duration of T2D was the only risk factor associated with T2D remission (P < .05). LDJB-SG improved the  by increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = .0157), decreasing waist circumference (P < .0001), and decreasing triglycerides (P = .0053). Postoperative complications of LDJB-SG included malodorous flatus (64.3%), accidental diarrhea induced by greasy food (57.1%), de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (28.6%), anemia (25%), fatigue (21.4%), underweight (17.9%), intolerance to cooked rice (10.7%), constipation (7.1%), and steatorrhea (3.6%).LDJB-SG resulted in acceptable T2D remission and  improvement at 1- and 3-year follow-up in Chinese T2D patients with a BMI of 20 to 32.5 kg/m. T2D duration may serve as the predictor of T2D remission. LDJB-SG should be performed with caution because of the high incidence of postoperative complications.Copyright © 2019.

The literature has suggested that these donors have increased risks postdonation. Not surprising, the threshold for living kidney donor approval among obese persons is typically higher and the process more costly. Therefore, a screening tool to predict the likelihood of approval among obese living kidney donor candidates was created.A single-center retrospective study was performed among obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/) living kidney donor candidates evaluated in clinic (January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017). Approved candidates were compared with those not approved using multivariable logistic regression, and a prediction tool was generated.Among 389 obese living kidney donor candidates, there were no significant differences in sex or race and ethnicity by approval status. However, nonapproved candidates had a higher prevalence of . In the prediction model, glucose impairment and hypertension were most predictive of nonapproval.Among obese living kidney donor candidates, several  components were associated with decreased odds of approval. This tool may serve as a useful initial screening for obese living kidney donor candidates, permitting more cost-effective evaluation processes. The tool could also be used to promote expeditious interventions in the preclinical setting, including weight management programs, to improve the likelihood of donation and postdonation outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This nonrandomized, therapeutic, open, single-arm study investigated the effects of progressive resistance training (PRT) on obesity indices in women with PCOS, and the relationship between obesity indices and telomere content.A total of 45 women with PCOS and 52 with non-PCOS (controls), aged 18 to 37 years, with body mass indexes of 18 to 39.9 kg/, performed three 1-hour sessions of PRT per week, for 16 weeks. Before and after PRT, measures included anthropometric indices and regions of interest of fat mass distribution, quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry,  and hormonal parameters, and telomere content. The general linear mixed models were used to determine the effects of PRT.PRT did reduce the waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, and the index of conicity among PCOS (P < .01). However, PRT did not influence regions of interest, body mass index, and WHR. After PRT, the telomere content was associated with regions of interest and anthropometric indices in whole group independent of PCOS (P < .05).Resistance exercise improves obesity indices in PCOS, independent of changes in body weight, and the relationship between telomeres and obesity parameters in PCOS remain to be fully clarified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29199785>Acute effect of moderate-intensity concentric and eccentric exercise on cardiac effort, perceived exertion and interleukin-6 level in physically inactive males.</a></h2><p>Muscle-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6) not only enhances glucose and fat metabolism but also has an anti-inflammatory effect that can prevent the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and .

Kallikrein 7 (KLK7) is the first known protease target inhibited by vaspin and a potential target for the treatment of  disorders. Here, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of KLK7 in adipose tissue may beneficially affect glucose metabolism and adipose tissue function. Therefore, we have inactivated the Klk7 gene in adipose tissue using conditional gene-targeting strategies in mice. Klk7-deficient mice (ATKlk7 ) exhibited less weight gain, predominant expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue and improved whole body insulin sensitivity under a high fat diet (HFD). ATKlk7  mice displayed higher energy expenditure and food intake, most likely due to altered adipokine secretion including lower circulating leptin. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was significantly reduced in combination with an increased percentage of alternatively activated (anti-inflammatory)  macrophages in epigonadal adipose tissue of ATKlk7 . Taken together, by attenuating adipose tissue inflammation, altering adipokine secretion and epigonadal adipose tissue expansion, Klk7 deficiency in adipose tissue partially ameliorates the adverse effects of HFD-induced obesity. In summary, we provide first evidence for a previously unrecognized role of KLK7 in adipose tissue with effects on whole body energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27702736>A huge ovarian mucinous cystadenoma associated with contralateral teratoma and polycystic ovary  in an obese adolescent girl.</a></h2><p>A 13-year-old, obese girl presented with acute abdominal pain with abdominal distension for a year.

We compared 2 oral fat meal tests (LIPOLD: 149g of fat, 56g of carbohydrates and 11.7g of proteins administrated per 2m2 of body surface) and LIPOTEST: 75g of fat, 25g of carbohydrates and 10g of protein with the addition of 15g common sugar) with regard to changes in triglycerides (TGs) as well as other cardiometabolic parameters between baseline and 4 h after the meals.We studied 21 men [median age (interquartile range; IQR) = 65 (16) years] with well-controlled T2DM [median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (IQR) = 6.6 (0.9) %]. All participants performed the meals with 1 week interval between the 2 meals.Median (IQR) TG differences in mg/dl were 86 (100) and 46 (60) for LIPOLD and LIPOTEST meals, respectively, whereas the % differences in TGs were 105 (105) and 48 (55), respectively. The differences (in mg/dl and %) between TGs before ingesting the test meal and after 4h were significant for both LIPOLD and LIPOTEST meals (p = 0.003 for mg/dl differences and p = 0.005 for % differences). Patients who had a positive response to the LIPOLD meal (i.e. TGs > 220 mg/dl at 4 h) also had increased postprandial TGs with LIPOTEST. The Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) correlated with TG differences (in mg/dl) following the LIPOLD meal consumption (Spearman's rho = (+) 0.527, p = 0.02). C-peptide correlated with TG differences (in mg/dl) following the LIPOTEST meal consumption (Spearman's rho = (+) 0.538, p = 0.032). There were no differences in TGs and glucose response postprandially in both testing meals according to body mass index (except for TGs between tertile 21.3-24.5 and 25-26.8 kg/, p=0.046, in LPOTEST group) and body surface area.An oral fat tolerance test (OFTT), which contains 75g fat, and represents the everyday habits of Western societies, could provide additional information regarding the postprandial state of the individuals with well-controlled T2DM. The consumption of meals with very high fat content may lead to over diagnosing PPL. TG differences after the consumption of a high fat meal correlated with HOMA-IR. This may be useful to evaluate the role of HOMA-IR in T2DM patients. A standardized the OFTT will help clinicians to better define postprandial TG abnormalities, leading to more appropriate therapeutic options to improve postprandial dysmetabolism.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689902>Clinical Features of Nonobese, Apparently Healthy, Japanese Men With Reduced Adipose Tissue Insulin Sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue insulin resistance has been observed in obese subjects and is considered an early  defect that precedes insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Although Asians can readily develop  disease without obesity, the clinical features of nonobese, apparently healthy, Asians with reduced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (ATIS) have not been elucidated.To investigate the clinical parameters associated with reduced ATIS in nonobese, apparently healthy (body mass index <25 kg/), Japanese men.We studied 52 nonobese Japanese men without cardiometabolic risk factors. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with a glucose tracer, we evaluated the insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. ATIS was calculated as the percentage of free fatty acid (FFA) suppression/insulin concentration during the first step of the glucose clamp.Using the median ATIS value, the subjects were divided into low- and high-FFA suppression groups. The low-FFA suppression group had moderate fat accumulation in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver. Compared with the high-FFA group, they also had a lower fitness level, decreased insulin clearance, impaired insulin sensitivity in muscle, moderately elevated triglycerides, and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. All these factors correlated significantly with ATIS. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was comparable between the two groups.In nonobese, apparently healthy, Japanese men, reduced ATIS was associated with moderate fat accumulation in subcutaneous fat and liver, lower insulin clearance, muscle insulin resistance, and moderate lipedema. These data suggest that reduced ATIS can occur early in the development of the , even in nonobese, apparently healthy, men.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323956>Hyperhomocysteinemia Promotes Insulin Resistance and Adipose Tissue Inflammation in PCOS Mice Through Modulating  Macrophage Polarization via Estrogen Suppression.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels are higher in women with polycystic ovary  (PCOS). However, the specific role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in the development of PCOS has never been reported. Adipose tissue inflammation is featured by the infiltration of macrophages, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of glucose and insulin intolerance. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and/or a high methionine diet to induce PCOS and HHcy mice models. We showed that DHEA induced a PCOS-like phenotypes, irregular estrous cycles, weight gain, abnormal sex hormone production, glucose and insulin resistance, and polycystic ovaries. HHcy further intensified the effects DHEA on the , endocrinal, hormonal, and morphological changes in PCOS-like mice. In addition, HHcy attenuated the DHEA-induced increase in serum estrogen levels in mice. Furthermore, HHcy may exacerbate the insulin resistance in PCOS-like mice, most likely through modulating the macrophage M1/ polarization pathways via the suppression of estrogen. Most important, our clinical data showed that there were increases in serum Hcy levels in patients with PCOS. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathological roles of HHcy in the development of PCOS and provide a promising target for PCOS therapy in clinical application.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635811>Short-Term Outcomes of Sleeve Gastrectomy plus Jejunojejunal Bypass: a Retrospective Comparative Study with Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Chinese Patients with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery represents the most effective treatment for obesity and its related comorbidities.

Participants were categorised into six mutually exclusive groups according to the BMI-MetS status: normal weight (BMI: ≤ 18.5to < 24.0 kg/) without MetS (MH-NW), normal weight with MetS (MUH-NW), overweight (BMI: ≤ 24.0to < 28.0 kg/) without MetS (MH-OW), overweight with MetS (MUH-OW), obese (BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/) without MetS (MHO) and obese with MetS (MUO). The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI was calculated for the incidence of MI using a multivariable Cox model. Results A total of 6745 (7.34%) individuals were classified as MHO. During a median 8-year follow-up, 1167 (1.27%) participants developed MI. The MHO group had an increased risk of MI (HR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37-2.25) in comparison with the MH-NW group after adjusting for potential confounding variables.

However, to date, the contribution of SIM1 mutations to the obesity phenotype has only been studied in a few populations. In this study, we screened the functional regions of SIM1 in severely obese children of Slovak and Moravian descent to determine if genetic variants within SIM1 may influence the development of obesity in these populations.The SIM1 promoter region, exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced in 126 unrelated obese children and adolescents (2-18 years of age) and 41 adult lean controls of Slovak and Moravian origin. Inclusion criteria for the children and adolescents were a body mass index standard deviation score higher than 2 SD for an appropriate age and sex, and obesity onset at less than 5 years of age. The clinical phenotypes of the SIM1 variant carriers were compared with clinical phenotypes of 4 MC4R variant carriers and with 27 unrelated SIM1 and MC4R mutation negative obese controls that were matched for age and gender.Seven previously described SIM1 variants and one novel heterozygous variant p.D134N were identified. The novel variant was predicted to be pathogenic by 7 in silico software analyses and is located at a highly conserved position of the SIM1 protein.

The results were polled as mean difference (MD), standardized MD (SMD) and hazard ratio (HR).Overall, 921 studies were retrieved, and 31 duplicated studies were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 80 studies were eligible for full text reading. Of those, 23 studies remained for qualitative synthesis. With the exception of one study, all studies were considered high quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS; score ≥6). Meta-analysis was performed in 21 studies, with a total of 31 383 women with PCOS and 102 797 controls. Women with PCOS with BMI <27 kg/ had lower BMD of the total femur (MD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.00; I2 = 31%; P = 0.22) and spine (MD, -0.07; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.01; I2 = 70%; P < 0.01) when compared with the control group, whereas for women with BMI ≥27 kg/ no difference was observed (femur: MD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.05; I2 = 20%, P = 0.29; spine: MD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.06 to 0.05; I2 = 0%; P = 0.84). Osteocalcin was remarkably reduced in women with PCOS with BMI <27 kg/ (SMD, -2.68; 95% CI, -4.70 to -0.67; I2 = 98%; P < 0.01), but in women with BMI ≥27 kg/, there were no differences between PCOS and controls. Few studies (n = 3) addressed the incidence of bone fractures in women with PCOS. The HR for total bone fractures did not identify differences between women with PCOS and controls.On the basis of the available evidence, it is possible to assume that PCOS in women with BMI <27 kg/ is associated with reduced BMD in the spine and femur, and decreased bone formation, as manifested by lower levels of circulating osteocalcin. These findings suggest that bone parameters in PCOS may be linked, to some extent, to adiposity. These studies included premenopausal women, who have already achieved peak bone mass. Hence, further prospective studies are necessary to clarify the existence of increased risk of fractures in women with PCOS.© The Author(s) 2019.

Qualitative assessment of the diets on the basis of 216 menus was performed based on the analysis of 3-day food diaries and food records taken from the last 24-hour dietary interview. Diets quality assessment was made using three types of point tests: Szewczyński’s Diets’ classification (SDC), Bielińska’s Test with Kulesza’s modification (BTK), Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI).Average waist-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) was above the standard 0.91± 0.08 and 29.16 ± 5.8 kg/. Qualitative analysis performed with point tests SDC, BT-K and HDI revealed that the majority of the diets were composed inappropriately, containing many mistakes. Statistically significant correlations (Pearson’s) were determined between HDI test and the body weight and BMI. When analyzing the type of the meals also the correlations (Spearman’s) between BMI and BMI category in BT-K test.Mistakes in diets of women with PCOS are the cause of  disorders related to improper function of ovaries.

In recent years, intestinal inflammation has been suggested to contribute to obesity related  and targeting gut inflammation with 5-ASA improves diet induced IR, however, its role in dyslipidemia is unknown and has never been explored. In the present study, we reported for the first time that administration of 5-ASA for 12 weeks significantly improved lipid profile by repressing plasma triglycerides and free cholesterol levels in mice fed high-fat cholesterol diet (HFC). In addition, liver lipids were significantly reduced by 5-ASA treatment in HFC-fed mice. Mechanistically, anti-inflammatory genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparγ) and  marker, such as Mrc1 and Ym1, were remarkably upregulated, while pro-inflammation gene monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (Mcp-1) were downregulated in small intestine of mice treated by 5-ASA. Further, 5-ASA improved gastrointestinal barrier by increasing the expression of the tight junction marker ZO-1. 5-ASA also enhanced cholesterol translocation by elevating genes expression of Npc1l1 and Abcg5/8. Moreover, mice fed HFC 5-ASA expressed increased Pparα in small intestinal and its target genes function in lipid oxidation and hydrolysis were remarkable elevated.

Although it has been speculated that kidney function decline associated with elevated adiponectin is attributable to decreased renal clearance and compensatory responses to adiponectin resistance, it is unclear how elevated adiponectin affects clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and whether the effects are the same as those in the general population. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether the association between serum adiponectin levels and clinical outcomes in non-diabetic CKD patients is independent of adiposity and . We enrolled 196 non-diabetic CKD patients with eGFR ranging between 10 and 60 mL/min/1.73 , these patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of . The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or renal events (renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy [RRT] or 50% reduction in eGFR). During the mean follow-up period of 5 years, 48 (24.5%) incident cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were observed, and 33 (16.8%) deaths occurred. The mean eGFR was 29.8 ± 12.8 mL/min/1.73m2. The baseline median adiponectin concentration in the cohort was 29.4(interquartile range, 13.3-108.7) μg/ml. Adiponectin levels were inversely related to body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.29; P < 0.001) and waist circumference (r = -0.35; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted Cox regression model, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 2.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-4.02; P = 0.03) for RRT and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.03-2.65; P = 0.04) for composite renal outcome. The risks remained consistent within different subgroups. However, no association was observed with mortality risk. In conclusion, higher adiponectin levels are associated with a higher risk of ESRD independent of conventional risk factors, BMI, and  components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498351>Effect of increased calcium consumption from fat-free milk in an energy-restricted diet on the  and cardiometabolic outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomised cross-over clinical trial.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of high-Ca fat-free milk phase (MD) (prescription of approximately 1500 mg of Ca/d) v. low-Ca phase (CD) (prescription of approximately 800 mg of Ca/d) in an energy-restricted diet on the  (MetS) and cardiometabolic measures in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and low habitual Ca consumption (<600 mg/d).

Macrophages have different functions and transcriptional profiles, but all are required for maintaining homeostasis. It is well known that macrophages play a key role in inflammation and early atherogenesis, and are present in two phenotypes: pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (). Osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (oc-stamp) is a multiple-pass transmembrane protein; however, its function remains unclear. In this study, we explored the role of oc-stamp in macrophages physiology. The results showed that oc-stamp was notably decreased under LPS and IFN-γ stimulation, while it was increased with IL-4 treatment. Furthermore, oc-stamp induced a phenotypic switch in macrophage polarization, suppressing the M1 pro-inflammatory state in the overexpression group, and promoting the M1 pro-inflammatory state in the knockdown group. Further study revealed that oc-stamp regulated macrophage polarization possibly via STAT6. Taken together, our results are the first to demonstrate that oc-stamp may play an important role in macrophage polarization and inhibit the M1 pro-inflammatory state.© The Author 2017.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory  macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by  pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological  closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic fat accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic fat deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing lipid metabolism and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage lipid metabolism and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581238>Role of dysfunctional adipocytes in cholesterol-induced nonobese .</a></h2><p>Many studies have reported the causes of obese  (MS); however, the causes of nonobese MS (NMS) remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused  problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of -type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol. Together, our findings indicate that inflamed dysfunctional adipocytes are critical in NMS, supporting the development of anti-inflammatory agents as potential therapeutic drugs for treating NMS.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859179>Pentraxin 3 deficiency protects from the  inflammation associated to diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>Low-grade chronic inflammation characterizes obesity and . Here, we aim at investigating the impact of the acute-phase protein long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on the immune-inflammatory response occurring during diet-induced obesity.PTX3 deficiency in mice fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks protects from weight gain and adipose tissue deposition in visceral and subcutaneous depots. This effect is not related to changes in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism but is associated with an improved immune cell phenotype in the adipose tissue of Ptx3 deficient animals, which is characterized by -macrophages polarization and increased angiogenesis. These findings are recapitulated in humans where carriers of a PTX3 haplotype (PTX3 h2/h2 haplotype), resulting in lower PTX3 plasma levels, presented with a reduced prevalence of obesity and decreased abdominal adiposity compared with non-carriers.Our results support a critical role for PTX3 in the onset of obesity by promoting inflammation and limiting adipose tissue vascularization and delineate PTX3 targeting as a valuable strategy for the treatment of adipose tissue-associated inflammatory response.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

No restriction was applied for language or publication status.Six studies involving 252 participants were included. Women with PCOS and OSA had significantly higher body mass index (mean difference [MD]: 6.01 kg/, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 4.69-7.33), waist circumference (MD: 10.93 cm, 95% CI: 8.03-13.83), insulin resistance, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and worse lipids' profile and impaired glucose regulation compared with women with PCOS without OSA. Most studies did not adjust for weight in their between-groups analysis. Total and free testosterone levels were not significantly different between the two groups. The majority of studies were found to be at high risk of selection bias, did not account for important confounders, were conducted in one country (United States), and used different methodologies to assess testosterone levels (preventing a meta-analysis for this specific outcome).OSA is associated with obesity and worse  profiles in women with PCOS.

Some simple anthropometric measurements such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), may link to increased risk of dyslipidemia. However, diverse results were found in different population studies. We focused on the associations between these measurements and dyslipidemia in non-obese (BMI <28kg/) population aged more than 40 years.Cross-sectional study of 4185 non-obese adults aged more than 40 years was conducted in Nanchang, Jiangxi province, China. Questionnaire, anthropometric and laboratory tests were conducted. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) criteria were used to define high total cholesterol (TC), high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia. The overall prevalence of high TC, high LDL-C, low HDL-C, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia were 15.68%, 27.98%, 20.12%, 44.01%, 21.98% and 49.06% respectively.

In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut microbiota in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the microbiota modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut microbiota, most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the microbiota alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the microbiota by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Among men, the areas for BF%% and BMI were the same (0.81, 95% CI: 0.76; 0.85) and were greater than that of BAI. The best OI cutoff points to identify the presence of MetS in women and men were, respectively: 24.97 and 25.36 kg/ for BMI, 34.30 and 26.14% for BAI, and 37.7 and 23.8% for BF%.

Microglia cells are the main actors in the AD process: stimuli from the microenvironment may induce microglia cells to switch to a classically activated inflammatory phenotype M1, or, on the contrary to an alternatively activated  phenotype characterized by the secretion of different types of cytokines. Many attempts are currently being made in order to delay the progression of AD by reducing inflammatory mechanisms underlying the disease. Several studies support a relationship among neuroinflammation and nutrients, foods or dietary patterns, taking into account the synergistic or antagonistic biochemical interactions among nutrients as well as the different food sources of the same nutrient. Natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds found in plant foods, such as fruits, particularly berries (such as strawberry, blueberry, blackcurrant, blackberry, blueberry and mulberry) have been shown to exert neuroprotective activity. It is still unclear whether the dietary bioactive compounds enter the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) playing a direct antiinflammatory or pro-inflammatory effect on microglia and/or other Central Nervous System (CNS) cells. Another hypothesis is that they may trigger a peripheral reaction that induce indirectly a CNS' response. The subsequent synthesis of cytokines may drive microglia polarization by different ways. So, via an indirect route microglia detects and responds to immune-to-brain signaling.This review summarizes current evidence about the potential mechanisms of the interaction among diet, neuroinflammation and AD.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120270>Independent and joint association of obesity and  with depression and inflammation.</a></h2><p>To investigate the separate and combined associations of obesity and  (MetS) with depression and the role of inflammation.Depression was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and was defined with a cutpoint of ≥10. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/ from measured height and weight. MetS was defined based on the American Heart Association consensus definition. Participants were divided into four groups: healthy normal weight (MHN), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUN), and  unhealthy obese (MUO). C-Reactive protein was assessed in a subsample.A total of 18,025 subjects were included in the analysis. Participants with MUO had the highest prevalence of depression compared with the MHN group (14.8% vs. 6.8, p < .001). While both obesity and MetS were independently associated with depression, there was a significant interaction between the two (p < .001), indicating that the associations of obesity and MetS with depression were synergistic. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, compared with the MHN group, the MUO group had the highest odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.30, 95% CI [2.03, 2.61]), followed by MHO group (OR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.30, 1.74]) and the MUN group (OR = 1.39, 95% CI [1.18, 1.64]). The MUO group also showed the highest level of C-reactive protein, and the latter partially mediated the effect between MUO and depressive symptoms (20.5% of the total effect).Both obesity and MetS are associated with depression independent of each other, but when present together, these conditions have a synergistic association with depression.

Recently, UA has been linked to LV Hypertrophy (LVH) and Diastolic Dysfunction (DD) in women with preserved Ejection Fraction (pEF) but not in corresponding men. We sought to assess if UA could predict indices of DD in hypertensive subjects with pEF independently of gender.We consecutively recruited 382 apparently healthy hypertensive subjects (age: 61.7±10.7, women: 61.3%, median EF: 64%). In 318 patients in sinus rhythm, LV mass-indexed to body surface area-was calculated (LVMI). LVH was set as an LVMI >116g/ or 96 g/ in men and women, respectively. The ratio of early transmitral peak velocity (E) to the mitral annular early diastolic velocity (Em) was used as an approximation of mean left atrial pressure (E/Em).UA [median (interquartile range): 5.4(2) mg/dl] independently predicted E/Em (adjusted coefficient: 1.01, p =0.026) while an interaction term between gender and UA was no significant (p=0.684). An ordinal score of DD was calculated taking into account increased E/Em, left atrium dilatation and LVH. Women with increased UA had 254% increased odds (adjusted OR=2.54, p=0.005) to be classified in the upper range of the DD score.In hypertensive subjects without HF, UA is independently associated with the presence of DD in both genders and correlates with its severity in women.

This technique has shown excellent weight loss and anti-diabetic effects in severely obese patients. In this retrospective study, we examined the clinical effects of LSG-DJB on mildly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) < 35 kg/m) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and analyzed factors contributing to the successful postoperative glycemic control.Seventy-two consecutive Japanese patients with T2DM with a BMI of < 35 kg/m who underwent LSG-DJB in a single institution from September 2007 to March 2015 were included for the study. Weight loss, safety, and the impact on T2DM and  were examined at 1 year after surgery when weight loss reaches an expected plateau. In addition, pre- and postoperative factors between those who achieved diabetes remission (remitters) and non-remitters were compared.The follow-up rate at 1 year after surgery was 93%. The mean percent total weight loss (%TWL) was 31.6 ± 8.8%, and the mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) dropped from 8.9 ± 1.5 to 6.4 ± 1.0%. There were four early- and seven late-severe complications (grade III-A or more based on the Clavien-Dindo classification), which account for the 1-year morbidity rate of 15%. There was no mortality. The complete (HbA1c of < 6% without diabetes medication) and partial (HbA1c of < 6.5% without diabetes medication) remission of T2DM was achieved in 31 and 49% of the patients, respectively. Positive impacts were also observed on hypertension and dyslipidemia. Consequently, the ratio of those who achieved the composite endpoint (HbA1c of < 7%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 100 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg) significantly increased from 4.2 to 22% (p = 0.003). Duration of T2DM and preoperative use of anti-hypertensive drugs were independent predictors of diabetes remission. Patients with a higher ABCD score were also at a higher rate of success in T2DM remission.LSG-DJB for T2DM patients with a BMI of < 35 kg/m is a feasible and effective surgical method in achieving moderate weight loss and excellent improvement of glycemic control, , and cardiovascular risk although the T2DM remission rate was lower compared with severely obese individuals.

In our study we investigated the expression levels of microRNAs and histone deacetylase enzymes via RT-qPCR in bone marrow specimens of adult patients suffering from hematological malignancies (total cohort n = 40), especially acute myeloid leukemia (n = 27). The levels of the three examined Warburg-effect related microRNAs (miR-378*, miR-23b, miR-26a) positively correlated with each other and the oncogenic miR-155 and miR-125b, while negatively with the level of the tumorsuppressor miR-124. Significant relationships have been confirmed between the levels of SIRT6, HDAC4 and the microRNAs listed above. In NPM1-mutated AML (n = 6), the level of miR-125b was significantly lower than in the group of AML patients not carrying this mutation (n = 13) (p < 0.05). In M5 FAB type of AML (n = 5), the level of miR-124 was significantly higher compared to the  group (n = 7) (p < 0.05). In two cases of FAB M5 AML, the levels of SIRT6 and miR-26a increased during the first 4 weeks of treatment. In the total cohort, white blood cell count at the time of the diagnosis significantly correlated with the levels of HDAC4, SIRT6, miR-124 and miR-26a. Our results suggest that Warburg-effect related microRNAs may have important role in the pathogenesis of leukemia, and the potential oncogenic property of HDAC4 and SIRT6 cannot be excluded in hematological malignancies. Elevated level of miR-125b can contribute to adverse prognosis of AML without NPM1 mutation.

In rodents and human patients, RYGB induces an increase in the gene and protein expression levels of the  isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in the jejunum.

Our data, however, revealed an unexpected finding and a potential new role of PKM2 for the natural history of  and NAFLD. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, RYGB-treated patients had decreased PKM2 blood levels compared with a well-matched group of patients with severe obesity before RYGB. Interestingly, PKM2 serum concentration correlated with body mass index before but not after the surgery. This prompted us to evaluate other potential mechanisms and sites of PKM2 regulation by the  and RYGB. We found that in patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the liver had increased PKM2 expression levels, and the enzyme appears to be specifically localized in Kupffer cells. The study of murine models of  and NASH replicated this pattern of expression, further suggesting a  link between hepatic PKM2 and NAFLD. Therefore, we conclude that PKM2 serum and hepatic levels increase in both  and NAFLD and decrease after RYGB.

Transcriptomic studies of Sc WAT have reported that CCL18, encoding the CC chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18), is increased in obesity/insulin resistance but its functional role is unknown.Our objectives were to determine if CCL18 is secreted from Sc WAT and if secreted and/or serum levels associate with  phenotypes. We also planned to define the primary cellular source and if CCL18 exerts effects on adipocytes.This is a cohort study.The study took place in an outpatient academic clinic.A total of 130 obese women scheduled for bariatric surgery and 35 nonobese controls were included.Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp or homeostasis model assessment. CCL18 was analyzed in serum/WAT incubates by ELISA. Effects of recombinant CCL18 was determined in cultures of primary human adipocytes and the monocyte cell line THP-1 differentiated into M0/M1/ macrophages.Association with  risk factors was measured.CCL18 was secreted from WAT and the levels correlated positively with insulin resistance, Adult Treatment Panel III risk score and plasma triglycerides, independent of body mass index and better than other established adipocytokines. In 80 obese women, S-CCL18 levels were significantly higher in insulin resistant compared with insulin sensitive subjects. In WAT CCL18 mRNA was expressed in macrophages and correlated positively with immune-related genes, particularly those enriched in  macrophages. While CCL18 increased cyto-/chemokine expression in M0/-THP-1 cells, human adipocytes showed no responses in vitro.Circulating and WAT-secreted CCL18 correlates with insulin resistance and  risk score. Because CCL18 is macrophage-specific and associates with adipose immune gene expression, it may constitute a marker of WAT inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30671172>Oxidative Stress Induced by Excess of Adiposity Is Related to a Downregulation of Hepatic SIRT6 Expression in Obese Individuals.</a></h2><p>Sirt6 is a member of the sirtuin family involved in physiological and pathological processes including aging, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and energy metabolism.

Metabolically obese but normal weight (MONW) individuals present  abnormalities and features of MetS despite having a normal range of body mass index (BMI). In recent years, different subtypes of obesity have been introduced, including metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically obese obese (MOO).

Data regarding French correctional institutions are lacking so far. To fill this gap, we have assessed in a sample from a French prison (33 females and 18 males) the gender-specific effect of incarceration on weight and body mass index (BMI) and examined their current  status. Furthermore, to reveal the possible determinants of increased obesity, we analyzed emotional vulnerability, eating behavior and physical activity using self-reported questionnaires.In this sample, obesity (BMI≥30 kg/) was already frequent in women (18.2%) but rather scarce for men (11%) at prison entry. Incarceration worsened the rate of obesity in both genders (21.2% and 16.7% respectively). At the time of study, abdominal obesity estimated through waist circumference was particularly prevalent in women (69.7%) versus men (27.8%) and  was detected in 33% of female against none in male inmates. Abdominal obesity was associated with female sex (p<0.03), low physical activity (p<0.05) and eating disorder (p = 0.07) in univariate analyses. Low physical activity remained significant as an explanatory factor of higher abdominal obesity in multivariate analysis. A marked difference between genders was found for practice of physical activity with a higher proportion of women compared to men being inactive (37.9% vs. 11.8%) and fewer women being very active (17.2% vs. 41.2%).This study revealed that a significant proportion of women of this correctional institution combined established obesity, a  and very little practice of physical activity which put them at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, obesity should be better surveyed and treated in prison, especially for female inmates.

Adjusted for the presence of MetS to evaluate its influence, the levels of AOPPs did not differ between the groups, whereas NO remained significantly lower. Data adjusted by the BMI showed that subjects with higher triacylglycerol levels had higher AOPPs (p = 0.001) and decreased total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter/uric Acid (p = 0.036). Subjects with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and patients with higher blood pressure showed increased AOPPs (p = 0.001 and p = 0.034, respectively) and lower NO levels (p = 0.017 and p = 0.043, respectively). Subjects who presented insulin resistance had higher AOPPs (p = 0.024).Nitrosative stress was related to BMI, and protein oxidation and nitrosative stress were related to  changes and hypertension.

Through transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and selective functional studies, we sought to elucidate the lincRNA landscape of human macrophages.We used deep RNA sequencing to assemble the lincRNA transcriptome of human monocyte-derived macrophages at rest and following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and IFN-γ (interferon γ) for M1 activation and IL-4 (interleukin 4) for  activation. Through de novo assembly, we identified 2766 macrophage lincRNAs, including 861 that were previously unannotated. The majority (≈85%) was nonsyntenic or was syntenic but not annotated as expressed in mouse. Many macrophage lincRNAs demonstrated tissue-enriched transcription patterns (21.5%) and enhancer-like chromatin signatures (60.9%). Macrophage activation, particularly to the M1 phenotype, markedly altered the lincRNA expression profiles, revealing 96 lincRNAs differentially expressed, suggesting potential roles in regulating macrophage inflammatory functions. A subset of lincRNAs overlapped genomewide association study loci for cardiometabolic disorders. MacORIS (macrophage-enriched obesity-associated lincRNA serving as a repressor of IFN-γ signaling), a macrophage-enriched lincRNA not expressed in mouse macrophages, harbors variants associated with central obesity. Knockdown of MacORIS which is located in the cytoplasm, enhanced IFN-γ-induced JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) phosphorylation in THP-1 macrophages, suggesting a potential role as a repressor of IFN-γ signaling. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages recapitulated the lincRNA transcriptome of human monocyte-derived macrophages and provided a high-fidelity model with which to study lincRNAs in human macrophage biology, particularly those not conserved in mouse.High-resolution transcriptomics identified lincRNAs that form part of the coordinated response during macrophage activation, including specific macrophage lincRNAs associated with human cardiometabolic disorders that modulate macrophage inflammatory functions.© 2017 The Authors.

Based on whether the patients were complicated with MS, they were divided into non- (N-MS) group (N.=79) and MS group (N.=61); the levels of serum dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), adiponectin (ADPN) and leptin as well as the contents of body fat and lean tissue of the two groups of patients were measured.The serum DPP-4 level in observation group was remarkably elevated compared with that in control group (P<0.05), but there were no significant differences in the leptin and ADPN levels between the two groups (P>0.05). The serum DPP-4 and leptin levels were positively correlated with the total body fat mass (FAT) of the patients in observation group (r=0.461, P=0.004; r=0.433, P=0.007); DPP-4 level had a positive correlation with trunk fat mass (TRUNK F) (r=0.545, P=0.001) and limb fat mass (LIMB F) (r=0.412, P=0.005); the leptin level was positively correlated with LIMB F (r=0.513, P=0.001); the leptin and ADPN levels were negatively correlated with the content of lean tissue (r=-0.476, P=0.001; r=-0.344, P=0.021). Compared with those in N-MS group, the levels of serum DPP-4 and leptin were increased significantly, while the ADPN level was decreased notably (P<0.05) in MS group.The adipokines DPP-4 and leptin in the serum can influence the body fat distribution of patients with T2MD; there is an important association of DPP-4, leptin and ADPN levels with MS, which may be used as therapeutic targets for multiple metabolism disorders of T2MD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566089>Markers of adiposity in HIV/AIDS patients: Agreement between waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio and body mass index.</a></h2><p>Waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) are all independent predictors of cardio- risk and therefore important in HIV/AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy at risk of increased visceral adiposity. This study aimed to assess the extent of agreement between these parameters and the body mass index (BMI), as anthropometric parameters and in classifying cardio- risk in HIV/AIDS patients.A secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study involving 200 HIV/AIDS patients was done. Anthropometric parameters were measured from participants using standard guidelines and central obesity defined according to recommended criteria. Increased cardio- risk was defined according to the standard cut-off values for all four parameters. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14.1.The prevalence of WC-defined central obesity, WHR-defined central obesity and WHtR > 0.50 were 33.5%, 44.5% and 36.5%, respectively. The prevalence of BMI-defined overweight and obesity was 40.5%. After adjusting for gender and HAART status, there was a significant linear association and correlation between WC and BMI (regression equation: WC (cm) = 37.184 + 1.756 BMI (Kg/) + 0.825 Male + 1.002 HAART, (p < 0.001, r = 0.65)), and between WHtR and BMI (regression equation: WHtR = 0.223 + 0.011 BMI (Kg/)- 0.0153 Male + 0.003 HAART, (p < 0.001, r = 0.65)), but not between WHR and BMI (p = 0.097, r = 0.13). There was no agreement between the WC, WHtR and BMI, and minimal agreement between the WHR and BMI, in identifying patients with an increased cardio- risk.Despite the observed linear association and correlation between these anthropometric parameters, the routine use of WC, WHR and WHtR as better predictors of cardio- risk should be encouraged in these patients, due to their minimal agreement with BMI in identifying HIV/AIDS patients with increased cardio- risk. HAART status does not appear to significantly affect the association between these anthropometric parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307161>NFATc3 deficiency reduces the classical activation of adipose tissue macrophages</a></h2><p>Nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) c3 have a prominent role in the regulation of proinflammatory factors in immune cells. The classically activated M1 macrophages are key players in the initiation and maintenance of adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. The role of NFATc3 in obesity and AT inflammation is unknown. We set out to determine how deficiency of NFATc3 effected macrophage polarization, inflammation and insulin resistance in visceral AT of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Nfatc3−/− and WT mice were fed a HFD for 8–17 weeks. Epididymal white AT (eWAT) F4/80(+) cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that Nfatc3−/− mice developed HFD-induced obesity similar to WT mice, but insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were improved, and liver fat accumulation was reduced in Nfatc3−/− mice compared to WT control mice. Moreover, M1 macrophage content and proinflammatory factors were reduced, whereas the alternatively activated  macrophage content was increased in eWAT of HFD-fed Nfatc3−/− mice compared to that of WT mice. In addition, eWAT insulin signaling was improved in HFD-fed Nfatc3−/− mice. Importantly, after bone-marrow-derived macrophages had been isolated from Nfatc3−/− mice and cultured in vitro, treatment of these cells with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide resulted in reduction of M1 inflammatory markers, suggesting that NFATc3 promoted M1 polarization by a cell-autonomous mechanism. The results demonstrated that NFATc3 played an important role in M1 macrophage polarization, AT inflammation and insulin resistance in response to obesity through transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286520>Serum content of total adipionectin in the ChNPP accident clean up workers of the «iodine period» suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (literature review and research data).</a></h2><p>assay of the total adiponectin level in the ChNPP accident clean up workers (ACUW) of the «iodine peri od» exposed to ionizing radiation in a young age and suffering now from type 2 diabetes mellitusMaterials and methods. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident clean up workers (ACUW) of the iodine period (n=111) exposed to ionizing radiation at a young age (18-35 years) were examined in two groups: Group I (main study group, n=66) of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and Group II (comparison group, n=45) of persons with normal glucose challenge test results. Total radiation doses varied in the range of 10.0-860.0 mSv. Group III (nosological control group, n=20) included persons suffering type 2 DM but not exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) and Group IV were apparently healthy. All study groups were representative by the age. Anthropometric data and parameters of glycemic control were assayed. Index of the homeostatic model for assessing insulin resistance (HOMA IR) was calculated. Level of total adiponectin was assayed by the immune enzyme method. Statistical pro cessing of the data was carried out using Missrosoft® Exxel 2002 software.Serum concentration of total adiponectin in the Chornobyl NPP ACUW of the iodine peri od and suffering type 2 DM despite having normal body weight or overweight or any degree of obesity was signifi cantly lower compared to apparently healthy persons ACUW with and normal glycemic control. Moderate negative correlation was found between the level of total adiponectin and degree of obesity in the ACUW suffering type 2 DM (t = 0.367, p <0.05). With an increase in the duration of the disease there was a decrease in serum concentration of total adiponectin in the Chornobyl NPP ACUW of iodine period suffering type 2 DM and in the group of nosologi cal control. The most favorable type of glycemic profile was peculiar for patients in the main group with higher lev els of total serum adiponectin and the lowest body mass index (up to 25 kg/). An increase in the body mass index was accompanied by an adverse combination of abnormalities in glycemic metabolism (increased glucose concen tration, IRI, and HbA1c), insulin resistance (a significant increase in HOMA) against the background of a decrease in concentration of total adiponectin. No significant differences were found in adiponectin levels in dose subgroups. At the same time, the reliable differences between the main group and comparison group were found in the 2-5th dose subgroups, which are due to differences in numbers of people with  (obesity) in the groups.N.

Obesity, a key risk factor for many chronic health problems, is rising globally and is accompanied by low-grade inflammation in adipose tissues. The precise mechanism by which helminths modulate  and obesity is not fully understood. We infected high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with the intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus and observed that helminth infection resulted in significantly attenuated obesity. Attenuated obesity corresponded with marked upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a key protein involved in energy expenditure, in adipose tissue, suppression of glucose and triglyceride levels, and alteration in the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism. Moreover, the attenuated obesity in infected mice was associated with enhanced helminth-induced Th2/Treg responses and  macrophage polarization. Adoptive transfer of helminth-stimulated  cells to mice that were not infected with H. polygyrus resulted in a significant amelioration of HFD-induced obesity and increased adipose tissue browning. Thus, our results provide evidence that the helminth-dependent protection against obesity involves the induction of  macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31365625> phenotypes of obese, overweight, and normal weight individuals and risk of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk is inconsistent in the normal-weight, overweight, and obese individuals due to the heterogeneity of  status.

The patients were divided in two groups: Main group consisted of 208 patients who followed a method including a calorie restriction diet and optimal physical activity; Control included 64 patients who received conventional drug treatment with weight loss. Main Outcome Measures were weight loss, fasting glucose and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HbA1c. Secondary endpoints were blood pressure, lipid and insulin blood levels.At 24 weeks, patients in Main weight lost between 8-18 kg (10-21%); their body mass index significantly decreased (-4.2 kg/) as well as their waist circumference (-13 cm) compared to Control. In Main weight loss was achieved fatty mass reduction. In Main fasting glucose and OGTT, HbA1c, blood pressure, reactive oxygen species decreased significantly, whereas hemoglobin levels and heel bone mineral density increased. In Main blood insulin levels decreased by 72.0%, cortisol levels decreased by 40.7%, while testosterone levels in men increased by 2.4 times from baseline.

There is very little information on the effect of magnesium supplementation on  profiles of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of magnesium supplementation on  profiles of pre-diabetic, obese and mild-to-moderate CKD patients with hypomagnesemia.A total of 128 hypomagnesemic, pre-diabetic and obese patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate between 90 and 30 ml/min/1.73m2 were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients in the magnesium group received 365 mg of oral magnesium (n = 57) once daily for 3 months, while patients in the control group received a placebo (n = 61), also once daily for 3 months.

Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were determined.HOMA-IR was significantly correlated with hepatic triglyceride content (r:0.76; p<0.0001). The lean-with-NAFLD group had significantly higher HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and lower serum adiponectin (p<0.05) than the overweight-without-NAFLD group. Insulin resistance was independently associated with NAFLD but not with waist circumference or BMI. Regression analysis showed hepatic triglyceride content to be the most important determinant of insulin resistance (p<0.01).Our findings suggest that NAFLD, once established, seems to be involved in insulin resistance and cardio- risk factors above and beyond waist circumference and BMI in non-obese, non-diabetic Caucasian individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28934333>Supermarket purchase contributes to nutrition-related non-communicable diseases in urban Kenya.</a></h2><p>While undernutrition and related infectious diseases are still pervasive in many developing countries, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD), typically associated with high body mass index (BMI), is rapidly rising. The fast spread of supermarkets and related shifts in diets were identified as possible factors contributing to overweight and obesity in developing countries. Potential effects of supermarkets on people's health have not been analyzed up till now.This study investigates the effects of purchasing food in supermarkets on people's BMI, as well as on health indicators such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure (BP), and the .This study uses cross-section observational data from urban Kenya. Demographic, anthropometric, and bio-medical data were collected from 550 randomly selected adults. Purchasing food in supermarkets is defined as a binary variable that takes a value of one if any food was purchased in supermarkets during the last 30 days. In a robustness check, the share of food purchased in supermarkets is defined as a continuous variable. Instrumental variable regressions are applied to control for confounding factors and establish causality.Purchasing food in supermarkets contributes to higher BMI (+ 1.8 kg/) (P<0.01) and an increased probability (+ 20 percentage points) of being overweight or obese (P<0.01). Purchasing food in supermarkets also contributes to higher levels of FBG (+ 0.3 mmol/L) (P<0.01) and a higher likelihood (+ 16 percentage points) of suffering from pre-diabetes (P<0.01) and the  (+ 7 percentage points) (P<0.01). Effects on BP could not be observed.Supermarkets and their food sales strategies seem to have direct effects on people's health. In addition to increasing overweight and obesity, supermarkets contribute to nutrition-related NCDs. Effects of supermarkets on nutrition and health can mainly be ascribed to changes in the composition of people's food choices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28424185>Very-long-chain -3 fatty acid supplements and adipose tissue functions: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p> Increased omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid consumption is reported to benefit patients with , possibly due to improved adipose tissue function. We tested the effects of high-dose, very-long-chain ω-3 fatty acids on adipose tissue inflammation and insulin regulation of lipolysis. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared 6 mo of 3.9 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/d (4.2 g total ω-3/d;  = 12) with a placebo (4.2 g oleate/d;  = 9) in insulin-resistant adults. Before and after treatment, the volunteers underwent adipose tissue biopsies to measure the total (CD68), pro- (CD14 = M1), and anti- (CD206 = ) inflammatory macrophages, crown-like structures, and senescent cells, as well as a 2-step pancreatic clamping with a [U-C]palmitate infusion to determine the insulin concentration needed to suppress palmitate flux by 50% (ICf). In the ω-3 group, the EPA and DHA contributions to plasma free fatty acids increased ( = 0.0003 and  = 0.003, respectively), as did the EPA and DHA content in adipose tissue ( < 0.0001 and  < 0.0001, respectively). Despite increases in adipose and plasma EPA and DHA in the ω-3 group, there were no significant changes in the ICf (19 ± 2 compared with 24 ± 3 μIU/mL), adipose macrophages (total: 31 ± 2/100 adipocytes compared with 33 ± 2/100 adipocytes; CD14: 13 ± 2/100 adipocytes compared with 14 ± 2/100 adipocytes; CD206: 28 ± 2/100 adipocytes compared with 29 ± 3/100 adipocytes), crown-like structures (1 ± 0/10 images compared with 1 ± 0/10 images), or senescent cells (4% ± 1% compared with 4% ± 1%). There were no changes in these outcomes in the placebo group. Six months of high-dose ω-3 supplementation raised plasma and adipose ω-3 fatty acid concentrations but had no beneficial effects on adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation in insulin-resistant adults.

MetS and fatty liver disease been associated with changes in adiponectin, soluble ST2 (sST2), chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1), hyaluronic acid (HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) concentrations in HIV-uninfected populations. Protease (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) may contribute to these comorbidities, but the effects of switching from PI- or NNRTI to raltegravir (RAL) on these biomarkers is unknown.Cryopreserved plasma was obtained from a completed, prospective trial of HIV-infected women with central adiposity on NNRTI- or PI-based ART during which they were randomized to remain on their current ART or switch to a RAL based regimen. Biomarker concentrations were quantified using ELISA and Multiplex assays at baseline and 24 weeks after randomization. Wilcoxon-signed rank test evaluated within-group changes, Spearman and linear regression models evaluated correlations between biomarkers and clinical covariates.Participants had a median age of 43 years, CD4+ T lymphocyte count 558 cells/mm3 and BMI 32 kg/; 35% met criteria for MetS. At baseline, higher adiponectin levels correlated with higher Chi3L1 levels (r = 0.42, p = 0.02), as did declines after 24 weeks (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Changes in sST2 correlated with changes in Chi3L1 (r = 0.43, p = 0.02) and adiponectin (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Adiponectin and Chi3L1 levels decreased significantly in women switched to RAL vs continue PI/NNRTI.In women with HIV and central obesity, the hepatic steatosis/fibrosis marker Chi3L1 and adiponectin decrease in conjunction with sST2 decreases following switch to RAL. Whether switching from NNRTI/PI-based regimens to RAL can improve hepatic steatosis and dysmetabolism requires further study.Clinicaltrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30806915>Effectiveness of Intra-Gastric Balloon as a Bridge to Definitive Surgery in the Super Obese.</a></h2><p>British National guidelines (NICE) recommend bariatric surgery for patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/, or BMI > 35 kg/ with any comorbidities of the . Intra-gastric balloons (IGB) can be used in super obese patients as a first step, before definitive surgery.Quantify weight loss 6 months after IGB placement, measure progression to definitive surgery and identify complications.Data collected retrospectively on 50 patients. Forty-six proposed for definitive bariatric surgery, four patients excluded. Analysis performed using SPSS v23.0.Median weight decreased from 165.5 to 155 kg (range 78 to 212, p < 0.01), BMI from 57.4 to 52.15 (range 32.9 to 70.5, p < 0.01), percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) was 12.9% (range - 3.3 to 64.66%, p < 0.01) and BMI reduction was 4.25 kg/ (range - 1.3 to 13.9, p < 0.01). Twenty-nine out of 46 patients (63%) progressed to definitive bariatric surgery. Ten out of 46 patients (21.7%) had complications requiring readmission. Seven of these patients required early balloon removal and six failed to progress to definitive surgery. Six patients had a second balloon placement, their actual weight loss was less successful, with some regaining weight.IGB is useful to aid weight loss prior to definitive bariatric surgery. Results from first balloon placement are encouraging and comparable with other studies "as reported by Genco et al. (Int J of Obes 30:129-133, 2006)." Readmission due to nausea, vomiting, dehydration and poor compliance may be associated with poor weight loss and failure to progress to definitive surgery. Second balloon placements were less successful.IGB as bridging therapy is a safe and useful adjunct. Sequential IGBs do not seem to provide additional benefit.</p></html>
