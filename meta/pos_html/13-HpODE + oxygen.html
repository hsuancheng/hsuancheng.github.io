The role of nutrient-induced biosynthesis of hormones is paramount for attaining metabolic homeostasis in the organism. Nutrient overload attenuate key metabolic cellular functions and interfere with hormonal-regulated inter- and intra-organ communication, which may ultimately lead to metabolic derangements. Hyperglycemia and high levels of saturated free fatty acids induce excessive production of  free radicals in tissues and cells. This phenomenon, which is accentuated in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients, has been associated with the development of impaired glucose tolerance and the etiology of peripheral complications. However, low levels of the same free radicals also induce hormetic responses that protect cells against deleterious effects of the same radicals. Of interest is the role of hydroxyl radicals in initiating peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and generation of α,β-unsaturated reactive 4-hydroxyalkenals that avidly form covalent adducts with nucleophilic moieties in proteins, phospholipids and nucleic acids. Numerous studies have linked the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE) to different pathological and cytotoxic processes. Similarly, two other members of the family, 4-hydroxyl-2E-hexenal (4-HHE) and 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE), have also been identified as potential cytotoxic agents. It has been suggested that 4-HNE-induced modifications in macromolecules in cells may alter their cellular functions and modify signaling properties. Yet, it has also been acknowledged that these bioactive aldehydes also function as signaling molecules that directly modify cell functions in a hormetic fashion to enable cells adapt to various stressful stimuli. Recent studies have shown that 4-HNE and 4-HDDE, which activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in vascular endothelial cells and insulin secreting beta cells, promote such adaptive responses to ameliorate detrimental effects of high glucose and diabetes-like conditions. In addition, due to the electrophilic nature of these reactive aldehydes they form covalent adducts with electronegative moieties in proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine and nucleotides. Normally these non-enzymatic modifications are maintained below the cytotoxic range due to efficient cellular neutralization processes of 4-hydroxyalkenals. The major neutralizing enzymes include fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), aldose reductase (AR) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which transform the aldehyde to the corresponding carboxylic acid or alcohols, respectively, or by biding to the thiol group in glutathione (GSH) by the action of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). This review describes the hormetic and cytotoxic roles of  free radicals and 4-hydroxyalkenals in beta cells exposed to nutritional challenges and the cellular mechanisms they employ to maintain their level at functional range below the cytotoxic threshold.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First CYP74-related enzyme of oxylipin biosynthesis in brown algae.</a></h2><p>Enzymes of CYP74 family play the central role in the biosynthesis of physiologically important oxylipins in land plants. Although a broad diversity of oxylipins is known in the algae, no CYP74s or related enzymes have been detected in brown algae yet. Cloning of the first CYP74-related gene CYP5164B1 of brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus is reported in present work. The recombinant protein was incubated with several fatty acid hydroperoxides. Linoleic acid 9-hydroperoxide (9-HPOD) was the preferred substrate, while linoleate 13-hydroperoxide (13-HPOD) was less efficient. α-Linolenic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides, as well as eicosapentaenoic acid 15-hydroperoxide were inefficient substrates. Both 9-HPOD and 13-HPOD were converted into epoxyalcohols. For instance, 9-HPOD was turned primarily into (9S,10S,11S,12Z)-9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. Both epoxide and hydroxyl  atoms of the epoxyalcohol were incorporated mostly from [O]9-HPOD. Thus, the enzyme exhibits the activity of epoxyalcohol synthase (EsEAS). The results show that the EsEAS isomerizes the hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols via epoxyallylic radical, a common intermediate of different CYP74s and related enzymes. EsEAS can be considered as an archaic prototype of CYP74 family enzymes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to develop a method for accurate quantification of PCOOH (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 16:0/HpODE PC), focusing on isomers such as 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC. Sodiated PCOOH ([M+Na](+), m/z 812) provided not only a known product ion (m/z 147) but also characteristic product ions (m/z 541 for 16:0/ PC and m/z 388 for 16:0/9-HpODE PC). Thus, three multiple reaction monitorings (MRMs) could be performed. MRM (812/147) enabled determination of 16:0/HpODE PC, and MRM (812/541) and MRM (812/388) allowed specific measurement of 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC, respectively. By using this method, we could determine plasma PCOOH concentrations in healthy subjects and patients with angiographically significant stenosis. In healthy subject and patient plasma, the concentration of 16:0/HpODE PC was close to the sum of the concentrations of 16:0/ PC and 16:0/9-HpODE PC. This finding shows that radical and/or enzymatic oxidation, rather than singlet  oxidation, is recognized to cause peroxidation of PC. The newly developed LC-MS/MS method appears to be a powerful tool for developing a better understanding of in vivo lipid peroxidation and its involvement in human diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The linoleic acid (LA)-derived hydroperoxide, 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE) undergoes homolytic decomposition to reactive aldehydes, 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal (ONE), 4-hydroxy-2(E)-nonenal, trans-4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal (EDE), and 4-hydroperoxy-2(E)-nonenal (HPNE), which can covalently modify peptides and proteins. ONE and HNE have been shown to react with angiotensin (Ang) II (DRVYIHPF) and modify the N-terminus, Arg(2), and His(6). ONE-derived pyruvamide-Ang II (Ang P) alters the biological activities of Ang II considerably. The present study revealed that EDE and HPNE preferentially modified the N-terminus and His(6) of Ang II. In addition to the N-substituted pyrrole of [N-C4H2]-Ang II and Michael addition products of [His(6)(EDE)]-Ang II, hydrated forms were detected as major products, suggesting considerable involvement of the vicinal dihydrodiol (formed by epoxide hydration) in EDE-derived protein modification in vivo. Substantial amounts of [N-(EDE-H2O)]-Ang II isomers were also formed and their synthetic pathway might involve the tautomerization of a carbinolamine intermediate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. The main HPNE-derived products were [His(6)(HPNE)]-Ang II and [N-(HPNE-H2O)]-Ang II. However, ONE, HNE, and malondialdehyde-derived modifications were dominant, because HPNE is a precursor of these aldehydes. A mixture of  and [(13)C18]- (1:1) was then used to determine the major modifications derived from LA peroxidation. The characteristic doublet (1:1) observed in the mass spectrum and the mass difference of the [M+H](+) doublet aided the identification of Ang P (N-terminal α-ketoamide), [N-ONE]-Ang II (4-ketoamide), [Arg(2)(ONE-H2O)]-Ang II, [His(6)(HNE)]-Ang II (Michael addition product), [N-C4H2]-Ang II (EDE-derived N-substituted pyrrole), [His(6)(HPNE)]-Ang II, [N-(9,12-dioxo-10(E)-dodecenoic acid)]-Ang II, and [His(6)(9-hydroxy-12-oxo-10(E)-decenoic acid)]-Ang II as the predominant LA-derived modifications. These modifications could represent the majority of lipid-derived modifications to peptides and proteins in biological systems.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
