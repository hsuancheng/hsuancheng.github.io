To investigate mechanisms by which the tumor can synthesize its own androgens and develop resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, methods to measure a complete androgen profile are imperative. Here, we report the development and validation of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (SID-LC-ESI-MS/MS) method to quantify nine human hydroxy-androgens as picolinates, simultaneously with requisite specificity and sensitivity. In the established method, the fragmentation patterns of all nine hydroxy-androgen picolinates were identified, and [C]-5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol and [C]-5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol used as internal standards were synthesized enzymatically. Intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy corresponds to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Criteria for Bioanalytical Method Validation. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of nine hydroxy-androgens is 1.0pg to 2.5pg on column. Diols which have been infrequently measured: 5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol and 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol can be determined in serum at values as low as 1.0pg on column. The method also permits the quantitation of conjugated hydroxy-androgens following enzymatic digestion. While direct detection of steroid conjugates by electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry has advantages the detection of unconjugated and conjugated steroids would require separate methods for each set of analytes. Our method was applied to pooled serum from male and female donors to provide reference values for both unconjugated and conjugated hydroxy-androgens. This method will allow us to interrogate the involvement of the conversion of 5-androstene-3β, 17β-diol to T, the backdoor pathway involving the conversion of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol to DHT and the inactivation of DHT to 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol in advanced prostate cancer.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxidative stress is a well-known phenomenon associated with Cisplatin toxicity. However, in Cisplatin treated group, abnormal animal behavior, decreased body weight, cellular and sub-cellular changes in the kidney and sperm abnormality were observed. Our investigation revealed that Cisplatin when administered in combination with a natural product derivative (Urs-12-ene-3α,24β-diol, labeled as IN0523) resulted in significant restoration of body weight and protection against the pathological alteration caused by Cisplatin to kidney and testis. Sperm count and motility were significantly restored near to normal. Cisplatin caused depletion of defense system i.e. glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase, which were restored close to normal by treatment of IN0523. Reduction in excessive  peroxidation induced by Cisplatin was also found by treatment with IN0523. The result suggests that IN0523 is a potential candidate for ameliorating Cisplatin induced toxicity in the kidney and testes at a dose of 100mg/kg p.o. via inhibiting the oxidative stress/redox status imbalance and may be improving the efflux mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The objective was to investigate the effect of postruminal Met supply during late pregnancy on 1-carbon, Met cycle, and transsulfuration pathways in the calf liver. During the last 28 d of pregnancy, cows were individually fed a control diet or the control diet plus rumen-protected dl-Met (MET; 0.09% dry matter intake). Liver samples obtained from calves (n = 14/group) at 4, 14, 28, and 50 d of age were used for metabolomics, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity analyses. Genes associated with 1-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation, and the cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine-choline pathway were analyzed via real-time PCR. Activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, cystathionine β-synthase, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) was analyzed using C isotopes. Data were analyzed using a mixed model that included the fixed effects of maternal treatment, day, and their interaction, and the random effect was calf within maternal diet. Calves born to dams offered MET tended to have greater birth  and had overall greater  during the first 9 wk of life. However, no differences were detected for daily feed intake and average daily gain between groups. Concentrations of betaine and choline, reflecting Met cycle activity, at d 14 through 28 were greater in MET calves. Transsulfuration pathway intermediates also were altered in MET calves, with concentrations of cysteine sulfinic  and hypotaurine (d 4 and 14) and taurine being greater (d 4, 14, 28, and 50). Despite the lack of differences in daily feed intake, the greater concentrations of the tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates fumarate and glutamate along with NAD/NADH in MET calves indicated enhanced rates of energy metabolism. Although activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was greater in MET calves at d 14, cystathionine β-synthase was lower and increased at d 14 and 28, where it was greater compared with the control diet. Activity of MTR was lower at d 4 and 50 in MET calves. Among gene targets measured, MET calves had greater overall expression of MTR, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and choline kinase α and β. An interaction of maternal diet by time was detected for mRNA abundance of DNA methyltransferase 3α (involved in de novo methylation) due to greater values at d 4 and 14 in MET calves. Overall, the data indicate that enhanced postruminal supply of Met to cows during late pregnancy may program hepatic metabolism of the calf in the context of maintaining Met homeostasis, phosphatidylcholine and taurine synthesis, DNA methylation, and energy metabolism. These alterations potentially result in better efficiency of nutrient use, hence conferring the calf a physiologic advantage during a period of rapid growth and development. The precise biologic mechanisms remain to be established.The Authors. Published by FASS Inc. and Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Dairy Science Association®.
