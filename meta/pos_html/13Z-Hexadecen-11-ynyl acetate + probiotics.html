However, the main problem associated with , is their low resistance to environmental and technological factors. Actually,  are marketed as capsules or sachets, but few probiotic tablets exist. The aim of this study was to design tablets made out of functional polymers (formula 1: methocel K-15-sodium alginate; formula 2: Eudragit(®) L-100-sodium alginate; formula 3: cellulose  phthalate) that improve the stability and survival of . Rigid tablets were produced through direct compression with a bacterial content of 10(9)CFU/tablet (9logCFU). Tablets were shown to improve the survival of cells when exposed to an acidic medium as compared to free cells. Eudragit(®) L-100-sodium alginate was found to be the most suitable excipient for the protection of probiotic within gastric conditions, resulting in the survival of 10(9)CFU (9logCFU) after 2h of incubation. Finally, these tablets were found to be stable over 6 months when stored at 4°C. No significant differences were reported between the number of cells at time cero and after 6 months of storage at 4°C (p>0.05). In conclusion, direct compression using Eudragit(®) L-100-sodium alginate seems to be a suitable to produce  tablets and could confer protection during passage trough stomach and storage.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The growth assays under different culture conditions were performed by using a 2(8-2) central composite experimental design, with a central point and sixteen additional points. The factors taken into consideration were glucose, lactose, yeast extract, tryptone, ammonium citrate, sodium , MgSO4 and MnSO4. The simultaneous presence of a carbon source (mainly glucose), a nitrogen source (mainly yeast extract) and salts (mainly MnSO4, MgSO4 and sodium ) allowed the highest cell biomass and bacteriocin levels to be reached in the experimental design. Through the application of the desirability function, several optimal medium compositions to achieve efficient production of biomass and bacteriocin were predicted. The optimized growth media allow a cost reduction of around 25 to 40% compared with conventional broths. The results obtained represent an advance in the search of the most suitable strategies for the production of bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical products to prevent or treat female urogenital infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523960>Impact of a Plant Sterol- and Galactooligosaccharide-Enriched Beverage on Colonic Metabolism and Gut Microbiota Composition Using an  Dynamic Model.</a></h2><p>A beverage enriched with plant sterols (1 g/100 mL) and galactooligosaccharides (1.8 g/100 mL) was subjected to a dynamic gastrointestinal and colonic fermentation process to evaluate the effect on sterol metabolism, organic acid production, and microbiota composition. Production of sterol metabolites (coprostanol, methylcoprostanol, ethylcoprostenol, ethylcoprostanol, and sitostenone) was observed in the transverse colon (TC) and descending colon (DC) vessels in general, from 24 and 48 h, respectively. Microbial activity was assessed through the production of organic acids, mainly  in all colon vessels, lactate in the AC, and butyrate and propionate in the TC and DC. A higher diversity in the microbial community was found in the TC and DC, in accordance with a higher sterol metabolism and organic acid production. Although the prebiotic effect of galactooligosaccharides was not detected, changes in microbiota composition (an increase in the  genus and the Synergistaceae and Lachnospiraceae families) indicated an enhancement of sterol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851248>Lactobacillus fermentum Improves Tacrolimus-Induced Hypertension by Restoring Vascular Redox State and Improving eNOS Coupling.</a></h2><p>The aim is to analyze whether the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (LC40) can prevent endothelial dysfunction and hypertension induced by tacrolimus in mice.Tacrolimus increases systolic blood pressure (SBP) and impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and these effects are partially prevented by LC40. Endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus is related to both increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-driven superoxide production and Rho-kinase-mediated eNOS inhibition. LC40 treatment prevents all the aortic changes induced by tacrolimus. LC40 restores the imbalance between T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) cells induced by tacrolimus in mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen. Tacrolimus-induced gut dysbiosis, that is, it decreases microbial diversity, increases the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and decreases - and butyrate-producing bacteria, and these effects are prevented by LC40. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from LC40-treated mice to control mice prevents the increase in SBP and the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine induced by tacrolimus.LC40 treatment prevents hypertension and endothelial dysfunction induced by tacrolimus by inhibiting gut dysbiosis. These effects are associated with a reduction in vascular oxidative stress, mainly through NOX2 downregulation and prevention of eNOS uncoupling, and inflammation possibly because of decreased Th17 and increased Treg cells polarization in mesenteric lymph nodes.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, investigations focusing on this unique metabolism of L. reuteri may reveal a basis for new probiotic properties. For instance, L. reuteri may use reactive aldehydes and ketones as electron acceptors to balance their redox metabolism, which opens the possibility to exploit this bacterium for in vivo bioreduction of deleterious compounds in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Herein we demonstrate that L. reuteri ATCC 55730 cultures on glucose are able to use furfural (1g/L), and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (0.5g/L), as electron acceptors. The former enhances the growth rate by about 25% and biomass yield by 15%, whereas the latter is inhibitory. Furfural is stoichiometrically reduced to furfuryl alcohol by the culture. The conversion of furfural had no effect on the flux distribution between the simultaneously operating phosphoketolase and Embden-Meyerhof pathways, but initiated a flux to  production. In addition to furfural and HMF, cellular extracts showed potential to reoxidize NADH and/or NADPH with acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and diacetyl, indicating that conversion reactions take place intracellularly, however, utilization mechanisms for the latter compounds may not be present in this strain. The strain did not reduce other GIT-related reactive compounds, including acrylamide, glyoxal, and furan.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment. However, GFD alone is not sufficient to relieve symptoms, control small intestinal inflammation and prevent long-term complications in many patients. The GFD has its challenges including issues related to adherence, lifestyle restrictions and cost. As a result, there is growing interest in and a need for non-dietary therapies to manage this condition. In recent years, different targets in the immune-mediated cascade of CD have been identified in clinical and pre-clinical trials for potential therapies. This review will discuss the latest non-dietary therapies in CD, including endopeptidases, modulators of enterocyte tight junctions and agents involved in gluten tolerization and immunomodulation. We will also discuss the potential implications of approved therapeutics on CD clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056551>Fecal microbiota in patients receiving enteral feeding are highly variable and may be altered in those who develop diarrhea.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of diarrhea in patients receiving enteral feeding includes colonic water secretion, antibiotic prescription, and enteropathogenic colonization, each of which involves an interaction with the gastrointestinal microbiota.The objective was to investigate temporal changes in the concentrations of fecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in patients starting 14-d of enteral feeding and to compare these changes between patients who do and do not develop diarrhea.Twenty patients starting exclusive nasogastric enteral feeding were monitored for 14 d. Fecal samples were collected at the start, middle, and end of this period and were analyzed for major bacterial groups by using culture independent fluorescence in situ hybridization and for SCFAs by using gas-liquid chromatography.Although no significant changes in fecal microbiota or SCFAs were observed during enteral feeding, stark alterations occurred within individual patients. Ten patients (50%) developed diarrhea, and these patients had significantly higher concentrations of clostridia (P = 0.026) and lower concentrations (P = 0.069) and proportions (P = 0.029) of bifidobacteria. Patients with and without diarrhea had differences in the proportion of bifidobacteria (median: 0.4% and 3.7%; interquartile range: 0.8 compared with 4.3; P = 0.035) and clostridia (median: 10.4% and 3.7%; interquartile range: 14.7 compared with 7.0; P = 0.063), respectively, even at the start of enteral feeding. Patients who developed diarrhea had higher concentrations of total fecal SCFAs (P = 0.044),  (P = 0.029), and butyrate (P = 0.055).Intestinal dysbiosis occurs in patients who develop diarrhea during enteral feeding and may be involved in its pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21605754>Rumen pH and fermentation characteristics in dairy cows supplemented with Megasphaera elsdenii NCIMB 41125 in early lactation.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effect of using the lactate-utilizing bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii NCIMB 41125 as a probiotic supplement on rumen fermentation and pH in dairy cows in the immediate postcalving period. Fourteen multiparous rumen-fistulated Holstein cows, blocked according to 305-d milk yield in the previous lactation, were used in a randomized complete block design. From d 1 to 28 postcalving, cows were fed ad libitum a total mixed ration with a forage to concentrate ratio of 392:608 and a starch concentration of 299g/kg of dry matter. Treatments consisting of a minimum of 10(10) cfu of Megasphaera elsdenii NCIMB 41125 or autoclaved M. elsdenii (placebo) were administered via the rumen cannula on d 3 and 12 of lactation (n=7 per treatment). Mid-rumen pH was measured every 15min, and eating and ruminating behaviors were recorded for 24h on d 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 22, and 28. Rumen fluid for volatile fatty acid and lactic acid analysis was collected at 11 time points on each of d 2, 4, 6, 13, and 15. Yields of milk and milk protein and lactose were similar, but milk fat concentration tended to be higher in cows that received the placebo. Time spent eating and ruminating and dry matter intake were similar across treatments. Ruminal lactic acid concentrations were highly variable between animals, and no cases of clinical acidosis were observed. Both treatment groups had rumen pH <5.6 for more than 3h/d (a commonly used threshold to define subacute ruminal acidosis), but the length of time with rumen pH <5.6 was markedly reduced in the days immediately after dosing and fluctuated much less from day to day in cows that received M. elsdenii compared with those that received the placebo. Ruminal total volatile fatty acid concentrations were similar across treatments, but the :propionate ratio tended to be smaller in cows that received M. elsdenii. Despite the lack of a measurable treatment effect on ruminal lactic acid concentration, supplementation of early lactation dairy cows with lactate-utilizing M. elsdenii altered the rumen fermentation patterns in favor of propionate, with potential benefits for energy balance and animal productivity.Copyright © 2011 American Dairy Science Association.

Several potential probiotic traits of K. marxianus B0399 were investigated by using in vitro assays, including adhesion and immune modulation, and the effect of the administration of 10(7) CFU/day of K. marxianus B0399 on the composition and metabolic activity of the human intestinal microbiota was investigated in a 3-stage continuous-culture system simulating the human colon. We demonstrated that this strain was highly adhesive to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells and modulated the immune response, inducing proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In the presence of inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), K. marxianus B0399 provoked decreases in the levels of production of proinflammatory cytokines in PBMCs and Caco-2 cells, thus ameliorating the inflammatory response. Furthermore, K. marxianus B0399 impacted the colonic microbiota, increasing the bifidobacterial concentration in the stages of the colonic model system simulating the proximal and transverse colon. The amounts of the short-chain fatty acids  and propionate also increased following yeast supplementation. Finally, K. marxianus B0399 was found to induce a decrease of the cytotoxic potential of the culture supernatant from the first stage of the colonic model system. The effects of K. marxianus B0399 on adhesion, immune function, and colonic microbiota demonstrate that this strain possesses a number of beneficial and strain-specific properties desirable for a microorganism considered for application as a probiotic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that liver is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined  (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31258540>Manipulation of Gut Microbiota Influences Immune Responses, Axon Preservation, and Motor Disability in a Model of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been implicated in MS and other immune diseases, although it remains unclear how manipulating the gut microbiota may affect the disease course. Using a well-established model of progressive MS triggered by intracranial infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), we sought to determine whether dysbiosis induced by oral antibiotics (ABX) administered on pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases of the disease influences its course. We also addressed the effects of microbiota recolonization after ABX withdrawn in the presence or absence of . Central and peripheral immunity, plasma  and butyrate levels, axon damage and motor disability were evaluated. The cocktail of ABX prevented motor dysfunction and limited axon damage in mice, which had fewer CD4 and CD8 T cells in the CNS, while gut microbiota recolonization worsened motor function and axonal integrity. The underlying mechanisms of ABX protective effects seem to involve CD4CD39 T cells and CD5CD1d B cells into the CNS. In addition, microglia adopted a round amoeboid morphology associated to an anti-inflammatory gene profile in the spinal cord of TMEV mice administered ABX. The immune changes in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were modest, yet ABX treatment of mice limited IL-17 production . Collectively, our results provide evidence of the functional relevance of gut microbiota manipulation on the neurodegenerative state and disease severity in a model of progressive MS and reinforce the role of gut microbiota as target for MS treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29771345>Sucrose metabolism alters Lactobacillus plantarum survival and interactions with the microbiota in the digestive tract.</a></h2><p>We investigated whether sucrose metabolism by probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum influences the intestinal survival and microbial responses to this organism when administered to mice fed a sucrose-rich, Western diet. A L. plantarum mutant unable to metabolize sucrose was constructed by deleting scrB, coding for beta-fructofuranosidase, in a rifampicin-resistant strain of L. plantarum NCIMB8826. The ScrB deficient mutant survived in 8-fold higher numbers compared to the wild-type strain when measured 24 h after administration on two consecutive days. According to 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing, proportions of Faecalibacterium and Streptococcus were elevated in mice fed the L. plantarum ΔscrB mutant. Metagenome predictions also indicated those mice contained a higher abundance of lactate dehydrogenases. This was further supported by a trend in elevated fecal lactate concentrations among mice fed the ΔscrB mutant. L. plantarum also caused other changes to the fecal metabolomes including higher concentrations of glycerol in mice fed the ΔscrB mutant and increased uracil,  and propionate levels among mice fed the wild-type strain. Taken together, these results suggest that sucrose metabolism alters the properties of L. plantarum in the digestive tract and that  can differentially influence intestinal metabolomes via their carbohydrate consumption capabilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20181862>Selected microbial groups and short-chain fatty acids profile in a simulated chicken cecum supplemented with two strains of Lactobacillus.</a></h2><p>Among the bacterial fermentation end products in the chicken cecum, butyrate is of particular importance because of its nutritional properties for the epithelial cell and pathogen inhibitory effects in the gut. An in vitro experiment, operated with batch bioreactor, was conducted to quantify butyric-producing bacteria in a simulated broiler cecum supplemented with Lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius JCM 1230 and Lactobacillus agilis JCM 1048 during 24 h of incubation. Selected bacterial species were determined by real-time PCR and short-chain fatty acids and lactate concentrations were monitored. The results showed that after 24 h of incubation, Lactobacillus supplementation significantly increased the number of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in medium containing cecal content and lactobacilli supplementation (Cc + L) compared with the control (Cc). Addition of lactobacilli did not alter Escherichia coli and Clostridium butyricum, whereas it significantly (P < 0.05) reduced Salmonella in treatment Cc + L compared with the Cc treatment. Propionate and butyrate formation were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in treatment Cc + L as compared with the Cc treatment. Lactate was only detected in treatment containing 2 Lactobacillus strains. After 24 h of incubation,  concentration significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in all treatments. It was suggested that lactate produced by Lactobacillus in the cecal content improved the growth of butyric producers such as F. prausnitzii, which significantly increased butyrate accumulation. Additionally, the results showed that butyrate and propionate inhibited Salmonella without influencing the E. coli profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23234728>Transcriptome analysis and physiology of Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 cells under continuous culture conditions.</a></h2><p>A central issue in the use of  in food and food supplements is their sensitivity to many environmental stress factors. The resistance of probiotic cells to lethal stress can be improved by application of homologous or heterologous sub-lethal stress during culture. This screening procedure is generally performed using batch cultures. Continuous cultures could be a suitable and more efficient method to test different stress factors on one culture instead of repeating several batch cultures. However, before testing stresses using continuous cultures, the physiological stability of continuously produced cells over a considered time period must be first evaluated. A continuous culture of Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 was maintained for 211 h at a dilution rate of 0.1 per h, mimicking a deceleration growth phase culture. Stable viable cell counts were measured over the culture period, decreasing only moderately from 8.8 to 8.6 log10 cfu/ml. A slight shift in metabolite production, characterized by increased lactate and decreased , formate and ethanol concentrations was observed. Susceptibilities to antibiotics and stress conditions were stable (cefotaxim, ampicillin, ceftazidime) or moderately affected (simulated gastric juices, heat, bile salts, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, penicillin, vancomycin and neomycin) over culturing time. Comparison of gene transcription profiles between samples collected after 31 h of continuous culture and samples collected after 134 and 211 h revealed only limited changes in expression of 1.0 and 3.8% of total genes, respectively. Based on these results, we propose that continuous culture can be used to produce bacterial cells with stable physiological properties suitable for fast and efficient screening of sub-lethal stress conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20420903>Development of microparticulate systems for intestinal delivery of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis.</a></h2><p>In the present study intestinal delivery systems resistant to gastric juice, loaded with the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus LA14 and Bifidobacterium lactis BI07, were produced by the polyelectrolyte complexation. First, beads were prepared by the traditional extrusion method and nine formulations were developed using alginate as main carrier and the biopolymer, xanthan gum (XG), as hydrophilic retardant polymer or the cellulose derivative, cellulose  phthalate (CAP), as gastro-resistant polymer. The results showed that the incorporation of the 0.5% (w/v) of XG or the 1% (w/v) of CAP within the 3% (w/v) of alginate solution increased the survival of the probiotic bacteria in acid conditions from 63% of the freeze-dried bacteria up to 76%. Subsequently, these formula was used to prepare smaller microcapsules by means of an atomization device. Despite of the high viscosity of the biomass suspension, the spraying system produced spherical and non-aggregated microcapsules able to survive in harsh condition better than beads: the survival of the probiotic bacteria after acid incubation was 91%. The performance of the microcapsules in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) containing pepsin and in gut medium (GM) containing bile salts was excellent (viability>95%). Furthermore, the viability of probiotic bacteria was maintained after an incubation of 24h in GM. Finally, stability tests performed at 5 degrees C highlighted a bacterial viability of about 82% and 70% after 6 and 9 months, respectively.2010 Elsevier B.V.

We measured the effect of VOA and its main active constituent, bornyl  (BA), on body weight, food intake, diarrhea, inflammatory cytokines, the mucosal barrier, and gut microbiota. VOA and BA significantly increased the rats' body weight, relieved diarrhea, and reversed histopathological changes in the gut and inflammation. VOA significantly inhibited apoptosis and alleviated the endoenteritis by downregulating p38 MAPK and caspase-3 expression. VOA and BA strengthened the intestinal mucosal barrier by increasing zonula occludin-1 and occludin expression. VOA and BA reduced the amount of pathogenic bacteria and increased the abundance of .

In Experiment 1, 36 early lactation Chinese Holstein dairy cows (56 ± 23 days in milk) were randomly assigned to three groups: Control, cows were fed total mixed ration (TMR); BSNLOW, TMR plus 0.5 × 1011 colony-forming units (cfu) of B. subtilis natto/cow per day; and BSNHIGH, TMR plus 1.0 × 1011 cfu of B. subtilis natto/cow per day. During the 70-day treatment period, daily milk production and daily milk composition were determined in individual cows. The results showed that supplementing dairy cows with 0.5 × 1011 and 1.0 × 1011 cfu of B. subtilis natto linearly increased (P < 0.01) milk production (25.2 and 26.4 kg/day v. 23.0 kg/day), 4% fat-corrected milk (27.3 and 28.1 kg/day v. 24.2 kg/day), energy-corrected milk (27.3 and 28.2 kg/day v. 24.2 kg/day), as well as milk fat (1.01 and 1.03 kg/day v. 0.88 kg/day), protein (0.77 and 0.82 kg/day v. 0.69 kg/day) and lactose yield (1.16 and 1.22 kg/day v. 1.06 kg/day) but decreased milk somatic cell counts (SCC) by 3.4% to 5.5% (P < 0.01) in BSNLOW and BSNHIGH treatments compared with Control. In Experiment 2, four rumen-cannulated dairy cows were fed the basal diet from 1 to 7 days (pre-trial period) and rumen samples were collected on days 6 and 7; the same cows then were fed 1.0 × 1011 cfu/day B. subtilis natto from days 8 to 21 (trial period) and rumen samples were collected on days 20 and 21. B. subtilis natto was discontinued from days 22 to 28 (post-trial period) and rumen samples were collected on days 27 and 28. Compared with the pre- and post-periods, ruminal pH decreased by 2.7% to 3.0% during the trial period (P < 0.01), whereas ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total volatile fatty acids and molar proportion of propionate (P < 0.01) and valerate (P < 0.05) increased. Molar proportion of  decreased and the  to propionate ratio was lower (P < 0.01) during the trial period. However, no differences for 24-h in sacco dry matter digestibility were detected among different periods (treatments) though NDF digestibility was reduced in the trial and post-trial periods (P < 0.01). Compared with pre-trial period, total ruminal bacteria, proteolytic and amylolytic bacteria in rumen enumerated by culture methods increased by 15.0%, 16.2% and 11.7%, respectively (P < 0.01) but protozoa decreased to 5.35 log10 cfu/ml (P < 0.01) during the trial period. These results demonstrate that B. subtilis natto improves milk production and milk components yield, decreases SCC and promotes the growth of total ruminal bacteria, proteolytic and amylolytic bacteria, which indicate that B. subtilis natto has potential to be applied as a probiotic for dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18554304>Isolation of lactate-utilizing butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces and in vivo administration of Anaerostipes caccae strain L2 and galacto-oligosaccharides in a rat model.</a></h2><p>Lactate-utilizing butyrate-producers were isolated from human feces and identified based on the sequences of 16S rRNA gene. Anaerostipes caccae strain L2, one of the seven human fecal isolates, was administered to rats with galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) as bifidogenic carbohydrates for stimulating lactate formation in the hindgut. Ingestion of GOS alone increased concentrations of cecal lactate and butyrate compared with control rats (P<0.05). Additional administration of strain L2 on GOS tended to enhance the promoting effect of GOS on cecal butyrate formation (P=0.06) and lowered the mean value of cecal lactate concentration (P=0.32). Consequently, cecal and fecal butyrate concentrations in rats administered with both strain L2 and GOS were significantly higher than those in the control rats (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). Significant changes were observed in the other fermentation acids, such as succinate, , and propionate, depending on the ingestion of strain L2. Administered strain L2 was retrieved from the cecal content of a rat based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. The results suggest that synbiotic ingestion of lactate-utilizing butyrate-producers and GOS alters the microbial fermentation and promotes the formation of beneficial fermentation acids, including butyrate, in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212110>The impact of chewing gum on halitosis parameters: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to analyze the impact of chewing gum on halitosis parameters. Three databases were searched with the following focused question: 'Can chewing gum additionally reduce halitosis parameters, such as organoleptic scores and volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), when compared to a control treatment'? Controlled clinical trials presenting at least two halitosis measurements (organoleptic scores and/or VSC) were included. Ten studies were included, and different active ingredients were used. One study was performed using a chewing gum without any active ingredient. Chewing gum containing probiotic bacterium was shown to significantly reduce the organoleptic scores. Chewing gums containing zinc  and magnolia bark extract as well as allylisothiocyanate (AITC) with zinc lactate significantly reduced the levels of VSC in comparison to a placebo chewing gum. Furthermore, a sodium bicarbonate-containing chewing gum significantly reduced the VSC levels in comparison to rinsing with water. Furthermore, eucalyptus-extract chewing gum showed significant reductions in both organoleptic scores and VSC when compared with a control chewing gum.

In this study, we showed that L. acidophilus K301 reduced the level of cholesterol through reverse transport in macrophages. L. acidophilus K301 upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of genes such as ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) under the control of liver X receptor (LXR), resulting in increased apoA-I-dependent cholesterol efflux in phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 cells. L. acidophilus K301 induced both ABCA1 and ABCG1 through the endogenous LXR agonist 24(S), 25-epoxcycholesterol, which is synthesized by intracellular cholesterol synthetic pathways. In vivo studies using L. acidophilus K301-treated ApoE-/- mice showed reduced accumulation of lipoproteins in the arterial lumen. The inhibitory effects of L. acidophilus K301 on accumulation of lipoprotein in atherosclerotic plaques were mediated by the induction of squalene reductase (SQLE) and oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) and resulted in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Taken together, our findings revealed that Lactobacillus acidophilus K301 regulates the expression of genes related to cholesterol reverse transport via the induction of endogenous LXR agonist, suggesting the therapeutic potential of Lactobacillus acidophilus K301 as an anti-atherosclerotic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21078530>Safety and intestinal microbiota modulation by the exopolysaccharide-producing strains Bifidobacterium animalis IPLA R1 and Bifidobacterium longum IPLA E44 orally administered to Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis IPLA R1 and Bifidobacterium longum IPLA E44 strains were tested for their safety and ability to modulate the intestinal microbiota in vivo. Chemically simulated gastrointestinal digestion showed considerably lower survival of E44 than R1 strain, the first microorganism also being more sensitive to refrigerated storage in 10% skimmed milk at 4°C. Harmful glycosidic activities were absent, or at low levels, in the strains R1 and E44. Both strains were sensitive to most antibiotics and resistant to aminoglycosides, a common feature in bifidobacteria. Similar to several other bifidobacteria strains, B. animalis subsp. lactis IPLA R1 displayed a moderate resistance against tetracycline which correlated with the presence of tet(W) gene in its genome. The general parameters indicating well-being status, as well as translocation to different organs and histological examination of the gut tissues, revealed no changes induced by the administration of bifidobacteria to rats. Twelve-week-old male Wistar rats were distributed into three groups, eight rats in each. Two groups were administered daily over 10⁸cfu of the corresponding strain suspended in 10% skimmed milk for 24 days, whereas rats in the placebo group received skimmed milk without microorganisms added. The microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) were monitored in faeces at different time points during treatment and in caecum content at the end of the assay. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that faecal and caecal Bifidobacterium levels were higher in bifidobacteria-fed rats than in the placebo rats at the end of the intervention, whereas total anaerobic plate counts did not show significant differences. Quantification of B. animalis and B. longum by qPCR showed that, independent of the microorganism administered, treatment with bifidobacteria resulted in higher levels of B. animalis in the caecum. PCR-DGGE analysis of microbial populations revealed a higher diversity of bands in caecum content of rats fed B. animalis IPLA R1 than in the placebo group and rats fed B. longum IPLA E44. Remarkably, although no variations in the proportion of , propionate and butyrate were found, at the end of the assay the total SCFA concentration in the faeces of rats fed bifidobacteria was significantly higher and those in caecum content significantly lower, than that of the placebo group. This suggests a displacement of the SCFA production to parts of the colon beyond the caecum in rats receiving bifidobacteria. Therefore, the oral administration of B. animalis IPLA R1 and B. longum E44 can be considered safe, these microorganisms having the ability to modulate the intestinal microbiota of rats by influencing SCFA and the bifidobacterial population levels.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM(TM) (NCFM) is a probiotic strain; however, many of the mechanisms behind its health-promoting effect remain unknown. Here, we studied the effects of NCFM on the metabolome of jejunum, cecum, and colon of NCFM monocolonized (MC) and GF mice using liquid chromatography coupled to mass-spectrometry (LC-MS). The study adds to existing evidence that NCFM in vivo affects the bile acid signature of mice, in particular by deconjugation. Furthermore, we confirmed that carbohydrate metabolism is affected by NCFM in the mouse intestine as especially the digestion of oligosaccharides (penta- and tetrasaccharides) was increased in MC mice. Additionally, levels of α-tocopherol  (vitamin E ) were higher in the intestine of GF mice than in MC mice, suggesting that NCFM affects the vitamin E  metabolism. NCFM did not digest vitamin E  in vitro, suggesting that direct bacterial metabolism was not the cause of the altered metabolome in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that NCFM affects intestinal carbohydrate metabolism, bile acid metabolism and vitamin E metabolism, although it remains to be investigated whether this effect is unique to NCFM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900399>The effect of synbiotics  and milk oligosaccharides on shaping gut microbiota community structure and NASH treatment.</a></h2><p>Probiotic  subspecies  () consumes human milk oligosaccharides (MO) and protects intestinal permeability thereby having anti-inflammatory effects (Underwood et al., 2015; Bode, 2006; Asakuma et al., 2011) [1-3].

Results from a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of isoflavone administration, either in conjunction with probiotic use or not, on the symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and compare the effects with those of hormone therapy.A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 postmenopausal women aged 40 to 60 years, randomly assigned to receive oral isoflavone (150 mg dry extract of glycine max) alone or isoflavone plus probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium lactis) or hormone therapy (1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethisterone ). The urogenital symptom subscale of the Menopause Rating Scale and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form were used to assess genitourinary symptoms. Vaginal maturation value, pH, vaginal health score, and vaginal flora were used to evaluate vaginal atrophy. Equol, equol intermediate, O-dimethylangolensin, and aglycones were measured using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.After 16 weeks of treatment, the urogenital symptoms, mainly vaginal dryness and sexual problem complaints, improved significantly in the hormone therapy group. There was a significant increase in the daidzein, glycitein, equol intermediate, and O-dimethylangolensin contents after 16 weeks in the isoflavone plus probiotic group. The maturation value, vaginal pH, and vaginal flora improved in the hormone therapy group. The vaginal health score increased in the isoflavone and hormone therapy groups.Probiotics improved the metabolism of isoflavones after 16 weeks of treatment.

This work illustrates that  is capable of enhancing the intestinal mucus layer and goblet cell function via upregulation of gene expression and autophagy signaling pathways, with a net increase in mucin production. Microbe-host interactions in the intestine occur along the mucus-covered epithelium. In the gastrointestinal tract, mucus is composed of glycan-covered proteins, or mucins, which are secreted by goblet cells to form a protective gel-like structure above the epithelium. Low levels of mucin or alterations in mucin glycans are associated with inflammation and colitis in mice and humans. Although current literature links microbes to the modulation of goblet cells and mucins, the molecular pathways involved are not yet fully understood. Using a combination of gnotobiotic mice and mucus-secreting cell lines, we have identified a human-derived microbe, , which adheres to intestinal mucus and secretes metabolites that upregulate the major mucin MUC2 and modulate goblet cell function. Unlike other  species,  does not extensively degrade mucin glycans and cannot grow on mucin alone. This work points to the potential of using  and similar mucin-friendly microbes as therapeutic agents for intestinal disorders with disruptions in the mucus barrier.Copyright © 2019 Engevik et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355158>Lactobacillus plantarum 299v Supplementation Improves Vascular Endothelial Function and Reduces Inflammatory Biomarkers in Men With Stable Coronary Artery Disease.</a></h2><p>A strong association has emerged between the gut microbiome and atherosclerotic disease. Our recent data suggest Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) supplementation reduces infarct size in male rats. Limited human data are available on the impact of Lp299v on the vasculature.To determine whether oral Lp299v supplementation improves vascular endothelial function and reduces systemic inflammation in humans with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).Twenty men with stable CAD consumed a drink containing Lp299v (20 billion CFU) once daily for 6 weeks. After a 4-week washout, subjects were given an option of additionally participating in a 10-day study of oral liquid vancomycin (250 mg QID). Vascular endothelial function was measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Before and after Lp299v, plasma short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine oxide, and adipokine levels were measured. Additional plasma samples underwent unbiased metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to determine changes of the stool microbiome. Arterioles from patients with CAD were obtained, and endothelium-dependent vasodilation was measured by video microscopy after intraluminal incubation with plasma from Lp299v study subjects. Lp299v supplementation improved brachial flow-mediated dilation ( P=0.008) without significant changes in plasma cholesterol profiles, fasting glucose, or body mass index. Vancomycin did not impact flow-mediated dilation. Lp299v supplementation decreased circulating levels of IL (interleukin)-8 ( P=0.01), IL-12 ( P=0.02), and leptin ( P=0.0007) but did not significantly change plasma trimethylamine oxide concentrations ( P=0.27). Plasma propionate ( P=0.004) increased, whereas  levels decreased ( P=0.03). Post-Lp299v plasma improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in resistance arteries from patients with CAD ( P=0.02).16S rRNA analysis showed the Lactobacillus genus was enriched in postprobiotic stool samples without other changes.Lp299v improved vascular endothelial function and decreased systemic inflammation in men with CAD, independent of changes in traditional risk factors and trimethylamine oxide. Circulating gut-derived metabolites likely account for these improvements and merit further study.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Day-old broilers (n = 80) were assigned to four dietary treatments, either fed a basal diet or the same diet supplemented with sucrose (4%), inulin (1%) or sucrose and inulin. At day 35, birds were killed and pH, lactate, ammonia, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and biogenic amines were determined in different parts of the digestive tract. Final body weights and the relative weights of liver, pancreas, crop, gizzard and small intestine were not influenced by treatment. The relative weights of the empty caeca and of the caecal digesta were higher with the diets containing inulin while caecal pH and ammonia were reduced. Lactate concentration was reduced in the crop (p < or = 0.01) and gizzard (p < or = 0.001) of sucrose-fed groups, while it was increased (p < or = 0.01) in the jejunum of inulin-fed group. Ammonia in the crop (p = 0.089) and gizzard (p = 0.067) tended to be lower in the group receiving inulin plus sucrose. Amongst SCFA, only  was detected in the crop and gizzard contents that tended to be lower (p = 0.09) in the crop digesta of sucrose plus inulin-fed group. N-butyrate (mol %) was higher (p < or = 0.001) in the caecal digesta of inulin-supplemented groups without affecting total SCFA. Dietary inulin elevated the concentration of putrescine in the jejunal and caecal contents. In the caecal digesta, total biogenic amines were increased (p < or = 0.001) in sucrose plus inulin-fed group without affecting production of biogenic amines in the jejunum. In conclusion, inulin could reduce the pH in the lower gastrointestinal tract of broilers, while sucrose had no acidifying influence in the upper digestive tract. Inulin enhanced the concentration or metabolic activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in the caecum. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential effect of inulin on the intestinal microbial composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29409331>Lactobacillus salivarius LA307 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA305 attenuate skin inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Oral  potential for the management of dermatological diseases is vast. However, results of available studies in skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), are inconsistent, partly because probiotic effects are strain specific. Careful selection of probiotic strains is therefore indispensable to ensure efficacy of treatment. In this study, Lactobacillus salivarius LA307, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA305 and Bifidobacterium bifidum PI22, three strains that were previously identified for their interesting immunomodulatory properties in allergy and/or colitis models, were assessed in the prevention of chronic skin inflammation induced by repeated applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- in hairless SKH-1 mice. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of skin lesions was performed together with measurements of serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-17, IL-22, IL-10 and IL-4. Daily oral treatment with the three strains at the dose of 1×10 cfu/day for 3 weeks limited the development of chronic skin inflammation, the effects being strain dependent. Indeed the two Lactobacillus strains significantly limited the intensity of skin inflammation both at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Macroscopic observations were correlated to the histological observations and the resulting microscopic score. This limitation of the development of AD-like skin lesions involved the modulation of cytokine production. Treatment with the two Lactobacillus strains induced a decrease in the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-17, IL-22 and at the opposite an increase in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and also of IL-4. Globally, B. bifidum PI22 had lower benefits. These results obtained in mice suggest that L. salivarius LA307 and L. rhamnosus LA305 could be good candidates for preserving skin integrity and homeostasis via the modulation of the gut microbiota and that their use could be beneficial in dermatological conditions such as AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107841>A novel non-dairy beverage from durian pulp fermented with selected  and yeast.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of sequential inoculation (Seq-I) of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis or Lactobacillus casei with yeast Williopsis saturnus on durian pulp fermentation. Seq-I of W. saturnus following B. animalis subsp. lactis did not bring about any significant differences compared to the B. animalis subsp. lactis monoculture due to the sharp early death of W. saturnus soon after inoculation. However, Seq-I of W. saturnus significantly enhanced the survival of L. casei and improved the utilization of fructose and glucose compared to L. casei monoculture. In addition, there were significant differences in the metabolism of organic acids especially for lactic acid and succinic acid. Furthermore, Seq-I produced significantly higher levels of volatile compounds including alcohols (ethanol and 2-phenylethyl alcohol) and  esters (2-phenylethyl , isoamyl  and ethyl ), which would positively contribute to the flavour notes. Although the initial volatile sulphur compounds were reduced to trace levels after fermentation, but the durian odour still remained.

Ruminal acidosis results in animal discomfort, anorexia, depression, decreased digestibility, and decreased milk production. In the present study, we examined the effects of daily addition of cells of a newly isolated strain of Prevotella bryantii (25A) to the rumen of 12 ruminally cannulated cows in early lactation. This strain was selected based on earlier in vitro studies that indicated its ability to grow rapidly, compete for starch, and produce organic acids other than lactate. After calving, all cows received increasing amounts of an energy-dense diet containing barley grain, corn silage, and grass silage in a 40:60 forage-to-concentrate ratio. Animals were blocked according to milk production from their previous lactation. Treatments (control and P. bryantii) were distributed among cows within the same block. Cows were fed once a day. Six cows were given a daily dose of P. bryantii (2 x 10(11) cells/dose), administered directly with a syringe through the rumen cannula, from 3 wk prepartum up to 7 wk postpartum. Rumen fluid was sampled before feeding and at 2 and 3 h postfeeding on wk 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 postpartum. Feed intake and milk yield were recorded daily and milk composition was recorded 2 d/wk, up to wk 7 of lactation. Feed intake was similar between control and treated cows. Prevotella bryantii did not change milk production, but milk fat tended to be greater in treated cows compared with control cows (3.9 vs. 3.5%). Rumen pH was similar between the 2 groups and differed across sampling times, being higher before feeding (6.3) as opposed to 2 h (5.9) and 3 h (5.7) postfeeding. Rumen lactate concentration was similar before feeding between control and treated cows; however, 2 to 3 h after feeding, lactate concentration was lower in cows receiving P. bryantii compared with control cows (0.7 vs. 1.4 mM). This difference was maintained throughout the experimental period. Concentration of NH(3)-N was greater in treated cows than in control cows (174 vs. 142 mg/L).  (65.5 vs. 57.8 mM), butyrate (12.7 vs. 10.5 mM), and branched-chain C4 fatty acid (0.90 vs. 0.75 mM) concentrations were greater in postfeeding samples of treated cows compared with control cows. Supplementing early-lactating cows with P. bryantii 25A increased ruminal fermentation products and milk fat concentration. Because signs of subacute ruminal acidosis were not observed in either treated or control cows, no conclusions can be made about possible protection against acidosis by P. bryantii.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759496>Bacterial secretions of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli elicit inflammatory pathways: a closer investigation of interkingdom signaling.</a></h2><p>There have been many studies on the relationship between nonpathogenic bacteria and human epithelial cells; however, the bidirectional effects of the secretomes (secreted substances in which there is no direct bacterium-cell contact) have yet to be fully investigated. In this study, we use a transwell model to explore the transcriptomic effects of bacterial secretions from two different nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strains on the human colonic cell line HCT-8 using next-generation transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). E. coli BL21 and W3110, while genetically very similar (99.1% homology), exhibit key phenotypic differences, including differences in their production of macromolecular structures (e.g., flagella and lipopolysaccharide) and in their secretion of metabolic byproducts (e.g., ) and signaling molecules (e.g., quorum-sensing autoinducer 2 [AI-2]). After analysis of differential epithelial responses to the respective secretomes, this study shows for the first time that a nonpathogenic bacterial secretome activates the NF-κB-mediated cytokine-cytokine receptor pathways while also upregulating negative-feedback components, including the NOD-like signaling pathway. Because of AI-2's relevance as a bacterium-bacterium signaling molecule and the differences in its secretion rates between these strains, we investigated its role in HCT-8 cells. We found that the expression of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) responded to AI-2 with a pattern of rapid upregulation before subsequent downregulation after 24 h. Collectively, these data demonstrate that secreted products from nonpathogenic bacteria stimulate the transcription of immune-related biological pathways, followed by the upregulation of negative-feedback elements that may serve to temper the inflammatory response.The symbiotic relationship between the microbiome and the host is important in the maintenance of human health. There is a growing need to further understand the nature of these relationships to aid in the development of homeostatic  and also in the design of novel antimicrobial therapeutics. To our knowledge, this is the first global-transcriptome study of bacteria cocultured with human epithelial cells in a model to determine the transcriptional effects of epithelial cells in which epithelial and bacterial cells are allowed to "communicate" with each other only through diffusible small molecules and proteins. By beginning to demarcate the direct and indirect effects of bacteria on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, two-way interkingdom communication can potentially be mediated between host and microbe.Copyright © 2015 Zargar et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18407981>Effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.</a></h2><p>A study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (DFM) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses.

Within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (LS; 1.2 g of starch x kg of BW(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (HS; 2.4 g of starch.kg of BW(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. The DFM treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of BW x d) as follows: no DFM (CON; control), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC1; single-species DFM), or a mixture of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Enterococcus faecium (LAC4; multiple-species DFM). Total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (LS; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (AC; abrupt change in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (HS; high dietary starch collection). Data collected consisted of total DM intake and fecal output, fecal pH, fecal  and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of DFM in the feed. With the exception of Fe digestibility, there were no starch x DFM interactions. There was an effect of starch level (P <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for Mg (P = 0.08) and CP, K, and Zn (P > 0.10). Horses supplemented with LAC4 had increased ether extract (P < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased Na (P < 0.10) digestibilities compared with CON horses. All DFM-supplemented horses had increased Cu (P < 0.05) and Fe and numerically increased Zn digestibilities compared with CON horses. Fecal pH decreased (P < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (P < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from LS to HS. There was a tendency for elevated fecal pH (P < 0.10) in LAC1 horses compared with CON horses. These results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. Supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. The potential response of DFM supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28437455>Effect of a probiotic beverage consumption (Enterococcus faecium CRL 183 and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707) in rats with chemically induced colitis.</a></h2><p>Some probiotic strains have the potential to assist in relieving the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.

The animals were randomly assigned into five groups: Group C: negative control; Group CL: positive control; Group CLF: DSS with the fermented product; Group CLP: DSS with the non-fermented product (placebo); Group CLS: DSS with sulfasalazine. The following parameters were monitored: disease activity index, fecal microbial analyses, gastrointestinal survival of probiotic microorganisms and short-chain fatty acids concentration in the feces. At the end of the protocol the animals' colons were removed so as to conduct a macroscopical and histopathological analysis, cytokines and nitrite quantification.Animals belonging to the CLF group showed fewer symptoms of colitis during the induction period and a lower degree of inflammation and ulceration in their colon compared to the CL, CLS and CLP groups (p<0.05). The colon of the animals in groups CL and CLS presented severe crypt damage, which was absent in CLF and CLP groups.

Some metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria impair the motilities of pathogenic bacteria. Because bacterial motility is strongly associated with virulence, the metabolic activities of lactic acid bacteria are effective for suppressing bacterial infections. Here we show that lactose fermentation by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis inhibits the motility of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A single-cell tracking and rotation assay for a single flagellum showed that the swimming behaviour of Salmonella was severely but transiently impaired through disruption of flagellar rotation on exposure to media cultivated with Lac. lactis. Using a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, we observed that the intracellular pH of Salmonella was decreased because of some fermentation products of Lac. lactis. We identified  as the lactose fermentation product of Lac. lactis triggering the paralysis of Salmonella flagella. The motilities of Pseudomonas, Vibrio and Leptospira strains were also severely disrupted by lactose utilization by Lac. lactis.

Carbon, nitrogen, and mineral sources were first screened by one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) methods. In order to increase yield production, the selected variables were further statistically optimized using response-surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). The maximum and minimum levels of the selected variables were determined and a set of 34 experimental runs was performed. The optimum concentrations of the tested variables for production of viable cells (12.24 log CFU mL(-1)) and bacteriocin activity (25,600 AU mL(-1)) were tryptone (10.0 g/L), peptone (6.0 g/L), maltose (3.0 g/L), glucose (9.0 g/L), NaCl (15.0 g/L), sodium citrate (2.5 g/L), sodium  (1.0 g/L), and dipotassium PO(4) (0.1 g/L). Threefold increased yield of bacteriocin was achieved in optimized medium compared to the unoptimized counterpart, and this was two times less cost than commercial MRS medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29102685>Antibacterial activity of autochthonous bacteria isolated from Anabas testudineus (Bloch, 1792) and it's in vitro probiotic characterization.</a></h2><p>Antimicrobial potentials of bacteria isolated from Anabas testudineus have been evaluated through in vitro antagonistic activity against potent fish pathogens. The cellular components and filtered culture medium were effective against six fish pathogens. Altogether 110 strains were isolated from the fish gut, out of which 10 strains were selected through well diffusion method. From them, a strain HGA8B having cumulative maximum score was selected as candidate probiotic. The whole-cell product, heat-killed whole-cell product, Ethyl  extract, and the filtered broth were exhibited bactericidal activity against the tested pathogens. In addition, the isolated bacterium was capable of producing extracellular enzymes important for the digestion of food materials and was capable of growth in fish mucus from Oreochromis niloticus. The strain tolerated bile juice secreted by the host and effectively produced biofilm. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequence revealed that isolated strain HGA8B was Bacillus sp. (MF351637). Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of the bacterium did not induce any pathological signs, symptoms or mortalities in Oreochromis niloticus and revealed the safety of this bacterium as a candidate probiotic in aquaculture.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Xylooligosaccharides (XOS), fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and inulin were used as references. The observed effects mainly depended on the average degree of polymerization (avDP) of the AXOS preparations. The AXOS and XOS preparations with a low avDP (<or=3) resulted in increased colonic  and butyrate production and boosted bifidobacteria concentrations in the cecum, but did not significantly lower the concentrations of branched SCFA, which are considered to be markers of protein fermentation by intestinal microbiota. In contrast, an AXOS preparation with a higher avDP (61) effectively suppressed branched SCFA concentrations and thus tipped the balance away from protein fermentation. However, it neither increased colonic butyrate concentrations nor stimulated cecal bifidobacteria development. Two AXOS preparations with a similar avDP (12 and 15) but different average degrees of arabinose substitution (avDAS) (0.69 and 0.27) affected the measured intestinal characteristics similarly, suggesting that the influence of the avDAS was apparently limited and possibly overshadowed by that of the avDP. Among those tested, an AXOS preparation with an avDP of 5 and an avDAS of 0.27 exhibited the best combination of desirable effects on gut health characteristics. Compared with this optimal AXOS preparation, FOS and inulin resulted in similar bifidogenic effects with increased production of colonic  (inulin) but not of butyrate. These new insights into the structure-activity relation of AXOS open up new perspectives for the production and application of AXOS preparations with optimized prebiotic and fermentation properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29551016>Determination of Optimized Growth Medium and Cryoprotective Additives to Enhance the Growth and Survival of .</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been intensively investigated in recent decades with special focus on modulation of the host intestinal microbiota. Numerous discoveries of effective  are driven by a significantly increasing demand for dietary supplements. Consequently, technological advances in the large-scale production and lyophilization are needed by probiotic-related industries for producing probiotic LAB for commercial use. Our study had a dual objective, to determine the optimum growth medium composition and to investigate appropriate cryoprotective additives (CPAs) for , and compare its responses with other  species. The one-factor-at-a-time method and central composite design were applied to determine the optimal medium composition for  cultivation. The following composition of the medium was established (per liter): 21.64 g maltose, 85 g yeast extract, 1.21 ml Tween 80, 6 g sodium , 0.2 g MgSO₄∙7H₂O, 0.02 g MnSO₄∙H₂O, 1 g K₂HPO₄, 1.5 g KH₂PO₄, 0.01 g FeSO₄∙7H₂O, and 1 g sodium citrate. A cryoprotective additive combination comprising 10% (w/v) skim milk and 10% (w/v) sucrose supplemented with 2.5% (w/v) sodium glutamate was selected for , and its effectiveness was confirmed using culture-independent methods in the freeze-dried cells of the  strains. In conclusion, the optimized medium enhanced the species-specific cultivation of . On the other hand, the cryoprotective effects of the selected CPA mixture may also be dependent on the bacterial strain.

In addition, the mechanisms by which KGM modulated the bowel habit were explored.Seven constipated subjects who passed bowel movement less than once a day participated in this diet-controlled linear study that consisted of a 21-d placebo period, a 7-d adaptation period, and a 21-d KGM-supplemented (1.5 g, tid) period. The large bowel response and fecal characteristics were recorded daily. Stools were collected individually on days 15-21 of placebo and KGM periods for analyses of colonic ecology indices such as fecal microflora, pH and short chain fatty acid content. Fecal component was determined to illustrate the fermentation of KGM.KGM supplement slightly but significantly increased the weekly defecation frequency from 4.1 +/- 0.6 to 5.3 +/- 0.6 and slightly eased the bowel movement. The fecal wet weight (g/d) and percent moisture were not significantly altered with the fiber supplement. However, the dry fecal weight (g/d) was increased mainly in the soluble mass. KGM supplement increased the fecal concentration (log counts/g wet feces) of lactobacilli, and the daily output (log counts/d) of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and total bacteria in this diet-controlled study. In addition, fermentation of KGM resulted in greater fecal , propionate and i-butyrate concentrations and lower fecal pH.The modest dose of KGM supplement promoted bowel movement by 30% and improved colonic ecology in constipated adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806110>Bacteriostatic anti-Vibrio parahaemolyticus activity of Pseudoalteromonas sp. strains DIT09, DIT44 and DIT46 isolated from Southern Chilean intertidal Perumytilus purpuratus.</a></h2><p>We characterised the anti-Vibrio parahaemolyticus (anti-V. parahaemolyticus) marine bacteria DIT09, DIT44 and DIT46 isolated from the intertidal mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. The 16S rRNA gene sequences identify a Pseudoalteromonas sp. that form a clade with P. prydzensis and P. mariniglutinosa. The strains produced bacteriostatic anti-V. parahaemolyticus agents during the exponential growth phase, which were also active against V. cholerae and V. anguillarum, but not on other Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Bacteriostatic agents could be permeated by analytic ultra-filtration with 3.5 kDa cut-off, partially precipitated with 70 and 90 % ammonium sulphate, but not extracted with ethyl . Reverse-phase HPLC revealed the production of a set of 5-6 active compounds by each strain (elution from 20 to 40 % acetonitrile), with similar but non identical HPLC patterns. Additionally, V. parahaemolyticus was able to progressively overcome the inhibition of antibiotics in trypticase soy agar with Fe(III) 0.5 up to 2 mM, suggesting the involvement of a set of novel siderophore or active molecules targeted at different Fe-siderophore uptake systems. The overall findings suggest that Pseudoalteromonas sp. DIT strains produce a putatively novel class of bacteriostatic and probably amphiphilic anti-Vibrio agents, indicating the need for further studies with chemical purification followed by their structural and functional characterization. Finally, the crude cell-free extracts, as well as the strains incubated at 10(3) and 10(5) c.f.u./mL, did not cause mortality in Artemia franciscana nauplii, suggesting that these bacteria are serious candidates for further probiotic evaluations with shellfish and fish cultures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27253486>Emerging evidence of the role of gut microbiota in the development of allergic diseases.</a></h2><p>The purpose is to review recent studies examining the role of gut microbiota in allergic diseases and asthma.Work in experimental models gives further evidence that a disturbed gut microbiota influences the propensity to develop allergic manifestations, and that changing the gut microbiota by dietary means (high fiber/ or prebiotics) in pregnancy may reduce the risk of allergic airways disease and food allergy in the offspring, respectively. The gut microbiome in established allergic disease and prior to disease onset has also been assessed in clinical trials. One study demonstrated a strong association between high abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and decreased levels of butyrate and propionate, and established eczema. Lower relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae appears to be implicated in food sensitization and to precede the development of atopic eczema. Decreased relative abundance of Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia in early infancy was reported to be associated with increased asthma risk. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these genera decreased airway inflammation in their offspring thereby proposing a causal role of bacteria in preventing allergic airways disease.Gut microbiome research is an actively developing field. Although candidate bacterial taxa have been reported it still remains unclear which bacteria (or other microbes), in which numbers and combinations, and when during the gut  process may prevent allergic diseases and asthma. There is still a call for standardized approaches that will enable direct comparison of different studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29683328>Dietary Clostridium butyricum Induces a Phased Shift in Fecal Microbiota Structure and Increases the Acetic Acid-Producing Bacteria in a Weaned Piglet Model.</a></h2><p>Clostridium butyricum is known as a butyrate producer and a regulator of gut health, but whether it exerts a beneficial effect as a dietary supplement via modulating the intestinal microbiota remains elusive. This study investigated the impact of C. butyricum on the fecal microbiota composition and their metabolites 14 and 28 days after weaning with 10 g/kg dietary supplementation of C. butyricum. Dynamic changes of microbial compositions showed dramatically increasing Selenomonadales and decreasing Clostridiales on days 14 and 28. Within Selenomonadales, Megasphaera became the main responder by increasing from 3.79 to 11.31%. Following the prevalence of some  producers ( Magasphaera) and utilizers ( Eubacterium_hallii) at the genus level and even with a significant decrease in fecal  on day 28, the present data suggested that C. butyricum influenced microbial metabolism by optimizing the structure of microbiota and enhancing  production and utilization for butyrate production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27655598>[Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy recognition of metabolic patterns in fecal extracts for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer].</a></h2><p> To characterize the metabolic " fingerprint" of fecal extracts for diagnosis of early-stage colorectal cancer(CRC)using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy(H-NMR)-based metabolomics coupled with pattern recognition.  From January 2014 to December 2014, we collected fecal samples at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, from 25 patients with colorectal adenomas(CR-Ad), 20 with stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ CRC, and 32 healthy controls(HCs). The patients were diagnosed by histopathology. No subjects had any complicating diseases. HCs showed no abnormalities from blood tests, endoscopic examination, diagnostic imaging, and/or medical interviews. We excluded participants who used antibiotics, NSAIDS, statins, or  within two months of study participation, and any patients who underwent chemotherapy or radiation treatments prior to surgery. We used orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA)for pattern recognition(dimension reduction)on H-NMR processed data(H frequency of 400.13 MHz), to find metabolic differences among CR-Ad, carcinoma and HC fecal samples; and receiver operating characteristic(ROC)analysis to determine the diagnostic value of the fecal metabolic biomarkers.

OPLS-DA clearly distinguished CR-Ad and stage Ⅰ/Ⅱ CRC from HC samples, based on their metabolomic profiles. Relative signal intensities in HCs were significantly lower than in the cancer patients for butyrate(HC: 23.0±6.0; CR-Ad: 18.0±5.0; CRC: 14.0±6.0; =-2.07, =0.008), (HC: 45.0±11.0; CR-Ad: 31.0±11.0; CRC: 24.0±8.0; =- 2.32, =0.011), propionate(HC: 26.0 ± 7.0; CR-Ad: 22.0 ± 6.0; CRC: 19.0 ± 5.0; =- 2.43, =0.032), glucose(HC: 37.0±7.0; CR-Ad: 31.0±7.0; CRC: 26.0±8.0; =-2.07, =0.044)and glutamine(HC: 4.5±2.0; CR-Ad: 4.9 ± 1.0; CRC: 5.4 ± 1.0; =2.21, =0.044).

Three candidate probiotic strains, Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-4270 (LC), L. rhamnosus I-3690 (LR) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis I-2494 (BA), were individually administered to HFD-fed mice (10(8) cells day(-1)) for 12 weeks. Each strain attenuated weight gain and macrophage infiltration into epididymal adipose tissue and markedly improved glucose-insulin homeostasis and hepatic steatosis. Weighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing of fecal bacterial 16S rRNA genes showed that the probiotic strains shifted the overall structure of the HFD-disrupted gut microbiota toward that of lean mice fed a normal (chow) diet. Redundancy analysis revealed that abundances of 83 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were altered by . Forty-nine altered OTUs were significantly correlated with one or more host MS parameters and were designated 'functionally relevant phylotypes'. Thirteen of the 15 functionally relevant OTUs that were negatively correlated with MS phenotypes were promoted, and 26 of the 34 functionally relevant OTUs that were positively correlated with MS were reduced by at least one of the , but each strain changed a distinct set of functionally relevant OTUs. LC and LR increased cecal  but did not affect circulating lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; in contrast, BA did not increase  but significantly decreased adipose and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α gene expression. These results suggest that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium differentially attenuate obesity comorbidities in part through strain-specific impacts on MS-associated phylotypes of gut microbiota in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24465012>Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are an essential component of the antimicrobial repertoire and represent an effective means by which neutrophils capture, contain, and kill microorganisms. However, the uncontrolled or excessive liberation of NETs also damages surrounding cells and can contribute to disease pathophysiology. Alterations in the gut microbiota, as well as the presence of local and systemic markers of inflammation, are strongly associated with the manifestation of a spectrum of intestinal disorders, including chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Although  exert beneficial effects on gut homeostasis, their direct effect on neutrophils, which are abundant in the setting of intestinal inflammation, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of nonpathogenic, enteropathogenic, and probiotic bacteria on the dynamics of NET formation. Using murine bone marrow-derived neutrophils and the neutrophil-differentiated human myeloid cell line d.HL-60, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG inhibits both PMA- and Staphylococcus aureus-induced formation of NETs. Moreover, probiotic L. rhamnosus strain GG had potent antioxidative activity: dampening reactive oxygen species production and phagocytic capacity of the neutrophils while protecting against cell cytotoxicity. Within the milieu of the gut, this represents a novel mechanism by which  can locally dampen innate immune responses and confer desensitization toward luminal Ags.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23233282>Development of probiotic tablets using microparticles: viability studies and stability studies.</a></h2><p>Alternative vectors to deliver viable cells of , to those conferring limited resistance to gastrointestinal conditions, still need to be sought. Therefore the main goal of the study was to develop tablets able to protect entrapped probiotic bacteria from gastric acidity, thus providing an easily manufacturing scale-up dosage form to deliver  to the vicinity of the human colon. Whey protein concentrate microparticles with Lactobacillus paracasei L26 were produced by spray-drying and incorporated in tablets with cellulose  phthalate and sodium croscarmellose. The viability of L. paracasei L.26 throughout tableting as well as its gastric resistance and release from the tablets were evaluated. Storage stability of L. paracasei L26 tablets was also performed by evaluation of viable cells throughout 60 days at 23°C and 33% relative humidity. A decrease of approximately one logarithmic cycle was observed after the acid stage and the release of L. paracasei L26 from the tablets occurred only after 4 h in the conditions tested. Microencapsulated L. paracasei L26 in tablets revealed some susceptibility to the storage conditions tested since the number of viable cells decreased 2 log cycles after 60 days of storage. However, the viability of L. paracasei L26 after 45 days of storage did not reveal significant susceptibility upon exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The developed probiotic tablets revealed to be potential vectors for delivering viable cells of L. paracasei L26 and probably other  to persons/patients who might benefit from probiotic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28116928>Assessment of the synbiotic properites of human milk oligosaccharides and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis in vitro and in humanised mice.</a></h2><p>The mode of delivery plays a crucial role in infant gastrointestinal tract colonisation, which in the case of caesarean section is characterised by the presence of clostridia and low bifidobacterial counts. Gut colonisation can be modified by , prebiotics or synbiotics. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are infant prebiotics that show a bifidogenic effect. Moreover, genome sequencing of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis within the infant microbiome revealed adaptations for milk utilisation. This study aimed to evaluate the synbiotic effect of B. longum subsp. infantis, HMOs and human milk (HM) both in vitro and in vivo (in a humanised mouse model) in the presence of faecal microbiota from infants born by caesarean section. The combination of B. longum and HMOs or HM reduced the clostridia and G-bacteria counts both in vitro and in vivo. The bifidobacterial population in vitro significantly increased and produce high concentrations of  and lactate. In vitro competition assays confirmed that the tested bifidobacterial strain is a potential probiotic for infants and, together with HMOs or HM, acts as a synbiotic. It is also able to inhibit potentially pathogenic bacteria. The synbiotic effects identified in vitro were not observed in vivo. However, there was a significant reduction in clostridia counts in both experimental animal groups (HMOs + B. longum and HM + B. longum), and a specific immune response via increased interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6 production. Animal models do not perfectly mimic human conditions; however, they are essential for testing the safety of functional foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26319882>Metabolism of Fructooligosaccharides in Lactobacillus plantarum ST-III via Differential Gene Transcription and Alteration of Cell Membrane Fluidity.</a></h2><p>Although fructooligosaccharides (FOS) can selectively stimulate the growth and activity of  and beneficially modulate the balance of intestinal microbiota, knowledge of the molecular mechanism for FOS metabolism by  is still limited. Here a combined transcriptomic and physiological approach was used to survey the global alterations that occurred during the logarithmic growth of Lactobacillus plantarum ST-III using FOS or glucose as the sole carbon source. A total of 363 genes were differentially transcribed; in particular, two gene clusters were induced by FOS. Gene inactivation revealed that both of the clusters participated in the metabolism of FOS, which were transported across the membrane by two phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) and were subsequently hydrolyzed by a β-fructofuranosidase (SacA) in the cytoplasm. Combining the measurements of the transcriptome- and membrane-related features, we discovered that the genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids (FAs) were repressed in cells grown on FOS; as a result, the FA profiles were altered by shortening of the carbon chains, after which membrane fluidity increased in response to FOS transport and utilization. Furthermore, incremental production of  was observed in both the transcriptomic and the metabolic experiments. Our results provided new insights into gene transcription, the production of metabolites, and membrane alterations that could explain FOS metabolism in L. plantarum.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Functional foods are commonly used to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota contributing to the maintenance of the host health or prevention of disease. In the present study, we characterized the impact of one month intake of a synbiotic food, containing fructooligosaccharides and the probiotic strains Lactobacillus helveticus Bar13 and Bifidobacterium longum Bar33, on the gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles of 20 healthy subjects.The synbiotic food did not modify the overall structure of the gut microbiome, as indicated by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The ability of the probiotic L. helveticus and B. longum strains to pass through the gastrointestinal tract was hypothesized on the basis of real-time PCR data. In spite of a stable microbiota, the intake of the synbiotic food resulted in a shift of the fecal metabolic profiles, highlighted by the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (GC-MS/SPME) analysis. The extent of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), ketones, carbon disulfide and methyl  was significantly affected by the synbiotic food consumption. Furthermore, the Canonical discriminant Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) of GC-MS/SPME profiles allowed a separation of the stool samples recovered before and after the consumption of the functional food.In this study we investigated the global impact of a dietary intervention on the gut ecology and metabolism in healthy humans. We demonstrated that the intake of a synbiotic food leads to a modulation of the gut metabolic activities with a maintenance of the gut biostructure. In particular, the significant increase of SCFA, ketones, carbon disulfide and methyl  following the feeding period suggests potential health promoting effects of the synbiotic food.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26033744>Effects of dietary inulin on bacterial growth, short-chain fatty acid production and hepatic lipid metabolism in gnotobiotic mice.</a></h2><p>In literature, contradictory effects of dietary fibers and their fermentation products, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), are described: On one hand, they increase satiety, but on the other hand, they provide additional energy and promote obesity development. We aimed to answer this paradox by investigating the effects of fermentable and non-fermentable fibers on obesity induced by high-fat diet in gnotobiotic C3H/HeOuJ mice colonized with a simplified human microbiota. Mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented either with 10% cellulose (non-fermentable) or inulin (fermentable) for 6 weeks. Feeding the inulin diet resulted in an increased diet digestibility and reduced feces energy, compared to the cellulose diet with no differences in food intake, suggesting an increased intestinal energy extraction from inulin. However, we observed no increase in body fat/weight. The additional energy provided by the inulin diet led to an increased bacterial proliferation in this group. Supplementation of inulin resulted further in significantly elevated concentrations of total SCFA in cecum and portal vein plasma, with a reduced cecal :propionate ratio. Hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis (Fasn, Gpam) and fatty acid elongation/desaturation (Scd1, Elovl3, Elovl6, Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2) were decreased in inulin-fed animals. Accordingly, plasma and liver phospholipid composition were changed between the different feeding groups. Concentrations of omega-3 and odd-chain fatty acids were increased in inulin-fed mice, whereas omega-6 fatty acids were reduced. Taken together, these data indicate that, during this short-term feeding, inulin has mainly positive effects on the lipid metabolism, which could cause beneficial effects during obesity development in long-term studies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

CeD is therefore managed using a strict and lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), the only effective treatment available currently. However, the GFD is restrictive. Hence, efforts are being made to explore alternative therapies. Based on their mechanisms of action on various molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of CeD, these therapies may be classified into one of the following five broad approaches. The first approach focuses on decreasing the immunogenic content of gluten, using strategies like genetically modified wheat, intra-intestinal gluten digestion using glutenases, microwave thermal treatment of hydrated wheat kernels, and gluten pretreatment with either bacterial/ fungal derived endopeptidases or microbial transglutaminase. The second approach involves sequestering gluten in the gut lumen before it is digested into immunogenic peptides and absorbed, using binder drugs like polymer p(HEMA-co-SS), single chain fragment variable (scFv), and anti- gluten antibody AGY. The third approach aims to prevent uptake of digested gluten through intestinal epithelial tight junctions, using a zonulin antagonist. The fourth approach involves tissue transglutaminase (tTG) inhibitors to prevent the enhancement of immunogenicity of digested gluten by the intestinal tTG enzyme. The fifth approach seeks to prevent downstream immune activation after uptake of gluten immunogenic peptides through the intestinal mucosal epithelial layer. Examples include HLA-DQ2 blockers that prevent presentation of gluten derived- antigens by dendritic cells to T cells, immune- tolerizing therapies like the vaccine Nexvax2 and TIMP-Glia, cathepsin inhibitors, immunosuppressants like corticosteroids, azathioprine etc., and anti-cytokine agents targeting TNF-α and interleukin-15. Apart from these approaches, research is being done to evaluate the effectiveness of /prebiotics, helminth therapy using , low FODMAP diet, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation in CeD symptom control; however, the mechanisms by which they play a beneficial role in CeD are yet to be clearly established. Overall, although many therapies being explored are still in the pre-clinical phase, some like the zonulin antagonist, immune tolerizing therapies and glutenases have reached phase II/III clinical trials. While these potential options appear exciting, currently they may at best be used to supplement rather than supplant the GFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30139941>Human-origin probiotic cocktail increases short-chain fatty acid production via modulation of mice and human gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>The gut bacteria producing metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; e.g., , propionate and butyrate), are frequently reduced in Patients with diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, and cancers. Hence, microbiome modulators such as  may be helpful in maintaining or even restoring normal gut microbiome composition to benefit host health. Herein, we developed a human-origin probiotic cocktail with the ability to modulate gut microbiota to increase native SCFA production. Following a robust protocol of isolation, characterization and safety validation of infant gut-origin Lactobacillus and Enterococcus strains with probiotic attributes (tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions, adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, absence of potential virulence genes, cell-surface hydrophobicity, and susceptibility to common antibiotics), we select 10 strains (5 from each genera) out of total 321 isolates. A single dose (oral gavage) as well as 5 consecutive doses of this 10-strain probiotic cocktail in mice modulates gut microbiome and increases SCFA production (particularly propionate and butyrate). Inoculation of these  in human feces also increases SCFA production along with microbiome modulation. Results indicate that human-origin probiotic lactobacilli and enterococci could ameliorate gut microbiome dysbiosis and hence may prove to be a potential therapy for diseases involving reduced SCFAs production in the gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25780093>Strengthening of the intestinal epithelial tight junction by Bifidobacterium bifidum.</a></h2><p>Epithelial barrier dysfunction has been implicated as one of the major contributors to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. The increase in intestinal permeability allows the translocation of luminal antigens across the intestinal epithelium, leading to the exacerbation of colitis. Thus, therapies targeted at specifically restoring tight junction barrier function are thought to have great potential as an alternative or supplement to immunology-based therapies. In this study, we screened Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus species for beneficial microbes to strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier, using the human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) in an in vitro assay. Some Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species prevented epithelial barrier disruption induced by TNF-α, as assessed by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). Furthermore, live Bifidobacterium species promoted wound repair in Caco-2 cell monolayers treated with TNF-α for 48 h. Time course (1)H-NMR-based metabonomics of the culture supernatant revealed markedly enhanced production of  after 12 hours of coincubation of B. bifidum and Caco-2. An increase in TER was observed by the administration of  to TNF-α-treated Caco-2 monolayers. Interestingly, -induced TER-enhancing effect in the coculture of B. bifidum and Caco-2 cells depends on the differentiation stage of the intestinal epithelial cells. These results suggest that Bifidobacterium species enhance intestinal epithelial barrier function via metabolites such as .© 2015 The Authors.

Thirty Santa Inês×Dorper crossbred intact males lambs weighing 20.4±3.8 kg were blocked by weight into 10 groups. Lambs in each group were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 dietary treatments: untreated (Control), LB, and LBLP silage. Lambs were fed experimental diets for 61 d. The apparent digestibility was indirectly estimated from indigestible NDF measured on d 57 to 59. Spot urine samples were collected from all animals on d 59 to estimate microbial protein synthesis. Lambs were slaughtered for carcass evaluation on d 61 when they weighed 32.4±5.2 kg. Six additional ruminally cannulated Santa Inês×Dorper crossbred wethers weighing 40.5±1.8 kg were used to examine dietary effects on ruminal fermentation. Average daily gain was increased when lambs were fed LBLP silage (P<0.05) but not LB silage. The LBLP silage had the highest (P<0.05) lactic acid concentration and both inoculated silages had greater acetic acid concentrations than the Control silage (P<0.05). Inoculation of corn silage increased intakes of DM, OM, CP, NDF, total carbohydrate (CHO), and GE by the lambs but decreased digestibility of DM, OM, CP, total and nonstructural carbohydrates, and concentration of GE and ME. (P<0.05). Nevertheless, lambs fed inoculated silages had greater microbial N supply than those on the Control treatment (P<0.05). The  to propionate ratio was lower in ruminal fluid of wethers in LBLP treatment than LB and Control treatment (P<0.05) and ruminal pH tended to be greater in LB lambs than in LBLP and Control wethers (P<0.10). Finally, the inoculation with both bacteria combined enhanced the silage fermentation. The intakes of DM, OM, CP, NDF, and GE were improved in the lambs fed corn silage inoculated with L. buchneri alone or combined with L. plantarum. The microbial N supply was enhanced in the lambs fed corn silage inoculated with L. buchneri. The inoculation of L. buchneri combined with L. plantarum reduced the  to propionate ratio in ruminal fluid and improved the ADG of lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060161>Effects of reductive acetogenic bacteria and lauric acid on in vivo ruminal fermentation, microbial populations, and methane mitigation in Hanwoo steers in South Korea.</a></h2><p>Animal science nutrition studies are increasingly focusing on finding solutions to reduce methane (CH4) emissions. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of reductive acetogenic bacteria [acetogen  (AP)] and lauric acid (LA) on in vivo rumen fermentation and microbial populations in Hanwoo steers. Four cannulated Hanwoo steers (392 ± 14 kg) were analyzed in a 4 × 4 Latin square design and were placed in hood-type chambers. They were fed similar amounts of concentrate and rice straw within and experimental design as follows: control (Con; 40 g DM basal feed, nonaddition of AP or LA), T1 = LA (40 g DM basal feed mixed with 40 g LA), T2 = AP (40 g DM basal feed, fermented with AP), and T3 = LA + AP (40 g DM basal feed, fermented with AP and mixed with 40 g LA). The animals were acclimatized to the diet for 15 d, followed by 6 d of the experimental period. Rumen fluid samples for metabolite and molecular analyses were collected 6 h after the morning feeding, with 2-h collection intervals. The enteric CH4 production was monitored on the last 2 d of the experimental period. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acids increased with the increase in time after feeding. , propionate, and butyrate concentrations were observed to be higher in the treatments than in Con. The addition of LA and AP reduced CH4 emission compared with that of Con (P < 0.01). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy results revealed no correlation between the LA and Con groups, but AP showed a correlation with LA and Con. Reduction in the number of protozoa which was accompanied by a decrease, because methanogens live symbiotically with protozoa. Supplementation of AP or LA alone and in combination decreased (P < 0.05) the methanogen population, whereas supplementation of LA alone significantly increased (P < 0.05) Ruminococcus flavefaciens and slightly increased total fungi. Thus, dietary supplementation of LA and AP has inhibitory effects on CH4 production in Hanwoo cattle. If the effects of this method can be maintained, reductive acetogens could become an important part of strategies to lower ruminant CH4 emissions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804905>Protective potential of Lactobacillus species in lead toxicity model in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>To alleviate adverse effects of heavy metal toxicity, diverse range of removing methods have been suggested, that is usage of algae, agricultural by-products and microorganisms. Here, we investigated lead (Pb) biosorption efficacy by two lactic acid bacteria species (LABs) in broiler chickens. In an in vitro study, Pb was added to culture medium of LABs (Lactobacillus pentosus ITA23 and Lactobacillus acidipiscis ITA44) in the form of lead . Results showed that these LABs were able to absorb more than 90% of Pb from the culture medium. In follow-up in vivo study, LABs mixture was added to diet of broiler chickens contained lead  (200 mg/kg). Pb exposure significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant activity in liver. The changes were recovered back to normal level upon LABs supplementation. Moreover, addition of LABs eliminated the liver tissue lesion and the suppressed performance in Pb-exposed chicks. Analysis of liver and serum samples indicated 48% and 28% reduction in Pb accumulation, respectively. In conclusion, results of this study showed that L. pentosus ITA23 and L. acidipiscis ITA44 effectively biosorb and expel dietary Pb from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24930470>Pyrroloquinoline quinone-secreting probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 ameliorates ethanol-induced oxidative damage and hyperlipidemia in rats.</a></h2><p>Chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption is associated with oxidative tissue damage, decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities, and increase in hepatic and plasma lipids. This study investigates the effect of modified probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) secreting pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) against EtOH-induced metabolic disorder in rats.Male Charles Foster rats were gavaged with EtOH (5 g/kg body weight [acute study] and 3 g/kg body weight per day for 10 weeks [chronic study]).Pretreatment of PQQ, vitamin C, and PQQ-secreting EcN prevented acute EtOH-induced oxidative damage in rats reflected by reduced lipid peroxidation in blood and liver and increased hepatic reduced glutathione. However, PQQ given externally was found to be most effective against acute EtOH toxicity. In the chronic study, rats treated with PQQ-secreting EcN showed remarkable reduction in oxidative tissue damage (liver, colon, blood, and kidney) with significant increase in antioxidant enzyme activities as compared to only EtOH-treated rats. Additionally, these rats had significantly lowered hepatic and plasma lipid levels with concomitant reduction in mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (0.5-fold) and increase in mRNA expression of acyl coenzyme A oxidase (2.4-fold) in hepatic tissue. Antioxidant and hyperlipidemic effects of PQQ-secreting EcN are correlated with increased colonic short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; i.e., , propionate, and butyrate) levels, and PQQ concentration in fecal samples (2-fold) and liver (4-fold). Extracted PQQ and vitamin C were given once a week, but they did not exhibit any ameliorative effect against chronic EtOH toxicity.Accumulated PQQ in tissues prevents hepatic and systemic oxidative damage. PQQ along with SCFAs reduced hyperlipidemia, which can be correlated with changes in mRNA expression of hepatic lipid metabolizing genes. Our study suggests that endogenous generation of PQQ by EcN could be an effective strategy in preventing alcoholic liver disease.Copyright © 2014 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30002323>A Vegetarian Diet Is a Major Determinant of Gut Microbiota Composition in Early Pregnancy.</a></h2><p>The composition of the gut microbiota can be influenced by dietary composition. In pregnancy, the maternal gut microbiome has associations with maternal and infant metabolic status. There is little known regarding the impact of a vegetarian diet in pregnancy on maternal gut microbiota. This study explored the gut microbiota profile in women who were vegetarian or omnivorous in early gestation. Women were selected from participants in the Study of  IN Gestational diabetes (SPRING) randomised controlled trial. Nine women identified as vegetarians were matched to omnivorous women in a 1:2 ratio. Microbiota analyses were performed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analysed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and Calypso software tools. There was no difference in alpha diversity, but beta diversity was slightly reduced in vegetarians. There were differences seen in the relative abundance of several genera in those on a vegetarian diet, specifically a reduction in , , and increases in the relative abundances of  and . In this sub-analysis of gut microbiota from women in early pregnancy, a vegetarian as compared to omnivorous diet, was associated with a different gut microbiome, with features suggesting alterations in fermentation end products from a mixed acid fermentation towards more /butyrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340>Evaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.</a></h2><p>Angelica dahurica root (ADR), which shows strong antioxidant activity, is used in Chinese medicine. This study evaluated the tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of ADR extracts fermented by four different probiotic bacteria: Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus brevis. The ADR was first extracted using distilled water, 70% ethanol, and ethyl , and then fermented by probiotic bacteria. The physiological characteristics of these fermented extracts, namely the antityrosinase activity, antioxidant activity, phenolic composition, and phenolic content, were evaluated and compared with those of unfermented extracts. Results showed that the water extracts after fermentation by probiotic bacteria exhibited the most favorable physiological characteristics. Among the extracts fermented by these probiotic bacteria, L. acidophilus-fermented ADR extract showed the most favorable physiological characteristics. The optimal IC values for antityrosinase activity, DPPH radical scavenging activity, and reducing power for L. acidophilus-fermented ADR extract were 0.07 ± 0.03, 0.12 ± 0.01, and 0.68 ± 0.06 mg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the physiological activities of fermented extracts were considerably higher than those of unfermented extracts. The tyrosinase inhibition and melanin content of B16F10 melanoma cells, and cytotoxicity effects of the fermented ADR extracts on B16F10 cells were also evaluated. We found that the L. acidophilus-fermented ADR extract at 1.5 mg/mL showed significant cellular antityrosinase activity with low melanin production in B16F10 cells and was noncytotoxic to B16F10 cells. Among all probiotic bacteria, water-extracted ADR fermented by L. acidophilus for 48 h was found to be the best skincare agent or antioxidant agent.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Gut microbiota and their metabolites are thought to be associated with the development of hypertension. We examined whether maternal high-fructose (HF) diet-induced programmed hypertension via altering gut microbiota, regulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and their receptors, and mediating nutrient-sensing signals in adult male offspring. Next, we aimed to determine whether early gut microbiota-targeted therapies with probiotic  and prebiotic inulin can prevent maternal HF-induced programmed hypertension. Pregnant rats received 60% high-fructose (HF) diet, with 2 × 10⁸ CFU/day  via oral gavage (HF+Probiotic), or with 5%  long chain inulin (HF+prebiotic) during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring ( = 7⁻8/group) were assigned to four groups: control, HF, HF+Probiotic, and HF+Prebiotic. Rats were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Maternal probiotic  and prebiotic inulin therapies protect against hypertension in male adult offspring born to fructose-fed mothers. Probiotic treatment prevents HF-induced hypertension is associated with reduced plasma  level and decreased renal mRNA expression of . While prebiotic treatment increased plasma propionate level and restored HF-induced reduction of  expression. Maternal HF diet has long-term programming effects on the adult offspring's gut microbiota. Probiotic and prebiotic therapies exerted similar protective effects on blood pressure but they showed different mechanisms on modulation of gut microbiota. Maternal HF diet induced developmental programming of hypertension, which probiotic  or prebiotic inulin therapy prevented. Maternal gut microbiota-targeted therapies could be reprogramming strategies to prevent the development of hypertension caused by maternal consumption of fructose-rich diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22146688>Probiotic bacterial strains differentially modulate macrophage cytokine production in a strain-dependent and cell subset-specific manner.</a></h2><p>Gut mucosal macrophages play a pivotal role in driving mucosal immune responses, resulting in either activation of inflammatory immune responses to pathogenic challenge or tolerance to beneficial luminal contents such as food and commensal bacteria. Macrophage responses elicited are dependent on tissue environment and the resulting cell subset, where homeostatic macrophages resemble the M2 macrophage subset and inflammatory macrophages resemble M1s.  can modulate macrophage function with outcome dependent on subset present. Using a THP-1 monocyte cell line-derived model of CD14high/low M1 and M2 macrophages, the aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of a panel of heat-killed probiotic bacteria and their secreted proteins on the subset-specific inflammatory marker profile of TNFα, IL-6 and NFκB. M1 and M2 cells were generated by differentiation of monocyte stable transfectants for high and low CD14 expression with phorbol 12-myristate 13- and vitamin D3, respectively, where the resulting CD14lo M2 and CD14hi M1s mimicked homeostatic and inflammatory mucosal macrophages. Subsets were stimulated by enteropathic lipopolysaccharides in the presence or absence of heat-killed (HK) or secreted proteins (SP) from a panel of probiotic bacteria. Regulation of cytokine expression was measured by ELISA and NFκB activity by reporter assay. HK  suppress CD14lo and augment CD14hi M1 and M2 production of TNFα whereas SPs augmented CD14hi M1 TNFα and were generally suppressive in the other subtypes. M2 macrophage IL-6 production was suppressed by both HK and SPs and differentially regulated in CD14lo and CD14hi M1s. NFκB activation failed to parallel the regulatory profiles for TNFα and IL-6 which is suggestive of probiotic bacteria exerting their regulatory effects on these cytokines in an NFκB-independent manner. In conclusion, HK and SP  differentially regulate macrophage cytokines and NFκB activation in a subset-dependent manner and suggest a cautionary approach to probiotic treatment of mucosal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150985>Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CRL 1584 isolated from a Lithobates catesbeianus hatchery.</a></h2><p>Lactococcus lactis CRL 1584 isolated from a Lithobates catesbeianus hatchery inhibits the growth of Citrobacter freundii (a bullfrog pathogen) and Listeria monocytogenes by a synergistic effect between lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and a bacteriocin-like molecule. The chemical characterization of the bacteriocin in cell-free supernatants indicates that it has a proteinaceous nature. Hexadecane and ethyl  did not modify the bacteriocin activity, while 10 and 20 % (v/v) chloroform decreased the activity by 29 and 43 %, respectively. The antimicrobial peptide was heat stable since 85 % of residual activity was detected when neutralized supernatants were heated at 80 °C for 30 min. Moreover, no bacteriocin inactivation was observed when supernatants were kept at -20 °C for 3 months. The synthesis of the bacteriocin was associated with bacterial growth, highest production (2,100 AU/ml) being detected at the end of the exponential growth phase. At pH ranges of 5-6.5 and 5.0-5.5 the inhibitory molecule was stable when stored for 2 days at 4 and 25 °C, respectively. Moreover, it had a bactericidal effect on L. monocytogenes and the ultrastructural studies of pathogenic cells revealed clumping of the cytoplasmic material, increased periplasmic space and cell wall modifications. The deduced amino acid sequence of the bacteriocin was identical to nisin Z and the genetic determinants for its production are harbored in the chromosome.

Dry coated pellet (DCP) loaded with  was optimized with respect to the quantity of the HPMCAS, an enteric coating polymer (108 mg), and the kinds and amounts of plasticizer (triethyl citrate, 15.7 mg; acetylated monoglyceride, 6.8 mg), by evaluating the survival rate of the bacteria during preparation process and in an acidic medium. Dry coating process allows the whole survivals of living bacteria during preparation process. The DCP formulation exhibited markedly higher acid tolerability and storage stability compared to uncoated viable bacteria. In an in vivo mucosal adherence study in rats, a profound colonization of viable bacteria in the small and large intestine was observed in rats receiving DCP system (p<0.05) compared to rats receiving uncoated . Moreover, we found that the repeated DCP administration noticeably inhibited intestinal penetration of endotoxin, a potent inflammatory stimulant, from intestinal mucus.

HBM mice were supplemented with Lactobacillus paracasei with (n = 10) and without (n = 7) prebiotics. Animals not supplemented with prebiotics received a diet enriched in glucose and lactose as placebo. In conventionalized animals, microbial populations and activities converged in term of multivariate mapping toward conventional mice. Both groups decreased bacterial processing of dietary proteins when switching to a diet enriched in glucose and lactose, as described with low levels of 5-aminovalerate, , and propionate and high levels of lysine and arginine. The HBM model differs from conventional and conventionalized microbiota in terms of type, proportion, and metabolic activity of gut bacteria (lower short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, 5-aminovalerate, and oligosaccharides, higher bile acids and choline). The  supplementation of HBM mice was associated with a specific amino acid pattern that can be linked to L. paracasei proteolytic activities. The combination of L. paracasei with the galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics was related to the enhanced growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, and a specific metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and SCFAs.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of prebiotics (fructo- (FOS), galacto- (GOS) and mannan- (MOS) oligosaccharides) and the bacteriocinogenic Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL67 (RBL67) on Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium N-15 (N-15) colonization using the PolyFermS in vitro continuous fermentation model simulating the swine proximal colon.The PolyFermS model was designed with a first-stage reactor containing immobilized fecal pig microbiota. This reactor continuously inoculated five parallel second-stage reactors, a control and four treatment reactors, all operated with proximal colon conditions. FOS and GOS (5.2 g/day), and MOS (half dosage) and RBL67 (10(8) copy numbers/mL applied daily) were tested on the ability of N-15 to colonize reactors, inoculated with the same microbiota. Reactor effluents were collected daily and analyzed for microbial composition (quantitative PCR and 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene pool) and main metabolites (HPLC).RBL67 and N-15 were shown to stably colonize the system. Colonization of N-15 was strongly inhibited by FOS and GOS, whereas addition of RBL67 alone or combined with MOS showed intermediate results. However, the effect of FOS and GOS was enhanced when prebiotics were combined with a daily addition of RBL67. FOS and GOS increased the total short chain fatty acid production, especially  and propionate. RBL67 combined with FOS additionally stimulated butyrate production.Our study demonstrates the suitability of the porcine PolyFermS in vitro model to study nutritional effects of pro- and prebiotics on gut microbiota composition and activity. It can further be used to monitor Salmonella colonization. The inhibition effects of FOS and GOS on N-15 colonization are partly due to an increased  production, while further antimicrobial mechanisms may contribute to an enhanced inhibition with prebiotic-RBL67 combinations.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and  and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24274095>The use of direct-fed microbials for mitigation of ruminant methane emissions: a review.</a></h2><p>Concerns about the environmental effect and the economic burden of methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants are driving the search for ways to mitigate rumen methanogenesis. The use of direct-fed microbials (DFM) is one possible option to decrease CH4 emission from ruminants. Direct-fed microbials are already used in ruminants mainly to increase productivity and to improve health, and are readily accepted by producers and consumers alike. However, studies on the use of DFM as rumen CH4 mitigants are scarce. A few studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown a CH4-decreasing effect but, to date, there has not been a systematic exploration of DFM as modulators of rumen methanogenesis. In this review, we explored biochemical pathways competing with methanogenesis that, potentially, could be modulated by the use of DFM. Pathways involving the redirection of H2 away from methanogenesis and pathways producing less H2 during feed fermentation are the preferred options. Propionate formation is an example of the latter option that in addition to decrease CH4 formation increases the retention of energy from the diet. Homoacetogenesis is a pathway using H2 to produce , however up to now no acetogen has been shown to efficiently compete with methanogens in the rumen. Nitrate and sulphate reduction are pathways competing with methanogenesis, but the availability of these substances in the rumen is limited. Although there were studies using nitrate and sulphate as chemical additives, use of DFM for improving these processes and decrease the accumulation of toxic metabolites needs to be explored more. There are some other pathways such as methanotrophy and capnophily or modes of action such as inhibition of methanogens that theoretically could be provided by DFM and affect methanogenesis. We conclude that DFM is a promising alternative for rumen methane mitigation that should be further explored for their practical usage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28743928>Effect of  on the meat flavour and gut microbiota of chicken.</a></h2><p>To date, no report has demonstrated the use of beneficial microbes for contributing to the flavour characteristics and gut microbiota diversity of chicken. Here, we selected six  obtained from our laboratory and supplemented them in six different combinations to 420 newborn male Qingjiaoma chickens under the same controlled living environment (60 birds, no probiotic supplements). The results showed that chicken supplemented with Bacillus species showed beneficial effects in body weight.  is the major fermentation production in the chicken caecum, and chicken supplemented with Pediococcus pentosaceus had the average higher short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents. In chicken caecal microflora, the abundance of Bacteroidetes bacteria was positively correlated with the content of propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate, whereas an increase in  content was positively correlated to the abundance of Firmicutes. Compared to chickens without probiotic supplement, chickens supplemented with P. pentosaceus had more characteristic flavour compounds in the sampled breast meat, especially higher concentrations of (E)-2-heptenal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, and certain C6-C9 unsaturated fatty acids. This resulted in a stronger chicken-fatty or fatty odour which directly improved the flavour. These findings suggest that  can improve chicken meat flavour and increase gut microbiota diversity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28662676>Effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 on the lipid/lipoprotein profile and short chain fatty acids in healthy young adults: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Some  have hypocholesterolemic effects in animal studies, which are mediated, in part, by increases in fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

Although strain UB-B.2(T) showed 97.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to the type strain of C. hathewayi, it exhibited only 38.4% relatedness at the whole-genome level. It also showed differences from its closest phylogenetic relative, C. hathewayi DSM 13479(T), in phenotypic characteristics such as hydrolysis of aesculin, starch and urea and fermentation end products.

It is suggested that they exhibit, among many other health benefits, protective effects against carcinogenesis in the colon, but there is not enough human data to support this. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of barley-derived beta-glucan in the gut microbiota of polypectomized patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume 125 g of bread per day with beta-glucan (3 g/d), or without (placebo group), for 3 months. Thirty-three polypectomized men and women (mean age 57.6 years) were recruited into the study, but only 20 completed. Subjects did not consume any , prebiotics or antibiotics 2 months prior the intervention, or during the study. Stool samples were collected at baseline, on days 30 and 90 of intervention, as well as 2 weeks after the intervention, for enumeration of total aerobes and anaerobes, coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, Bacteroides spp., Clostridium perfringens, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and Candida spp. Faecal bacterial enzyme activity (beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase), pH, faecal moisture and the concentration of volatile fatty acids in the faeces were measured. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also recorded. Overall, no significant differences were observed in bacterial viable counts between the two feeding groups. Group specific analysis for β-glucan group revealed significantly decreased total coliform counts on the 30th day of the trial compared to the baseline (p = 0.041). Clostridium perfringens concentration increased without reaching statistical significance, on the 30th day, while it decreased significantly on the 90th day of the intervention compared to the 30th day (p = 0.016). An increase was noted in the molar ratio of  on the 90th day of the trial compared to placebo (p = 0.018). The molar ratio of butyrate presented a trend to increase on the 30th day, which decreased (p = 0.013) on the 90th day and then increase 2 weeks after the intervention (p = 0.017) compared to placebo. A decrease was recorded in the β-glucan group in the bloating and abdominal pain score after the 30th day of the intervention (Day 30-37) compared to placebo.

In this study, two different dietary supplements were designed and evaluated for their effects against Pb toxicity in mice. Dietary supplement A contained grape seed extract, tea polyphenols and  CCFM8661, and dietary supplement B contained vitamin C, calcium carbonate, zinc , and  CCFM8661. The results showed that both dietary supplements could effectively decrease Pb levels, protect aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and recover glutathione, zinc protoporphyrin and malondialdehyde levels in tissues and blood of mice. A step-through passive avoidance task confirmed that the dietary supplements could recover the learning and memory capacities of Pb-exposed mice. The protective effects of both dietary supplements to alleviate oxidative stress and cognitive impairments were superior to the chelator treatment. Administration of the dietary supplements during Pb exposure offered more significant protection than administration after Pb exposure. Animal safety evaluation also indicated that these dietary supplements barely induced side effects in the mice.

The development of more sophisticated methods, such as metagenomics sequencing, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, microarrays and fluorescence in situ hybridization, has expanded our knowledge on gut microbiome. Dysbiosis has been related to increased plasma concentrations of gut microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which triggers the production of a variety of cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells.

We have shown that gut dysbiosis plays a causal role in the development of hypertension in a rat model of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Functional analysis of the dysbiotic microbiota in OSA demonstrates a loss of short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. However, measurements of short chain fatty acid concentrations and testing of their role in blood pressure regulation are lacking. We hypothesized that reduced short chain fatty acids in the gut are responsible for OSA-induced hypertension. OSA significantly increased systolic blood pressure at 7 and 14 days ( P<0.05), an effect that was abolished by the probiotic Clostridium butyricum or the prebiotic Hylon VII. The 16S rRNA analysis identified several short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that were significantly increased by Cbutyricum and Hylon treatment.  concentration in the cecum was decreased by 48% after OSA ( P<0.05), an effect that was prevented by Cbutyricum and Hylon. Cbutyricum and Hylon reduced OSA-induced dysbiosis, epithelial goblet cell loss, mucus barrier thinning, and activation of brain microglia ( P<0.05 for each). To examine the role of  in OSA-induced hypertension, we chronically infused  into the cecum during 2 weeks of sham or OSA. Restoring cecal  concentration prevented OSA-induced gut inflammation and hypertension ( P<0.05). These studies identify  as a key player in OSA-induced hypertension.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of flour moisture content during extrusion on in vitro fermentation properties of whole grain oats. Extrudates were processed at three moisture levels (15%, 18%, and 21%) at fixed screw speed (300rpm) and temperature (130°C). The extrudates were then subjected to in vitro digestion and fermentation. Extrusion moisture significantly affected water-extractable β-glucan (WE-BG) in the extrudates, with samples processed at 15% moisture (lowest) and 21% moisture (highest) having the highest concentration of WE-BG. After the first 8h of fermentation, more WE-BG remained in fermentation media in samples processed at 15% moisture compared with the other conditions. Also, extrusion moisture significantly affected the production of , butyrate, and total SCFA by the microbiota during the first 8h of fermentation. Microbiota grown on extrudates processed at 18% moisture had the highest production of  and total SCFA, whereas bacteria grown on extrudates processed at 15% and 18% moisture had the highest butyrate production. After 24h of fermentation, samples processed at 15% moisture supported lower Bifidobacterium counts than those produced at other conditions, but had among the highest Lactobacillus counts. Thus, moisture content during extrusion significantly affects production of fermentation metabolites by the gut microbiota during the initial stages of fermentation, while also affecting probiotic bacteria counts during extended fermentation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Epithelial cells lining the FGT provide the first barrier to HIV-1 entry. Previous studies have suggested that certain hormonal contraceptives or a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiota can enhance HIV-1 acquisition in the FGT. We examined the effects of lactobacilli and female sex hormones on the barrier functions and innate immune responses of primary endometrial genital epithelial cells (GECs). Two probiotic strains,  RC-14 and  GR-1, were tested, as were sex hormones estrogen (E2), progesterone (P4), and the hormonal contraceptive medroxyprogesterone  (MPA). Our results demonstrate that probiotic lactobacilli enhance barrier function without affecting cytokines. Treatment of GECs with MPA resulted in reduced barrier function. In contrast, E2 treatment enhanced barrier function and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Comparison of hormones plus lactobacilli as a pre-treatment prior to HIV exposure revealed a dominant effect of lactobacilli in preventing loss of barrier function by GECs. In summary, the combination of E2 and lactobacilli had the best protective effect against HIV-1 seen by enhancement of barrier function and reduction in proinflammatory cytokines. These studies provide insights into how probiotic lactobacilli in the female genital microenvironment can alter HIV-1-mediated barrier disruption and how the combination of E2 and lactobacilli may decrease susceptibility to primary HIV infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30234072>Marine Actinomycetes with Probiotic Potential and Bioactivity against Multidrug-resistant Bacteria.</a></h2><p>Considering antimicrobial resistance problem, marine microorganisms with the bioactivity against multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens have attracted many scientific interests. To address this issue, a total of 21 marine actinomycetes isolated from the Caspian Sea have been screened out. Primary screening via cross-streak method revealed that 3 strains: MN2, MN39, and MN40 produce antimicrobial agents with wide spectrum activity. In the second step, the potent strains were characterized morphologically, and then identified genetically using 16S rRNA analysis. After that, the bioactivity of the ethyl  extracts of liquid culture against some MDR bacteria has been studied using disc diffusion method. Finally, the exoenzymatic activity of the strains, and the anti-vibrio activity of the extracts have been evaluated. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene (1.5 kb) showed that the potent strains belong to the genus .

These bacteria can uptake oligosaccharides for the fermentative metabolism of hexoses and pentoses, producing lactate,  as well as short-chain fatty acids and propionate. These end-products are known to have important effects on human health. β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) are pivotal enzymes for the metabolism and homeostasis of Bifidobacterium, since they hydrolyze small and soluble saccharides, typically producing glucose. Here we describe the cloning, expression, biochemical characterization and the first X-ray structure of a GH3 β-glucosidase from the probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BaBgl3). The purified BaBgl3 showed a maximal activity at 45 °C and pH 6.5. Under the optimum conditions, BaBgl3 is highly active on 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) and, at a lesser degree, on 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX, about 32% of the activity observed for pNPG). The 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure of BaBgl3 revealed a three-domain structure composed of a TIM barrel domain, which together with α/β sandwich domain accommodate the active site and a third C-terminal fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain with unknown function. Modeling of the substrate in the active site indicates that an aspartate interacts with the hydroxyl group of the C6 present in pNPG but absent in pNPX, which explains the substrate preference. Finally, the enzyme is significantly stabilized by glycerol and galactose, resulting in considerable increase in the enzyme activity and its lifetime. The structural and biochemical studies presented here provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of complex carbohydrates degradation utilized by probiotic bacteria as well as for the development of new prebiotic oligosaccharides.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the relationship between the maximum biomass of different homofermentative Lactobacillus and lactate accumulation, and to develop a prediction equation for the maximum biomass concentration in such cultures. The accumulation of the end products and the depletion of nutrients by various strains were evaluated. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of acid anions for various strains at pH 7.0 were examined. The lactate concentration at the point of complete inhibition was not significantly different from the MIC of lactate for all of the strains, although the inhibition mechanism of lactate and  on Lactobacillus rhamnosus was different from the other strains which were inhibited by the osmotic pressure caused by acid anions at pH 7.0. When the lactate concentration accumulated to the MIC, the strains stopped growing. The maximum biomass was closely related to the biomass yield per unit of lactate produced (YX/P) and the MIC (C) of lactate for different homofermentative Lactobacillus.

The effect of LC-EAS on nitric oxide release was analyzed in RAW 264.7 cells, wherein, an inhibition in nitric oxide production through suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression was observed. Evaluation of LC-EAS on LPS-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a down-regulation in TNF-α and IL-6 genes and an upregulation of IL-10. An inhibition in the protein expression of NF-κB, ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation confirms the immunomodulatory potential of LC-EAS. The effect of LC-EAS on in vitro intestinal epithelial cells was investigated using HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cells. LC-EAS exhibited an inhibition of NF-κB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas STAT3 phosphorylation was unregulated. To evaluate the downstream target of STAT3 upregulation, expression of the intestinal trefoil factor TFF3 which is a NF-κB regulator and STAT3 downstream target was studied. LC-EAS was observed to elevate TFF3 mRNA expression.

In this study we used Muc2 mucin-deficient (Muc2) and Muc2 littermates to test whether the probiotic mixture VSL#3 requires an intact mucin barrier to exert its beneficial effect. VSL#3 alone reduced basal colonic proinflammatory cytokine levels and improved epithelial barrier function in Muc2 animals. Similarly, in dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, VSL#3 dampened the proinflammatory chemokines KC, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and upregulated the tissue regeneration growth factors transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which accelerated resolution of colitis symptoms in Muc2 animals. Importantly, improved colonic health in VSL#3-treated animals was associated with attenuated reactive oxygen species production by peritoneal macrophages, restoration of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the small intestine, and increased abundance of bacterial commensals in the gut. The beneficial effects of VSL#3 in Muc2 animals were mediated by , an important short-chain fatty acid produced by gut bacteria.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the energy source's moisture content (high moisture corn and dry whole-shelled corn), two natural feed supplements (Saccaromyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM 1079-Levucell and Aspergillus oryzae-Amaferm), and two levels of vitamin A (2200 IU/kg and no supplementation) on the fecal excretion of E. coli O157:H7 in naturally infected cattle. One hundred sixty-eight Angus-cross beef steers were randomly allocated to 24 pens, and each pen was assigned 1 of 12 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. E. coli O157:H7 was detected by rectoanal mucosal swab (RAMS) and fecal grab samples using immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and standard microbiological techniques. On the basis of multivariable multilevel logistic regression models, we found a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in animals fed dry whole-shelled corn in models based on fecal-IMS, and this effect was increased if a super-shedding animal (shedding > 10(4) colony forming units of E. coli O157:H7 per gram of feces) was present in the pen at the time of testing relative to animals fed high moisture corn and nonexposed to super-shedders. However, in similar models based on RAMS-IMS testing, the effect of corn type on the prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 varied with the type of feed additive used. Being exposed to a super-shedding pen-mate also increased the odds of being positive to E. coli O157:H7 in the RAMS-IMS models.

It was hypothesized that fibrolytic bacteria isolated from the moose rumen could be used as  to improve fiber degradation and animal production. Thirty-one isolates (Bacillus, n = 26; Paenibacillus, n = 1; and Staphylococcus, n = 4) were cultured from moose rumen digesta samples collected in Vermont. Using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, culturing techniques, and optical densities, isolates were identified and screened for biochemical properties important to plant carbohydrate degradation. Five isolates were selected as candidates for use as a probiotic, which was administered daily to neonate lambs for 9 weeks. It was hypothesized that regular administration of a probiotic to improve fibrolysis to neonate animals through weaning would increase the developing rumen bacterial diversity, increase animal production, and allow for long-term colonization of the probiotic species. Neither weight gain nor wool quality was improved in lambs given a probiotic, however, dietary efficiency was increased as evidenced by the reduced feed intake (and rearing costs) without a loss to weight gain. Experimental lambs had a lower  to propionate ratio than control lambs, which was previously shown to indicate increased dietary efficiency. Fibrolytic bacteria made up the majority of sequences, mainly Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Ruminococcus. While protozoal densities increased over time and were stable, methanogen densities varied greatly in the first six months of life for lambs.

The metabolism of [1-(13)C]glucose was characterized in cells grown in glucose as the sole carbon source. Moreover, the metabolism of lactose specifically labeled with (13)C on carbon 1 of the glucose or the galactose moiety was determined in suspensions of cells grown in lactose. These experiments allowed the quantification of some intermediate and end products of the metabolic pathways, as well as determination of the consumption rate of carbon sources. Additionally, the labeling patterns in metabolites derived from the metabolism of glucose specifically labeled with (13)C on carbon 1, 2, or 3 in cells grown in glucose or lactose specifically labeled in carbon 1 of the glucose moiety ([1-(13)Cglucose]lactose), lactose specifically labeled in carbon 1 of the galactose moiety ([1-(13)Cgalactose]lactose), and [1-(13)C]glucose in lactose-grown cells were determined in cell extracts by (13)C NMR.

TRAIL is pro-apoptotic on colon cancer cells, while not cytotoxic towards normal healthy cells. However, its clinical use is limited by cell resistance to cell death which occurs in approximately 50% of cancer cells. Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are also known to specifically induce apoptosis of cancer cells.

Here, we investigated possible synergistic effect between Propionibacterium freudenreichii and TRAIL. Indeed, we hypothesized that acting on both extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways may exert a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect. Whole transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that propionibacterial supernatant or propionibacterial metabolites (propionate and ), in combination with TRAIL, increased pro-apoptotic gene expression (TRAIL-R2/DR5) and decreased anti-apoptotic gene expression (FLIP, XIAP) in HT29 human colon cancer cells. The revealed synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, depending on both death receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5) and caspases (caspase-8, -9 and -3) activation, was lethal on cancer cells but not on normal human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC), and was inhibited by Bcl-2 expression.

These results open new perspectives for food grade P. freudenreichii-containing products in order to potentiate TRAIL-based cancer therapy in colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814797>Host responses to the pathogen Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and beneficial microbes exhibit host sex specificity.</a></h2><p>Differences between microbial pathogenesis in male and female hosts are well characterized in disease conditions connected to sexual transmission. However, limited biological insight is available on variances attributed to sex specificity in host-microbe interactions, and it is most often a minimized variable outside these transmission events. In this work, we studied two gut microbes-a pathogen, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and a probiotic, Lactobacillus animalis NP-51-and the interaction between each agent and the male and female gastrointestinal systems. This trial was conducted in BALB/c mice (n=5 per experimental group and per sex at a given time point), with analysis at four time points over 180 days. Host responses to M.avium subsp. paratuberculosis and L. animalis were sensitive to sex. Cytokines that were significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) betweenthe sexes included interleukin-1α/β (IL-1α/β), IL-17, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and gamma interferon (IFN-) and were dependent on experimental conditions. However, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and IL-13/23 showed no sex specificity. A metabolomics study indicated a 0.5- to 2.0-fold (log2 scale) increase in short-chain fatty acids (butyrate and ) in males and greater increases in o-phosphocholine or histidine from female colon tissues; variances distinct to each sex were observed with age or long-term probiotic consumption. Two genera, Staphylococcus and Roseburia, were consistently overrepresented in females compared to males; other species were specific to one sex but fluctuated depending on experimental conditions. The differences observed suggest that male and female gut tissues and microbiota respond to newly introduced microorganisms differently and that gut-associated microorganisms with host immune system responses and metabolic activity are supported by biology distinct to the host sex.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21635575>Effect of feeding Bacillus subtilis natto fermentation product on milk production and composition, blood metabolites and rumen fermentation in early lactation dairy cows.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to determine the effect of Bacillus subtilis natto fermentation product supplementation on blood metabolites, rumen fermentation and milk production and composition in early lactation dairy cows. Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows (DIM = 29 ± 6 days, parity = 2.8 ± 1.1) were blocked by DIM and parity and then randomly assigned to three treatments (12 per treatment) in a 9-week trial. Cows in control, DFM1 and DFM2 were fed TMR diets supplemented with 0, 6 and 12 g of B. subtilis natto solid-state fermentation product per day per cow respectively. Plasma non-esterified fatty acids were lower (p = 0.03) in DFM1 and DFM2 compared with control cows (633 and 639 vs. 685 μm). Ruminal propionate increased (23.9 vs. 26.3 and 26.9/100 mol, control vs. DFM1 and DFM2 respectively) and  decreased (64.2 vs. 62.7 and 62.1/100 mol, control vs. DFM1 and DFM2 respectively) with increasing B. subtilis natto fermentation product supplementation. DMI of the cows in three treatments was not affected by B. subtilis natto fermentation product supplementation, but milk yield was 3.1 and 3.2 kg/day higher for DFM1 and DFM2 than that for control cows on average across the 9-week trial, and significant differences were observed during weeks 5-9 of the trial, which resulted in 9.5% and 11.7% increase in feed efficiency. B. subtilis natto fermentation product supplementation did not affect milk fat percentage and protein yield but increased (p < 0.05) milk fat yield and lactose percentage (p < 0.01) and tended to decrease protein percentage (p = 0.06). The findings show that B. subtilis natto fermentation product was effective in increasing lactation performance of early lactation dairy cows possibly by altering the rumen fermentation pattern without any negative effects on blood metabolites.© 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215997>Recent trends and applications of encapsulating materials for probiotic stability.</a></h2><p>The importance of  and their live delivery in the gastrointestinal tract has gained much importance in the recent past. Many reports have indicated that there is poor viability of probiotic bacteria in dairy based products, both fermented and non-fermented, and also in the human gastro-intestinal system is questionable. In this case, microencapsulation is the most significant emerging and efficient technology that is being used for the preservation of  against adverse environmental conditions. Apart from different techniques of microencapsulation, various types of encapsulating materials are also used for the process, namely, alginate, chitosan, carrageenan, gums (locust bean, gellan gum, xanthan gum, etc.), gelatin, whey protein, starch, and compression coating. Each one of the encapsulating materials has its own unique characteristics of capsule formation and provision of shape, appearance, and strength to microbeads. The type of encapsulating material also influences the viability of  during storage, processing, and in the gastrointestinal tract. The effectiveness of any material depends not upon its capsule forming capability, strength, and enhancing viability but also on its cheapness, availability, and biocompatibility. So, added convenience and reduced packaging costs may also be used to offset the cost of encapsulating one or more ingredients. Encapsulated forms of ingredients provide a longer shelf life for the product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19307644>Meta-analysis of the influence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae supplementation on ruminal parameters and milk production of ruminants.</a></h2><p>The effects of yeast supplementation on intake, production, and rumen fermentation characteristics have been widely studied, but results are inconsistent between different studies. A quantitative meta-analysis was applied to 110 papers, 157 experiments, and 376 treatments dealing with yeast supplementation in ruminants. The objective was first to highlight the major quantitative effects of live yeast supplementation on intake, rumen fermentation, and milk production, and second, to identify major differences in experimental conditions between studies that can affect the response to treatment. Some of these experimental conditions are referred to as interfering factors. Yeast supplementation increased rumen pH (+0.03 on average) and rumen volatile fatty acid concentration (+2.17 mM on average), tended to decrease rumen lactic acid concentration (-0.9 mM on average), and had no influence on -to-propionate ratio. Total-tract organic matter digestibility was also increased by yeast supplementation (+0.8% on average). Yeast supplementation increased dry matter intake (DMI; +0.44 g/kg of body weight; BW), milk yield (+1.2 g/kg of BW), and tended to increase milk fat content (+0.05%), but had no influence on milk protein content. Dose effects of yeast supplementation, expressed as log(10) [1+(cfu per 100 kg of BW)], globally confirmed the qualitative effects observed in the first analysis. The positive effect of yeast supplementation on rumen pH increased with the percentage of concentrate in the diet and with the DMI level. It was negatively correlated with the level of dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The positive effect of yeast supplementation on rumen volatile fatty acid concentration increased with DMI and crude protein levels. The positive effect of yeast supplementation on organic matter digestibility increased with the percentage of concentrate and NDF in the diet. The negative effect of yeast supplementation on lactic acid concentration tended to decrease when the DMI level and the percentage of concentrate in the diet increased. The effects of interfering factors were globally similar when either dose effect or qualitative effect of yeast was taken into account. Although rumen fermentation efficiency per se was not measured, these results suggest an improvement in rumen fermentation by yeast supplementation. This effect could, however, be modulated by several different factors such as DMI, percentage of concentrate or NDF in the diet, or species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26318448>Responses in ileal and cecal bacteria to low and high amylose/amylopectin ratio diets in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>Dietary starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation in the distal intestine. This study aimed to compare the bacterial community in the ileal and cecal digesta of growing pigs fed diets with low (0.14, LR pigs) and high (0.43, HR pigs) amylose/amylopectin ratio. Pyrosequencing based on MiSeq 2000 platform showed that in ileum digesta, Bacteroidetes of LR pigs was markedly higher than that in HR pigs (P < 0.05). Megasphaera and Prevotella were the two most predominant genera in LR pigs, and Prevotella was significantly higher in LR pigs than in HR pigs (P < 0.05). Prevotella was predominant in cecal samples from both LR and HR pigs, although no significant differences were found between the two groups. In the ileum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Mitsuokella multacida were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in LR pigs along with an increase of  and butyrate concentrations. Halomonas pacifica, Escherichia fergusonii, and Actinobacillus minor which belong to class Gammaproteobacteria were significantly lower (P < 0.01) in HR pigs with a significant increase (P < 0.01) of Lactobacillus acetotolerans-like bacteria. Therefore, the changed bacterial community may lead to a transformation of microbial function, such as the alteration of fermentation mode which is showed on the change of microbial metabolites like the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), to a response to the switch of dietary composition, and in turn, to help host absorb and utilize nutrients efficiently. The increase of dietary amylose induced the reduction of conditioned pathogens which may probably be due to the increase of some  such as Lactobacillus, thus reducing the risk of intestinal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19223094>Effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus on gut microflora metabolic biomarkers in fed and fasted rats.</a></h2><p>Little is known about fasting effects on gut bacterial metabolism. As  are purported to be beneficial for health, this study aimed to investigate the response of gut microbial metabolism on fasting with or without probiotic administration.Sixty male adult Wistar rats were allocated to six experimental treatments, for 6 days, arranged under three nutritional schemes namely: (a) ad libitum feeding (control), (b) fasting for 3 days and re-feeding for the remainder (re-fed) and (c) fasting for 6 days combined with parenteral liquid treatment during the last 3 days (starved). Each nutritional scheme had one non-probiotic and one probiotic treatment receiving orally Lactobacillus acidophilus. Rat caecal digesta were analyzed for bacterial enzyme activities and volatile fatty acids (VFA).Fasted rats had significantly lower activities of alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase and higher activities of beta-galactosidase and azoreductase compared to control and re-fed rats, irrespective of probiotic administration. Results were variable regarding cholylglycine hydrolase (CGH), while there were no differences between treatments regarding beta-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase activity. Fasted rats had significantly lower caecal VFA concentration and different fermentation patterns. L. acidophilus resulted in significantly reduced azoreductase activity and increased caecal  levels in fasted rats. Re-feeding appeared to restore most enzyme activities, fermentation intensity and to some extent fermentation patterns at control treatment levels. L. acidophilus resulted in significantly reduced CGH activity and increased butyrate levels in re-fed rats.The results indicate a health beneficial potential of L. acidophilus in fasted and re-fed nutritional states via reduction of harmful azoreductase and CGH activities and promotion of useful VFA components for colonic function and health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803064>Fermented Prunus mume with  inhibits 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13- induced skin carcinogenesis through alleviation of oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Maesil (Prunus mume Siebold and Zucc.), a member of the genus Rosaceae, has been reported to have antioxidative effects, as well as anticancer influence in many cancer lines. Thus, this present study was designed to investigate the inhibitory effect of fermented Maesil with  against 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13- (TPA)-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis via its antioxidative potential. Mice were fed a diet containing fermented Maesil, containing either 1% (1% FM fed group) or 2% (2% FM fed group) along with  following DMBA and TPA exposure. Continuous ingestion of the experimental feed markedly inhibited skin carcinogenesis, as evidenced by a marked decrease in papilloma numbers and epidermal hyperplasia as well as cellular proliferation and the percentage of proliferating-cell nuclear antigen positive cells. Also, the FM fed group showed an increase of total antioxidant capacity as well as an increased level of phase II detoxifying enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, concurrent with a decreased lipid peroxidation activity level. Taken together, these results suggest that fermented Maesil has the ability to suppress the development of DMBA-TPA induced skin carcinogenesis, via the reduction of lipid peroxidation, enhancing total antioxidant capacity and phase II detoxifying enzyme.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913304>An assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of Lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.</a></h2><p>There is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. In this study, the adhesion of 10 Lactobacillus species was investigated using H357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. Coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. The results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). All strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity. All strains, except Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl . There was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0·883, P < 0·001). The highest mean for autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the Lact. gasseri strains. Correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. This study indicated that the Lact. gasseri, Lact. fermentum, and Lact. paracasei strains might be potential  for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. It should also be emphasized that a selective process for probiotic strains is required.Adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. These abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. This is the first study to investigate the oral Lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. Significant results were found for the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for aggregation among certain strains of Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei. This observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use in oral health.© 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31219825>Microbiota and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: promising prospects for clinical interventions?</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most important cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries but no pharmacological therapy is currently available. Growing evidence suggests that the microbiota plays a role in the occurrence and evolution of this disease, namely through the production of bioactive metabolites.Omics technologies (metagenomic, metabolomic, and phenomic data) allow providing a robust prediction of steatosis. More than just correlations, causative effects of certain bacterial metabolites have been evidenced in vitro and in rodent models. Butyrate has been shown to be a potent metabolic and inflammatory modulator in the liver. Several aromatic amino-acids such as phenylacetic acid, imidazole propionate, and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic inflammation, whereas indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-) seem to preserve liver integrity. Current clinical trials aim at evaluating the efficacy of novel approaches (functional foods, prebiotic and , and fecal microbial transplants).The microbiota brings new hopes in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adequate intervention studies in targeted patients are needed to unravel the relevance of such approaches in the management of those liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101052>Molecular clues to understand the aerotolerance phenotype of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis.</a></h2><p>Oxygen is one of the abiotic factors negatively affecting the survival of Bifidobacterium strains used as , mainly due to the induction of lethal oxidative damage. Aerobic conditions are present during the process of manufacture and storage of functional foods, and aerotolerance is a desired trait for bifidobacteria intended for use in industry. In the present study, the molecular response of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis IPLA4549 to aerobic conditions is presented. Molecular targets affected by oxygen were studied using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT) PCR. Globally, oxygen stress induced a shift in the glycolytic pathway toward the production of acetic acid with a concomitant increase in ATP formation. Several changes in the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in redox reactions were detected, although the redox ratio remained unaltered. Interestingly, cells grown under aerobic conditions were characterized by higher activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, which can directly detoxify molecular oxygen, and by higher NADH oxidase specific activity, which can oxidize NADH using hydrogen peroxide. In turn, this is in agreement with the glycolytic shift toward  production, in that more NADH molecules may be available due to the lower level of lactic acid formation. These findings further our ability to elucidate the mechanisms by which B. animalis copes with an oxygen-containing atmosphere.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30405588>Characterization of Diversity and Probiotic Efficiency of the Autochthonous Lactic Acid Bacteria in the Fermentation of Selected Raw Fruit and Vegetable Juices.</a></h2><p>The diversity of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermented broccoli, cherry, ginger, white radish, and white-fleshed pitaya juices was analyzed using culture-independent and -dependent approaches. The major properties of selected probiotic strains, including dynamic variations in pH, viable cell counts, antibiotic resistance, bacterial adhesion to hydrophobic compounds, and survivability during simulated gastrointestinal transit, were investigated using broccoli as the fermentation substrate. In broccoli and ginger juices, the genus  occupied the dominant position (abundances of 79.0 and 30.3%, respectively); in cherry and radish juices,  occupied the dominant position (abundances of 78.3 and 83.2%, respectively); and in pitaya juice,  and  occupied the dominant positions (52.2 and 37.0%, respectively). , and  subspecies were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In general, the selected autochthonous LAB isolates displayed no significant differences in comparison with commercial strains with regard to growth rates or acidification in fermented broccoli juice. Among all the isolates,  B4-25 exhibited the highest antibiotic resistance profile (equal to that of  CICC20265), and suitable adhesion properties (adhesion of 13.4 ± 5.2% ∼ 36.4 ± 3.2% and 21.6 ± 1.4% ∼ 69.6 ± 2.3% to ethyl  and xylene, respectively). Furthermore,  Ca-4 and  B-25 featured the highest survival rates (22.4 ± 2.6 and 21.2 ± 1.4%, respectively), after simulated gastrointestinal transit.

The scope of this research was conducted to investigate the effects of two alternatives (Bacillus licheniformis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to monensin on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immunity, ruminal fermentation and microbial diversity of fattening lambs. One hundred and sixty Dorper × Thin-tailed Han sheep (32 ± 3.45 kg BW) were randomly assigned into 5 treatments of n = 32 lambs/group. Lambs in the control group were fed a basal diet (NC) while the other four treatments were fed basal diets supplemented with monensin (PC), Bacillus licheniformis (BL), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC), and the combination of Bacillus licheniformis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with protease (BS), respectively. The experiment lasted for 66 d. Feed intake was recorded every 2 d and lambs were weighed every 20 d. Ten lambs from each group were slaughtered at the end of the trial, and samples of serum and rumen fluid were collected. The results indicated that the dietary regimen did not affect the dry matter intake (DMI). The average daily gain (ADG) of BS treatment was significantly higher than NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with the NC treatment, the other four supplementation treatments increased the concentration of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin (INS) (P < 0.05). The malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) showed no significant difference among the 5 treatments while the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) of BS group was significantly increased (P < 0.05). The supplementation regimen decreased the concentration of ammonia Nitrogen (NH-N) and increased the content of microbial crude proteins (MCP) (P < 0.05). The supplementation of antibiotics and  reduced the concentrations of  and increased the concentrations of propionate (P < 0.05). The supplementation treatments increased the relative abundance of Lentisphaerae, Fibrobacteres and Tenericutes at the phylum level, whereas at the genus level, they increased the relative abundance of Fibrobacter (P < 0.05).

Short-chain fatty acids influence colonic health through various mechanisms. In vitro and ex vivo studies show that SCFAs have anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, play an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in colonocytes, and protect colonocytes from external harm. Animal studies have found substantial positive effects of SCFAs or dietary fiber on colonic disease, but convincing evidence in humans is lacking. Most human intervention trials have been conducted in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. Only a limited number of those trials are of high quality, showing little or no favorable effect of SCFA treatment over placebo. Opportunities for future research include exploring the use of combination therapies with anti-inflammatory drugs, prebiotics, or ; the use of prodrugs in the setting of carcinogenesis; or the direct application of SCFAs to improve mucosal healing after colonic surgery.© The Author(s) 2017.

Specifically, to show the relevance of this rapid screening tool, the antimicrobial potential of generally recognized as safe calcium diacetate (DAX) and blends with cranberry (NC) and oregano (OX) natural extracts was evaluated. Furthermore, the same extracts were evaluated against beneficial lactic acid bacteria. The targeted foodborne pathogens evaluated were Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus using optimized initial cocktails (∼10 colony-forming unit/mL) containing strains isolated from human food outbreaks. Of all extracts evaluated, 0.51% (w/v) DAX in ethanol was the most effective against all four pathogens. However, DAX when reduced to 0.26% and with added blends from ethanol extractions consisting of DAX:OX (3:1), slightly outperformed or was equal to same levels of DAX alone. Subculture of wells in which no growth occurred after 1 week indicated that all water and ethanol extracts were bacteriostatic against the pathogens tested. All the targeted antimicrobials had no effect on the probiotic organism Lactobacillus plantarum. The use of such rapid screening methods combined with the use of multistrain cocktails of targeted foodborne pathogens from outbreaks will allow rapid large-scale screening of antimicrobials and enable further detailed studies in targeted model food systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24693976>Cellular fatty acid composition and exopolysaccharide contribute to bile tolerance in Lactobacillus brevis strains isolated from fermented Japanese pickles.</a></h2><p>Bile tolerance is a fundamental ability of probiotic bacteria. We examined this property in 56 Lactobacillus brevis strains isolated from Japanese pickles and also evaluated cellular fatty acid composition and cell-bound exopolysaccharide (EPS-b) production. The bile tolerance of these strains was significantly lower in modified de Man - Rogosa - Sharpe (MRS) medium (without Tween 80 or sodium ) than in standard MRS medium. Aggregating strains showed significantly higher bile tolerance than nonaggregating strains in MRS medium, but there was no significant difference in the modified MRS media. The relative octadecenoic acid (C18:1) content of the 3 most tolerant aggregating and nonaggregating strains was significantly higher when bile was added to MRS. In MRS without Tween 80, the relative C18:1 content was only marginally affected by addition of bile. In MRS without sodium , only the 3 most tolerant nonaggregating strains increased their relative C18:1 content in the presence of bile. Meanwhile, culture in MRS without sodium  reduced EPS-b production in aggregating strains. In conclusion, both EPS-b and cellular fatty acid composition play important roles in bile tolerance of pickle-derived L. brevis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20136455>Antimicrobial activities of essential oil and hexane extract of Florence fennel [Foeniculum vulgare var. azoricum (Mill.)

Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the essential oils obtained from inflorescence, leaf stems, and whole aerial parts contained (E)-anethole (59.28-71.69%), limonene (8.30-10.73%), apiole (trace to 9.23%), beta-fenchyl  (3.02-4.80%), and perillene (2.16-3.29%) as the main components. Likewise, the hexane extract of the plant sample exhibited a similar chemical composition, and it contained (E)-anethole (53.00%), limonene (27.16%), gamma-terpinene (4.09%), and perillene (3.78%). However, the hexane extract also contained less volatile components such as n-hexadecanoic acid (1.62%), methyl palmitate (1.17%), and linoleic acid (1.15%). The in vitro antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil, anethole, and hexane extract were effective against most of the foodborne pathogenic, saprophytic, probiotic, and mycotoxigenic microorganisms tested. The results of the present study revealed that (E)-anethole, the main component of Florence fennel essential oil, is responsible for the antimicrobial activity and that the essential oils as well as the hexane extract can be used as a food preservative. This study is the first report showing the antimicrobial activities of essential oil and hexane extract of Florence fennel against probiotic bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359019>Eurotium cristatum, a potential probiotic fungus from Fuzhuan brick tea, alleviated obesity in mice by modulating gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Obesity is one of the major public health problems worldwide, mainly resulting from unhealthy lifestyles and diet. Gut microbiota dysbiosis may lead to obese humans and animals. Modulating gut bacteria through  or certain dietary supplements could normalize gut microbiota and subsequently alleviate obesity. The daily consumption of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) or its extracts has been observed to alleviate obesity in humans and experimental animals. In this study, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice, such as body weight gain and fat accumulation, was prevented by the consumption of Eurotium cristatum, the dominant fungus during the manufacturing and storage of FBT. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice was also partially normalized. E. cristatum was able to modulate both gut fungal and bacterial compositions, based on the analysis of the microbiota composition of mice fecal samples (n = 5). E. cristatum increased  and butyrate-producing bacteria in mouse gut. There was five times more butyrate in the fecal samples from mice fed with E. cristatum than that from untreated HFD mice. Our results suggest that E. cristatum may be used as a probiotic fungus to alleviate obesity and to modulate gut microbiota in humans beneficially.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554038>Survival of Kluyveromyces lactis and Torulaspora delbrueckii to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their use as single and mixed inoculum for cheese production.</a></h2><p>The demand for new probiotic products has shown recent increases alongside a growing interest in studying starter cultures of cheeses. This study thus aims to evaluate the ability to survive under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and impact of Torulaspora delbrueckii B14 and Kluyveromyces lactis B10 as single and mixed inocula for cheese production. These two yeast strains were subjected to simulated gastrointestinal tracts and tested for self-aggregation, hydrophobicity, pathogen inhibition, antibiotic resistance, and β-galactosidase production. The yeast strains were also assessed for their ability to survive in different NaCl concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10% w/v), multiple temperatures (4 °C and 40 °C), and used as single and mixed starter cultures for cheese production. Yeasts population levels were monitored by YPD plating and MALDI-TOF and metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS over the course of the 21 days cheese maturation process. T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 both showed >80% viability after the passage through the simulated gastrointestinal tract, had self-aggregation rates >90%, and displayed β-galactosidase activities of 0.35 U/g and 0.53 U/g, respectively. Both yeasts survived at 2.5%, 5%, and 10% NaCl for 21 days and showed growth at 4 °C. In cheese, the single inoculum of K. lactis B10 and mixed inoculum showed the highest levels of lactose consumption. HS-SPME GC-MS analysis of cheese samples allowed the identification of 38 volatile compounds. The highest concentrations of most of these compounds were observed after 21 days of maturation for the cheese produced with mixed inoculum. The most abundant acids detected were hexanoic and decanoic acid; the most abundant alcohols were 2,3-butanediol, 2-phenylethanol and isoamyl alcohol, and the most prevalent ester compounds were isoamyl  and phenethyl . Our results therefore show that T. delbrueckii B14 and K. lactis B10 are interesting yeasts for further studies in the context of  and positively impact the composition of desirable volatile compounds in cheeses, particularly when used as mixed inoculum.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Treatments were (1) a control milk replacer [22:20; 22% crude protein (CP) and 20% fat], (2) an accelerated milk replacer (27:10; 27% CP and 10% fat), (3) the control milk replacer with added DFM (22:20+D), and (4) the accelerated milk replacer with added DFM (27:10+D). Dry matter intake, rectal temperatures, respiration scores and rates, and fecal scores were collected daily. Body weight, hip and withers height, heart girth, blood, and rumen fluid samples were collected weekly. Effects of treatment, sex, week, and their interactions were analyzed. Calves fed an accelerated milk replacer, regardless of DFM supplementation, consumed more CP and metabolizable energy in the milk replacer. No treatment differences were found for starter intake or intake of neutral detergent fiber or acid detergent fiber in the starter. Calves fed the accelerated milk replacer had greater preweaning and weaning body weight compared with calves fed the control milk replacer. Average daily gain was greater during the preweaning period for calves fed the accelerated milk replacer, but the same pattern did not hold true during the postweaning period. Feed efficiency did not differ among treatments. Hip height tended to be and withers height and heart girth were greater at weaning for calves fed the accelerated milk replacer compared with calves fed the control milk replacer. Fecal scores were greatest in calves fed DFM. Overall , propionate, butyrate, and n-valerate concentrations were lower in calves fed the accelerated milk replacer, but DFM did not have an effect. Rumen pH was not different. Blood metabolites were unaffected by DFM supplementation, but calves fed the accelerated milk replacer had increased partial pressure of CO2, bicarbonate, and total bicarbonate in the blood. Direct-fed microbial supplementation did not appear to benefit the calf in this trial.Copyright © 2014 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

By degrading dietary substrates, the gut microbiota produces several metabolites that bind human pharmacological targets, impact subsequent signalling networks and in fine modulate host's metabolism. In this review, we revisit the pharmacological relevance of four classes of gut microbial metabolites in CMD: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, methylamines and indoles. Unravelling the signalling mechanisms of the microbial-mammalian metabolic axis adds one more layer of complexity to the physiopathology of CMD and opens new avenues for the development of microbiota-based pharmacological therapies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and  and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

Control of bacterial fish pathogen is a difficult task among aquaculture practitioners. A large number of antibiotics are used for the control of prevalent bacterial pathogens in aquaculture. This may lead to drug resistance among pathogens and further treatment will be ineffective. Here, we can use probiotic bacteria as a biocontrol agent in fish disease and it is a novel field. In this study, antimicrobial potential of the bacterium Bacillus coagulans (MTCC-9872) has been evaluated through in vitro antagonistic activity of cellular preparations/components against potent pathogens. The cellular preparations/components such as Ethyl  extract, whole-cell product, heat-killed whole-cell product, and filtered broth were exhibited bactericidal activity against the tested pathogens. Bactericidal activity varied among different cellular preparation/components. The tested bacterium effectively produced biofilm as significant as tested positive control in a microtitre plate and effectively adhered on to the glass slide. In addition, the bacterium was capable of producing extracellular enzymes necessary for the digestion of food materials and was capable to grow in fish mucus from Oreochromis niloticus. The bacterium tolerated bile juice secreted by the host. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of the bacterium did not induce any pathological signs, symptoms or mortalities in Oreochromis niloticus and revealed the safety of this bacterium in the fish.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28784506>Chemometric evaluation of the volatile profile of probiotic melon and probiotic cashew juice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the lactic acid fermentation on volatile compounds of melon and cashew apple juices. The effect of the fermentation processing on the volatile profile of probiotic juices was assessed by HS-SPME/GC-MS coupled to chemometrics with 67.9% and 81.0% of the variance in the first principal component for melon and cashew juices, respectively. The Lactobacillus casei fermentation imparted a reduction of ethyl butanoate, ethyl-2-methylbutirate, and ethyl hexanoate for melon juice; and of ethyl , ethyl-2-methyl butanoate, ethyl crotonate, ethyl isovalerate, benzaldehyde, and ethyl hexanoate for cashew juice. Measurements of the stability of these compounds and the formation of the component 3-methyl-2-butenyl in melon juice may be used as a volatile marker to follow the juice fermentation. These findings suggested that even though it is not a dairy product the lactic acid fermentation of fruits developed a volatile profile combining the fruit and lactic acid fermentation volatiles with mildly formation or degradation of aroma compounds.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The interplay among the host intestinal epithelium, the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota performs an essential role in gut homeostasis and protection against infectious diseases. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in orchestrating protective immunity and tolerance in the gut. The mechanisms by which DCs adapt their responses and discriminate between virulent microbes and trillions of innocuous bacteria remain ill-defined. Here we investigated the effect of cross-talk between commensal-related bacteria (CB) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists on DC activation and the outcome of the in vitro T helper response. Human monocyte-derived DCs were exposed to eight different Gram-positive or Gram-negative CB strains prior to activation with five different TLR agonists. The key polarizing cytokines interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-10, IL-1beta and IL-6 were quantified and the fate of naïve T-cell differentiation was evaluated. We identified a unique combination of Lactobacillus casei and TLR3 signals that acted in synergy to selectively increase IL-12p70 secretion. Exposure to poly(I:C) converted L. casei-treated DCs into potent promoters of T helper type 1 (Th1) responses. We propose that DCs can integrate harmless and dangerous non-self signals delivered by viral products, to mount robust Th1 responses. Thus, in vivo DC targeting with selective  may improve strategies for the management of enteric diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274213>[Host energy regulation via SCFAs receptors, as dietary nutrition sensors, by gut microbiota].</a></h2><p>Food intake regulates energy balance, and its dysregulation leads to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Free fatty acids are not only essential nutrients but also act as signaling molecules in various cellular processes. Recent studies have shown that the receptors GPR40, GPR41, GPR43, and GPR120 are new drug targets for treating metabolic disorders because they are activated by free fatty acids. Two of these receptors, GPR41 and GPR43, are activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs: , propionate, and butyrate), which are important energy sources for the host. During feeding, SCFAs are produced by the microbial fermentation of dietary fiber in the gut. The gut microbiota affect nutrient acquisition and energy regulation of the host, and can influence the development of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Hence, GPR41 and GPR43 are also a focus of research into energy regulation via SCFAs. We report that these SCFA receptors are involved in energy homeostasis: GPR41 regulates sympathetic activity, and GPR43 regulates adipose-insulin signaling by sensing SCFAs produced by gut microbiota. We believe that these results will provide valuable insight into therapeutic targets for treating metabolic disorders and diabetes, as well as in the use of  to control gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838858> Biofilm-Integrated Electrospun Nanofiber Membranes: A New Starter Culture for Fermented Milk Production.</a></h2><p>Electrospun nanofiber membranes are widely investigated in the past few decades as candidates for tissue engineering, which can mimic natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and improve cell adhesion, proliferation, and expression on nanofiber membranes. However, the formation of bacterial biofilms on nanofiber membranes and application of the biofilm-integrated nanofiber membranes remain largely unknown. Here, electrospun cellulose  nanofiber membranes are first utilized as scaffold materials for Lactobacillus plantarum ( L. plantarum) biofilm formation. Nanofiber membranes proved to be an excellent scaffold for bacteria biofilm with high stability, where biofilms were interlocked with nanofibers forming a cohesive structure. In comparison with planktonic bacteria, L. plantarum biofilms on nanofiber membranes show excellent gastrointestinal resistance. Instead of decreasing, the number of viable cells increased after 3 h digestion in vitro. The L. plantarum biofilm-integrated nanofiber membranes were used as reusable starter cultures for fermented milk production showing excellent fermentative ability and higher survival of L. plantarum during shelf life. The viable cells in fermented milk remained at 11 log CFU/g throughout the reusable batches, which is far above the required value of 7 log CFU/g in commercial products. In addition, the produced fermented milk possesses shorter fermentation time and higher survival of  during shelf life. The results suggest electrospun nanofiber membranes are ideal scaffold materials for bacteria biofilms immobilization in biotechnology and fermentation engineering, which broaden the potential use of electrospun nanofiber membranes in microbiology and strengthen the application of biofilms in fermentation engineering.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881953>Safety Evaluation and Colonisation Abilities of Four Lactic Acid Bacteria as Future .</a></h2><p>The study evaluated the safety and colonisation properties of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB), by determining their cell hydrophobicity and aggregation abilities.

Lactobacillus reuteri ZJ625, Lactobacillus reuteri VB4, Lactobacillus salivarius ZJ614 and Streptococcus salivarius NBRC13956 were tested for cell surface hydrophobicity abilities against xylene, chloroform and ethyl . The isolates were also tested for auto-aggregation and co-aggregation abilities; the optical densities of cell growth were measured after 1, 2, 3 and 4 h of experimental set-up. DNA was extracted from all the four isolates and amplified using PCR with specific primers to detect virulence genes of adhesion collagen protein (ace) and aggregation substances (agg and asa); also, resistance genes of Vancomycin vanA, Vancomycin vanC1 and Vancomycin vanC2/3 were assayed in the four isolates. The isolates showed high hydrophobicity to all solvents: xylene (78-84%), chloroform (68-75%) and ethyl  (52-60%). High auto- and co-aggregations ranging from 60 to 70% and from 45 to 56% respectively were observed in the isolates after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. Some of the tested isolates showed the presence of virulence and resistance genes; however, this does not indicate that these genes are unsafe because their transmission and expression abilities are unknown.

Under metformin treatment, disturbances of the intestinal microbes lead to increased abundance of  spp.,  and decreased abundance of . This alteration may potentially lead to adverse effects on the host metabolism, with the depletion of butyrate producer genus. However, an increased production of butyrate and propionate was verified in metformin-treated Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. The mechanisms underlying these nutritional alterations and their relation with gut microbiota dysbiosis remain unclear. Here, we used Genome-scale Metabolic Models of the representative gut bacteria  spp., , and  to elucidate their bacterial metabolism and its effect on intestinal nutrient pool, including macronutrients (e.g., amino acids and short chain fatty acids), minerals and chemical elements (e.g., iron and oxygen). We applied flux balance analysis (FBA) coupled with synthetic lethality analysis interactions to identify combinations of reactions and extracellular nutrients whose absence prevents growth. Our analyses suggest that  sp. is the bacteria least vulnerable to nutrient availability. We have also examined bacterial contribution to extracellular nutrients including short chain fatty acids, amino acids, and gasses. For instance,  sp. and  may contribute to the production of important short chain fatty acids (e.g.,  and butyrate, respectively) involved in the host physiology under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We have also identified pathway susceptibility to nutrient availability and reaction changes among the four bacteria using both FBA and flux variability analysis. For instance, lipopolysaccharide synthesis, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and amino acid metabolism are pathways susceptible to changes in  sp. and . Our observations highlight important commensal and competing behavior, and their association with cellular metabolism for prevalent gut microbes.

Prebiotic and probiotic strategies are thought to be useful in the context of experimental IBD. Here, we compared the effects of preventive versus therapeutic treatment with a high fiber diet (prebiotic) in combination or not with Bifidobacterium longum (probiotic) in a murine model of chronic colitis.Colitis was induced by adding dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to drinking water for 6 days (acute colitis) or for 5 cycles of DSS (chronic colitis).Administration of the high fiber diet protected from acute colitis. Protection was optimal when diet was started 20 days prior to DSS. A 5-day pretreatment with , a short-chain fatty acid, provided partial protection against acute colitis. In chronic colitis, pretreatment with the high fiber diet attenuated clinical and inflammatory parameters of disease. However, when the treatment with the high fiber diet started after disease had been established, overall protection was minimal. Similarly, delayed treatment with  or B. longum did not provide any protection even when the probiotic was associated with the high fiber diet.Preventive use of a high fiber diet or  clearly protects mice against acute and chronic damage induced by DSS in mice. However, protection is lost when therapies are initiated after disease has been established.

This study aims to characterize the compositional and functional effects of several nutritional, neutraceutical, and pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease interventions on the gut microbiome, through metagenomic and metabolomic approaches. Apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice were fed for 24 weeks either high-fat/cholesterol diet alone (control, HFC) or high-fat/cholesterol in conjunction with one of three dietary interventions, as follows: plant sterol ester (PSE), oat β-glucan (OBG) and bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri APC 2587 (BSH), or the drug atorvastatin (STAT). The gut microbiome composition was then investigated, in addition to the host fecal and serum metabolome.We observed major shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome of PSE mice, while OBG and BSH mice displayed more modest fluctuations, and STAT showed relatively few alterations. Interestingly, these compositional effects imparted by PSE were coupled with an increase in  and reduction in isovalerate (p < 0.05), while OBG promoted n-butyrate synthesis (p < 0.01). In addition, PSE significantly dampened the microbial production of the proatherogenic precursor compound, trimethylamine (p < 0.05), attenuated cholesterol accumulation, and nearly abolished atherogenesis in the model (p < 0.05). However, PSE supplementation produced the heaviest mice with the greatest degree of adiposity (p < 0.05). Finally, PSE, OBG, and STAT all appeared to have considerable impact on the host serum metabolome, including alterations in several acylcarnitines previously associated with a state of metabolic dysfunction (p < 0.05).We observed functional alterations in microbial and host-derived metabolites, which may have important implications for systemic metabolic health, suggesting that cardiovascular disease interventions may have a significant impact on the microbiome composition and functionality.

Cecal contents from laying hens were diluted to a 1:3,000 concentration with an anaerobic dilution solution and added to serum tubes filled with ground alfalfa or a layer ration with or without fructooligosaccharide (FOS) prebiotic. Samples were processed in an anaerobic hood, pressurized by using a pressure manifold, and incubated at 37 degrees C. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) and lactic acid concentrations were quantified at 6 and 24 h of substrate fermentation. In this study, fermentation of alfalfa resulted in greater production of , VFA, and lactic acid compared with the layer ration. Although with a relative inconsistency in data between trials, the amendment of FOS to both alfalfa and the layer ration appeared to further increase fermentation as demonstrated by overall higher propionate, butyrate, VFA, and lactic acid concentrations. The effect was more pronounced after 24 h of fermentation, implying time constraints for the optimal production of fermentation products in the chicken gastrointestinal tract.

They do not receive early enteral feeding and have limited opportunities for skin to skin contact with their mothers. Many of these infants receive gastric acid suppression therapies. All these factors increase the risk of gut dysbiosis in these infants. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased risk of infections and other morbidities in ICU patients. Experimental studies have shown that probiotics inhibit gut  with pathogenic bacteria, enhance gut barrier function, facilitate  with healthy commensals, protect from enteropathogenic infection through production of , reduce antimicrobial resistance, enhance innate immunity, and increase the maturation of the enteric nervous system and promote gut peristalsis. Through these mechanisms, probiotics have the potential to decrease the risk of sepsis and inflammation, improve feed tolerance and minimise cholestasis in neonates with CGISC. Among preterm non-surgical infants, evidence from more than 35 RCTs and multiple observational studies have shown probiotics to be safe and beneficial. A RCT in neonates (N=24) with gastroschisis found that probiotic supplementation partially attenuated gut dysbiosis. Two ongoing RCTs (total N=168) in neonates with gastrointestinal surgical conditions are expected to provide feasibility data to enable the conduct of large RCTs. Rigorous quality assurance of the probiotic product, ongoing microbial surveillance and clinical vigilance are warranted while conducting such RCTs.© 2018 The Authors.

Eight primiparous, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows were arranged in a paired 2×2 crossover design. Cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: 1) intraruminal inoculation of 35 ml suspension per day of M. elsdenii ATCC 25940 (MEGA), containing 108 cfu/ml of bacteria, dissolved in 35 ml of saline (0·15 m), or 2) carrier alone (35 ml saline; CTR). Both postprandial and preprandial rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA) and plasma metabolite measurements were analysed. Postprandial VFA patterns were affected the most, with butyrate (P<0·01) and valerate (P<0·01) proportions increasing, and  (P<0·01), isobutyrate (P=0·05) and isovalerate (P<0·01) decreasing in MEGA cows. Preprandial data measured at various days showed that MEGA dosage tended to increase the molar proportion of propionate (P=0·09) and lower the  to propionate ratio (P=0·07) in the rumen fluid. There was no effect of treatment on rumen pH and on the concentration of lactate in the rumen as well as on selected preprandial plasma metabolites. Postprandial plasma concentrations of cholesterol tended to increase (P=0·07) in MEGA cows compared with CTR. Concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the plasma were lower in MEGA cows after the morning feeding (P<0·01). Sampling hour also affected plasma NEFA in this study. Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) were not affected by the treatment (P>0·05); however, after the morning feeding BHBA concentration was increased in both groups of cows. Dry matter intake and milk yield and composition were not affected by treatment. In conclusion, results indicate that M. elsdenii has the potential to modulate the rumen fermentation profile in mid-lactation Holstein cows, but these effects were only slightly reflected in changes in plasma metabolites and milk composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729207>Efficacy of  from anaerobic microflora with prebiotics on growth performance and noxious gas emission in growing pigs.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of  from anaerobic microflora with prebiotics (synbiotics) on growth performance, noxious gas emission and fecal pathogenic bacteria populations in growing pigs. The basal diet, which contained approximately 25% corn, 24% whey, 12% wheat and 12% soybean meal, was supplemented alternatively with 0.15% antibiotics (US diet), prebiotics and 0.2%  from anaerobic bacteria (BS diet), yeast (YS diet), mold (MS diet) or compounds (CS diet). One hundred and fifty pigs were fed an experimental diet for 15 days. Although the growth performance was not affected by supplemental synbiotics, the BS group showed higher dry matter and crude protein digestibility. The BS group decreased fecal ammonia and amine gas emissions, and increased fecal  gas emission compared with the US group. All synbiotics groups decreased in fecal propionate gas emission. Fecal Escherichia coli population was lower in the synbiotics groups than in the US group. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that synbiotics exert similar effects with antibiotics on the nutrient digestibility and fecal microflora composition in growing pigs.

The preventive effects of probiotic/synbiotic therapy on microbiota and septic complications have not been thoroughly clarified in patients with sepsis. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether synbiotics have effects on gut microbiota and reduce complications in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis.Sepsis patients who were mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) were included in this randomized controlled study. Patients receiving daily synbiotics (Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, and galactooligosaccharides) initiated within 3 days after admission (the Synbiotics group) were compared with patients who did not receive synbiotics (the No-Synbiotics group). The primary outcome was infectious complications including enteritis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and bacteremia within 4 weeks from admission. The secondary outcomes included mortality within 4 weeks, fecal bacterial counts, and organic acid concentration. Enteritis was defined as the acute onset of continuous liquid stools for more than 12 h.Seventy-two patients completed this trial; 35 patients received synbiotics and 37 patients did not receive synbiotics. The incidence of enteritis was significantly lower in the Synbiotics than the No-Synbiotics group (6.3% vs. 27.0%; p < 0.05). The incidence of VAP was also significantly lower in the Synbiotics than the No-Synbiotics group (14.3% vs. 48.6%; p < 0.05). The incidence of bacteremia and mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the analysis of fecal bacteria, the number of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the Synbiotics group was significantly higher than that in the No-Synbiotics group. In the analysis of fecal organic acids, total organic acid concentration, especially the amounts of , were significantly greater in the Synbiotics group than in the No-Synbiotics group at the first week (p < 0.05).Prophylactic synbiotics could modulate the gut microbiota and environment and may have preventive effects on the incidence of enteritis and VAP in patients with sepsis.UMIN, R000007633 .

One hundred and eighty birds at the age of 65 weeks were induced to moult by mixing zinc oxide (ZnO) in feed at the rate 3000 IU/kg of feed. Upon completion of moulting, birds were divided into six groups (five replicates per group) in a completely randomized design and were fed vitamin C (500 IU/kg), vitamin E (100 IU/kg), lower protein level,  (50 mg/l), and a combination of these components, while one group was kept as control. After completion of moulting phase (5 weeks), the treatment effects were tested as in vitro macrophages engulfment percentage, nitric oxide (NO) production, serum antibody titres against Newcastle disease (ND) and infectious bronchitis (IB). The results showed that in vitro macrophage engulfment percentage in unopsonized conditions was significantly higher in vitamin E-supplemented group.

Yeast viability was studied under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. AFB(1) binding ability was evaluated at different pH values as present in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract. The effect of yeast strains on cellulose digestion and volatile fatty acids production by ruminal bacteria was also evaluated. All yeast strains were able to survive under gastrointestinal conditions and to adsorb AFB(1) at the different pH assayed. The strain RC016 showed the highest binding percentage at the three tested pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria in ruminal fluid increased in the presence of RC008 and RC016 yeast strains. The concentration of  and propionate after ruminal fermentation increased with the addition of RC008 and RC016 strains; this effect was less significant with RC009 strain. Strains RC008 and RC016 are potential probiotic to be included in animal feed: they help to increase fibber digestibility and could reduce AFB(1 )bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract. Viable S. cerevisiae RC008 and RC016 strains with both probiotic and mycotoxins adsorption properties could be used as feed additives in ruminant feedstuff.© 2011 Taylor & Francis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20724280>The Plackett-Burman design in optimization of media components for biomass production of Lactobacillus rhamnosus OXY.</a></h2><p>The central composite design was developed to search for an optimal medium for the growth of Lactobacillus rhamnosus OXY. The effect of various media components, such as carbon sources, simple and complex nitrogen sources, mineral agents, and growth factors (vitamins B, amino acids) was examined. The first-order model based on Plackett-Burman design showed that glucose, sodium pyruvate, meat extract and mineral salts significantly influenced the growth of the examined bacteria. The second-order polynomial regression confirmed that maximum biomass production could be achieved by the combination of glucose (12.38 g/l), sodium pyruvate (3.15 g/l), meat extract (4.08 g/l), potassium phosphate (1.46 g/l), sodium  (3.65 g/l) and ammonium citrate (1.46 g/l).

Although dietary interventions with , prebiotics, and synbiotics can be effective means to regulate obesity and associated comorbidities, the underlying shifts in gut microbial communities, especially at the functional level, have not been characterized in great details. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of synbiotics on the regulation of gut microbiota and the alleviation of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disorders in mice.Specific pathogen-free (SPF) male C57BL/6J mice were fed diets with either 10% (normal diet, ND) or 60% (high-fat diet, HFD) of total calories from fat (lard). Dietary interventions in the HFD-fed mice included (i) probiotic (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei DSM 46331), (ii) prebiotic (oat β-glucan), and (iii) synbiotic (a mixture of i and ii) treatments for 12 weeks. Besides detailed characterization of host metabolic parameters, a multi-omics approach was used to systematically profile the microbial signatures at both the phylogenetic and functional levels using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metaproteomics and targeted metabolomics analysis.The synbiotic intervention significantly reduced body weight gain and alleviated features of metabolic complications. At the phylogenetic level, the synbiotic treatment significantly reversed HFD-induced changes in microbial populations, both in terms of richness and the relative abundance of specific taxa. Potentially important species such as Faecalibaculum rodentium and Alistipes putredinis that might mediate the beneficial effects of the synbiotic were identified. At the functional level, short-chain fatty acid and bile acid profiles revealed that all dietary interventions significantly restored cecal levels of , propionate, and butyrate, while the synbiotic treatment reduced the bile acid pools most efficiently. Metaproteomics revealed that the effects of the synbiotic intervention might be mediated through metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolisms.Our results suggested that dietary intervention using the novel synbiotic can alleviate HFD-induced weight gain and restore gut microbial ecosystem homeostasis phylogenetically and functionally.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Stool testing included bacterial and yeast culture tests, lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, elastase, digestion markers, short chain fatty acids (SCFA's), pH, and blood presence. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed with a modified six-item GI Severity Index (6-GSI) questionnaire, and autistic symptoms were assessed with the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC).Gastrointestinal symptoms (assessed by the 6-GSI) were strongly correlated with the severity of autism (assessed by the ATEC), (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). Children with 6-GSI scores above 3 had much higher ATEC Total scores than those with 6-GSI-scores of 3 or lower (81.5 +/- 28 vs. 49.0 +/- 21, p = 0.00002).Children with autism had much lower levels of total short chain fatty acids (-27%, p = 0.00002), including lower levels of , proprionate, and valerate; this difference was greater in the children with autism taking , but also significant in those not taking . Children with autism had lower levels of species of Bifidobacter (-43%, p = 0.002) and higher levels of species of Lactobacillus (+100%, p = 0.00002), but similar levels of other bacteria and yeast using standard culture growth-based techniques. Lysozyme was somewhat lower in children with autism (-27%, p = 0.04), possibly associated with probiotic usage. Other markers of digestive function were similar in both groups.The strong correlation of gastrointestinal symptoms with autism severity indicates that children with more severe autism are likely to have more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and vice versa. It is possible that autism symptoms are exacerbated or even partially due to the underlying gastrointestinal problems. The low level of SCFA's was partly associated with increased probiotic use, and probably partly due to either lower production (less sacchrolytic fermentation by beneficial bacteria and/or lower intake of soluble fiber) and/or greater absorption into the body (due to longer transit time and/or increased gut permeability).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302882>Effect of sodium  on the adhesion to porcine gastric mucin in a Lactococcus lactis strain grown on fructose.</a></h2><p>The association of lactic acid bacteria with mucosal surfaces plays important roles in the beneficial effects of these bacteria on human health, such as colonization of the gastrointestinal tract for pathogen antagonism. Previously, we found that the adhesion of Lactococcus lactis 7-1 to porcine gastric mucin was higher with fructose than with lactose, galactose or xylose as the carbon source. In this study, we examined the effect of growth conditions on the adhesion of strain 7-1 grown on fructose. Medium components affect the adhesion: the adhesion of strain 7-1 grown with sodium  was higher than that without it. The enhancement of adhesion by sodium  was not observed under aerobic conditions. Cellular properties grown with or without sodium  were characterized: strain 7-1 grown with sodium  had similar sugar contents, and different fatty acid composition to those grown without it. Strain 7-1 grown with sodium  showed significantly lower cell yield and significantly higher hydrophobicity than those grown without it, which is associated with higher adhesion. Fructose and sodium  are frequently used in the food industry; this study may reveal a simple way to enhance the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria by growing them with these substances.© 2015 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414136>Highly efficient treatment of aerobic vaginitis with simple acidic buffered gels: The importance of pH and buffers on the microenvironment of vaginas.</a></h2><p>Aerobic vaginitis (AV) leads to uterus deep infection or preterm birth. Antibacterial agents are not optimal therapeutics of AV. Here, we report a series of temperature-sensitive in situ forming acidic buffered gels for topical treatment of AV, involving lactate, , and citrate gels at pH 3.5, 5.0, and 6.5. AV rat models were prepared following vaginal infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In vitro/in vivo studies of the buffered gels were performed compared with ofloxacin gels and blank gels. All the buffered gels showed the lower in vitro antibacterial activities than ofloxacin gels but the better in vivo anti-S. aureus effects and similar anti-E. coli effects. The buffered gels improved Lactobacillus growth in the vaginas. Both the healthy rat vaginal pH and the pH of rat vaginas treated with the buffered gels were about 6.5 though the AV rat models or ones treated with ofloxacin gels still remained at the high pH more than 7.0. After treatments with the buffered gels, the vaginal smears changed to a clean state nearly without aerobic bacteria, the vaginal tissues were refreshed, and the immunoreactions were downregulated. The acidic buffered gels bring rapid decrease of local vaginal pH, high antibacterial activities, improvement of , and alleviation of inflammation. They are simple, highly efficient, and safe anti-AV formulations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Bacteria-loaded pellets primarily prepared with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose  succinate were compressed into tablets with highly compressible excipients and optimized for flow properties, hardness, and disintegration time. The optimized probiotic tablet consisted of enteric-coated pellets (335 mg), microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH102, 37.5 mg), and porous calcium silicate (25 mg) and allowed whole survival of living bacteria during the compaction process with sufficient tablet hardness (13 kp) and disintegration time (14 minutes). The multiple-unit tablet showed remarkably higher storage stability under ambient conditions (25°C/60% relative humidity) over 6 months and resistance to acidic medium compared to uncoated strains or pellets. Repeated intake of this multiple-unit tablet significantly lowered plasma level of endotoxin, a pathogenic material, compared to repeated intake of bare probiotics or marketed products in rats.

Treatments were a control group (n = 15), which did not receive Megasphaera elsdenii (Me0) and a M. elsdenii group, which received a 50-ml oral dose of M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125 (10(8) CFU/ml) at day 14 day of age (Me14). Calves were given colostrum for the first 3 day followed by limited whole milk feeding. A commercial calf starter was offered ad libitum starting at day 4 until the end of the study. Fresh water was available throughout the study. Feed intake and growth were measured. Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture to determine β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Fourteen male calves (seven per group) were euthanised on day 42 and digestive tracts harvested. Reticulo-rumen weight was determined and rumen tissue samples collected from the cranial and caudal sacs of the ventral and dorsal portions of the rumen for measurements of papillae length, papillae width and rumen wall thickness. Dosing with M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125 improved starter dry matter intake (DMI), weaning body weight (BW) and tended to improve average daily gain. Calves in Me14 group had greater plasma BHBA concentration than Me0-calves during the last 3 weeks of the trial and had at day 42 greater reticulo-rumen weight, papillae width and papillae density compared to Me0. No differences in rumen wall thickness or papillae length were observed between the two groups. Total volatile fatty acids,  and propionate production did not differ between treatments, but butyrate production was greater in Me14 than Me0. Dosing M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125 showed benefit for calves with improved feed intake and rumen development suggesting increased epithelium metabolism and improved absorption of digestive end products.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972288>Alteration of gut bacteria and metabolomes after glucaro-1,4-lactone treatment contributes to the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone (1,4-GL) has been shown to have a hypocholesterolemic effect in rats and human subjects. However, little information is known concerning the alteration of metabolome associated with the effect. Here, we show that 1,4-GL delays the development of hypercholesterolemia with the coadministration of a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFHC) in rats. Metabonomic results based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that urinary trimethylamine N-oxide, trimethylamine, lactate, , formate, and creatinine are significantly altered after 1,4-GL and HFHC treatments. Colonic flora test results reveal that the quantity of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the intestines respectively increase by about 1.7- and 4.2-fold in rats treated with 1,4-GL compared with those in the control group. Rats that were coadministered with HFHC and 1,4-GL exhibit normal levels of lactate and  in serum and display urinary excretions of lactate and  that are 2 to 3 times higher compared with those treated with HFHC alone. The results imply that the increased probiotic quantities and urinary excretion of breakdown products of fat/cholesterol after 1,4-GL treatment contribute to the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.

In this study, we assessed the utilization of different carbon sources (glucose, starch, inulin and fructooligosaccharides) by strains of both genera and selected the best suited combinations for evidencing this cross-feeding phenomenon. Co-cultures of Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32 with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii S3/L3 with fructooligosaccharides as carbon source, as well as with F. prausnitzii A2-165 in starch, were carried out and the production of short-chain fatty acids was determined.

In contrast, butyrate concentrations were higher in co-cultures as compared to the respective F. prausnitzii monocultures, indicating enhanced formation of butyrate by F. prausnitzii in the presence of the bifidobacteria. Variations in the levels of  and butyrate were more pronounced in the co-culture with fructooligosaccharides than with starch.

One approach is feeding the electron acceptor NO, thus outcompeting methanogens for aqueous H. We hypothesized that a live yeast culture (LYC; Saccharomyces cerevisiae from Yea-Sacc 1026, Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, KY) would stimulate the complete reduction of NO to NH by selenomonads, thus decreasing the quantity of CH emissions per unit of energy-corrected milk production while decreasing blood methemoglobin concentration resulting from the absorbed intermediate, NO. Twelve lactating Jersey cows (8 multiparous and noncannulated; 4 primiparous and ruminally cannulated) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cattle were fed diets containing 1.5% NO (from calcium ammonium nitrate) or an isonitrogenous control diet (containing additional urea) and given a top-dress of ground corn without or with LYC, with the fourth week used for data collection. Noncannulated cows were spot measured for CH emission by mouth using GreenFeed (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). The main effect of NO decreased CH by 17% but decreased dry matter intake by 10% (from 19.8 to 17.8 kg/d) such that CH:dry matter intake numerically decreased by 8% and CH:milk net energy for lactation production was unaffected by treatment. Milk and milk fat production were not affected, but NO decreased milk protein from 758 to 689 g/d. Ruminal pH decreased more sharply after feeding for cows fed diets without NO. :propionate was greater for cows fed NO, particularly when combined with LYC (interaction effect). Blood methemoglobin was higher for cattle fed NO than for those fed the control diet but was low for both treatments (1.5 vs. 0.5%, respectively; only one measurement exceeded 5%), indicating minimal risk for NO accumulation at our feeding level of NO. Although neither apparent organic matter nor neutral detergent fiber digestibilities were affected, apparent N digestibility had an interaction for NO × LYC such that apparent N digestibility was numerically lowest for diets containing both NO and LYC compared with the other 3 diets. Under the conditions of this study, NO mitigated ruminal methanogenesis but also depressed dry matter intake and milk protein yield. Based on the fact that few interactions were detected, LYC had a minimal role in attenuating negative cow responses to NO supplementation.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533 is relatively sensitive to oxidative stress; the presence of oxygen causes a lower biomass yield due to early growth stagnation. We show however that oxygen can also be beneficial to this organism as it relieves the requirement for  and CO2 during growth. Both on agar- and liquid-media, anaerobic growth of L. johnsonii NCC 533 requires CO2 supplementation of the gas phase. Switching off the CO2 supply induces growth arrest and cell death. The presence of molecular oxygen overcomes the CO2 dependency. Analogously, L. johnsonii NCC 533 strictly requires media with  to sustain anaerobic growth, although supplementation at a level that is 100-fold lower (120 microM) than the concentration in regular growth medium for lactobacilli already suffices for normal growth. Analogous to the CO2 requirement, oxygen supply relieves this -dependency for growth. The L. johnsonii NCC 533 genome indicates that this organism lacks genes coding for pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), both CO2 and acetyl-CoA producing systems. Therefore, C1- and C2- compound production is predicted to largely depend on pyruvate oxidase activity (POX). This proposed role of POX in C2/C1-generation is corroborated by the observation that in a POX deficient mutant of L. johnsonii NCC 533, oxygen is not able to overcome  dependency nor does it relieve the CO2 dependency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28658542>The nutrition-gut microbiome-physiology axis and allergic diseases.</a></h2><p>Dietary and bacterial metabolites influence immune responses. This raises the question whether the increased incidence of allergies, asthma, some autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and others might relate to intake of unhealthy foods, and the decreased intake of dietary fiber. In recent years, new knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underpinning a 'diet-gut microbiota-physiology axis' has emerged to substantiate this idea. Fiber is fermented to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly , butyrate, and propionate. These metabolites bind 'metabolite-sensing' G-protein-coupled receptors such as GPR43, GPR41, and GPR109A. These receptors play fundamental roles in the promotion of gut homeostasis and the regulation of inflammatory responses. For instance, these receptors and their metabolites influence Treg biology, epithelial integrity, gut homeostasis, DC biology, and IgA antibody responses. The SCFAs also influence gene transcription in many cells and tissues, through their inhibition of histone deacetylase expression or function. Contained in this mix is the gut microbiome, as commensal bacteria in the gut have the necessary enzymes to digest dietary fiber to SCFAs, and dysbiosis in the gut may affect the production of SCFAs and their distribution to tissues throughout the body. SCFAs can epigenetically modify DNA, and so may be one mechanism to account for diseases with a 'developmental origin', whereby in utero or post-natal exposure to environmental factors (such as nutrition of the mother) may account for disease later in life. If the nutrition-gut microbiome-physiology axis does underpin at least some of the Western lifestyle influence on asthma and allergies, then there is tremendous scope to correct this with healthy foodstuffs, , and prebiotics.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Some Bifidobacterium strains produce exopolysaccharides (EPS), complex carbohydrate polymers that promote changes in the metabolism of B. fragilis when this microorganism grows in their presence. To demonstrate that B. fragilis can use EPS from bifidobacteria as fermentable substrates, purified EPS fractions from two strains, Bifidobacterium longum E44 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis R1, were added as the sole carbon source in cultures of B. fragilis DSMZ 2151 in a minimal medium. Bacterial counts were determined during incubation and the evolution of organic acids, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and evolution of EPS fractions was analysed by chromatography.Growth of B. fragilis at early stages of incubation was slower in EPS than with glucose, microbial levels remaining higher in EPS at prolonged incubation times. A shift in metabolite production by B. fragilis occurred from early to late stages of growth, leading to the increase in the production of propionate and  whereas decrease lactate formation. The amount of the two peaks with different molar mass of the EPS E44 clearly decreased along incubation whereas a consumption of the polymer R1 was not so evident.This report demonstrates that B. fragilis can consume some EPS from bifidobacteria, with a concomitant release of SCFA and organic acids, suggesting a role for these biopolymers in bacteria-bacteria cross-talk within the intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28659066>The potential synergistic behaviour of inter- and intra-genus probiotic combinations in the pattern and rate of short chain fatty acids formation during fibre fermentation.</a></h2><p>This study compared the rate of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production by different probiotic combinations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to determine any synergistic effects.

The finding revealed that  which was the predominant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) was found in both proximal and distal colons, while the combination of encapsulated L. casei 01 and germinated-purple-rice drinks gave rise to highest formation of SCFA. Significant impact of rice drinks could be observed on reducing ammonia production. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that encapsulated L. casei 01 and encapsulated L. casei 01 plus rice drinks markedly increased concentration of colon lactobacilli and bifidobacteria by 2 and 1 log 16S rRNA gene copies/mL, respectively. On the contrary, undesirable bacteria such as clostridia and coliforms were significantly reduced with the influence of encapsulated L. casei 01 plus purple-rice drinks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29798705>Lactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C beneficially modulates the innate immune response triggered by Helicobacter pylori infection in vitro.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with important gastric pathologies. An aggressive proinflammatory immune response is generated in the gastric tissue infected with H. pylori, resulting in gastritis and a series of morphological changes that increase the susceptibility to cancer development.  could present an alternative solution to prevent or decrease H. pylori infection. Among them, the use of immunomodulatory lactic acid bacteria represents a promising option to reduce the severity of chronic inflammatory-mediated tissue damage and to improve protective immunity against H. pylori. We previously isolated Lactobacillus fermentum UCO-979C from human gastric tissue and demonstrated its capacity to reduce adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric epithelial cells (AGS cells). In this work, the ability of L. fermentum UCO-979C to modulate immune response in AGS cells and PMA phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-differentiated THP-1 (human monocytic leukaemia) macrophages in response to H. pylori infection was evaluated. We demonstrated that the UCO-979C strain is able to differentially modulate the cytokine response of gastric epithelial cells and macrophages after H. pylori infection. Of note, L. fermentum UCO-979C was able to significantly reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in AGS and THP-1 cells as well as increase the levels of immunoregulatory cytokines, indicating a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect. These findings strongly support the probiotic potential of L. fermentum UCO-979C and provide evidence of its beneficial effects against the inflammatory damage induced by H. pylori infection. Although our findings should be proven in appropriate experiments in vivo, in both H. pylori infection animal models and human trials, the results of the present work provide a scientific rationale for the use of L. fermentum UCO-979C to prevent or reduce H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152242>Comparative assessment of canine-origin  CPN23 and dairy-origin  NCDC 15 for nutrient digestibility, faecal fermentative metabolites and selected gut health indices in dogs.</a></h2><p>The present experiment was undertaken to validate a probiotic of canine origin for its potential use in dogs.

The objective was to evaluate the potency of lactobacilli to bind lead in vitro and the protective effects of a selected Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661 against lead-induced toxicity in mice. Nine strains of bacteria were used to investigate their binding abilities of lead in vitro, and L. plantarum CCFM8661 was selected for animal experiments because of its excellent lead binding capacity. Both living and dead L. plantarum CCFM8661 were used to treat 90 male Kunming mice during or after the exposure to 1 g/L lead  in drinking water. The results showed oral administration of both living and dead L. plantarum CCFM8661 offered a significant protective effect against lead toxicity by recovering blood δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity, decreasing the lead levels in blood and tissues, and preventing alterations in the levels of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and reactive oxygen species caused by lead exposure. Moreover, L. plantarum CCFM8661 was more effective when administered consistently during the entire lead exposure, not after the exposure.

The aim of this study was to test whether oral administration of a synbiotic (Simbioflora®) preparation containing Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis plus fructooligosaccharide could help control mucosal inflammation in experimental mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: control (CTL), control + prebiotic (CTL+P), control + synbiotic (CTL+S), mucositis (MUC), mucositis + prebiotic (MUC+P), and mucositis + synbiotic (MUC+S). Mice from the CTL+S, MUC+S, CTL+P, and MUC+P groups received synbiotic or prebiotic daily by oral gavage for 13 days. Mice in the CTL and MUC groups received the same volume of saline. On day 11, mice in the MUC, MUC+P, and MUC+S groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg/kg 5-FU to induce mucositis. After 72 h, all mice were euthanised. Intestinal permeability, intestinal histology, and biochemical parameters were analysed. Group MUC showed a greater weight loss and increased intestinal permeability (0.020 counts per min [cpm]/g) compared to the CTL group (0.01 cpm/g) P<0.05. Both treatments attenuated weight loss compared to the MUC group. Nonetheless, the synbiotic caused a greater reduction in intestinal permeability (0.012 cpm/g) compared to the MUC (0.020 cpm/g) and MUC+P (0.016 cpm/g) groups P<0.05. Mice in groups MUC+P and MUC+S displayed significant recovery of lesions and maintenance of the mucus layer. There were no differences in the short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the faeces between the MUC and CTL groups (P>0.05). Increased  and propionate concentrations were evidenced in the faeces of the MUC+P and MUC+S groups. Only the synbiotic treatment increased the butyrate concentration (P<0.05).

Recent evidence in mice has identified a "critical window" early in life where gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) are most influential in experimental asthma. However, current research has yet to establish whether these changes precede or are involved in human asthma. We compared the gut microbiota of 319 subjects enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, and show that infants at risk of asthma exhibited transient gut microbial dysbiosis during the first 100 days of life. The relative abundance of the bacterial genera Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium, and Rothia was significantly decreased in children at risk of asthma. This reduction in bacterial taxa was accompanied by reduced levels of fecal  and dysregulation of enterohepatic metabolites. Inoculation of germ-free mice with these four bacterial taxa ameliorated airway inflammation in their adult progeny, demonstrating a causal role of these bacterial taxa in averting asthma development. These results enhance the potential for future microbe-based diagnostics and therapies, potentially in the form of , to prevent the development of asthma and other related allergic diseases in children.Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910250>Isolation and characterization of antifungal compound from Lactobacillus plantarum KCC-10 from forage silage with potential beneficial properties.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to isolate, identify and characterize an antifungal compound from Lactobacillus plantarum KCC-10 from forage silage with potential beneficial properties.The 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic affiliation was determined using bioinformatic tools and identified as Lactobacillus sp. KCC-10 with 100% sequence similarity to L. plantarum. The antifungal substances were extracted with ethyl  from spent medium in which Lactobacillus sp. KCC-10 was cultivated. Antifungal activity was assessed using the broth microdilution technique. The compounds were obtained by eluting the crude extract with various concentrations of solvents followed by chromatographic purification. Based on the infrared, (13) C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and (1) H NMR spectral data, the compound was identified as a phenolic-related antibiotic. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the compound against Aspergillus clavatus, A. oryzae, Botrytis elliptica and Scytalidium vaccinii was 2.5 mg ml(-1) and that against A. fumigatus, A. niger and S. fusca was 5.0 mg ml(-1) , respectively. In addition, Lactobacillus sp. KCC-10 was highly sensitive towards oxgall (0.3%) but grew well in the presence of sodium taurocholate (0.3%). An antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was an intrinsic feature of this strain; thus, consumption does not represent a health risk to humans or animals.Novel L. plantarum KCC-10 with antifungal and potential probiotic properties was characterized for use in animal food.This study revealed that L. plantarum KCC-10 exhibited good antifungal activity similar to that of probiotic Lactobacillus strains.© 2013 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589612>Gut Bacteria Products Prevent AKI Induced by Ischemia-Reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are fermentation end products produced by the intestinal microbiota and have anti-inflammatory and histone deacetylase-inhibiting properties. Recently, a dual relationship between the intestine and kidneys has been unraveled. Therefore, we evaluated the role of SCFA in an AKI model in which the inflammatory process has a detrimental role. We observed that therapy with the three main SCFAs (, propionate, and butyrate) improved renal dysfunction caused by injury. This protection was associated with low levels of local and systemic inflammation, oxidative cellular stress, cell infiltration/activation, and apoptosis. However, it was also associated with an increase in autophagy. Moreover, SCFAs inhibited histone deacetylase activity and modulated the expression levels of enzymes involved in chromatin modification. In vitro analyses showed that SCFAs modulated the inflammatory process, decreasing the maturation of dendritic cells and inhibiting the capacity of these cells to induce CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation. Furthermore, SCFAs ameliorated the effects of hypoxia in kidney epithelial cells by improving mitochondrial biogenesis. Notably, mice treated with -producing bacteria also had better outcomes after AKI. Thus, we demonstrate that SCFAs improve organ function and viability after an injury through modulation of the inflammatory process, most likely via epigenetic modification.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19211520>Synergy of Astragalus polysaccharides and  (Lactobacillus and Bacillus cereus) on immunity and intestinal microbiota in chicks.</a></h2><p> and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) can modulate systemic immunity and intestinal microbiota in animals and human beings.

To address this issue, this study was designed to investigate the synergistic effects on immunity and intestinal microbiota in chicks. A total of 240 female Hy-Line chicks were assigned to 4 treatments. Four treatments were fed the same corn-soy meal control diet; however, treatments 2, 3, and 4 were supplemented (per kg of feed) with 220 mg of APS, 4 x 10(10) cfu , and dual treatment, respectively. Parameters evaluated included serum Newcastle disease antibody titer, peripheral blood acid alpha-naphthyl  esterase-positive (ANAE(+)) T-lymphocyte percentage, immune organ relative weights and histological changes, and selected intestinal tract bacteria. Compared with the control, Newcastle disease antibody titer, ANAE(+) T-lymphocyte percentage, immune organ relative weights, histological changes, as well as lactobacilli and Bacillus cereus numbers significantly increased (P <or= 0.05); however, the Escherichia coli numbers in chicks of the treatments decreased (P <or= 0.05).

Shiga toxins (Stxs) are the main virulence factor of EHEC. The antagonistic effect of a prophylactic treatment with the probiotic strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae against EHEC O157:H7 was investigated using complementary in vitro human colonic model and in vivo murine ileal loop assays. In vitro, the probiotic treatment had no effect on O157:H7 survival but favorably influenced gut microbiota activity through modulation of short-chain fatty acid production, increasing  production and decreasing that of butyrate. Both pathogen and probiotic strains had individual-dependent effects on human gut microbiota. For the first time, stx expression was followed in human colonic environment: at 9 and 12 h post EHEC infection, probiotic treatment significantly decreased stx mRNA levels. Besides, in murine ileal loops, the probiotic yeast specifically exerted a trophic effect on intestinal mucosa and inhibited O157:H7 interactions with Peyer's patches and subsequent hemorrhagic lesions. Taken together, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae may be useful in the fight against EHEC infection and that host associated factors such as microbiota could influence clinical evolution of EHEC infection and the effectiveness of .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24223212>Vaginal pH and microbicidal lactic acid when lactobacilli dominate the microbiota.</a></h2><p>Lactic acid at sufficiently acidic pH is a potent microbicide, and lactic acid produced by vaginal lactobacilli may help protect against reproductive tract infections. However, previous observations likely underestimated healthy vaginal acidity and total lactate concentration since they failed to exclude women without a lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota, and also did not account for the high carbon dioxide, low oxygen environment of the vagina. Fifty-six women with low (0-3) Nugent scores (indicating a lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota) and no symptoms of reproductive tract disease or infection, provided a total of 64 cervicovaginal fluid samples using a collection method that avoided the need for sample dilution and rigorously minimized aerobic exposure. The pH of samples was measured by microelectrode immediately after collection and under a physiological vaginal concentration of CO2. Commercial enzymatic assays of total lactate and total  concentrations were validated for use in CVF, and compared to the more usual HPLC method. The average pH of the CVF samples was 3.5 ± 0.3 (mean ± SD), range 2.8-4.2, and the average total lactate was 1.0% ± 0.2% w/v; this is a five-fold higher average hydrogen ion concentration (lower pH) and a fivefold higher total lactate concentration than in the prior literature. The microbicidal form of lactic acid (protonated lactic acid) was therefore eleven-fold more concentrated, and a markedly more potent microbicide, than indicated by prior research. This suggests that when lactobacilli dominate the vaginal microbiota, women have significantly more lactic acid-mediated protection against infections than currently believed. Our results invite further evaluations of the prophylactic and therapeutic actions of vaginal lactic acid, whether provided in situ by endogenous lactobacilli, by probiotic lactobacilli, or by products that reinforce vaginal lactic acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25179909>Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum, a butyrate producer with probiotic potential, is intrinsically tolerant to stomach and small intestine conditions.</a></h2><p>Butyrate has several beneficial properties that are essential to maintain gastrointestinal health. Therefore butyrate-producing bacteria are seen as the next generation of . The butyrate-producing bacterium Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (a clostridial cluster IV strain) is such a promising probiotic candidate for people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. To exert its beneficial properties, it is crucial that B. pullicaecorum survives the harsh conditions of the upper gastrointestinal tract to arrive in the colon in a viable and metabolically active state. Before developing a stable formulation of B. pullicaecorum for oral administration, it is important to know its intrinsic acid and bile tolerance. We monitored the survival during and short chain fatty acid production after incubation in conditions simulating the stomach and small intestine using in vitro batch experiments. In case of acid conditions (pH 2 and pH 3), B. pullicaecorum was viable and active but not cultivable. Cultivability was restored during subsequent small intestine conditions. Importantly, bile and pancreatic juice had no lethal effect. Milk, as a suspension medium, only had a protective effect on the cultivability during the first hour at pH 2. B. pullicaecorum was still metabolically active after upper gastrointestinal conditions and produced short chain fatty acids, but a shift from butyrate to  production was observed. Although the butyrate-producing anaerobe B. pullicaecorum showed good intrinsic acid and bile tolerance in terms of viability and metabolic activity, colonization efficiency and butyrate production under colon conditions is needed to further evaluate its probiotic potential.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Diet can also change the profile of gut microbiota and, thereby, behavior. Effects of bacteria on the nervous system cannot be disassociated from effects on the immune system since the two are in constant bidirectional communication. While the composition of the gut microbiota varies greatly among individuals, alterations to the balance and content of common gut microbes may affect the production of molecules such as neurotransmitters, e.g., gamma amino butyric acid, and the products of fermentation, e.g., the short chain fatty acids butyrate, propionate, and .

We identified 203 isolates of Faecalibacterium sp., which were clustered in 40 genetically distinct groups. One representative isolate from each cluster was selected for further characterization. The concentrations of the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) , butyrate, propionate and isobutyrate in the culture media were measured by gas chromatography. We observed reduction in the concentration of  followed by concomitant increase in the concentration of butyrate, suggesting that the isolates were consuming  present in the media and producing butyrate. Butyrate production correlated positively with bacterial growth. Since butyrate has many benefits to the colonic epithelial cells, the selection of strains that produce higher amounts of butyrate is extremely important for the development of this potential probiotic. The effect of pH and concentration of bile salts on bacterial growth was also evaluated in order to mimic the conditions encountered by F. prausnitzii in vivo. The optimal pH for growth ranged between 5.5 and 6.7, while most isolates were inhibited by of the lowest concentration of bile salts tested (0.1%). Antimicrobial resistance profile showed that most isolates of Faecalibacterium sp. were resistant against ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. More than 50% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, amikacin, cefepime and cefoxitin. A total of 19 different combinations of multidrug resistance were observed among the isolates.

After weaning to solid foods, some of the most important of these are the short chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced by the fermentation of undigested dietary components and endogenous secretions. The main SCFA are , propionate and butyrate which have numerous documented effects promoting large bowel function. Of the major acids, butyrate seems especially important. It is a major metabolic fuel for colonocytes and promotes a normal phenotype in these cells, potentially lowering the risk of diseases such as colo-rectal cancer. Imbalances in the microbiota are thought to predispose to large bowel dysfunction and  are being developed to correct this. However, most commercial products contain bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) which are dominant species in milk-fed infants but have limited roles in adults. Prebiosis is defined usually by the specific stimulation of these bacteria. However, the end products of most  do not include butyrate or propionate which raises questions about their effectiveness in promoting bowel health in adults. Resistant starch (RS) is a dietary fibre component and its fermentation generally favours butyrate production. Dietary RS intakes and faecal butyrate levels are high in populations at low risk of diet-related large bowel diseases. Conversely, RS intakes and faecal butyrate levels are very low in high risk groups. This raises the possibility that greater RS consumption could be of health benefit. RS is not regarded widely as a prebiotic but (according to the accepted definition) most forms show the requisite features in stimulating specific bacteria, giving raised total SCFA and butyrate levels and a consequent benefit to the host. Current efforts to improve public health through increasing RS consumption could be facilitated by greater recognition of its prebiotic role.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172038>Epigenome targeting by probiotic metabolites.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in immune development and homeostasis. A disturbed microbiota during early infancy is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammatory and allergic diseases later in life. The mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood but are likely to involve alterations in microbial production of fermentation-derived metabolites, which have potent immune modulating properties and are required for maintenance of healthy mucosal immune responses.  are beneficial bacteria that have the capacity to alter the composition of bacterial species in the intestine that can in turn influence the production of fermentation-derived metabolites. Principal among these metabolites are the short-chain fatty acids butyrate and  that have potent anti-inflammatory activities important in regulating immune function at the intestinal mucosal surface. Therefore strategies aimed at restoring the microbiota profile may be effective in the prevention or treatment of allergic and inflammatory diseases.Probiotic bacteria have diverse effects including altering microbiota composition, regulating epithelial cell barrier function and modulating of immune responses. The precise molecular mechanisms mediating these probiotic effects are not well understood. Short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate are a class of histone deacetylase inhibitors important in the epigenetic control of host cell responses. It is hypothesized that the biological function of  may be a result of epigenetic modifications that may explain the wide range of effects observed. Studies delineating the effects of  on short-chain fatty acid production and the epigenetic actions of short-chain fatty acids will assist in understanding the association between microbiota and allergic or autoimmune disorders.We propose that treatment with specific probiotic bacteria under in vivo conditions would offer the ideal conditions to examine the microbiological, immunological and epigenetic mechanisms of action. Advances in epigenetic technology now allow investigators to better understand the complex biological properties of  and their metabolites.Determining the precise mechanisms of probiotic action will lead to more specific and efficacious therapeutic strategies in the prevention or treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22442660>Milk fermented by Propionibacterium freudenreichii induces apoptosis of HGT-1 human gastric cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. The "economically developed countries" life style, including diet, constitutes a risk factor favoring this cancer. Diet modulation may lower digestive cancer incidence. Among promising food components, dairy propionibacteria were shown to trigger apoptosis of human colon cancer cells, via the release of short-chain fatty acids  and propionate.A fermented milk, exclusively fermented by P. freudenreichii, was recently designed. In this work, the pro-apoptotic potential of this new fermented milk was demonstrated on HGT-1 human gastric cancer cells. Fermented milk supernatant induced typical features of apoptosis including chromatin condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, DNA laddering, cell cycle arrest and emergence of a subG1 population, phosphatidylserine exposure at the plasma membrane outer leaflet, reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial transmembrane potential disruption, caspase activation and cytochrome c release. Remarkably, this new fermented milk containing P. freudenreichii enhanced the cytotoxicity of camptothecin, a drug used in gastric cancer chemotherapy.Such new probiotic fermented milk may thus be useful as part of a preventive diet designed to prevent gastric cancer and/or as a food supplement to potentiate cancer therapeutic treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189124>[EFFECT OF PROBIOTIC ENTEROCOCCI AND GLATIRAMER  ON THE SEVERITY OF EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN RATS ].</a></h2><p>Currently intestinal microbiota is considered as a potential target for influence in various pathologies which have inflammation, autoimmunity or neurodegeneration in the genesis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) combines all these processes in the pathogenesis. Furthermore, the balance of the components of intestinal microbiota is disrupted during MS and followed by disbiosis. Different  - bacteria with proven beneficial properties are widely used to correct dysbisis. In this paper, was investigated the ability of probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium L-3 to reduce disease severity in multiple sclerosis model - experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). E. faecium L-3 were used alone or in combination with glatiramer  (GA). It is shown that administration of E. faecium L-3 reduces the severity of EAE in rats almost as same as that of GA. However, when the probiotic enterococci administered together with GA the protective effect does not observed. It is assumed that these preparations stimulates different ways of the immune system, because their action stimulate different immune cells populations. The study demonstrates the ability of E. faecium L-3 to influence on the immune system in MS, directly and indirectly (through the correction of dysbiosis). This fact allows us to consider E. faecium L-3 as a potential tool for immunomodulation in autoimmune, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31363877>Rumen fermentation and microbial community composition influenced by live Enterococcus faecium supplementation.</a></h2><p>Supplementation of appropriate  can improve the health and productivity of ruminants while mitigating environmental methane production. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the effects of Enterococcus faecium SROD on in vitro rumen fermentation, methane concentration, and microbial population structure. Ruminal samples were collected from ruminally cannulated Holstein-Friesian cattle, and 40:60 rice straw to concentrate ratio was used as substrate. Fresh culture of E. faecium SROD at different inclusion rates (0, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%) were investigated using in vitro rumen fermentation system. Addition of E. faecium SROD had a significant effect on total gas production with the greatest effect observed with 0.1% supplementation; however, there was no significant influence on pH. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest propionate (P = 0.005) but the lowest methane concentration (P = 0.001). In addition, , butyrate, and total VFA concentrations in treatments were comparatively higher than control. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the predominance of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. At the genus level, Prevotella (15-17%) and Methanobrevibacter (96%) dominated the bacterial and archaeal communities of the in vitro rumen fermenta, respectively. Supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest quantities of total bacteria and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, whereas 1.0% E. faecium SROD resulted in the highest contents of total fungi and Fibrobacter succinogenes. Overall, supplementation of 0.1% E. faecium SROD significantly increased the propionate and total volatile fatty acids concentrations but decreased the methane concentration while changing the microbial community abundance and composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26104525>Optimizing Production of Two Potential Probiotic Lactobacilli Strains Isolated from Piglet Feces as Feed Additives for Weaned Piglets.</a></h2><p>Two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus johnsonii x-1d-2 and Lactobacillus mucosae x-4w-1, originally isolated from piglet feces, have been demonstrated to possess antimicrobial activities, antibiotic resistances and interleukin-6 induction ability in RAW 267.4 macrophages in our previous study. These characteristics make L. johnsonii x-1d-2 and L. mucosae x-4w-1 good candidates for application in feed . In this study, soybeal meal, molasses and sodium  were selected to optimize the growth medium for cultivation of L. johnsonii x-1d-2 and L. mucosae x-4w-1. These two strains were then freeze-dried and mixed into the basal diet to feed the weaned piglets. The effects of L. johnsonii x-1d-2 and L. mucosae x-4w-1 on the growth performance and fecal microflora of weaned piglets were investigated. The results showed that the bacterial numbers of L. johnsonii x-1d-2 and L. mucosae x-4w-1 reached a maximum of 8.90 and 9.30 log CFU/mL, respectively, when growing in optimal medium consisting of 5.5% (wt/vol) soybean meal, 1.0% (wt/vol) molasses and 1.0% (wt/vol) sodium . The medium cost was 96% lower than the commercial de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe medium. In a further feeding study, the weaned piglets fed basal diet supplemented with freeze-dried probiotic cultures exhibited higher (p<0.05) body weight gain, feed intake, and gain/feed ratio than weaned piglets fed basal diet. Probiotic feeding also increased the numbers of lactobacilli and decreased the numbers of E. coli in the feces of weaned piglets. This study demonstrates that L. johnsonii x-1d-2 and L. mucosae x-4w-1 have high potential to be used as feed additives in the pig industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29242832>Persistence of Supplemented  subsp.

This study sought to determine whether provision of an initial course of  subsp.  () would lead to persistent  of the probiotic organism in breastfed infants. Mothers intending to breastfeed were recruited and provided with lactation support. One group of mothers fed  EVC001 to their infants from day 7 to day 28 of life ( = 34), and the second group did not administer any probiotic ( = 32). Fecal samples were collected during the first 60 postnatal days in both groups. Fecal samples were assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, mass spectrometry, and endotoxin measurement. -fed infants had significantly higher populations of fecal , in particular , while EVC001 was fed, and this difference persisted more than 30 days after EVC001 supplementation ceased. Fecal milk oligosaccharides were significantly lower in  EVC001-fed infants, demonstrating higher consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by  EVC001. Concentrations of  and lactate were significantly higher and fecal pH was significantly lower in infants fed EVC001, demonstrating alterations in intestinal fermentation. Infants colonized by  at high levels had 4-fold-lower fecal endotoxin levels, consistent with observed lower levels of Gram-negative  and .  The gut microbiome in early life plays an important role for long-term health and is shaped in large part by diet. Probiotics may contribute to improvements in health, but they have not been shown to alter the community composition of the gut microbiome. Here, we found that breastfed infants could be stably colonized at high levels by provision of  EVC001, with significant changes to the overall microbiome composition persisting more than a month later, whether the infants were born vaginally or by caesarean section. This observation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating the capacity of this subspecies to utilize human milk glycans as a nutrient and underscores the importance of pairing a probiotic organism with a specific substrate.  by  EVC001 resulted in significant changes to fecal microbiome composition and was associated with improvements in fecal biochemistry. The combination of human milk and an infant-associated  sp. shows, for the first time, that durable changes to the human gut microbiome are possible and are associated with improved gut function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25650127>Plant extract enhances the viability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.</a></h2><p>A commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium  (SA) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. Yogurts prepared from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* SA, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus Bifidobacterium animalis,Lactobacillus acidophilus, or both ) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5°C. Supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. At the end of storage, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and L. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts.

Aggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons demonstrated significant differences in cell surface properties among the tested propionibacteria strains. Almost all strains appeared relatively hydrophilic, which showed low affinity for p-xylene. Four of the tested strains showed the strong adhesion to ethyl , a basic solvent, in comparison with microbial adhesion to chloroform, an acidic solvent, which demonstrated the particularity of propionibacteria to have an important electron donor and acidic character. Also, these strains simultaneously showed affinity to 3 hydrocarbons, suggesting a high complexity of the cell surface. All propionibacteria strains tested showed autoaggregation and coaggregation ability with the Escherichia coli ATTC 11229, but the results were strain-specific and dependent on incubation conditions. Anaerobic incubation conditions were determined as the best condition for aggregation abilities of propionibacteria strains. A relationship was obtained between aggregation abilities (auto- and coaggregation) and a correlation between adhesion to hydrocarbon (chloroform) and autoaggregation was possible. Our results indicate that the ability to autoaggregation together with cell surface hydrophobicity and coaggregation abilities with E. coli strain can be used for preliminary screening in order to identify potentially probiotic bacteria suitable for human or animal use.Autoaggregation, cell surface hydrophobicity, and coaggregation abilities with E. coli of the selected dairy propionibacteria strains could be used as probiotic in foods after in vivo studies.© 2011 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633171>Enterococcus faecium strain L-3 and glatiramer  ameliorate experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in rats by affecting different populations of immune cells.</a></h2><p>The effect of probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain L-3 was studied in rats with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Glatiramer  (GA) was used as control drug. E. faecium strain L-3 and GA both were able to reduce the severity of EAE in a similar fashion. Both approaches increased the proportion of EAE resistant rats and rats with mild disease, prolonged the inductive phase of EAE and reduced the disease duration.

Accordingly, 32 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from faeces of dogs, out of which 9 strains were short-listed for further in vitro testing based on the aggregation time and cell surface hydrophobicity. The results of acid-, bile- and phenol-tolerance tests indicated that out of the nine, isolate cPRO23 was having better resistance to these adverse conditions likely to be encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. The isolate also showed optimal enzymatic activities for amylase, lipase and protease. Further assessments also indicated its superiority in terms of co-aggregation and antagonistic activity against pathogenic strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis. Subsequently, the isolate was identified through 16S rRNA sequencing and sequence homology, and designated as Lactobacillus johnsonii CPN23. The candidate probiotic was then evaluated in vivo using 15 adult Labrador dogs, divided into 3 groups, viz. CON (with no ), dPRO (with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC 15 as a conventional dairy-origin probiotic) and cPRO (with L. johnsonii CPN23 as a canine-origin probiotic). Results of the 9-week study indicated that supplementation of cPRO improved (P < 0.05) the faecal concentration of  and butyrate with a concomitant reduction (P < 0.05) in faecal ammonia. The cell-mediated immune response, assessed as delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to phytohaemagglutinin-P, was better (P < 0.05) in dogs fed cPRO as compared to the CON dogs. There were, however, no variations evident in the antibody response to sheep-erythrocytes among the three groups. It is concluded that the canine-origin L. johnsonii CPN23, in addition to possessing all the in vitro functional attributes of a candidate probiotic, also has the potential to be used as a probiotic in pet nutrition programs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22962927>Treatment of the common cold in children and adults.</a></h2><p>The common cold, or upper respiratory tract infection, is one of the leading reasons for physician visits. Generally caused by viruses, the common cold is treated symptomatically. Antibiotics are not effective in children or adults. In children, there is a potential for harm and no benefits with over-the-counter cough and cold medications; therefore, they should not be used in children younger than four years. Other commonly used medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, oral prednisolone, and Echinacea, also are ineffective in children. Products that improve symptoms in children include vapor rub, zinc sulfate, Pelargonium sidoides (geranium) extract, and buckwheat honey. Prophylactic , zinc sulfate, nasal saline irrigation, and the herbal preparation Chizukit reduce the incidence of colds in children. For adults, antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, codeine, nasal saline irrigation, Echinacea angustifolia preparations, and steam inhalation are ineffective at relieving cold symptoms. Pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, inhaled ipratropium, and zinc ( or gluconate) modestly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms for adults. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some herbal preparations, including Echinacea purpurea, improve symptoms in adults. Prophylactic use of garlic may decrease the frequency of colds in adults, but has no effect on duration of symptoms. Hand hygiene reduces the spread of viruses that cause cold illnesses. Prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduces cold symptom duration in adults and children.</p></html>
