<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28289093>A hot spot on interferon α/β receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) underpins its interaction with interferon-β and dictates signaling.</a></h1><p>The interaction of IFN-β with its receptor IFNAR1 (interferon α/β receptor subunit 1) is vital for host-protective anti-viral and anti-proliferative responses, but signaling via this interaction can be detrimental if dysregulated. Whereas it is established that IFNAR1 is an essential component of the IFNAR signaling complex, the key residues underpinning the IFN-β-IFNAR1 interaction are unknown. Guided by the crystal structure of the IFN-β-IFNAR1 complex, we used truncation variants and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate domains and residues enabling complexation of IFN-β to IFNAR1. We have identified an interface on IFNAR1-subdomain-3 that is differentially utilized by IFN-β and IFN-α for signal transduction. We used surface plasmon resonance and cell-based assays to investigate this important IFN-β binding interface that is centered on IFNAR1 residues Tyr and Tyr binding the C and N termini of the B and C helices of IFN-β, respectively. Using IFNAR1 and IFN-β variants, we show that this interface contributes significantly to the affinity of IFN-β for IFNAR1, its ability to activate STAT1, the expression of interferon stimulated genes, and ultimately to the anti-viral and anti-proliferative properties of IFN-β. These results identify a key interface created by IFNAR1 residues Tyr and Tyr interacting with IFN-β residues , Leu, Glu, , Val, and Arg that underlie IFN-β-IFNAR1-mediated signaling and biological processes.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187204>Differentiating founder and chronic HIV envelope sequences.</a></h1><p>Significant progress has been made in characterizing broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV envelope glycoprotein Env, but an effective vaccine has proven elusive. Vaccine development would be facilitated if common features of early founder virus required for transmission could be identified. Here we employ a combination of bioinformatic and operations research methods to determine the most prevalent features that distinguish 78 subtype B and 55 subtype C founder Env sequences from an equal number of chronic sequences. There were a number of equivalent optimal networks (based on the fewest covarying amino acid (AA) pairs or a measure of maximal covariance) that separated founders from chronics: 13 pairs for subtype B and 75 for subtype C. Every subtype B optimal solution contained the founder pairs 178-346 Asn-Val, 232-236 -Ser, 240-340 Lys-Lys, 279-315 Asp-Lys, 291-792 Ala-Ile, 322-347 Asp-, 535-620 Leu-Asp, 742-837 Arg-, and 750-836 Asp-Ile; the most common optimal pairs for subtype C were 644-781 Lys-Ala (74 of 75 networks), 133-287 Ala-Gln (73/75) and 307-337 Ile-Gln (73/75). No pair was present in all optimal subtype C solutions highlighting the difficulty in targeting transmission with a single vaccine strain. Relative to the size of its domain (0.35% of Env), the α4β7 binding site occurred most frequently among optimal pairs, especially for subtype C: 4.2% of optimal pairs (1.2% for subtype B). Early sequences from 5 subtype B pre-seroconverters each exhibited at least one clone containing an optimal feature 553-624 (Ser-Asn), 724-747 (Arg-Arg), or 46-293 (Arg-Glu).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087732>Enzymatic hydrolysis optimization of Paphia undulata and lymphocyte proliferation activity of the isolated peptide fractions.</a></h1><p>The immune system is important in preventing and controlling various infectious diseases. Immunoactive peptides derived from food proteins could exert immunomodulatory activity without side effects. Paphia undulata with high-protein is suitable for the production of immunoactive peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis parameters to maximize the immune activity of hydrolysates from Paphia undulata.Hydrolysis parameters, including temperature, time and the ratio of alkaline protease to Paphia undulata meat (E/S), were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: temperature, 51 °C; time, 3.14 h; E/S, 4,321 U g(-1) (Paphia undulata meat). Furthermore, hydrolysates obtained under the optimum conditions were fractionated by ultrafiltration and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. After two-step isolation, the isolated fractions (P2 and P3) including the peptides Pro-His--Cys, Val-Gly-Try-, Glu-, Leu-, and Glu-Gly-Ala-Lys, Trp-Ile or Trp-Leu, respectively, could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation ability.These results showed that response surface methodology and two-step separation were efficient for recovery of low-molecular-weight peptides with high spleen lymphocyte proliferation activity, and the isolated fractions of Paphia undulata hydrolysates are potential ingredients for development of functional foods.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29627244>Jugular arginine infusion relieves lipopolysaccharide-triggered inflammatory stress and improves immunity status of lactating dairy cows.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of jugular l-Arg infusion on performance and immune function during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  of lactating dairy cows. Eight Holstein cows (multiparous, 608.8 ± 31.5 kg) at mid-lactation were randomly assigned to 5-d jugular infusions of control (saline), Arg (3 g/h), LPS (0.033 μg/kg per h), and LPS + Arg (0.033 μg/kg per h of LPS and 3 g/h of Arg) in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 infusion periods separated by 10-d noninfusion periods. Jugular solutions of saline, Arg, LPS, and LPS + Arg were continuously infused using peristaltic pumps for approximately 6 h/d during infusion periods. Milk yield was measured on each day of the infusion period. Milk samples were obtained on the last 2 d of each infusion period, and blood samples were obtained on the last day of each infusion period before infusion (0 h) and at 3 and 6 h. We found that the jugular LPS infusion significantly increased serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and lipopolysaccharide binding protein, whereas Arg attenuated the increase in IL-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels and tended to decrease the lipopolysaccharide binding protein level. Arginine alleviated the decrease in dry matter intake and milk fat yield and the increase of somatic cell count induced by LPS. Total casein in milk was decreased during the LPS-induced  period, and jugular Arg infusion significantly increased the content of total casein. In contrast, lactalbumin in milk increased during the LPS-induced  period, whereas jugular Arg infusion significantly decreased the content of lactalbumin. The concentrations of plasma Gly, , Ile, Leu, Arg, , and total free AA were significantly decreased by LPS treatment, but Arg attenuated this tendency. These results indicated that jugular Arg infusion (18 g/d) has protective effects on relieving inflammatory stress and improving immunity status triggered by LPS. In conclusion, Arg could attenuate inflammatory stress and improve milk performance of lactating dairy cows. This protective effect may be due to the ability of Arg to suppress LPS effects and improve immunity status.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the function and mechanism of the biological active peptide isolated from bursa on B cell development and autophagy were less reported. In this study, we isolated a new oligopeptide with nine amino acids Leu-Met---Arg-Asn-Glu-Gly- from avian bursa following RP-HPLC, MODIL-TOP-MS, and MS/MS, which was named after BP9. The results of immunization experiments showed that mice injected with 0.01 and 0.05 mg/mL BP9 plus JEV vaccine generated the significant increased antibody levels, compared to those injected with JEV vaccine only. The microarray analysis on the molecular basis of BP9-treated immature B cell showed that vast genes were involved in various immune-related biological processes in BP9-treated WEHI-231 cells, among which the regulation of cytokine production and T cell activation were both major immune-related processes in WEHI-231 cells with BP9 treatment following network analysis. Also, the differentially regulated genes were found to be involved in four significantly enriched pathways in BP9-treated WEHI-231 cells. Finally, we proved that BP9 induced the autophagy formation, regulated the gene and protein expressions related to autophagy in immature B cell, and stimulated AMPK-ULK1 phosphorylation expression. These results suggested that BP9 might be a strong bursal-derived active peptide on antibody response, B cell differentiation, and autophagy in immature B cells, which provided the linking among humoral , B cell differentiation, and autophagy and offered the important reference for the effective immunotherapeutic strategies and immune improvement.</p></html>
