In ready biodegradability tests (RBTs), however, contrasting results have been observed for metformin. The objective of this study was to measure the biodegradation of MET and GUA in RBTs, using activated sludge from the local wastewater treatment plant, either directly or after pre-exposure to MET, in a chemostat. The activated sludge community was cultivated in chemostats, in presence or absence of MET, for a period of nine months, and was used in RBT after one, three and nine months. The results of this study showed that the original activated sludge was able to completely remove MET (15 mg/l) and the newly produced GUA (50% of C) under the test conditions. Inoculation of the chemostat led to a rapid shift in the community composition and abundance. The community exposed to 1.5 mg/l of MET was still able to completely consume MET in the RBTs after one-month exposure, but three- and nine-months exposure resulted in reduced removal of MET in the RBTs. The ability of the activated sludge community to degrade MET and GUA is the result of environmental exposure to these chemicals as well as of conditions that could not be reproduced in the laboratory system. A MET-degrading strain belonging to the genus Aminobacter has been isolated from the chemostat community. This strain was able to completely consume 15 mg/l of MET within three days in the test. However, community analysis revealed that the fluctuation in relative abundance of this genus (<1%) could not be correlated to the fluctuation in biodegradation capacity of the chemostat community.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The use of various types of mouthrinses plays an important role in maintaining proper oral hygiene and in removing some of the microbial components from the oral cavity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of selected mouthrinses on the reference strains of Trichomonas tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis which can be a part of the oral cavity . Two standard strains Trichomonas tenax (ATCC 30207) and Entamoeba gingivalis (ATCC 30927) were used and metronidazole as a drug used in the treatment of infections caused by protozoa as well as fourteen agents used as mouthwashes were tested, with two pure compounds acting as mouthrinse ingredients, i.e. 20% benzocaine and 0.2% chlorhexidine, as well as 12 commercially-available formulas: Azulan, Colgate Plax Complete Care Sensitive, Corsodyl 0.2%, Curasept ADS 205, Dentosept, Dentosept A, Eludril Classic, Listerine Total Care, Octenidol, Oral- Pro-Expert Clinic Line, Sylveco and Tinctura salviae. The protozoonicidal activity of the preparations was evaluated on the basis of the ratio of dead to living ratios after incubation in an incubator (37°C) for 1, 10 and 30 min. Protozoa were counted in the ürker chamber in each case up to 100 cells in an optical microscope (over 400×). The criterion for the death of protozoa was the lack of movement and changes in the shape and characteristics of cell disintegration. The curves of activity were obtained after experiments conducted for 5–7 different solutions of each preparation. On the basis of the curves, the solution killing 50% of the population (CL50) was calculated. All mouthrinses tested in this work in their undiluted form acted lethally on both protozoa. Benzocaine, used as a local anesthetic, has etiotropic properties which can be useful for supporting antiprotozoal treatment. Chlorhexidine confirmed its high efficiency in the eradication of potentially pathogenic protozoa. The use of mouthrinses is an important complement for other procedures intended to maintain correct oral hygiene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670358>Effect of supplementation of nicotinamide and sodium butyrate on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of stocking density and dietary nicotinamide (NAM) and butyrate sodium (BA) supplementation on the growth performance, liver mitochondrial function and gut  of broilers at high stocking density. A total of 342, 26-d-old Cobb500 broilers were divided into 5 groups with 6 replicates. Treatments were as follows: (a) Low stocking density (L, 9 birds per cage); () High stocking density (H, 12 birds per cage); (c) H + 50 ppm NAM; (d) H + 500 ppm BA; (e) H + 50 ppm NAM + 500 ppm BA (COMB). The results showed that high stocking density significantly reduced the feed intake and body weight gain of broilers, while COMB improved the growth performance at high stocking density. High stocking density significantly reduced the liver metallothionein content, liver mitochondrial membrane potential and the activities of Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase. In contrast, the liver metallothionein contents in the NAM, BA and COMB fed group were higher than those in the H group. COMB increased the activity of ATPase as well, but it failed to enhance the mitochondrial membrane potential. Stocking density also affected gut  of broilers. The high-density group increased the relative abundance of Blautia. Supplementation of BA and NAM increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, a combination of NAM and BA can improve the performance, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function and intestinal  of broilers at high stocking density.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531343>Effect of Chronic Consumption of Sweeteners on  and Immunity in the Small Intestine of Young Mice.</a></h2><p>The consumption of sweeteners has increased as a measure to reduce the consumption of calories and thus combat obesity and diabetes. Sweeteners are found in a large number of products, so chronic consumption has been little explored. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of chronic sweetener consumption on the  and immunity of the small intestine in young mice. We used 72 CD1 mice of 21 days old, divided into 3 groups: (i) No treatment, (ii) Group A (6 weeks of treatment), and (iii) Group  (12 weeks of treatment). Groups A and  were divided into 4 subgroups: Control (CL), Sucrose (Suc), Splenda® (Spl), and Svetia® (Sv). The following were determined: anthropometric parameters, percentage of lymphocytes of Peyer's patches and lamina propria, IL-6, IL-17, leptin, resistin, C-peptide, and TNF-. From feces, the  of the small intestine was identified. The BMI was not modified; the mice preferred the consumption of Splenda® and Svetia®. The percentage of CD3 lymphocytes in Peyer's patches was increased. In the lamina propria, Svetia® increased the percentage of CD3 lymphocytes, but Splenda® decreases it. The Splenda® and Svetia® subgroups elevate leptin, C-peptide, IL-6, and IL-17, with reduction of resistin. The predominant genus in all groups was . The chronic consumption of sweeteners increases the population of lymphocytes in the mucosa of the small intestine.

C. Ma. and its bioactivity on intestinal bacteria strains.</a></h2><p>To understand whether polysaccharides may have impact on gut , a neutral polysaccharide CDA-0.05 with an average molecular weight of 7.96 kDa was obtained from Cistanche deserticola Y. C. Ma. The monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that CDA-0.05 was composed of glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 96.4: 3.6. The backbone of CDA-0.05 contained 1, 4-linked α-D-Glcp, 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp and 1, 4-linked β-D-Galp, with branches of T-linked α-D-Glcp attached at C-6 of 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp residues. Bioactivity test results suggested that CDA-0.05 could promote the growth of three species of Bacteroides (. thetaiotaomicron, . ovatus and . fragilis) significantly. Furthermore, CDA-0.05 could also promote some probiotics growth, such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri. These results suggested that CDA-0.05 might help to maintain intestinal homeostasis and could be recommended as part of fibers or drugs candidate to benefit human body by regulating gut bacteria.Copyright © 2019.

We recently verified that the dietary polyphenol chrysin was able to abolish some of the metabolic changes induced by fructose-feeding in the rat. Because the role of the intestine upon fructose-induced MS is poorly understood, we decided to investigate the influence of fructose, in vivo, on the intestinal environment and the ability of chrysin to interfere with the putative observed changes. For this, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 18 weeks as follows: (A) tap water (CONT), () tap water and chrysin (100 mg kg day) (CHRY), (C) 10% fructose in tap water (FRUCT), and (D) 10% fructose in tap water and chrysin (100 mg kg day) (FRUCT + CHRY). Our findings show that the relative expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2 mRNA were not affected by fructose-feeding and/or chrysin. In contrast, GLUT5 mRNA expression was markedly increased in fructose-fed animals, and this effect was reduced by chrysin. However, the apparent permeability to C-FRUCT was markedly and similarly decreased in FRUCT, CHRY and FRUCT + CHRY rats. Jejunal villus width and crypt depth were significantly higher in FRUCT and FRUCT + CHRYS rats, respectively. Finally, chrysin did not alter gut  composition, but fructose significantly increased Lactobacillus and E. coli. Moreover, FRUCT + CHRY rats had an increase on the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This is the first report showing that chrysin is able to interfere with the effects of fructose at the intestinal level, which may contribute to the fructose-induced MS features.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298956>The effect of levofloxacin on the lung  of laboratory rats.</a></h2><p> The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of levofloxacin on the  of healthy lungs.  Male F344 rats received either no levofloxacin (n = 9), intravenous levofloxacin (n = 12), oral levofloxacin (n = 12), or subcutaneous levofloxacin (n = 14). Rats received a clinically applicable dose (5.56 mg/kg) of levofloxacin via the assigned delivery route once daily for three days. On day four, lung tissue was collected and the lung  composition was investigated using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.  Untreated lungs showed a  dominated by bacteria of the genera . After treatment with levofloxacin, bacteria of the genus  dominated the lung . This was observed for all routes of antibiotic administration, with a significant difference compared to no-antibiotic control group (PERMANOVA: P < 0.001; homogeneity of dispersions: P = 0.656).  Our study is the first to demonstrate the effects of levofloxacin therapy on lung  in laboratory rats. Levofloxacin treatment by any route of administration leads to profound changes in the rat lung , resulting in the predominance of bacteria belonging to the genus .

Cholera toxin  (CTB) is a mucosal adjuvant that can induce antigen tolerance. Bacillus subtilis spores are an ideal vehicle for the oral delivery of heterologous antigens.We investigated the therapeutic effect of recombinant NAP  subtilis spores on peanut allergies in a mouse model.Female C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized and challenged with peanut extract by oral administration. Before challenge, recombinant NAP and CTB-NAP (CNAP) spores were orally administered to sensitized mice for 4 weeks. Faecal peanut-specific IgA and serum-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a levels were measured, and the intestinal  was analysed. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD25 antibodies for regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion to evaluate the efficacy of Tregs in preventing peanut allergy. After challenge, anaphylactic reactions, plasma histamine, Tregs, and splenocyte interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, IL-5 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were evaluated.After 4 weeks of recombinant spore treatment, faecal IgA levels and serum IgG2a levels were increased, while serum IgG1 and IgE levels were reduced. Intestinal  analysis revealed that CNAP spores increased the taxonomic abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level and Clostridia at the class level. After challenge, the administration of NAP or CNAP spores to mice was found to ameliorate anaphylactic reactions and decrease plasma histamine levels. Administration of NAP or CNAP spores also enhanced IL-10 and IFN-γ secretion, and suppressed IL-4 and IL-5 secretion. The protective effect of CNAP spores was more pronounced than that of NAP spores; this therapeutic effect was lost after Treg depletion.Recombinant NAP spores successfully suppressed Th2 inflammation via the up-regulation of Tregs; this may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for treating food allergies.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382927>Association of Constipation with risk of end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem. Many risk factors were identified and interventions were applied accordingly, but the incidence of end-stage renal disease continued increasing. Some other risk factors may be ignored. Gut  has been recognized as an important endogenous organ. The kidney-gut axis would contribute to gut dysbiosis, which might worsen CKD. Constipation, commonly seen in CKD, was one of the clinical presentation of gut dysbiosis. The clinical impact of constipation to CKD remains unknown. Our study aimed at assessing the risk of ESRD between CKD patients with and without constipation in a nationwide database.We identified newly diagnosed cases of CKD without constipation history before in 2000-2011 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. Subjects who developed constipation later formed constipation group. The others without constipation matched by propensity score formed non-constipation group. The incidence rates and hazards of ESRD in patients with and without constipation by the end of 2013 were compared by using Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable.The incidences of ESRD per 1000 person-years were 22.9 for constipation group and 12.2 for non-constipation group, respectively. Cox proportional hazard models with a time-dependent variable revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.90 (95% CI, 1.60-2.27). Compared to the CKD patients without constipation, adjusted hazard ratio for the CKD patients with laxatives < 33, 33-197 and ≥ 198 days per year were 0.45 (0.31-0.63), 1.85 (1.47-2.31) and 4.41 (3.61-5.39) respectively.In a population of newly-diagnosed CKD patients, we observed that subjects with de novo constipation, as compared with non-constipation, have increased risk of developing ESRD.

The results showed that ultrasound (US) did not modify luminosity (P = 0.42), redness (a*, P = 0.45), or yellowness (*, P = 0.94). However, the hue angle increased with US treatment and during storage (P = 0.04), showing an important degradation in the color of meat treated with 16 Wcm. The pH and shear force decreased during storage at 4 °C (P = 0.01). Although US did not have any significant effects on the tenderness of the meat, the interfibrillar areas increased drastically in samples treated with 16, 28 and 90 Wcm (P < 0.0001). US was effective in controlling mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria during storage at 4 °C when intensities of 90 Wcm were used (P < 0.0001), whereas decontamination of coliform bacteria was efficient independently of ultrasonication intensity, as long as a long sonication time (40 min) was used.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Usage of antibiotics in food production and in human or veterinary medicine has resulted in the emergence of commensal antibiotic resistant bacteria in the human gut. The incidence of erythromycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the feces of healthy vegans, ovo-lacto vegetarians and omnivores was analyzed. Overall, 155 LAB were isolated and characterized for their phenotypic and genotypic resistance to erythromycin. The isolates belonged to 11 different species within the Enterococcus and Streptococcus genera. Enterococcus faecium was the dominant species in isolates from all the dietary categories. Only 97 out of 155 isolates were resistant to erythromycin after Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination; among them, 19 isolates (7 from vegans, 4 from ovo-lacto vegetarians and 8 from omnivores) carried the erm() gene. The copresence of erm() and erm(A) genes was only observed in Enterococcus avium from omnivores. Moreover, the transferability of erythromycin resistance genes using multidrug-resistant (MDR) cultures selected from the three groups was assessed, and four out of six isolates were able to transfer the erm() gene. Overall, isolates obtained from the omnivore samples showed resistance to a greater number of antibiotics and carried more tested antibiotic resistance genes compared to the isolates from ovo-lacto vegetarians and vegans. In conclusion, our results show that diet does not significantly affect the occurrence of erythromycin-resistant bacteria and that commensal strains may act as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes and as a source of antibiotic resistance spreading.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417554>Dietary Oligosaccharides Attenuate Stress-Induced Disruptions in Immune Reactivity and Microbial -Vitamin Metabolism.</a></h2><p> Exposure to stressful stimuli dysregulates inflammatory processes and alters the gut . Prebiotics, including long-chain fermentable fibers and milk oligosaccharides, have the potential to limit inflammation through modulation of the gut . To determine whether prebiotics attenuate stress-induced inflammation and  perturbations, mice were fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with galactooligosaccharides, polydextrose and sialyllactose (GOS+PDX+SL) or sialyllactose (SL) for 2 weeks prior to and during a 6-day exposure to a social disruption stressor. Spleens were collected for immunoreactivity assays. Colon contents were examined for stressor- and diet- induced changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing and UPLC-MS/MS.  Stress increased circulating IL-6 and enhanced splenocyte immunoreactivity to an  LPS challenge. Diets containing GOS+PDX+SL or SL alone attenuated these responses. Stress exposure resulted in large changes to the gut metabolome, including robust shifts in amino acids, peptides, nucleotides/nucleosides, tryptophan metabolites, and  vitamins. Multiple  vitamins were inversely associated with IL-6 and were augmented in mice fed either GOS+PDX+SL or SL diets. Stressed mice exhibited distinct microbial communities with lower abundances of  spp. and higher abundances of  spp. Diet supplementation with GOS+PDX+SL, but not SL alone, orthogonally altered the microbiome and enhanced the growth of  spp. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from mice fed the GOS+PDX+SL diet unveiled genes in a  MAG for   vitamin synthesis.  vitamers directly attenuated the stressor-induced exacerbation of cytokine production in LPS-stimulated splenocytes.  Overall, these data indicate that colonic metabolites, including  vitamins, are responsive to psychosocial stress.

A firm connection between melatonin at a physiologically relevant concentration and the gut  and inflammation has recently established. Herein, we summarize their crosstalk and focus on four novelties. First, how melatonin is synthesized and degraded in the gut and exerts potentially diverse phenotypic effects through its diverse metabolites. Second, how melatonin mediates the activation and proliferation of intestinal mucosal immune cells with paracrine and autocrine properties. By modulating T/ cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, melatonin immunomodulatory involved in regulating T-cell differentiation, intervening T/ cell interaction and attenuating the production of pro-inflammatory factors, achieving its antioxidant action via specific receptors. Third, how melatonin exerts antimicrobial action and modulates microbial components, such as lipopolysaccharide, amyloid-β peptides via nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) or signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1) pathway to modulate intestinal immune function in immune-pineal axis. The last, how melatonin mediates the effect of intestinal bacterial activity signals on the body rhythm system through the NF-κ pathway and influences the mucosal epithelium oscillation via clock gene expression. These processes are achieved at mitochondrial and nuclear levels to control the host immune cell development.

Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of  complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human Microbiome Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31378678>Mapping Interactions of Microbial Metabolites with Human G-Protein-Coupled Receptors.</a></h2><p>Despite evidence linking the human microbiome to health and disease, how the  affects human physiology remains largely unknown. -encoded metabolites are expected to play an integral role in human health. Therefore, assigning function to these metabolites is critical to understanding these complex interactions and developing -inspired therapies. Here, we use large-scale functional screening of molecules produced by individual members of a simplified human  to identify bacterial metabolites that agonize G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Multiple metabolites, including phenylpropanoic acid, cadaverine, 9-10-methylenehexadecanoic acid, and 12-methyltetradecanoic acid, were found to interact with GPCRs associated with diverse functions within the nervous and immune systems, among others. Collectively, these metabolite-receptor pairs indicate that diverse aspects of human health are potentially modulated by structurally simple metabolites arising from primary bacterial metabolism.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Effluent collected after Rubrivivax gelatinosus-mediated wastewater treatment could be re-utilized as microbial feeds, medicament, and aquaculture water to culture Crucian carp. Therefore, a novel integrated system of wastewater treatment using effluent containing R. gelatinosus that improves yield, increases disease resistance, and enhances the quality of aquaculture water for Crucian carp culture was proposed and investigated. Crucian carp can grow well in effluent containing R. gelatinosus (ER). The survival rate, yield, and whole body composition of the ER group were all increased compared to the control group (CK). The biochemical ( vitamin) and other substances in the effluent of R. gelatinosus enhanced the activity of proteases, amylases, lipases, AKP, ACP, phagocytic, SOD, CAT by up-regulating the expression of akp, acp, sod, and cat genes. Theoretical analysis showed that biochemicals regulate the expression of these gene and enzyme activities by acting as a signal that stimulates the active center. Moreover, R. gelatinosus and biochemical substances improved mTOR and NF-kB signaling pathway and intestinal . Furthermore, R. gelatinosus inhibited Aeromonas hydrophila that increases resistance against fish disease and promotes the growth of intestinal bacteria. Meanwhile, R. gelatinosus in the effluent also improved the aquaculture water quality. This technology would save the aquaculture water, reduce water pollution and wastewater discharge, and increase the output and disease resistance of Crucian carp, simultaneously.Copyright © 2019.

The piglets were randomly allocated into three iso-nitrogenous diet groups that were fed either a control diet, a diet with 15% RDP, or a diet with 30% RDP for a total of 35 days. Chromium oxide was used for apparent digestibility measurements. On d14 and d35, half of the piglets were randomly selected for hemato-biochemical and gut  evaluations.Increasing inclusion levels of RDP tended to linearly increase (p ≤ 0.07) average daily gain on d14 and d35, and decreased (p = 0.08) feed conversion ratio on d35. Empty stomach weight increased (p = 0.04) on d35 while digestibility of diet components decreased. Serum globulin concentration decreased on d14 (P = 0.003) and red blood cell count tended to decrease (P = 0.06) on d35, parallel to increase RDP levels. Gene amplicon profiling of 16S rRNA revealed that the colonic  composition of weaned pigs changed by inclusion of RDP over the period. On d14, decreased proportions of Lachnospiraceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Bacteroidales_ge, and increased proportions of Prevotellaceae_ge, Prevotella_2, and Prevotella_9 were found with inclusion of RDP, whereas opposite effect was found on d35. Additionally, the proportion of Lachnospiraceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_ge, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, and Bacteroidales_ge in RDP diets decreased over periods in control diet but increased largely in diet with 30% RDP.These results indicate that RDP modulates in a favorable way gastrointestinal  composition and improves piglet performance despite a negative impact on digestibility of lipids and GE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500822>MAIT cells in metabolic diseases.</a></h2><p>Metabolic diseases represent a wide category of alterations affecting metabolism. These pathologies are notably marked by inflammation that implicates the immune system. Mucosal Associated Invariant (MAI)T cells are immune cells expressing a semi-invariant TCR able to recognize bacterial and fungal vitamin  metabolites. MAIT cells can promote inflammation and are present in many organs central to metabolism, suggesting a role in the etiopathology of these diseases.Here, we will review what is known of the involvement of MAIT cells in metabolic pathologies in humans and mice.MAIT cells are severely affected, overactivated with a frequency reduction and a phenotype shift from protective to deleterious. Therefore, they might be a novel target to treat, in particular, pancreas and liver metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, we have constructed a bioactive  (LC) strain, LC, by inserting  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene, which stimulates the conversion of conjugated linoleic acids. In this study, we evaluated the modulation of gut microbiome and protective roles of LC against pathogenic  serovar Typhimurium (ST) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) infections in BALB/cJ mice. We observed that LC colonized efficiently in mice gut intestine and competitively reduced the infection with ST and EHEC in various locations of small and large intestine, specifically cecum, jejunum, and ileum ( < 0.05). Positive modulation of the cecal , for example, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, and increased bacterial species diversity/richness, was detected in ST-challenged mice pretreated with LC based on 16S metagenomic sequencing. Cytokine gene expression analysis indicated that mice pretreated with LC associated with attenuated bacterial pathogen-induced gut inflammation. Furthermore, mice fed daily with LC for one week could protect themselves from the impairments caused by enteric infections with ST or EHEC. These impairments include weight loss, negative hematological changes, intestinal histological alterations, and potential death. This  study suggests that daily consumption of novel conjugated linoleic acids over-producing probiotic effectively improves intestinal  composition and prevents/combats foodborne enteric bacterial infections with pathogenic  and diarrheagenic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31452345>A commercial seaweed extract structured microbial communities associated with tomato and pepper roots and significantly increased crop yield.</a></h2><p>Seaweeds have been used as a source of natural fertilizer and biostimulant in agriculture for centuries. However, their effects on soil and crop root  remain unclear. Here, we used a commercially available Ascophyllum nodosum extract (ANE) to test its effect on bacterial and fungal communities of rhizospheric soils and roots of pepper and tomato plants in greenhouse trials. Two independent trials were conducted in a split-block design. We used amplicon sequencing targeting fungal ITS and bacterial 16S rRNA gene to determine microbial community structure changes. We find that productivity parameters of root, shoot and fruit biomass were positively and significantly influenced by the ANE amendment. In addition, a-diversity differed significantly between amended and control plants, but only in some of the experimental conditions. Species composition among sites (-diversity) differed according to the amendment treatment in all four communities (fungal-root, fungal-soil, bacterial-root and bacterial-soil). Finally, we identified a number of candidate taxa most strongly correlated with crop yield increases. Further studies on isolation and characterization of these microbial taxa linked to the application of liquid seaweed extract may help to enhance crop yield in sustainable agro-ecosystems.© 2019 The Authors.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal . The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as dysbiosis markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic acids along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). To show that the optimised method is a useful tool for chemical diagnosis of dysbiosis, it was applied for determination of the dysbiosis markers in the authentic urine samples.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The gut  is considered as a factor involved in the regulation of numerous metabolic pathways by impacting several functions of the host. It has been suggested that probiotics can modulate host gene expression and metabolism, and thereby positively influence host adipose tissue development and obesity related-metabolic disorders. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing  strain on host glucose and lipid metabolism and the gut microbial composition in a short-term diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group that received control standard diet, a group fed a high-fat diet (HF), and a group fed HF supplemented with  IPLA R1. Fasting serum insulin as well as triglycerides accumulation in the liver were significantly reduced in the group receiving  IPLA R1. The treatment with the EPS-producing  IPLA R1 tended to down-regulate the expression of host genes involved in the hepatic synthesis of fatty acids which was concomitant with an upregulation in the expression of genes related with fatty acid oxidation.  IPLA R1 not only promoted the increase of  but also the levels of . Our data indicate that the EPS-producing  IPLA R1 strain may have beneficial effects in metabolic disorders associated with obesity, by modulating the gut  composition and promoting changes in lipids metabolism and glucose homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400167>Acidic pH promotes lipopolysaccharide modification and alters colonization in a bacteria-animal mutualism.</a></h2><p>Environmental pH can be an important cue for symbiotic bacteria as they colonize their eukaryotic hosts. Using the model mutualism between the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, we characterized the bacterial transcriptional response to acidic pH experienced during the shift from planktonic to host-associated lifestyles. We found several genes involved in outer membrane structure were differentially expressed based on pH, indicating alterations in membrane physiology as V. fischeri initiates its symbiotic program. Exposure to host-like pH increased the resistance of V. fischeri to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymixin , which resembles antibacterial molecules that are produced by the squid to select V. fischeri from the ocean . Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a homolog of eptA, a predicted phosphoethanolamine transferase, as critical for antimicrobial defense. We used MALDI-MS to verify eptA as an ethanolamine transferase for the lipid-A portion of V. fischeri lipopolysaccharide. We then used a DNA pulldown approach to discover that eptA transcription is activated by the global regulator H-NS. Finally, we revealed that eptA promotes successful squid colonization by V. fischeri, supporting its potential role in initiation of this highly specific symbiosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417547>Gut Bacterial Metabolite Urolithin A (UA) Mitigates Ca Entry in T Cells by Regulating miR-10a-5p.</a></h2><p>The gut  influences several biological functions including immune responses. Inflammatory bowel disease is favorably influenced by consumption of several dietary natural plant products such as pomegranate, walnuts, and berries containing polyphenolic compounds such as ellagitannins and ellagic acid. The gut  metabolizes ellagic acid resulting in the formation of bioactive urolithins A, , C, and D. Urolithin A (UA) is the most active and effective gut metabolite and acts as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant agent. However, whether gut metabolite UA affects the function of immune cells remains incompletely understood. T cell proliferation is stimulated by store operated Ca entry (SOCE) resulting from stimulation of Orai1 by STIM1/STIM2. We show here that treatment of murine CD4 T cells with UA (10 μM, 3 days) significantly blunted SOCE in CD4 T cells, an effect paralleled by significant downregulation of Orai1 and STIM1/2 transcript levels and protein abundance. UA treatment further increased miR-10a-5p abundance in CD4 T cells in a dose dependent fashion. Overexpression of miR-10a-5p significantly decreased STIM1/2 and Orai1 mRNA and protein levels as well as SOCE in CD4 T cells. UA further decreased CD4 T cell proliferation. Thus, the gut bacterial metabolite UA increases miR-10a-5p levels thereby downregulating Orai1/STIM1/STIM2 expression, store operated Ca entry, and proliferation of murine CD4 T cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632541>Synergistic effects of  culture supernatant and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The gut  has been shown to play an important role in chronic liver disease. It has been found that both  and its culture supernatant have the potential to mitigate alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have immunosuppressive effects with few side effects. The synergistic effect between  culture supernatant and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) deserves further observation. In this study, a mouse model of chronic alcoholic hepatitis was established by eight weeks of Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet feeding; and LGG-s, BMMSCs or a combination of the two were used to explore a new therapeutic method for alcoholic liver disease and to study the mechanism. The results showed that the combined LGG-s and BMMSC treatment might have a synergistic effect and could improve the symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis by regulating inflammation, autophagy and lymphocyte subsets through the PI3k/NF-kB and PI3K/mTOR pathways. With the treatment, the autophagy rate accelerated, and alcohol-induced natural killer  (NKB) cell and follicular helper T (TFH) cell numbers decreased. These findings suggest that the development of alcoholic hepatitis may occur via PI3K/NF-kB and PI3K/mTOR pathway overactivation as well as through NKB and TFH cell imbalances. Moreover, LGG-s and BMMSCs can regulate these factors and alleviate the disease.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563774>Bacillus coagulans R11 maintained intestinal villus health and decreased intestinal injury in lead-exposed mice by regulating the intestinal  and influenced the function of faecal microRNAs.</a></h2><p>Lead contamination is an environmental problem, especially in developing countries; due to the nondegradable characteristics of lead, it is easily deposited in human and animal bodies by the food chain.

Our prior study demonstrated that microbial diversity was higher in cirrhotics from Turkish vs the USA, which was associated with lower risk of 90-day hospitalizations. We aimed to define gut microbial functional and metabolomic changes to increase insight into benefits of the Mediterranean compared to Western diets.In all, 139 Turkish (46 controls/50 compensated/43 decompensated) and 157 American subjects (48 controls/59 compensated/50 decompensated) were studied. Turkish subjects consumed a modified Mediterranean diet with daily fermented milk intake, whereas Americans consumed a Western diet. Predicted gut microbial functionalities and plasma metabolomics were compared between/within countries. Correlation network differences between  and metabolites in cirrhotics from Turkey vs the USA were evaluated.Predicted microbial function showed lower amino acid, bioenergetics and lipid pathways, with functions related to vitamin , glycan, xenobiotic metabolism, DNA/RNA synthesis, in cirrhotics from Turkey compared to the USA. Plasma metabolomics demonstrated higher relative lactate levels in Turkey vs the USA. The metabolite changes in decompensated cirrhosis, compared to controls, showed similar trends in Turkey and the USA, with reduced lipids and phosphocholines. Phosphocholines were significantly lower in patients hospitalized in 90 days (P = .03). Correlation networks in cirrhotics demonstrated linkage differences between beneficial taxa, Blautia and Oscillispira, and lactate and unsaturated lipids, in Turkey compared to American patients.A modified Mediterranean diet was associated with altered plasma metabolomics and beneficially alters  functionality and correlations compared to Western diet in cirrhosis.

However, dietary adherence is challenging to maintain while ensuring adequate nutrition, which can lead to sub-optimal clinical outcomes. Metabolomics offers a systematic approach to identify new biomarkers of disease progression in PKU when using urine as a surrogate for blood specimens that is more accurate than self-reported diet records. Herein, the plasma and urine metabolome of a cohort of classic PKU patients (median age = 11 years; n = 22) mainly prescribed (78%) a Phe-restricted diet were characterized using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Overall, there was good mutual agreement between plasma Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations measured from PKU patients when using an amino acid analyzer based on UPLC-UV as compared to MSI-CE-MS with a mean bias of 12% (n = 82). Longitudinal measurements of recently diagnosed PKU infants (n = 3) revealed good long-term regulation of blood Phe with dietary management, and only occasional episodes exceeding the recommended therapeutic range (>360 μM) unlike older PKU patients. Plasma metabolomic studies demonstrated that non-adherent PKU patients had lower circulating concentrations of Tyr, arginine, 2-aminobutyric acid, and propionylcarnitine (q < 0.05, FDR) that were inversely correlated to Phe (r ≈ -0.600 to -0.830). Nontargeted metabolite profiling also revealed urinary biomarkers associated with poor dietary adherence among PKU patients, including elevated concentrations of catabolites indicative of Phe intoxication (e.g., phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Additionally, PKU patients with poor blood Phe control had lower excretion of urinary compounds derived from co-metabolism of Tyr due to  activity (e.g., cresol sulfate, phenylsulfate), as well as several metabolites associated with inadequate nutrient intake, including low carnitine and  vitamin status (e.g., folic acid, vitamin B12). Interestingly, an unknown urinary metabolite was strongly correlated with Phe excretion in PKU patients (r = 0.861), which was subsequently identified as imidazole lactic acid when using high resolution MS/MS. Overall, urine profiling offers a non-invasive approach for better treatment monitoring of individual PKU patients, which can also guide the design of novel therapies that improve adherence to Phe-restricted diets without acquired nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597568>Relating the gut metagenome and metatranscriptome to immunotherapy responses in melanoma patients.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma is modulated by gut . Few studies have examined this phenomenon in humans, and none have incorporated metatranscriptomics, important for determining expression of metagenomic functions in the microbial community.In melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy, gut microbiome was characterized in pre-treatment stool using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome sequencing (n = 27). Transcriptional expression of metagenomic pathways was confirmed with metatranscriptome sequencing in a subset of 17. We examined associations of taxa and metagenomic pathways with progression-free survival (PFS) using 500 × 10-fold cross-validated elastic-net penalized Cox regression.Higher microbial community richness was associated with longer PFS in 16S and shotgun data (p < 0.05). Clustering based on overall microbiome composition divided patients into three groups with differing PFS; the low-risk group had 99% lower risk of progression than the high-risk group at any time during follow-up (p = 0.002). Among the species selected in regression, abundance of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides massiliensis, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Blautia producta were related to shorter PFS, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus eutactus, Prevotella stercorea, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 46FAA to longer PFS. Metagenomic functions related to PFS that had correlated metatranscriptomic expression included risk-associated pathways of L-rhamnose degradation, guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis, and  vitamin biosynthesis.This work adds to the growing evidence that gut  are related to immunotherapy outcomes, and identifies, for the first time, transcriptionally expressed metagenomic pathways related to PFS.

All strains (n = 50) possessed the virulence genes spa (Staphylococcal protein A), coa (coagulase), and icaAB (intercellular adhesin); 96% (n = 48) possessed clfB (clumping factor ), and 88% (n = 44) possessed ebps (elastin-binding protein) and sdrD (serine aspartate repeat protein D). All strains were resistant to methicillin, ampicillin, dicloxacillin, cefotaxime, and penicillin, and were multidrug resistant to 6-12 antibiotics. PFGE analysis showed 37 different pulsed-field types and most strains (60.4%) had a unique pulsed-field type. Twenty-four distinct combinations of virulence genes and antibiotic-resistant phenotypes were identified.Although S. aureus has been considered a transient member of the oral , our results indicate a high-level expression of virulence genes and multidrug resistance in the strains isolated from periodontal lesions.

Rapid induction of bactericidal activity in the insect gut at the onset of pupation has been described in numerous orders of the Holometabola and is best-studied in the Lepidoptera where it is under control of the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) moulting pathway. Here, using RNAseq, we compare the expression of immune effector genes in the gut during metamorphosis in a holometabolous (Galleria mellonella) and a hemimetabolous insect (Gryllus bimaculatus). We find that in G. mellonella, the expression of numerous immune effectors and the transcription factor GmEts are upregulated, with peak expression of three antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and a lysozyme coinciding with delamination of the larval gut. By contrast, no such upregulation was detectable in the hemimetabolous Gr. bimaculatus.

However, its influences on bird gut morphology and intestinal  were still unclear. We used female Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to examine the effects of chronic lead exposure (0, 50 ppm and 1000 ppm) on cecal histology, microbial communities and immune function. The results showed 50 ppm lead exposure caused subtle damages of cecum cell structure. However, 1000 ppm lead exposure caused severe cecum histopathological changes characterized by mucosa abscission, Lieberkühn glands destruction and lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, both lead concentrations induced ultrastructural damages featured by nucleus pyknosis, mitochondrial vacuolation and microvilli contraction. Meanwhile, microbial community structure, species diversity, taxonomic compositions and taxa abundance in the cecum were affected by lead exposure. Furthermore, the mRNA relative expression of immunity-related genes such as interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) was significantly downregulated while that of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and natural killer kappa  (NF-κ) was significantly upregulated in the cecum of 50 and 1000 ppm lead exposure groups.

In this sense, this work aims to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on intestinal  modulation, degree of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, inflammation, gut permeability, and body composition.This double-blind, randomized clinical trial will include adult outpatients with a diagnosis of NASH confirmed by biopsy with or without transient elastography. All patients will undergo a complete anamnesis to investigate their alcohol consumption, previous history, medications, nutritional assessment (dietary intake and body composition), sarcopenia, physical activity level and physical and functional capacity, cardiovascular risk, biochemical parameters for assessment of inflammatory status, lipid profile, hepatic function, gut permeability, and assessment of . These procedures will be performed at baseline and repeated after 24 weeks (at the end of the study). Through the process of randomization, patients will be allocated to receive treatment A or treatment . Both patients and researchers involved will be blinded (double-blind study). The intervention consists of treatment with a probiotic mix (Lactobacillus acidophillus + Bifidobacterium lactis + Lactobacillus rhamnosus + Lactobacillus paracasei, 1 x 10 CFU for each) and the placebo which is identical in all its characteristics and packaging. Patients will be instructed to consume two sachets/day during 24 weeks and to report any symptoms or side effects related to the use of the sachets. Adherence control will be carried out through the patient's notes on a form provided, and also by checking the number of sachets used.The final results of study will be analyzed and disseminated in 2020.ClinicalTrials.gov, ID:  .

Some probiotics were demonstrated to exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Lactobacillus plantarum CMU995 against alcohol-induced liver injury. The mice were orally administered L. plantarum CMU995 for 1 week, followed by the administration of alcohol and different tested substances daily for 6 weeks. The liver injury was examined by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), malondialdehyde (MDA), anti-oxidative enzyme, endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and lipid accumulation in the liver or serum among different groups. L. plantarum CMU995 exhibited beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury via reduction in the serum concentration of AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, we also found that the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and intestinal tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) were considerably higher in L. plantarum CMU995-fed groups when compared with placebo group. Meanwhile, the protective effects were demonstrated biological gradients as controversial dose-dependent. We speculate that L. plantarum CMU995 inhibited the migration of alcohol-derived endotoxin into the blood and liver, thereby improving the intestinal barrier. The present evidence may provide a novel -based strategy to prevent the alcohol-induced liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h2><p>Evidence has proven that the gut  is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666311>Incidence of necrotising enterocolitis before and after introducing routine prophylactic  and  probiotics.</a></h2><p>To compare rates of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis, and mortality in 5-year epochs before and after implementation of routine daily multistrain probiotics administration in high-risk neonates.Single-centre retrospective observational study over the 10-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017.Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, UK.Preterm neonates at high risk of NEC: admitted to NICU within 3 days of birth at <32 weeks' gestation or at 32-36 weeks' gestation and of birth weight <1500 g.Prior to 1 January 2013 probiotics were not used. Thereafter, dual-species  and  combination probiotics were routinely administered daily to high-risk neonates; from April 2016 triple-species probiotics (    and   subspecies ) were used.Incidence of NEC (modified Bell's stage 2a or greater), late-onset sepsis, and mortality.Rates of NEC fell from 7.5% (35/469 neonates) in the pre-implementation epoch to 3.1% (16/513 neonates) in the routine probiotics epoch (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85, p=0.014). The more than halving of NEC rates after probiotics introduction was independent of any measured covariates, including breast milk feeding rates. Cases of late-onset sepsis fell from 106/469 (22.6%) to 59/513 (11.5%) (p<0.0001), and there was no episode of sepsis due to  or . All-cause mortality also fell in the routine probiotics epoch, from 67/469 (14.3%) to 47/513 (9.2%), although this was not statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (adjusted sub-hazard ratio=0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, p=0.155).Administration of multispecies  and  probiotics has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of NEC and late-onset sepsis in our neonatal unit, and no safety issues. Our data are consistent with routine use of  and  combination probiotics having a beneficial effect on NEC prevention in very preterm neonates.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Gut  abundance was significantly different, where standard vaginally delivered (SVD) and breast-fed (BF) groups were higher in comparison with caesarean section (CS), milk-powder-fed (MPF), and mixed-fed (MF) groups. The genus unclassified Enterobacteriaceae was dominant, followed by , which was highly abundant in SVD and BF groups. The dominant  species in all groups were ,  and .  and the diversity of  in SVD and BF groups were significantly higher. For  profiles,  and  were dominant among all the groups, while  species in CS and MPF groups were more diverse. Functional predictions showed significant differences between delivery mode and feeding groups, such as phosphotransferase system as well as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. In early infants with different delivery and feeding methods, gut -particularly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli communities-showed significant differences, with strong implications for physiological functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500212>Seasonal Abundance of Psyllid Species on Carrots and Potato Crops in Spain.</a></h2><p>Psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) can transmit the phloem restricted bacterium ' Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso). In Europe, Lso causes severe losses to carrot and represents a threat to the potato industry. A rising concern is Lso transmission from carrot to potato and within potato, and this has driven the need for monitoring populations of psyllid species which could serve as vectors on both crops. This would provide a fundamental understanding of the epidemiology of Lso. Different sampling methods were used to survey populations of psyllid species in commercial carrot and potato fields in central and eastern mainland Spain from 2015 to 2017. Two psyllid species,   and   were found on carrot and potato crops. In carrot fields the most abundant species was   (occurring from crop emergence to harvest); whereas in potato crops the most abundant psyllid species was  . Depending on field location, the maximum psyllid populations occurred between June and October. Since   was found on both carrot and potato and is the only psyllid species able to feed and reproduce on both these crops in Europe, there is the potential risk of Lso transmission from carrot to potato.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614751>Metagenomic Insights into the Effects of Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) on the Composition of Luminal and Mucosal  in C57BL/6J Mice, Especially the  Composition.</a></h2><p>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are considered prebiotics and have been proven to selectively promote the growth of  in the gut. This study aimed to clarify the effects of FOS intake on the composition of luminal and mucosal  in mice. Briefly, mice were fed a 0% or 25% FOS (/)-supplemented diet for four weeks, and the composition of luminal and mucosal , especially the  was analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA and  gene, respectively. After FOS intervention, there were significant increases in the total and wall weights of the cecum and the amount of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecal contents of the mice. At the phylum level, the results showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in the contents and mucosa from the cecum to the distal colon in the FOS group. Besides , a significant increase was observed in the relative abundance of  in all samples at the genus level, which may be partially related to the increase in butyric acid levels in the luminal contents. Furthermore,  sequencing revealed that  was almost the sole bifidobacterial species in the luminal contents (>98%) and mucosa (>89%). These results indicated that FOS can selectively promote  proliferation in the intestine, either in the lumen or the mucosa from the cecum to the distal colon. Further studies are required to reveal the competitive advantage of  over other FOS-metabolizing bacteria and the response mechanisms of  to FOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341570>Fecal human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) levels and gut  patterns in preterm neonates with different feeding patterns.</a></h2><p>Human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is an essential antibacterial peptide involved in innate immunity and is expressed in breast milk and intestinal mucosa. The aim of this study was to investigate fecal hBD-2 levels and gut  in preterm neonates with different feeding patterns.This study was cross-sectionally designed and included 44 preterm neonates categorized into four groups as follows: breast milk only, breast milk predominant, formula milk predominant, formula milk only. The study was conducted at the Neonatology Ward, National Center Hospital Cipto Mangunkusumo, Jakarta from November 2016 to April 2017. hBD-2 levels were measured by ELISA. Intestinal bacteria were quantified by qPCR.hBD-2 levels were significantly different between groups (one-way ANOVA, p=0.004) and the highest value of hBD-2 was found in the formula milk predominant group (344.87±61.2 ng/mL). hBD-2 levels were positively correlated with feeding pattern (Spearman correlation test, p=0.009, r=0.391). There were no significant differences in the total number of specific intestinal  ( and ) among groups (one-way ANOVA, p>0.05).

Statistical analyses focused on intraindividual and interindividual bacterial diversity and identification of differentially abundant taxa.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls had similar microbiome profiles of the gut  regarding intraindividual bacterial diversity, OTU distribution, ratio between regional and local species diversity when testing all OTUs, and genera with a relative abundance greater than 0.5%. Similarly, the subgroup of NMDAR encephalitis patients with an ovarian teratoma (n = 3) showed no differences in microbiome variation compared with controls. Patients in the acute encephalitis stage (n = 8) showed significant differences in the numbers of , , , , and ; however, significance was lost after correction for multiple testing.Patients with NMDAR encephalitis and controls both had a normal gut microbiome. The lack of overabundance of certain bacterial species in patients suggests that microbiome changes are no major contributors to the pathogenesis, disease course, or prognosis in NMDAR encephalitis. Despite the small sample size and heterogeneous groups, findings indicate differences to other neuroimmunologic diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

In 303 Emirati adults, we tested the hypothesis that incense use is linked to compositional changes in the oral  that can be potentially significant for health. The oral  was assessed by amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene from mouthwash samples. Frequency of incense use was ascertained through a questionnaire and examined in relation to overall oral  composition (PERMANOVA analysis), and to specific taxon abundances, by negative binomial generalized linear models. We found that exposure to incense burning was associated with higher microbial diversity (p < 0.013) and overall microbial compositional changes (PERMANOVA, p = 0.003). Our study also revealed that incense use was associated with significant changes in bacterial abundances (i.e. depletion of the dominant taxon Streptococcus), even in occasional users (once/week or less) implying that incense use impacts the oral  even at low exposure levels. In summary, this first study suggests that incense burning alters the oral , potentially serving as an early biomarker of incense-related toxicities and related health consequences.

We present the case of a patient with BRAF-negative stage IVC anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) treated with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, pembrolizumab, following radiographic progression on chemoradiation. Blood samples were collected prior to and at four time points during treatment with pembrolizumab. Mass cytometry was used to determine expression of relevant biomarkers by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Faecal samples were collected at baseline and 4 weeks following treatment initiation; taxonomic profiling using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed. Following treatment, a marked expansion in CD20  cell, CD16 CD56 NK cell and CD45RO CCR7 central memory CD4 T-cell populations was observed in the peripheral blood. Proportions of cells expressing the co-receptors TIGIT, OX40 and CD86 also increased during treatment. A high abundance of bacteria of the order Bacteroidales, specifically from the Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae families, was identified in the faecal . Moreover, the patient's microbiome was enriched in Clostridiales order members Ruminococcaceae, Veillonellaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was significantly higher following initiation of checkpoint therapy as assessed by the Shannon and Simpson index. Our results suggest that treatment with pembrolizumab promotes expansion of T-, - and NK cell populations in the peripheral blood at the time of tumour regression and have the potential to be implemented as predictive biomarkers in the context of checkpoint blockade therapy.

Besides its effect in blood pressure reduction, ZGXFD is also known to be a radical therapy with little or no side effects. Compared with western medicines, Chinese medicinal formulas have the advantage of simultaneously attacking multiple targets. However, such a property brings trouble to the pharmacological studies of Chinese medicines. This study investigated the composition of gut  in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with ZGXFD. ZGXFD was shown to cause similar effects in the treatment group as benazepril: both were able to reduce in SHR the microbial diversity, Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio and coccus to bacillus (C/) ratio. Meanwhile, ZGXFD can maintain the integrity of intestinal mechanistic barrier and elevate the percentage of bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA). By investigating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system, we found that ZGXFD can decrease the expression of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) in lungs, which in turn causes a increase in AngI produces angiotensin1-7 (Ang1-7) and decrease in AngII.

Butyrate contributes to gut homeostasis, but it may also control inflammatory responses and host physiology in other tissues. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases, thereby affecting gene transcription, and also signals through the metabolite-sensing G protein receptor (GPR)109a. We produced an mAb to mouse GPR109a and found high expression on podocytes in the kidney. Wild-type and  mice were induced to develop nephropathy by a single injection of Adriamycin and treated with sodium butyrate or high butyrate-releasing high-amylose maize starch diet. Butyrate improved proteinuria by preserving podocyte at glomerular basement membrane and attenuated glomerulosclerosis and tissue inflammation. This protective phenotype was associated with increased podocyte-related proteins and a normalized pattern of acetylation and methylation at promoter sites of genes essential for podocyte function. We found that GPR109a is expressed by podocytes, and the use of  mice showed that the protective effects of butyrate depended on GPR109a expression. A prebiotic diet that releases high amounts of butyrate also proved highly effective for protection against kidney disease. Butyrate and GPR109a play a role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease and provide one of the important molecular connections between diet, the gut , and kidney disease.-Felizardo, R. J.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸ (NF-ĸ) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸ inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347944>Compositional analyses reveal correlations between taxon-level gut bacterial abundance and peripheral T cell marker expression in African infants.</a></h2><p>Although exclusive breastfeeding has been linked to lower rates of postnatal HIV transmission compared to nonexclusive breastfeeding, mechanisms underlying this are unclear. Across a longitudinally sampled cohort of South African infants, we showed that exclusively breastfed (EBF) infants had altered gut bacterial communities when compared to nonexclusively breastfed (NEBF) infants, as well as reduced peripheral CD4 + T cell activation and lowered chemokine and chemokine receptor expression in the oral mucosa. We further demonstrated that the relative abundance of key taxa was correlated with peripheral CD4 + T cell activation. Here, we supplement those findings by using compositional data analyses to identify shifts in the abundance of several  strains relative to select strains of , and others that are associated with the transition to NEBF. We illustrate that the abundance ratio of these taxa is tightly correlated with feeding modality and is a strong predictor of peripheral T cell activation.

Metabotype-A only produces urolithin-A, metabotype- yields urolithin- and isourolithin-A in addition to urolithin-A, and metabotype 0 does not produce urolithins. Metabotype-A has been suggested to be 'protective', and metabotype- dysbiotic-prone to cardiometabolic impairments. We analyzed the gut-microbiome of 40 healthy women and determined their metabotypes and enterotypes, and their associations with anthropometric and gut-microbial changes after 3 weeks, 4, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Metabotype-A was predominant in mothers who lost weight (≥2 kg) (75%) versus metabotype- (54%). After delivery, the  of metabotype-A mothers changed, unlike metabotype-, which barely changed over 1 year. The metabotype-A discriminating bacteria correlated to the decrease of the women's waist while some metabotype- bacteria were inversely associated with a reduction of body mass index (BMI), waist, and waist-to-hip ratio. Metabotype- was associated with a more robust and less modulating microbial and anthropometric profiles versus metabotype-A, in which these profiles were normalized through the 1-year follow-up postpartum. Consequently, urolithin metabotypes assessment could be a tool to anticipate the predisposition of women to normalize their anthropometric values and gut-, significantly altered during pregnancy and after childbirth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31417535>Pretreatment With  Preserves Against D-Galactosamine-Induced Liver Injury in a Rat Model.</a></h2><p> () functions as a probiotic in animals, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Here, we have evaluated riboflavin (B2 vitamin) production by five  strains isolated from , a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from north-western Argentina and their isogenic riboflavin-overproducing derivatives previously selected using roseoflavin. A direct fluorescence spectroscopic detection method to quantify riboflavin production in bacterial culture supernatants has been tested. Comparison of the efficiency for riboflavin fluorescence quantification with and without prior HPLC fractionation showed that the developed method is a rapid and easy test for selection of B2 vitamin-producing strains. In addition, it can be used for quantitative detection of the vitamin production in real time during bacterial growth. On the basis of this and previous analyses, the  M5MA1-B2 riboflavin overproducer was selected for  and  studies after being fluorescently labeled by transfer of the pRCR12 plasmid, which encodes the mCherry protein. The labeling did not affect negatively the growth, the riboflavin production nor the adhesion of the strain to Caco-2 cells. Thus,  M5MA1-B2[pRCR12] was evaluated for its survival under digestive tract stresses in the presence of  in the dynamic multistage BFBL gut model and in a murine model. After exposure to both models, M5MA1-B2[pRCR12] could be recovered and detected by the pink color of the colonies.

In Experiment 1, twenty goats were fed with an isonitrogenous diet, containing 28% Non-Fiber Carbohydrate (MNFC group,  = 10) or 14% NFC (LNFC group,  = 10). In the MNFC group, the ruminal concentration of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) increased, and pH declined. Compared with those in the LNFC group, the microbial protein synthesis in rumen and mRNA abundance of urea transporter  (UT-) in rumen epithelium increased in the MNFC group, although serum urea-N (SUN) did not differ significantly between groups. Simultaneously, urinal urea-N excretion was reduced in the MNFC group. Significant correlations were found between rumen SCFA and UT- and between UT- and urinal urea-N excretion. Furthermore, the abundances of SCFA receptor of GPR41 and GPR43 increased in the rumen epithelium of the MNFC group. These results suggest that increases of SUN transported into the rumen and incorporated into microbial protein and decreases of urinal urea-N excretion are related to ruminal SCFA. This is supported by data from our previous study in which added SCFA on the mucosal side caused increases of urea transport rate (flux J urea) from the blood to the ruminal lumen side. In Experiment 2, we used 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing to analyze the structure of the ruminal  community in relation to SCFA. An additional eight goats were assigned into the MNFC ( = 4) and LNFC ( = 4) groups. The dietary ingredients, chemical composition, and feeding regimes were the same as those in Experiment 1. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA analysis) revealed NFC promoted the expansion of  diversity, particularly of SCFA-producing microbes. The function prediction of 19 upregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog groups showed an NFC-induced increase of the types and abundances of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing N and fatty acid metabolism. Based on our present and previous investigations, our results indicate that, in goats consuming a MNFC diet, the facilitated urea transport in the rumen and improved urea N salvage are triggered by an expansion of ruminal  diversity and are signaled by ruminal SCFA. This study thus provides new insights into the  involved in the dietary modulation of urea-N salvage in ruminant animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487251>[Refractory colitis by Clostridium difficile treated with fecal  transplant].</a></h2><p>Clostridium difficile infection is an increasingly recognized cause of diarrhea in inpatients, frequently associated to high mortality.

Severe  infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients. Fecal  transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing  and toxin  and negative for  ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within 5 d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery. Our case is the first reported in China.This case explores the possibilities of initially using FMT to treat severe CDI.

This study aims to investigate the effects of pterostilbene on reducing TMAO formation and on decreasing vascular inflammation in carnitine-feeding mice.C57BL/6 mice are treated with 1.3% carnitine in drinking water with or without pterostilbene supplementation. Using LC-MS/MS, the result shows that mice treated with 1.3% carnitine only significantly increased the plasma TMAO and pterostilbene supplementation group can reverse it. Additionally, pterostilbene decreases hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) mRNA levels compared to carnitine only group. It appears that pterostilbene can alter host physiology and create an intestinal microenvironment favorable for certain gut . Gut  analysis reveals that pterostilbene increases the abundance of Bacteroides. Further, pterostilbene decreases mRNA levels of vascular inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin).These data suggest that amelioration of carnitine-induced vascular inflammation after consumption of pterostilbene is partially mediated via modulation of gut  composition and hepatic enzyme FMO3 gene expression.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and -cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory -cell responses. In IBD, CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although -cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in IBD, dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the  in IBD, with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses. Regulatory function of Trm may explain their association with intestinal health.

The earthworms Pontoscolex corethrurus (invasive) and Balanteodrilus pearsei (native) are associated with the emergence of agriculture and sedentism in the region Amazon and Maya, respectively. Both species have shifted their preference from their natural habitat to the cropland niche. They contrast in terms of intensification of agricultural land use (anthropic impact to the symbiotic soil microbiome). P. corethrurus inhabits conventional agroecosystems, while . pearsei thrives in traditional agroecosystems, i.e., P. corethrurus has not yet been recorded in soils where . pearsei dwells. The demographic behavior of these two earthworm species was assessed in the laboratory over 100 days, according to their origin (OE; P. corethrurus and . pearsei) food quality (FQ; soil only, maize stubble, Mucuna pruriens), and soil moisture (SM; 25, 33, 42%). The results showed that OE, FQ, SM, and the OE x FQ interaction were highly significant for the survival, growth, and reproduction of earthworms. P. corethrurus showed a lower survival rate (> mortality). P. corethrurus survivors fed a diet of low-to-intermediate nutritional quality (soil and stubble maize, respectively) showed a greater capacity to grow and reproduce; however, it was surpassed by the native earthworm when fed a high-quality diet (M. pruriens). Besides, P. corethrurus displayed a low cocoon hatching (emergence of juveniles). These results suggest that the presence of the invasive species was associated with a negative interaction with the soil  where the native species dwells, and with the absence of natural mutualistic bacteria (gut, nephridia, and cocoons). These results are consistent with the absence of P. corethrurus in milpa and pasture-type agricultural niches managed by peasants (agroecologists) to grow food regularly through biological soil management.

This study aimed to use metagenomics to predict faecal nutrient digestibility in grower-finisher pigs. The study design consisted of 160 three-way crossbreed grower-finisher pigs (80 female and 80 male) which were either fed a diet based on corn/soybean meal or a more fibrous diet based on wheat/barley/by-products. On the day before slaughter, faecal samples were collected and used to determine faecal digestibility of dry matter, ash, organic matter, crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre and non-starch polysaccharides. The faecal samples were also sequenced for the 16S hypervariable region of bacteria (V3/V4) to profile the faecal microbiome. With these data, we calculated the between-animal variation in faecal nutrient digestibility associated with variation in the faecal microbiome, that is the "microbiability". The microbiability values were significantly greater than zero for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crude fibre and non-starch polysaccharides, ranging from 0.58 to 0.93, as well as for crude fat with a value of 0.37, but not significantly different from zero for ash. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we estimated the accuracy of predicting digestibility values of individual pigs based on their faecal  composition. The accuracies of prediction for crude fat and ash digestibility were virtually 0, and for the other nutrients, the accuracies ranged from 0.42 to 0.63. In conclusion, the faecal  composition gave high microbiability values for faecal digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crude fibre and non-starch polysaccharides. The accuracies of prediction are relatively low if the interest is in precisely predicting faecal nutrient digestibility of individual pigs, but are promising from the perspective of ranking animals in a genetic selection context.© 2019 The Authors.

Nineteen phages were isolatedand tested for their ability to infect strains within the ECOR collection and  O157:H7 Δstx. Furthermore, since coliphages have been reported to cross-infect certain  spp., we also evaluated the ability of the nineteen phages to infect a representative  strain from our collection. Based on having distinct (although overlapping in some cases) host ranges, ten phage isolates were selected for genome sequence and morphological characterization. Together, these ten selected phages were shown to infect most of the ECOR library, with 61 of the 72 strains infected by at least one phage from our collection. Genome analysis of the ten phages allowed classification into five previously described genetic subgroups plus one previously underrepresented subgroup.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487283>Opportunistic pathogens and large microbial diversity detected in source-to-distribution drinking water of three remote communities in Northern Australia.</a></h2><p>In the wet-dry tropics of Northern Australia, drinking water in remote communities is mostly sourced from bores accessing groundwater. Many aquifers contain naturally high levels of iron and some are shallow with surface water intrusion in the wet season. Therefore, environmental bacteria such as iron-cycling bacteria promoting biofilm formation in pipes or opportunistic pathogens can occur in these waters. An opportunistic pathogen endemic to northern Australia and Southeast Asia and emerging worldwide is Burkholderia pseudomallei. It causes the frequently fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals. As we know very little about the microbial composition of drinking water in remote communities, this study aimed to provide a first snapshot of the  and occurrence of opportunistic pathogens in bulk water and biofilms from the source and through the distribution system of three remote water supplies with varying iron levels. Using 16s-rRNA gene sequencing, we found that the geochemistry of the groundwater had a substantial impact on the untreated . Different iron-cycling bacteria reflected differences in redox status and nutrients. We cultured and sequenced . pseudomallei from bores with elevated iron and from a multi-species biofilm which also contained iron-oxidizing Gallionella, nitrifying Nitrospira and amoebae. Gallionella are increasingly used in iron-removal filters in water supplies and more research is needed to examine these interactions. Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, . pseudomallei occurred in water with low organic carbon levels and with low heterotrophic microbial growth. No . pseudomallei were detected in treated water; however, abundant DNA of another opportunistic pathogen group, non-tuberculous mycobacteria was recovered from treated parts of one supply. Results from this study will inform future studies to ultimately improve management guidelines for water supplies in the wet-dry tropics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424516>Effects of dietary inulin supplementation on the composition and dynamics of cecal  and growth-related parameters in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Inulin, a prebiotic, is an attractive alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in chickens. Dietary supplementation with inulin can improve growth performance, carcass yield, immune system activity, and serum biochemical parameters in chickens. A few studies investigated the impact of dietary inulin supplementation on chicken intestinal . In this study, we investigated how and why dietary supplementation with 1, 2, and 4% inulin can affect body weight gain, feed intake, food conversion rate, immunological parameters, serum biochemical parameters, and composition and dynamics of the cecal  of Tegel broiler chickens using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (qFISH). We showed that inulin inclusion has a negative effect on growth performance parameters before day 21 and a positive effect subsequently up to day 42. Quantitative FISH data revealed an age-dependent change in the cecal  in the control broilers fed no inulin. Thus, relative abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria decreased from 52.8 to 48.3% of total cells and from 8.7 to 1.4% at days 7 and 42, respectively. However, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria gradually increased from 9.3 to 26.9% of the total cells and from 10.7 to 21.1%, respectively, over the same periods. Inulin inclusion appeared to lower the relative abundances of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Bifidobacterium species at an early bird age, but it subsequently significantly (P < 0.05) increased their relative abundances. Such increases positively correlated with body weight gain of the birds, determined after day 21. Thus, dietary supplementation with inulin together with the addition of L. johnsonii and Bifidobacterium (. gallinarum and . pullorum) cultures at an early age may help overcome its early negative influence on growth performance. We believe that these findings can improve our knowledge on how inulin can change the intestinal  of broiler chickens and help in developing an inulin feeding regime to optimize its beneficial role in chicken development.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620482>Dietary administration of probiotics modulates non-specific immunity and gut  of Nile tilapia () cultured in low input ponds.</a></h2><p>Poor culture conditions in low input ponds make fish highly susceptible to infectious pathogens which lead to diseases and mortalities yet the effects of probiotics on immunity, gut  and microbiological quality of fish in low input ponds are unknown.

Results indicate that hemato-immunological parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC) serum protein, albumin, globulin and lysozyme activity) were significantly higher in fish fed on probiotic treated diets compared to the control ( < 0.05). On the contrary, fish fed on Diet 6 presented significantly similar Hb and globulin values compared to the control (P > 0.05). Additionally, fish fed on probiotic treated diets retained the probiotics in their guts and lower microbial load was realized in their muscle ( < 0.05).

When intestinal homeostasis is perturbed, the function of the gastrointestinal tract and other organ systems, including the brain, can be compromised. The gut  is proposed to contribute to blood-brain barrier disruption and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. While progress is being made, a better understanding of interactions between gut microbes and host cells, and the impact these have on signaling from gut to brain is now required. In this review, we summarise current evidence of the impact gut microbes and their metabolites have on blood-brain barrier integrity and brain function, and the communication networks between the gastrointestinal tract and brain, which they may modulate.

In this study, the effect of Holothuria leucospilota polysaccharide (HLP) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was investigated in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. The results showed that HLP significantly improved glucose intolerance and regulated blood lipid and hormone levels (p < 0.05). Pathological analysis showed that HLP repaired the impairments of the pancreas and colon in diabetic rats. In addition, a high dose of HLP (200 mg/kg) significantly upregulated the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase  (PKB/AKT), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2), and downregulated the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) in diabetic rats (p < 0.05). Furthermore, HLP treatment increased the short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and decreased the opportunistic bacterial pathogen in the feces of diabetic rats. These results demonstrated that HLP has the potential to ameliorate T2DM in GK rats.Copyright © 2019.

Despite its benefits, the risks associated with exposing large numbers of infants to antibiotics, especially long-term effects on health through changes in the , remain unclear. This systematic review summarises studies that have investigated the effect of IAP on the intestinal  of infants.A systematic search in Ovid MEDLINE was used to identify original studies that investigated the effect of IAP on the intestinal  in infants. Studies were excluded if: they included preterm infants, the antibiotic regimen was not specified, antibiotics were used for indications other than prophylaxis, probiotics were given to mothers or infants, or antibiotics were given to infants.We identified six studies, which investigated a total of 272 infants and included 502 stool samples collected up to 3 months of age. In all the studies, IAP was given for group  streptococcus (GBS) colonisation. Infants who were exposed to GBS IAP had a lower bacterial diversity, a lower relative abundance of Actinobacteria, especially , and a larger relative abundance of Proteobacteria in their intestinal  compared with non-exposed infants. Conflicting results were reported for the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.GBS IAP has profound effects on the intestinal  of infants by diminishing beneficial commensals. Such changes during the early-life 'critical window' during which the intestinal  and the immune response develop concurrently may have an important influence on immune development. The potential long-term adverse consequences of this on the health of children warrant further investigation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Recently, caseinolytic protease  (ClpB), a disaggregation chaperon protein of , was identified as a conformational mimetic of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide. Importantly, ClpB was necessary for  to have an anorexigenic effect in mice, suggesting that it may participate in satiety signaling. To explore this further, we determined the short-term (2 h) effects of three macronutrients: protein (bovine serum albumin), carbohydrate (D-fructose) and fat (oleic acid), on the production of ClpB by  and analyzed whether ClpB can stimulate the secretion of the intestinal satiety hormone, peptide YY (PYY). Isocaloric amounts of all three macronutrients added to a continuous culture of  increased ClpB immunoreactivity. However, to increase the levels of ClpB mRNA and ClpB protein in bacteria and supernatants, supplementation with protein was required. A nanomolar concentration of recombinant  ClpB dose-dependently stimulated PYY secretion from the primary cell cultures of rat intestinal mucosa. Total proteins extracted from  but not from ClpB-deficient  strains also tended to increase PYY secretion.

The results related to physico-chemical parameters showed a decrease in total organic carbon (TOC), organic matter (OM), total carbon (TC) along the process. Volatile solids (VS) were also reduced, reaching 36% at 120 days, which is above the limit according to the current legislation. Similarly, metal content was found to be an important variable in the evolution of enzymatic activity, while lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and nickel (Ni) were the most influential. Moreover, heavy metals were found below the limit of type  compost quality or European class 2 at the end of the process, which is suitable for agriculture soil. The odorous impact generated during the hydrolytic stage was reduced to an average value of 4 ou/s. This suggests that, covered stage with the semi-permeable film, could be a viable solution to mitigate odour emissions. The highest temperature was reached at 10 days and it was favoured by semi-permeable film. Temperature promoted the presence of thermophilic bacteria and fungi and indicated an early biodegradation process mediated by microorganisms. Statistical analyses revealed a high correlation of physico-chemical variables with microbial activity. Thus, samples from the first 14 days were highly correlated with enzymatic activities such as β-glucosidase (Ac-βGlu), protease (Ac-Pr), and dehydrogenase (Ac-De), which have usually been involved in the hydrolysis of organic matter.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mycotoxin degradation is not well-known yet. For this, a sensitive, specific, and accurate analytical method is needed to determine mycotoxins in the rumen fluid. This study aims to develop and thoroughly validate an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitative determination in the rumen fluid of some of the most relevant mycotoxins found in maize silage in Western Europe: deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), zearalenone (ZEN), mycophenolic acid (MPA), roquefortine C (ROQ-C) and enniatin  (ENN ), as well as their metabolites deepoxy-deoxynivalenol (DOM-1), α-zearalenol (α-ZEL), β-zearalenol (β-ZEL), zearalanone (ZAN), α-zearalanol (α-ZAL) and β-zearalanol (β-ZAL). As feed is often present in the rumen fluid samples, the potential interaction of feed particles with the mycotoxin extraction and analysis was investigated. Extraction recovery and matrix effects were determined in the rumen fluid with and without maize silage. Differences in those parameters between rumen fluid alone and rumen fluid with maize silage highlight the importance of using matrix-matched calibration curves for the quantification of mycotoxins in rumen fluid samples. A cross-validation of the method with rumen fluid and maize silage demonstrates that this analytical method can be applied in research on rumen fluid samples to investigate the degradation of the reported mycotoxins by rumen  if matrix-matched calibration is performed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343650>Preparation and characterization of selenium enriched-Bifidobacterium longum DD98, and its repairing effects on antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of a novel selenium-enriched Bifidobacterium longum DD98 (Se-. longum DD98) supplement food and its repairing effects on the intestinal ecology of mammals.

Microbiome and colonic transcriptome analysis was performed, pre (day 0) and post antibiotics (day 8) and subsequently into recovery (days 11 and 18).Unique community profiles were evident depending upon the donor, with donor A recipient mice being dominated by Prevotella and Faecalibacterium and donor  recipient mice dominated by Bacteroides and Parabacteroides. Donor A mice underwent a marked destabilization of their  following antibiotic treatment, while donor  mice maintained a more stable profile. Dramatic and overlapping alterations in the host transcriptome were apparent following antibiotic challenge in both groups. Despite this overlap, donor A mice experienced a more significant alteration in gene expression and uniquely showed correlations between host pathways and key microbial genera.Germ-free mice humanized by different donor microbiotas maintain distinct microbiome profiles, which respond in distinct ways to antibiotic challenge and evince host responses that parallel microbiome disequilibrium.

Syntrophic relationships and mutualism at the level of major carbon and energy sources have been documented, however, relatively little is known about metabolic interactions involving micronutrients, such as -vitamins, biosynthetic precursors of essential cofactors in the mammalian host and numerous members of the gut  alike.  genomic reconstruction and prediction of community-wide metabolic phenotypes for eight major -vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12), suggests that a significant fraction of microbial gut communities (>20% by abundance) are represented by auxotrophic species whose viability is strictly dependent on acquiring one or more -vitamins from diet and/or prototrophic microbes  committed salvage pathways. Here, we report the stability of gut  using humanized gnotobiotic mice and  anaerobic fecal culture in the context of extreme variations of dietary -vitamin supply as revealed by phylotype-to-phenotype prediction from 16S rRNA profiling and metabolomic measurements. The observed nearly unaltered relative abundance of auxotrophic species in gut communities in the face of diet or media lacking -vitamins or containing them in great excess (∼30-fold above normal) points to a strong contribution of metabolic cooperation (-vitamin exchange and sharing) to the stability of gut bacterial populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508436>Evaluation of the Antimicrobial and Anti-inflammatory Properties of -DFM (Norum™) in Broiler Chickens Infected With  Enteritidis.</a></h2><p>Restrictions of in-feed antibiotics use in poultry has pushed research toward finding appropriate alternatives such as Direct-Fed Microbials (DFM). In this study, previously tested  isolates (.  and . ) were used to evaluate their therapeutic and prophylactic effects against  serovar Enteritidis (. Enteritidis) in broiler chickens. For this purpose, initial antibacterial activity of -DFM (10 spores/g or 10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis colonization in crop, proventriculus and intestine was investigated using an  digestive model. Furthermore, to evaluate therapeutic and prophylactic effects of -DFM (10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis colonization, altogether 60 ( = 30/group) and 30 ( = 15/group) 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated to either DFM or control group (without -DFM), respectively. Chickens were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 1-day old, and cecal tonsils (CT) and crop were collected 3 and 10 days later during the therapeutic study, whereas they were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 6-day-old, and CT and crop were collected 24 h later from two independent trials during the prophylactic study. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), FITC-d and intestinal IgA levels were reported for both chicken studies, in addition cecal  analysis was performed during the therapeutic study. DFM significantly reduced . Enteritidis concentration in the intestine compartment, and in both proventriculus and intestine compartments as compared to the control when used at 10 spores/g and 10 spores/g, respectively ( < 0.05). DFM significantly reduced FITC-d and IgA as well as SOD and IgA levels ( < 0.05) compared to the control in therapeutic and prophylactic studies, respectively. Interestingly, in the therapeutic study, there were significant differences in bacterial community structure and predicted metabolic pathways between DFM and control. Likewise, phylum  and the genera , and cc_115 were decreased, while the genus  was enriched significantly in the DFM group as compared to the control (MetagenomeSeq,  < 0.05). Thus, the overall results suggest that the -DFM can reduce . Enteritidis colonization and improve the intestinal health in chickens through mechanism(s) that might involve the modulation of gut  and their metabolic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31557668>Application of a novel molecular technique to characterise the effect of settling on microbial community composition of activated sludge.</a></h2><p>Activated sludge (AS) and return activated sludge (RAS) microbial communities from three full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (denoted plant A,  and C) were compared to assess the impact of sludge settling (i.e. gravity thickening in the clarifier) and profile microorganisms responsible for nutrient removal and reactor foaming. The results show that all three plants were dominated with microbes in the phyla of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetae, Acidobacteria and Saccharibacteria. AS and RAS shared above 80% similarity in the microbial community composition, indicating that sludge thickening does not significantly alter the microbial composition. Autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifiers were present in the AS. However, the abundance of autotrophic nitrifiers was significantly lower than that of the heterotrophic nitrifiers. Thus, ammonium removal at these plants was achieved mostly by heterotrophic nitrification. Microbes that can cause foaming were at 3.2% abundance, and this result is well corroborated with occasional aerobic biological reactor foaming. By contrast, these microbes were not abundant (<2.1%) at plant A and C, where aerobic biological reactor foaming has not been reported.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

C. difficile infection (CDI) is largely caused by two virulence factors, TcdA and TcdB. Here, we report a 3.87-Å-resolution crystal structure of TcdB holotoxin that captures a unique conformation of TcdB at endosomal pH. Complementary biophysical studies suggest that the C-terminal combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domain of TcdB is dynamic and can sample open and closed conformations that may facilitate modulation of TcdB activity in response to environmental and cellular cues during intoxication. Furthermore, we report three crystal structures of TcdB-antibody complexes that reveal how antibodies could specifically inhibit the activities of individual TcdB domains.

Although excessive sugar consumption is now robustly associated with an array of adverse health consequences, comparatively little research has thus far addressed its impact on the risk of mental illness. But ample evidence suggests that high-dose sugar intake can perturb numerous metabolic, inflammatory, and neurobiological processes. Many such effects are of particular relevance to the onset and maintenance of depressive illness, among them: systemic inflammation, gut  disruption, perturbed dopaminergic reward signaling, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and the generation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Accordingly, we hypothesize that added dietary sugars carry the potential to increase vulnerability to major depressive disorder, particularly at high levels of consumption. The present paper: (a) summarizes the existing experimental and epidemiological research regarding sugar consumption and depression vulnerability; () examines the impact of sugar ingestion on known depressogenic physiological processes; and (c) outlines the clinical and theoretical implications of the apparent sugar-depression link. We conclude that the extant literature supports the hypothesized depressogenic impact of added dietary sugars, and propose that an improved understanding of the effects of sugar on body and mind may aid in the development of novel therapeutic and preventative measures for depression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Days 22 to 42, BW and ADG were higher (p < .05) in pigs fed T2 diet than CON and T1 diets, and the pigs fed T1 diet had higher BW than CON treatment. Overall, the ADG with the T2 treatment was higher (p < .05) than that with the T1 and CON treatments, and pigs offered T1 treatment had higher (p < .05) ADG than CON treatment. Moreover, F:G ratio were significantly decreased (p < .05) by T2 treatment compared with CON treatment. The faecal Lactobacillus counts were improved, and E. coli counts were reduced (p < .05) in pigs fed T2 diet compared with CON at the end of the experiment. In conclusion, supplementation of 0.1% Bacillus subtilis GCB-13-001 1 × 10  CFU/kg has shown a beneficial effect in improving BW, increase ADG, decrease F:G ratio.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337064>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Types Differ in Markers of Inflammation, Gut Barrier and in Specific Anti-Bacterial Response.</a></h2><p>Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC-IBD), share three major pathogenetic mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-gut dysbiosis, gut barrier failure and immune system dysregulation. While clinical differences among them are well known, the underlying mechanisms are less explored. To gain an insight into the IBD pathogenesis and to find a specific biomarker pattern for each of them, we used protein array, ELISA and flow cytometry to analyze serum biomarkers and specific anti-microbial  and T cell responses to the gut commensals. We found that decrease in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and increase in MMP-14 are the strongest factors discriminating IBD patients from healthy subjects and that PSC-IBD patients have higher levels of Mannan-binding lectin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), CD14 and osteoprotegerin than patients with UC. Moreover, we found that low transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is associated with disease relapse and low osteoprotegerin with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) therapy. Patients with CD have significantly decreased antibody and increased T cell response mainly to genera ,  and .

To assess the degree of variance in these distributions, fecal and soil samples were collected from six distinct housing areas on commercial dairy farms (n = 7) in Washington State. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the  differed between different on-farm locations in feces and soil, and in both cases, the  of dairy calves was often distinct from others (P < 0.05). Thirty-two specific antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were widely distributed on dairies, of which several clinically relevant ARGs (including cfr, cfrB, and optrA) were identified for the first time at U.S. dairies. Overall, ARGs were observed more frequently in feces and soil from dairy calves and heifers than from hospital, fresh, lactation and dry pens. Droplet-digital PCR demonstrated that the absolute abundance of floR varied greatly across housing areas and this gene was enriched the most in calves and heifers. Furthermore, in an extended analysis with 14 dairies, environmental soils in calf pens had the most antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli followed by heifer and hospital pens. All soil E. coli isolates (n = 1,905) are resistant to at least 4 different antibiotics, and the PFGE analysis indicated that florfenicol-resistant E. coli is probably shared across geographically-separated farms. This study identified a discrete but predictable distribution of antibiotic resistance genes and organisms, which is important for designing mitigation for higher risk areas on dairy farms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For the sow portion of the study, 29 sows and litters were used from day 30 of gestation until weaning. Sow treatments consisted of control diet or probiotic diet with . subtilis C-3102 at 500,000 cfu/g of gestation feed and 1,000,000 cfu/g of lactation feed. For the nursery portion of the study, 358 weaned pigs, progeny of sows on study, were used in a 42-d nursery study. Nursery treatments consisted of control diet or probiotic diet with . subtilis C-3102 and prebiotics at 500,000 cfu/g of nursery feed. Treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with sow treatment (control or probiotic diet) as main plot and nursery treatment (control or probiotic diet) as subplot. Performance, fecal consistency by fecal score method, and fecal microbes by isolation and enumeration method were assessed. In lactation, probiotic-fed sows tended (P = 0.057) to have increased feed intake, but it did not improve (P > 0.05) sow or litter performance in lactation. In the nursery, there were no (P > 0.10) interactions or main effects of sow or nursery treatments on overall growth performance. However, pigs born from control-fed sows had greater (P < 0.05) average daily gain, average daily feed intake, and body weight in late nursery than pigs born from probiotic-fed sows. Fecal score evaluation of nursing and nursery pigs indicated no influence (P > 0.05) of sow or nursery treatments on fecal consistency. Fecal microbial analysis revealed a modest modification in fecal microbial population by increasing (P < 0.05) the number of total Bacillus sp. in probiotic-fed sows and nursery pigs. Nursing piglets born from probiotic-fed sows carried over (P < 0.05) this modification in fecal microbial population preweaning. In conclusion, providing a probiotic based on . subtilis C-3102 to sows during gestation and lactation and to progeny after weaning did not elicit noteworthy improvements in performance or fecal consistency, but there was a benefit on sow lactation feed intake. Fecal microbial analysis indicated a maternal-progeny intestinal  relationship with pigs born from probiotic-fed sows displaying similar fecal microbial population as sows. However, pigs born from probiotic-fed sows demonstrated reduced growth rate and feed consumption in late nursery.© The Author(s) 2019.

Intestinal community and metabolic profiles were characterized to establish their potential interactions during liver regeneration.Partial hepatectomy caused fluctuating changes in gut microbiome, which paralleled the biological processes of LR. Briefly, the enhanced cell proliferation occurring within 30-48 h was associated with a decreased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes reflected by a reduction in Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, while an increase in Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, which was indicative of a lean phenotype. Whereas, the  derived from 12-24h and 3-14 day were characterized by elevated F/ ratios, suggesting the differing energy extract behaviors of  during the course of LR. Functional changes of the shifted  revealed by PICRUSt confirmed the pyrosequencing results. The microbiome derived from hour 12 rats showed overpresentation of metabolism-related modules. In contrast, the microbiome derived from day 2 rats was functionally unique in "replication and repair", "amino acid metabolism" and "nucleoid metabolism". Upon examining the dynamic pattern of metabolic response, the specific pathways including glycerophospholipid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were identified to be attributable to the systemic alterations in LR related-metabolism. Moreover, our data demonstrated that several key functional bacteria were strongly related to the perturbations of above pathways.Gut flora may play a central role in manipulating metabolic responses in LR.This article is protected by copyright.

The composition of  varies from host to host, and it changes during the lifetime. It is known that microbiome may be changed because of a diet, bacteriophages and different processes for example, such as inflammation. Like all other areas of medicine, there is a continuous growth in the area of microbiology. Different microbes can reside in all sites of a human body, even in locations that were previously considered as sterile; for example, liver, pancreas, brain and adipose tissue. Presently one of the etiological factors for liver disease is considered to be pro-inflammatory changes in a host's organism. There are lot of supporting data about intestinal dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability and its effect on development of liver disease pointing to the gut-liver axis. The gut-liver axis affects pathogenesis of many liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis , chronic hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gut  has been implicated in the regulation of brain health, emphasizing the gut-brain axis. Also, experiments with mice showed that microorganisms have significant effects on the blood-brain barrier integrity.  can modulate a variety of mechanisms through the gut-liver axis and gut-brain axis.

Modulation of the functions of immune cells in different environments is crucial for managing infection and inferior bone integration via immunomodulation. In this work, sodium butyrate, a fermentation product of gut , was loaded onto 3D porous sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SP) to modulate the immune responses of cells in different environments. Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial effects showed that sodium butyrate-loaded SP exhibited superior antibacterial activity, especially in the samples containing high concentrations of sodium butyrate. Under bacterial stimulation, the phagocytic activity of macrophages increased with an increase in the sodium butyrate concentration via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which favoured bactericidal activity in the implant-associated infection stage. For bacterial elimination, sodium butyrate-containing SP could polarize macrophages to the M2 phenotype and subsequently stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, which is considered beneficial for bone regeneration in the tissue repair stage. In vitro osteogenesis was evaluated and the results demonstrated that treatment with sodium butyrate-containing SP increased the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins. An in vivo rat osteomyelitis model was used to evaluate the protective effect of the SP-loaded with sodium butyrate on bone destruction and osteolysis under infection conditions. To study osteogenesis in vivo, a rat femoral model without infection was used. The results indicated that the SP-B2 group exhibited superior anti-infection capacity and induced new bone formation around the implant in vivo. Treatment with sodium butyrate-containing porous SP modulated the macrophage response under different stimuli, thereby serving as a new approach for the design of smart implant materials with superior antibacterial and bone repair properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384536>Regulation of -GLP1 axis by sennoside A in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sennoside A (SA) is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicines with an activity of irritant laxative, which is often used in the treatment of constipation and obesity. However, its activity remains unknown in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. In this study, the impact of SA on insulin sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved insulin sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut  profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon. A mitochondrial stress was observed in the enterocytes of HFD mice with ATP elevation, structural damage, and complex dysfunction. The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by palmitic acid in the cell culture. The mitochondrial response was inhibited in HFD mice by SA treatment.

This study aimed to evaluate the probiotic features of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 based on adhesive properties for the inhibition of the adhesion of infectious pathogens. The molecular identification of the strain was performed from the sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA with 27FYM and 1492R primers, and its probiotic features, including resistance to gastric juices, resistance to bile salts, and hydrophobicity were evaluated. The potential of Lactobacillus plantarum strain L15 to adhere to human adenocarcinoma intestinal cell line, Caco-2, as well as the auto and co-aggregation and anti-adherence activity against Escherichia coli were investigated. The results demonstrated that this strain has a desirable potential for passing through the low pH of the stomach and entering the intestines.

In this review, we focus on methanogenic Archaea, which rely on hydrogen for their metabolism and growth. On one hand, methanogenic Archaea in the gut are functional associates of the fermentative digestion of dietary fibers, favoring the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids and likely contributing to the weaning reaction during the neonatal window of opportunity.

The fecal  in different groups was compared by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene pyrosequencing.Prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was found. Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the  was higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Distance-based community analysis revealed that the  differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse. Although the findings regarding the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratios across the four comparison groups were not statistically significant, the F/ ratio gradually increased in patients from the acute phase group (0.87), to the disease remission group with relapse (1.06), to the group without relapse (1.28), to the healthy group (1.63).Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis exhibit a substantial alteration in fecal  composition.© 2019 The Authors.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root , including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal  were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/ index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic  to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal  and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including  and  genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of -derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut  and the host  modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling.

However, a systematic study of the intestinal  of this harmful insect pest is still lacking. Here, we comprehensively investigated the larval gut  of  in two field populations from Zigui (developed in orange) and Danjiangkou (developed in mandarin orange). We observed a dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in these bacterial communities, and Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant family throughout the larval stage. However, most of the identified fungal sequences were annotated as being from either Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla. Although there was a difference in the structure of the microbial communities between the two populations, the dynamic change patterns of most of the members of the  were similar across the lifespan of larvae in both populations. The relative abundances of the Acetobacteraceae, Leuconostocaceae, and Lactobacillaceae gut bacteria as well as the Pichiaceae, Sebacinaceae, and Amanitaceae fungi increased throughout development, and these microorganisms stably resided in the larval gut. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the functions of gut bacterial communities were inferred, and there was a significant increase in carbohydrate metabolism across the lifespan of larvae in both groups. Spearman correlation analysis showed that Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Leuconostocaceae displayed a positive correlation with fructose and mannose metabolism, an important pathway of carbohydrate metabolism, highlighting the potential roles of these prevalent microbial communities in host biology.Copyright © 2019 Yao, Ma, Cai, Raza, Bai, Wang, Zhang, Ma and Zhang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31454171>Oral mucositis and microbial colonization in oral cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy: A prospective analysis in a tertiary care dental hospital.</a></h2><p>The ulcerative phase of oral mucositis following radiotherapy/chemotherapy for oral cancer colonizes bacteria, fungi and viruses.

However, the link between obesity-associated  and gastric pathogenesis has not been clarified. We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered  composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced obesity.Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal epithelium-specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 -Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal  was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric  of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial dysbiosis in the stomach. The  changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric  from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance. Moreover, T3 -Lepr cKO mice failed spontaneous obesity, and suppressed decreased abundance of gastric  and occurrence of intestinal metaplasia during HFD feeding similar to db/db mice.Gastric leptin signaling modulates the gastric  community and regulates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A four-strained consortium of commensal bacteria that contains Blautia producta BP can reverse antibiotic-induced susceptibility to VRE infection. Here we show that BP reduces growth of VRE by secreting a lantibiotic that is similar to the nisin-A produced by Lactococcus lactis. Although the growth of VRE is inhibited by BP and L. lactis in vitro, only BP colonizes the colon and reduces VRE density in vivo. In comparison to nisin-A, the BP lantibiotic has reduced activity against intestinal commensal bacteria. In patients at high risk of VRE infection, high abundance of the lantibiotic gene is associated with reduced density of E. faecium. In germ-free mice transplanted with patient-derived faeces, resistance to VRE colonization correlates with abundance of the lantibiotic gene. Lantibiotic-producing commensal strains of the gastrointestinal tract reduce colonization by VRE and represent potential probiotic agents to re-establish resistance to VRE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352203>In vitro and in vivo metabolism of Cistanche tubulosa extract in normal and chronic unpredictable stress-induced depressive rats.</a></h2><p>Cistanche tubulosa, one species of Cistanches Herba, was recently confirmed to have antidepressant efficacy in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) rats by restoring homeostasis of intestinal . In this paper, we aim to explore the metabolic profile of C. tubulosa in normal and CUS induced depressive model rats in vitro and in vivo. Using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, the in vitro gastrointestinal metabolism of Cistanche tubulosa extract (CTE) was evaluated in both normal and CUS rats. At the same time, in vivo metabolism of CTE in normal and depressed rats were also investigated in rat urine and feces. A total of 20 and 26 metabolites were characterized from in vitro and in vivo metabolism in normal and CUS rats, respectively. CTE was metabolized to aglycones and degradation products of phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and iridoid glycosides whether by normal or depressed rat intestinal  in vitro. Phase II metabolites of aglycones and degradation products of PhGs and iridoid glycosides were the main metabolites in rat urine and feces. Additionally, the metabolic capability to generate secondary glycosides and aglycones in depressive rat intestinal  was much weaker than that in normal rat intestinal , which was attributed to the disordered glycoside hydrolases produced by intestinal  in CUS depressed rats.

For this reason, it is generally considered an important threat to the dairy industry. Many microbial, host, and environmental factors can protect against, predispose to, or influence the development of mastitis. The objective of this work was to characterize the milk  of Manchega ewes, and to compare samples from animals with and without a history of mastitis. We analyzed milk samples from 36 ewes belonging to 2 different farms (18 ewes from each farm) using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. We also analyzed several immune compounds to investigate associations of mastitis with 3 main variables: farm; history of mastitis or no mastitis; and parity number. Both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques showed that ewe milk harbored a site-specific complex  and microbiome. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main species driving the difference between farm A (where it was the dominant species) and  (where it was not). In contrast, samples from farm  were characterized by the presence of a wide spectrum of other coagulase-negative staphylococci. Some of these species have already been associated with subclinical intramammary infections in ruminants. Of the 10 immune compounds assayed in this study, 3 were related to a history of mastitis [IL-8, IFN-γ, and IFN-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10)]. Increases in IL-8 concentrations in milk seemed to be a feature of subclinical mastitis in sheep, and in this study, this immune factor was detected only in samples from ewes with some episodes of mastitis and from the group with the highest somatic cell count. We also observed a positive correlation between the samples with the highest somatic cell count and IFN-γ and IP-10 levels. Our results suggest that these 3 compounds could be used as biomarkers for the negative selection of mastitis-prone animals, particularly when somatic cell count is very high.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Various Ct85-cluster sequence types were detected in the fecal samples of several companion and production animal species with remarkably differing prevalences and abundances. The Ct85 sequence type composition of swine closely resembled that of humans. One of the five types (d) shared between humans and swine was not present in any other animals tested, while one sequence type () was found only in human samples.

Seventy-two 21-d-old pigs were fed a plain diet (CTR) or supplemented with sodium butyrate (BUT) or sodium heptanoate (HPT), both at 0.3%. After a week of adaptation, animals were orally challenged at days 8 and 9 with 5.8 · 10 and 6.6 · 10 cfu, respectively, and were euthanised on d 4 and d 8 post-inoculation (PI) ( = 8) to collect blood, digesta and tissue samples and characterise microbial groups, pathogen loads (qPCR), fermentation, ileal histomorphometry and immune markers. Colonic  was analysed by 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing. Supplementing both acid salts did not compensate clinical challenge effects nor performance impairments and neither histomorphometry nor serum biomarkers. Changes in the gastric fermentative activity were registered, BUT reducing lactic acid concentrations (day 8 PI), and with HPT fewer animals presenting detectable concentrations of propionic, butyric and valeric acids. At ileum BUT increased acetic acid concentration (day 8 PI), and both additives reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the colon. Increases in enterobacteria and coliforms counts in ileal digesta (day 4 PI,  < 0.10) and mucosa scrapes ( < 0.05) were registered although  F4 gene copies were unaffected. Regarding changes in the colonic  (day 4 PI), Prevotellaceae and  were promoted with BUT supplementation whereas only minor groups were modified in HPT-treated animals. Summarising, although the pathogen loads or inflammatory mediators remained unresponsive, butyrate and heptanoate showed a significant impact on microbial fermentation along the whole GIT, being able to modify different bacterial groups at the colon. It could be hypothesised that these effects might be mediated by a carry-over effect of the changes observed in gastric fermentation, but possibly also to a better nutrient digestion in the foregut as a result of the reduced colonic SCFA concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623169>Urolithin Metabotypes Can Determine the Modulation of Gut  in Healthy Individuals by Tracking Walnuts Consumption over Three Days.</a></h2><p>Walnuts are rich in polyphenols ellagitannins, modulate gut  (GM), and exert health benefits after long-term consumption.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various colonization conditions such as bacterial concentrations, colonization time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations, colonization time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate, colonization efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial colonization reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting colonization of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

NXT is a fine powder mixture without any herb extraction, and there must be lots of ingredients hard to be absorbed. However, little is known about the correlation between the NXT's cardioprotective effects and gut . Herein, we report the effect of NXT on the development of cardiovascular diseases and clarify the correlation between NXT's cardioprotective effects and gut . In the current study, minipigs were selected and fed with high-fat diet and NXT daily for successive 8 months. During the process, up to 18 biomedical parameters were monthly determined to observe the dynamic changes after NXT treatment. At the end of experimental process, pathological examinations of heart, coronary artery, carotid artery, thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta were conducted by HE staining and 16SrDNA sequencing, and analyzing of gut  were conducted. Our results showed that NXT's effects against cardiovascular diseases were through regulating blood lipid profiles, inhibiting vascular inflammation, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and alleviating myocardial injury, without damages on liver and kidney particularly. Concurrently, we also found that long-term administration of NXT increased the diversity of gut , influenced the microbiome structure and composition stably, and revered the increase of the ratio of the  to  (F/ ratio) in relative abundance. Specifically, our results revealed some key bacterium of , , , and  that were closely involved in NXT's effects. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NXT can inhibit the development of cardiovascular diseases by ameliorating high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders and partly through improving gut .Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Su, Li, Rao, Lin, Zeng, Chen, Yan, Liu and Yao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31375480>Fecal Microbiotas of Indonesian and New Zealand Children Differ in Complexity and Bifidobacterial Taxa during the First Year of Life.</a></h2><p>The biological succession that occurs during the first year of life in the gut of infants in Western countries is broadly predictable in terms of the increasing complexity of the composition of microbiotas. Less information is available about microbiotas in Asian countries, where environmental, nutritional, and cultural influences may differentially affect the composition and development of the microbial community. We compared the fecal microbiotas of Indonesian ( = 204) and New Zealand (NZ) ( = 74) infants 6 to 7 months and 12 months of age. Comparisons were made by analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and derivation of community diversity metrics, relative abundances of bacterial families, enterotypes, and cooccurrence correlation networks. Abundances of  subsp.  and  subsp.  were determined by quantitative PCR. All observations supported the view that the Indonesian and NZ infant microbiotas developed in complexity over time, but the changes were much greater for NZ infants.  subsp.  dominated the microbiotas of Indonesian children, whereas  subsp.  was dominant in NZ children. Network analysis showed that the niche model (in which trophic adaptation results in preferential colonization) of the assemblage of microbiotas was supported in Indonesian infants, whereas the neutral (stochastic) model was supported by the development of the microbiotas of NZ infants. The results of the study show that the development of the fecal  is not the same for infants in all countries, and they point to the necessity of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that control the colonization of the gut in early life. This study addresses the microbiology of a natural ecosystem (the infant bowel) for children in a rural setting in Indonesia and in an urban environment in New Zealand. Analysis of DNA sequences generated from the microbial community () in the feces of the infants during the first year of life showed marked differences in the composition and complexity of the bacterial collections. The differences were most likely due to differences in the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding of infants in the two countries. These kinds of studies are essential for developing concepts of microbial ecology related to the influence of nutrition and environment on the development of the gut  and for determining the long-term effects of microbiological events in early life on human health and well-being.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298050>Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) consumption influences gut  composition.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated if vitamin E consumption affects gut .

Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified the gut  as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of both obesity and the related metabolic disorders. The gut  is known to protect gastrointestinal mucosa permeability and to regulate the fermentation and absorption of dietary polysaccharides, perhaps explaining its importance in the regulation of fat accumulation and the resultant obesity. The proposed mechanisms by which the gut  could contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and the related metabolic diseases include: (a) a high abundance of bacteria that ferment carbohydrates, leading to increased rates of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis, providing an extra source of energy for the host, that is eventually stored as lipids or glucose; () increased intestinal permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), resulting in elevated systemic LPS levels that aggravate low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance; (c) increased activity of the gut endocannabinoid system. Fecal transplantation studies in germ-free mice have provided crucial insights into the potential causative role of the gut  in the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Diet +/- bariatric surgery have been reported to modulate the gut , leading to lean host phenotype body composition. This review aims to report clinical evidence for a link of the gut  with human obesity and obesity-related diseases, to provide molecular insights into these associations, and to address the effect of diet and bariatric surgery on the gut , including colonic , as a potential mechanism for promoting weight loss.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31583399>Unexpectedly Weak Anti- in 2 Group O Pediatric Patients on Parenteral Nutrition and Disease Specific Supplemental Enteral Feeds.</a></h2><p>Anti-A and anti- antibodies are naturally occurring and develop from exposure to intestinal bacteria after age 4 to 6 months.

FK often leads to poor visual prognosis and thus requires accurate diagnosis. Conventional approaches, including clinical diagnoses, smears, and cultures, often fail to provide reliable diagnostic value. Omics approaches, such as those using genomic, metagenomic, and tear proteomic data sources, provide promising features for improving the diagnosis and monitoring the progression of FK. Genomic approaches are based mainly on detecting amplicons of ribosomal RNA genes, and internal transcribed spacers are gradually gaining popularity in clinical practices. A metagenomic approach based on 16S rRNA genes may help monitor the dynamic change of conjunctival  associated with an FK event, whereas that based on shot-gun and 18S rRNA target enrichment sequencing could have the potential to diagnose FK using clinical samples. A tear proteomic approach may provide comprehensive information about ocular surface defense and injury during FK. Representative up- and down-regulated proteins during FK could also be used as biomarkers to determine the clinical course and develop a treatment strategy in different stages of FK.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of probiotics has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial barrier function, which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase  (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut , increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides.

These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31438811>Links between metamorphosis and symbiosis in holometabolous insects.</a></h2><p>Many animals depend on microbial symbionts to provide nutrition, defence or other services. Holometabolous insects, as well as other animals that undergo metamorphosis, face unique constraints on symbiont maintenance. Microbes present in larvae encounter a radical transformation of their habitat and may also need to withstand chemical and immunological challenges. Metamorphosis also provides an opportunity, in that symbiotic associations can be decoupled over development. For example, some holometabolous insects maintain the same symbiont as larvae and adults, but house it in different tissues; in other species, larvae and adults may harbour entirely different types or numbers of microbes, in accordance with shifts in host diet or habitat. Such flexibility may provide an advantage over hemimetabolous insects, in which selection on adult-stage microbial associations may be constrained by its negative effects on immature stages, and vice versa. Additionally, metamorphosis itself can be directly influenced by symbionts. Across disparate insect taxa, microbes protect hosts from pathogen infection, supply nutrients essential for rebuilding the adult body and provide cues regulating pupation. However, microbial associations remain completely unstudied for many families and even orders of Holometabola, and future research will undoubtedly reveal more links between metamorphosis and , two widespread features of animal life.

Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P. anaerobius) is an anaerobic bacterium selectively enriched in the faecal and mucosal  from patients with CRC, but its causative role and molecular mechanism in promoting tumorigenesis remain unestablished. We demonstrate that P. anaerobius adheres to the CRC mucosa and accelerates CRC development in Apc mice. In vitro assays and transmission electron microscopy revealed that P. anaerobius selectively adheres to CRC cell lines (HT-29 and Caco-2) compared to normal colonic epithelial cells (NCM460). We identified a P. anaerobius surface protein, putative cell wall binding repeat 2 (PCWBR2), which directly interacts with colonic cell lines via α/β integrin, a receptor frequently overexpressed in human CRC tumours and cell lines. Interaction between PCWBR2 and integrin α/β induces the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in CRC cells via phospho-focal adhesion kinase, leading to increased cell proliferation and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) activation. NF-κ in turn triggers a pro-inflammatory response as indicated by increased levels of cytokines, such as interleukin-10 and interferon-γ in the tumours of P. anaerobius-treated Apc mice. Analyses of tumour-infiltrating immune cell populations in P. anaerobius-treated Apc mice revealed significant expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumour-associated macrophages and granulocytic tumour-associated neutrophils, which are associated with chronic inflammation and tumour progression. Blockade of integrin α/β by RGDS peptide, small interfering RNA or antibodies all impair P. anaerobius attachment and abolish P. anaerobius-mediated oncogenic response in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, we show that P. anaerobius drives CRC via a PCWBR2-integrin α/β-PI3K-Akt-NF-κ signalling axis and identify the PCWBR2-integrin α/β axis as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31405010>Screening of the High-Rhizosphere Competent ' Culturable Endophyte  Allows the Recovery of Multifaceted and Versatile Biocontrol Agents.</a></h2><p>Halophyte , an evergreen shrub inhabiting the Mediterranean region, has well-documented phytoremediation potential for metal removal from polluted sites. It is also considered to be a medicinal halophyte with potent activity against plant pathogens. Therefore,  may be a suitable candidate for isolating endophytic  members that provide plant growth promotion (PGP) and resistance to abiotic stresses. Selected for biocontrol abilities, these endophytes may represent multifaceted and versatile biocontrol agents, combining pathogen biocontrol in addition to PGP and plant protection against abiotic stresses. In this study 117 root culturable bacterial endophytes, including Gram-positive ( and ), Gram-negative (, , , , ,  and ) and actinomycete  genera have been recovered from . The collection exhibited high levels of biocontrol abilities against bacterial ( MAT2 and  MAT3) and fungal ( XSZJY-1,  MAT1 and  f. sp. radicis lycopersici FORL) pathogens. Several bacteria also showed PGP capacity and resistance to antibiotics and metals. A highly promising candidate  LMRE 36 with high PGP, biocontrol, metal and antibiotic, resistance was subsequently tested in planta (potato and olive trees) for biocontrol of a collection of 14 highly damaging  species. LMRE 36 proved very effective against the collection in both species and against an emerging  sp. threatening olive trees culture in nurseries. These findings provide a demonstration of our pyramiding strategy. Our strategy was effective in combining desirable traits in biocontrol agents towards broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens and protection of crops from abiotic stresses. Stacking multiple desirable traits into a single biocontrol agent is achieved by first, careful selection of a host for endophytic  recovery; second, stringent in vitro selection of candidates from the collection; and third, application of the selected biocontrol agents in planta experiments. That pyramiding strategy could be successfully used to mitigate effects of diverse biotic and abiotic stresses on plant growth and productivity. It is anticipated that the strategy will provide a new generation of biocontrol agents by targeting the  of plants in hostile environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31358825>Enterotype-based Analysis of Gut  along the Conventional Adenoma-Carcinoma Colorectal Cancer Pathway.</a></h2><p>The dysbiosis of human gut  is strongly associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The dysbiotic features of the transition from advanced polyp to early-stage CRC are largely unknown. We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing and enterotype-based gut  analysis study. In addition to Bacteroides- and Prevotella-dominated enterotypes, we identified an Escherichia-dominated enterotype. We found that the dysbiotic features of CRC were dissimilar in overall samples and especially Escherichia-dominated enterotype. Besides a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, Enterococcus, and Aeromonas in all CRC faecal , we found that the most notable characteristic of CRC faecal  was a decreased abundance of potential beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria. Notably, Oscillospira was depleted in the transition from advanced adenoma to stage 0 CRC, whereas Haemophilus was depleted in the transition from stage 0 to early-stage CRC. We further identified 7 different CAGs by analysing bacterial clusters. The abundance of  in cluster 3 significantly increased in the CRC group, whereas that of cluster 5 decreased.

Stool and plasma samples from 114 subjects, including in SLE ( = 27), SjS ( = 23), PAPs ( = 11) and undifferentiated connective tissue (UCTD,  = 26) patients, and geographically-matched healthy controls (HCs,  = 27), were collected for microbiome (16s rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolome (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry) analysis to identify shared characteristics across diseases. Out of 130 identified microbial genera, a subset of 29 bacteria was able to differentiate study groups (area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) = 0.730 ± 0.025). A fair classification was obtained with a subset of 41 metabolic peaks out of 254 (AUROC = 0.748 ± 0.021). In both models, HCs were well separated from SADs, while UCTD largely overlapped with the other diseases. In all of the SADs pro-tolerogenic bacteria were reduced, while pathobiont genera were increased. Metabolic alterations included two clusters comprised of: (a) members of the acylcarnitine family, positively correlating with a Prevotella-enriched cluster and negatively correlating with a butyrate-producing bacteria-enriched cluster; and () phospholipids, negatively correlating with butyrate-producing bacteria.

So far, the beneficial properties of potato fiber have been poorly characterized. This study investigated the effect of FiberBind 400, a commercial potato fiber product, on survival of probiotic Lactobacillus strains at simulated gastric conditions and on the composition and metabolic activity of the gut , using the TIM-2 colon model. Resistant starch and native starch from potato were used as reference substrates. FiberBind 400 had an ability to improve survival of the four tested strains, Lactobacillus fermentum PCC®, L. rhamnosus LGG®, L. reuteri RC-14® and L. paracasei F-19® in a strain-dependent way. The highest effect was observed for L. fermentum PCC® and L. rhamnosus LGG®. The effect of starches on bacterial survival was insignificant. Composition of the fecal  in TIM-2 fermentations was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon. Fermentation of FiberBind 400 resulted in more diverse microbial communities compared to starches. Changes in microbial abundances specifically mediated by FiberBind 400, included increases in the genera Lachnospira, Butyrivibrio, Mogibacterium, Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Desulfovibrio, and the species . ovatus, as well as decreases in Ruminococcus torques and unassigned Ruminococcus spp. Shifts in other bacterial populations, such as increased abundances of Oscillospira, Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, Citrobacter, along with reduction of Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were not significantly different between the substrates. Cumulative production of individual short-chain fatty acids was similar between potato fiber and starches. The study demonstrated that FiberBind 400 had a potential to protect probiotic Lactobacillus strains during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and selectively modulate the gut bacterial populations. This knowledge can support application of potato fiber as a functional food ingredient with added biological benefits.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Given their commitment to antimicrobial mucosal immunity, we investigated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and Vα7.2+CD161- T-cell frequency/function and their possible associations with MT and gut dysbiosis, in chronic HIV and/or HCV infections. We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For Vα7.2+CD161++ and Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and  stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNFα/IFNγ. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool  composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating Vα7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells ( = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin ( = 0.004) and granzyme  ( = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon  stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, Vα7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+:  = 0.002; PD-1+:  = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+:  < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to  stimulation.

Thereby, it modulates immune responses against tumors, microbial and viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Recently, the production of αGalCer by Bacteroidetes from the human gut microbiome was elucidated. Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, we screened murine intestinal tracts to identify and quantify αGalCers, and we investigated the αGalCer response to different dietary and physiologic conditions. In both the caecum and the colon of mice, we found 1-15 pmol αGalCer/mg protein; in contrast, mice lacking  (germ-free mice) and fed identical diet did not harbor αGalCer. The identified αGalCer contained a β(R)-hydroxylated hexadecanoyl chain N-linked to C18-sphinganine, which differed from what has been reported with Bacteroides fragilis. (Unlike β-anomeric structures, but similar to αGalCers from . fragilis, the synthetic form of the murine αGalCer induced iNKT cell activation in vitro. Last, we observed a decrease in αGalCer production in mice exposed to conditions that alter the composition of the gut , including Western type diet, colitis, and influenza A virus infection. Collectively, this study suggests that αGalCer is produced by commensals in the mouse intestine and reveals that stressful conditions causing dysbiosis alter its synthesis. The consequences of this altered production on iNKT cell-mediated local and systemic immune responses are worthy of future studies.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574574>Adzuki Bean Water Extract Attenuates Obesity by Modulating M2/M1 Macrophage Polarization and Gut  Composition.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a chronic condition resulting in excessive fat accumulation in adipose tissues.

AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing M2-polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut .The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut  composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The gut  can influence arsenic toxic effects.We aimed to explore whether gut  play a role in arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling inhibition and the subsequent lipid and cholesterol dysbiosis.Conventional and antibiotic-treated mice (AB-treated mice) were exposed to  and  arsenic for 2 wk. Hepatic mRNAs were extracted and sequenced. The expression levels of genes associated with LXR/RXR signaling were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and serum and hepatic cholesterol levels were measured. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics were used to examine serum and hepatic lipids.Pathway analysis indicated that arsenic exposure differentially influenced the hepatic signaling pathways in conventional and AB-treated mice. The expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (), and cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (), as well as cholesterol efflux genes, including ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 5/8 () and cluster of differentiation 36 (), was lower in arsenic-exposed conventional mice but not in AB-treated mice. Similarly, under arsenic exposure, the hepatic expression of scavenger receptor class  member 1 (), which is involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), was lower in conventional mice, but was higher in AB-treated animals compared with controls. Correspondingly, arsenic exposure exerted opposite effects on the serum cholesterol levels in conventional and AB-treated mice, i.e., higher serum cholesterol levels in conventional mice but lower levels in AB-treated mice than in respective controls. Serum lipid levels, especially triglyceride (TG) levels, were higher in conventional mice exposed to  arsenic, while arsenic exposure did not significantly affect the serum lipids in AB-treated mice. Liver lipid patterns were also differentially perturbed in a -dependent manner.Our results suggest that in mice, the gut  may be a critical factor regulating arsenic-induced LXR/RXR signaling perturbation, suggesting that modulation of the gut  might be an intervention strategy to reduce the toxic effects of arsenic on lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4415.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443482>The Interplay between Maternal and Post-Weaning High-Fat Diet and Gut  in the Developmental Programming of Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Excessive intake of saturated fat has been linked to hypertension. Gut  and their metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are known to be involved in the development of hypertension. We examined whether maternal and post-weaning high-fat (HF) diet-induced hypertension in adult male offspring is related to alterations of gut , mediation of SCFAs and their receptors, and downregulation of nutrient-sensing signals. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received either a normal diet (ND) or HF diet (D12331, Research Diets) during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were put on either the ND or HF diet from weaning to 16 weeks of age, and designated to four groups (maternal diet/post-weaning diet;  = 8/group): ND/ND, HF/ND, ND/HF, and HF/HF. Rats were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age. Combined HF/HF diets induced elevated blood pressure (BP) and increased body weight and kidney damage in male adult offspring. The rise in BP is related to a downregulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) pathway. Additionally, HF/HF diets decreased fecal concentrations of propionate and butyrate and decreased G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41), but increased olfactory receptor 78 (Oflr78) expression. Maternal HF diet has differential programming effects on the offspring's  at 3 and 16 weeks of age. Combined HF/HF diet induced BP elevation was associated with an increased  to  ratio, increased abundance of genus  and phylum , and reduced abundance in genus . Maternal gut -targeted dietary interventions might be reprogramming strategies to protect against programmed hypertension in children and their mothers on consumption of a fat-rich diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523411>The effects of supplementation of  and  spores on the intestinal microflora and growth performance in rat.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microflora has an important role in the health status. Since probiotics can balance the intestinal microflora, they have a lot of health beneficial effects. So the appropriate selection of probiotics can cause health-promoting effects. In this study, the combined effects of  and  on the intestinal microflora and growth performance in rats were investigated.80 male rats were divided into the treatment (receiving 5×10 spores/ml of  and 5×10 spores/ml of  for three weeks in daily water) and control (tap water without probiotics) groups. The total aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), coliforms and spores were weekly counted in the fecal samples. Additionally, the water and feed consumption, the weight gain and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) were calculated for each week.The probiotics significantly increased the total aerobic, LAB and spore counts and caused significant reduction in the anaerobe and coliform counts. Following three weeks of probiotic administration, the number of anaerobic bacteria, and coliforms were reduced by up to 0.7 and 1.18 log and the number of aerobic bacteria, LAB and spores were increased by 1.29, 1.15 and 7.2 log respectively.

Endospores allow environmental persistence, dissemination and for pathogens, are also infection vehicles. In both the model Bacillus subtilis, an aerobic organism, and in the intestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile, an obligate anaerobe, sporulation mobilizes hundreds of genes. Their expression is coordinated between the forespore and the mother cell, the two cells that participate in the process, and is kept in close register with the course of morphogenesis. The evolutionary mechanisms by which sporulation emerged and evolved in these two species, and more broadly across Firmicutes, remain largely unknown. Here, we trace the origin and evolution of sporulation using the genes known to be involved in the process in . subtilis and C. difficile, and estimating their gain-loss dynamics in a comprehensive bacterial macro-evolutionary framework. We show that sporulation evolution was driven by two major gene gain events, the first at the base of the Firmicutes and the second at the base of the . subtilis group and within the Peptostreptococcaceae family, which includes C. difficile. We also show that early and late sporulation regulons have been co-evolving and that sporulation genes entail greater innovation in . subtilis with many Bacilli-lineage restricted genes. In contrast, C. difficile more often recruits new sporulation genes by horizontal gene transfer, which reflects both its highly mobile genome, the complexity of the gut  and an adjustment of sporulation to the gut ecosystem.© The Author(s) 2019.

Macroalga-derived oligosaccharides are candidate prebiotics, and herein, we determined the effects of  sp.-derived alginate oligosaccharide (AlgOS) on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon (). Using a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, we investigated the  harbored in the intestinal content and mucus of the fish offered feeds supplemented with 0.5 and 2.5% AlgOS. We found that the prebiotic shifts the intestinal  profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with 2.5% AlgOS while with 0.5% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity analysis indicated the significant differences between control and prebiotic-fed groups. The low supplementation level of AlgOS facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria (including , , ), and Spirochaetes () in the content or mucus of the fish, and few of these bacteria (, ) have genes associated with butyrate production. The results indicate that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal  of Atlantic salmon. These findings can generate further interest in the potential of macroalgae-derived oligosaccharides for food and feed applications.Copyright © 2019 Gupta, Lokesh, Abdelhafiz, Siriyappagouder, Pierre, Sørensen, Fernandes and Kiron.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470288>Gnotobiotic mice inoculated with Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes, deteriorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease severity by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a serious liver disorder and characterized by the hepatic accumulation of excess fatty acids. Clinical studies and animal models have shown a shift of gut  from bacteroidetes to firmicutes in NAFLD patients and a diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that these 2 groups of bacteria may have differential effects on lipid metabolism in the liver, which further contributed to pathogenesis of NAFLD. To elucidate these effects, we inoculated two species of Bacteroidetes (-group) or five species of Firmicutes (F-group) which were isolated from healthy individuals into germ-free mice. We found that the F-group induced elevated body weight, liver weight, and hepatic steatosis compared to the -group under high-fat diet (HFD) conditions. The mRNA expression level of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) was elevated in the F-group compared to that in the -group. Increased mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) were also seen under HFD conditions in the F-group compared to that in the -group. In addition, the expression level of miR802-5p was only elevated in the F-group under HFD conditions. Taken together, our results suggested that these specific species of Firmicutes may induce more hepatic steatosis by modulating fatty acid influx and lipogenesis compared to those of Bacteroidetes. These results may provide more understanding of the effects of gut  on NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The susceptibility to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes, conditions that add to the cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), was associated with the ancestral genetic composition and gut . Studies explicitly testing associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbes are growing. We here examined whether the host genetic ancestry was associated with gut  composition, and distinguished the effects of genetic ancestry and non-genetic factors on human cardiometabolic health. We performed a cross-sectional study with 441 community-dwelling Colombian mestizos from five cities spanning the Andes, Pacific, and Caribbean coasts. We characterized the host genetic ancestry by genotyping 40 ancestry informative markers; characterized gut  through 16S rRNA gene sequencing; assessed diet intake, physical activity, cigarette, and medicament consumption; and measured cardiometabolic outcomes that allowed calculating a CMS risk scale. On average, each individual of our cohort was 67 ± 6% European, 21 ± 5% Native American and 12 ± 5% African. Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models showed that individuals with higher Native American and African ancestries had increased fasting insulin, body mass index and CMS risk, as assessed by the CMS risk scale. Furthermore, we identified 21 OTUs associated to the host genetic ancestry and 20 to cardiometabolic health. While we highlight novel associations between genetic ancestry and gut , we found that the effect of intestinal microbes was more likely to explain the variance in CMS risk scale than the contributions of European, Native American and African genetic backgrounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31527267>Immunization against poly--acetylglucosamine reduces neutrophil activation and GVHD while sparing microbial diversity.</a></h2><p>Microbial invasion into the intestinal mucosa after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) triggers neutrophil activation and requires antibiotic interventions to prevent sepsis. However, antibiotics lead to a loss of  diversity, which is connected to a higher incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Antimicrobial therapies that eliminate invading bacteria and reduce neutrophil-mediated damage without reducing the diversity of the  are therefore highly desirable. A potential solution would be the use of antimicrobial antibodies that target invading pathogens, ultimately leading to their elimination by innate immune cells. In a mouse model of aGVHD, we investigated the potency of active and passive immunization against the conserved microbial surface polysaccharide poly--acetylglucosamine (PNAG) that is expressed on numerous pathogens. Treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to PNAG (anti-PNAG) or vaccination against PNAG reduced aGVHD-related mortality. Anti-PNAG treatment did not change the intestinal microbial diversity as determined by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Anti-PNAG treatment reduced myeloperoxidase activation and proliferation of neutrophil granulocytes (neutrophils) in the ileum of mice developing GVHD. In vitro, anti-PNAG treatment showed high antimicrobial activity. The functional role of neutrophils was confirmed by using neutrophil-deficient     mice that had no survival advantage under anti-PNAG treatment. In summary, the control of invading bacteria by anti-PNAG treatment could be a novel approach to reduce the uncontrolled neutrophil activation that promotes early GVHD and opens a new avenue to interfere with aGVHD without affecting commensal intestinal microbial diversity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31291601>Binary interactions between the yeast Candida albicans and two gut-associated Bacteroides species.</a></h2><p>The yeast Candida albicans forms part of the natural gut  of healthy human individuals and its interactions with other microbial symbionts can impact host well-being. We therefore studied binary interactions between potentially pathogenic representatives of the gut-associated bacterial genus Bacteroides and C. albicans using anaerobic bacteria/yeast co-cultures prepared with a quarter-strength brain heart infusion (¼ BHI; 9.25 g/l) broth. We found that, except for minor changes observed in the cell numbers of one out of four C. albicans strains tested, yeast growth was largely unaffected by the presence of the bacteria. In contrast, growth of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 and Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482 was significantly enhanced in the presence of C. albicans. Supplementation of Bacteroides monocultures with dead Candida albicans CAB 392 cells, containing intact outer cell wall mannan layers, resulted in increased bacterial concentrations. Subsequent culturing of the Bacteroides strains in a liquid minimal medium supplemented with candidal mannan demonstrated that . vulgatus ATCC 8482, unlike . fragilis NCTC 9343, utilized the mannan. Furthermore, by reducing the initial oxygen levels in monocultures prepared with ¼ BHI broth, bacterial numbers were significantly enhanced compared to in monocultures prepared with ¼ BHI broth not supplemented with the reducing agent l-cysteine hydrochloride. This suggests that C. albicans can stimulate Bacteroides growth via aerobic respiration and/or antioxidant production. The cell-free supernatant of 24-h-old C. albicans CAB 392 monocultures was also found to increase Bacteroides growth and chloramphenicol sensitivity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative rates of quality deterioration and  growth in six product systems (tomatoes, apples, fresh-cut cantaloupe, fresh-cut lettuce, baby spinach, and commercially processed turkey slices) under various conditions of refrigeration temperatures, atmospheres, and quality. Cantaloupe and spinach leaves supported >1 log CFU/g growth of  before product spoilage at both 4 and 9°C.

In this study, we aimed at characterizing the gut  composition in the three different stages of hepatitis  virus-induced chronic liver disease patients and healthy individuals. Faecal samples and clinical data were collected from HBVCLD patients and healthy individuals. The 16S rDNA gene amplification products were sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis including alpha diversity and PICRUSt was performed. A total of 19 phyla, 43 classes, 72 orders, 126 families and 225 genera were detected. The beta-diversity showed a separate clustering of healthy controls and HBVCLD patients covering chronic hepatitis (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and gut  of healthy controls was more consistent, whereas those of CHB, LC and HCC varied substantially. The abundance of Firmicutes was lower, and Bacteroidetes was higher in patients with CHB, LC and HCC than in healthy controls. Predicted metagenomics of microbial communities showed an increase in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism-related genes and lipid metabolism-related genes in HBVCLD than in healthy individuals.

Many aquatic reptiles live in habitats with high levels of opportunistic microbial pathogens, yet little is known about their immune system. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is vital for protection against ingested pathogens and maintenance of normal gut . In mammals, gut mucosal immunity is well-characterized and mucosal surfaces are coated in protective antibodies. However, reptiles lack lymph nodes and Peyer's patches, which are the major sites of mammalian  cell responses. The presence or distribution of mucosal  cells in reptiles is unknown. In this study, we first set out to determine if  cells could be detected in intestinal tissues of red-eared slider turtles, Trachemys scripta. Using whole-mount immunochemistry and a primary antibody to turtle antibody light chains, we identified widely distributed  cell aggregates within the small intestine of hatchling turtles. These aggregates appeared similar to isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) in mammals and the frequency was much higher in distal intestinal sections than in proximal sections. To determine if these structures were inducible in the presence of microbes, we introduced an enteric Salmonella species through oral gavage. Analysis of intestinal tissues revealed that hatchlings exposed to Salmonella exhibited significantly more of these aggregates when compared with those that did not receive bacteria. These studies provide the first evidence for  cell-containing ILF-like structures in reptiles and provide novel information about gut immunity in nonmammalian vertebrates that could have important implications for ecological interactions with pathogens.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31422731>Brown planthopper honeydew-associated symbiotic microbes elicit momilactones in rice.</a></h2><p>Plants use many natural products to counter pests and diseases in nature.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the 2,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage disease, cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous bowel history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of inflammatory bowel disease, 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable bowel syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; (2) no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic diseases such as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, etc., no autoimmune disease, not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant disease; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious diseases (hepatitis  virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; (2) 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.

The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes by a FACSCount automated instrument. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Correlations among intestinal flora, inflammatory factor levels, and CD4+ T lymphocyte values were evaluated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the AIDS group were higher than those in the control group, while the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes was lower. The amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the AIDS group were significantly lower than those in control group, while the amounts of E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium were much higher. The amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were negatively correlated with the content of TNF-α and IL-6 and the CD4+ T lymphocyte count, while those correlations were reversed for E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. faecium.The intestinal  of AIDS/HIV patients were disordered, and there was a correlation between the amount of intestinal flora and the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the levels of TNF-α and IL-6.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31521198>Commensal-derived metabolites govern Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis in host intestine.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that the commensal microbes act as a barrier against invading pathogens and enteric infections are the consequences of multi-layered interactions among commensals, pathogens, and the host intestinal tissue. However, it remains unclear how perturbations of the gut  compromise host infection resistance, especially through changes at species and metabolite levels.Here, we illustrate how Bacteroides vulgatus, a dominant species of the Bacteroidetes phylum in mouse intestine, suppresses infection by Vibrio cholerae, an important human pathogen. Clindamycin (CL) is an antibiotic that selectively kills anaerobic bacteria, and accordingly Bacteroidetes are completely eradicated from CL-treated mouse intestines. The Bacteroidetes-depleted adult mice developed severe cholera-like symptoms, when infected with V. cholerae. Germ-free mice mono-associated with . vulgatus became resistant to V. cholerae infection. Levels of V. cholerae growth-inhibitory metabolites including short-chain fatty acids plummeted upon CL treatment, while levels of compounds that enhance V. cholerae proliferation were elevated. Furthermore, the intestinal colonization process of V. cholerae was well-simulated in CL-treated adult mice.Overall, we provide insights into how a symbiotic microbe and a pathogenic intruder interact inside host intestine. We identified . vulgatus as an indigenous microbial species that can suppress intestinal infection. Our results also demonstrate that commensal-derived metabolites are a critical determinant for host resistance against V. cholerae infection, and that CL pretreatment of adult mice generates a simple yet useful model of cholera infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462512> cell superantigens in the human intestinal .</a></h2><p>IgA is prominently secreted at mucosal surfaces and coats a fraction of the commensal , a process that is critical for intestinal homeostasis. However, the mechanisms of IgA induction and the molecular targets of these antibodies remain poorly understood, particularly in humans. Here, we demonstrate that  from a subset of human individuals encode two protein "superantigens" expressed on the surface of commensal bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae such as  that bind IgA variable regions and stimulate potent IgA responses in mice. These superantigens stimulate  cells expressing human VH3 or murine VH5/6/7 variable regions and subsequently bind their antibodies, allowing these microbial organisms to become highly coated with IgA in vivo. These findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for commensal superantigens in host- interactions. Furthermore, as superantigen-expressing strains show an uneven distribution across human populations, they should be systematically considered in studies evaluating human  cell responses and  during homeostasis and disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Frequent recurrences have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high healthcare costs, and lower quality of life. In this review, we compare the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent rCDI. We performed a systematic review of the English literature, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated rCDI as an outcome. Studies were included irrespective of patient demographics, disease severity, type of intervention, comparator used, or time-point of outcome evaluation. We performed a comprehensive literature search with the assistance of a research librarian. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Our search yielded 38 RCTs (8,102 participants). Nineteen RCTs (3,743 subjects) evaluated antibiotics, eight fecal  transplantation (FMT) (582 subjects), three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2,805 subjects), and eight probiotics, prebiotics, or non-antibiotic polymers (972 subjects). The antibiotic and FMT therapies that demonstrated efficacy in rCDI prevention included: fidaxomicin (when compared to a ten-day vancomycin course) and FMT administered by nasogastric tube (when compared to a fourteen-day vancomycin course and a fourteen-day vancomycin course plus bowel lavage). Actoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin A; CDA1) plus bezlotoxumab (MAb against C. difficile toxin ; CDB1) in combination or bezlotoxumab alone appeared to be more effective in preventing rCDI compared to actoxumab alone. Of the prebiotics, probiotics, and nonantibiotic polymers, oligofructose, Saccharomyces boulardii, and the nontoxigenic C. difficile strain M3 were the most efficacious for rCDI prevention. Thirty-eight RCTs (>8,000 participants) evaluating treatment modalities for CDI were examined for efficacy in prevention of rCDI. Several CDI-specific antibiotics, FMT modalities, monoclonal antibodies, and various prebiotics and probiotics demonstrated a reduction in risk of rCDI with the greatest risk reduction observed with FMT and monoclonal antibody therapy. It is notable that the comparators in these studies were very different from one another and the relative risk reduction of rCDI may not be directly comparable from one study to the next.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, we isolated a novel probiotic strain candidate from fecal samples from healthy infants and characterized it as  strain ZY-312. Functional characterization reveals that ZY-312 inhibited  invasion, restoring epithelial barrier dysfunction, decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and reducing dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis). Furthermore, the presence of ZY-132 was sufficient to hinder the adverse reaction seen with  in a -induced NEC model. Taking the results together, our study demonstrated the utility of ZY-312 as a promising probiotic agent for the prevention of NEC.Copyright © 2019 Fan et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332740>Defining microbial biomarkers for risk of preterm labor.</a></h2><p>Preterm birth remains the main contributor to early childhood mortality.

Alterations in the vaginal microbial community structure might represent a risk factor for preterm birth.

While no differences in microbial diversity measures appeared associated with the spontaneous preterm and full-term outcomes, the microbial composition was distinct for these groups. Differential abundance analysis showed Lactobacillus species to be associated with full-term birth whereas an unknown Prevotella species was more abundant in the spontaneous preterm group. Although we studied a very miscegenated population from Brazil, our findings were similar to evidence pointed by other studies in different countries. The role of Lactobacillus species as a protector in the vaginal microbiome is demonstrated to be also a protector of spontaneous preterm outcome whereas the presence of pathogenic species, such as Prevotella spp., is endorsed as a factor of risk for spontaneous preterm delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519210>Specific gut microbiome members are associated with distinct immune markers in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence reveals the importance of the microbiome in health and disease and inseparable host-microbial dependencies. Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., a replacement of the cellular components of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut  composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g., at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly.In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) high concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and  cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution, and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286804>New insights into the interplay between autophagy, gut  and inflammatory responses in IBD.</a></h2><p>One of the most significant challenges of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research is to understand how alterations in the symbiotic relationship between the genetic composition of the host and the intestinal , under impact of specific environmental factors, lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria.

Bacterial metabolism is an important regulator of susceptibility in vitro and likely plays a large role within the host. We applied a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to link antibiotic-induced taxonomic and transcriptional responses within the murine microbiome. We found that antibiotics significantly alter the expression of key metabolic pathways at the whole-community and single-species levels. Notably, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which blooms in response to amoxicillin, upregulated polysaccharide utilization. In vitro, we found that the sensitivity of this bacterium to amoxicillin was elevated by glucose and reduced by polysaccharides. Accordingly, we observed that dietary composition affected the abundance and expansion of . thetaiotaomicron, as well as the extent of microbiome disruption with amoxicillin.

Freshwater environment can thus become reservoirs where an antibiotic impact microorganisms, and is an important public health concern. Degradation and dilution processes are fundamental for predicting the actual risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination from freshwater reservoirs. This study reviews major approaches for detecting and quantifying antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) and genes (ARGs) in freshwater and their prevalence in these environments. Finally, the role of dilution, degradation, transmission and the persistence and fate of ARB/ARG in these environments are also reviewed. Culture-based single strain approaches and molecular techniques that include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and metagenomics are techniques for quantifying ARB and ARGs in freshwater environments. The level of ARBs is extremely high in most of the river systems (up to 98% of the total detected bacteria), followed by lakes (up to 77% of the total detected bacteria), compared to dam, pond, and spring (<1%). Of most concern is the occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which cause highly epidemic infections. Dilution and natural degradation do not completely eradicate ARBs and ARGs in the freshwater environment. Even if the ARBs in freshwater are effectively inactivated by sunlight, their ARG-containing DNA can still be intact and capable of transferring resistance to non-resistant strains. Antibiotic resistance persists and is preserved in freshwater bodies polluted with high concentrations of antibiotics. Direct transmission of indigenous freshwater ARBs to humans as well as their transitory insertion in the  can occur. These findings are disturbing especially for people that rely on freshwater resources for drinking, crop irrigation, and food in form of fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved metabolic health is associated with a relatively high  gene content and increased microbial diversity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the gut  and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut  of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid levels. Transplantation of fecal  from women with PCOS or . vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid metabolism, reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS.

Here we hypothesize that the ghost ant, Tapinoma melanocephalum, living in areas that have been invaded by the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, displays behavioral differences to interspecific competition that are reflected in both its trophic position and symbiotic . We demonstrate that T. melanocephalum workers from S. invicta invaded areas are less aggressive towards workers of S. invicta than those inhabiting non-invaded areas. Nitrogen isotope analyses reveal that colonies of T. melanocephalum have protein-rich diets in S. invicta invaded areas compared with the carbohydrate-rich diets of colonies living in non-invaded areas. Analysis of  isolated from gut tissue shows that T. melanocephalum workers from S. invicta invaded areas also have different bacterial communities, including a higher abundance of Wolbachia that may play a role in vitamin  provisioning. In contrast, the  of workers of T. melanocephalum from S. invicta-free areas are dominated by bacteria from the orders Bacillales, Lactobacillales and Enterobacteriales that may be involved in sugar metabolism. We further demonstrate experimentally that the composition and structure of the bacterial symbiont communities as well as the prevalence of vitamin  in T. melanocephalum workers from S. invicta invaded and non-invaded areas can be altered if T. melanocephalum workers are supplied with either protein-rich or carbohydrate-rich food.

Here, we review how and why this developmental strategy has evolved. While there are many theories explaining the evolution of metamorphosis, many of which fit under the hypothesis of decoupling of life stages, there are few clear adaptive hypotheses on why complete metamorphosis evolved. We propose that the main adaptive benefit of complete metamorphosis is decoupling between growth and differentiation. This facilitates the exploitation of ephemeral resources and enhances the probability of the metamorphic transition escaping developmental size thresholds. The evolution of complete metamorphosis comes at the cost of exposure to predators, parasites and pathogens during pupal life and requires specific adaptations of the immune system at this time. Moreover, metamorphosis poses a challenge for the maintenance of symbionts and the gut , although it may also offer the benefit of allowing an extensive change in  between the larval and adult stages. The regulation of metamorphosis by two main players, ecdysone and juvenile hormone, and the related signalling cascades are now relatively well understood. The mechanics of metamorphosis have recently been studied in detail because of the advent of micro-CT and research into the role of cell death in remodelling tissues and organs. We support the argument that the adult stage must necessarily have preceded the larval form of the insect. We do not resolve the still contentious question of whether the larva of insects in general originated through the modification of existing preadult forms or through heterochrony as a modified embryonic stage (pronymph), nor whether the holometabolous pupa arose as a modified hemimetabolous final stage larva.

We analyzed the contribution of gluten on obesity and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with 5% gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of browning markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal  composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut  is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa  (NFκ) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκ p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκ p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκ p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest a close relationship between IBD and depression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480433>Bone Diseases in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis is a frequently observed complication in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly liver cirrhosis and cholestatic liver diseases. In addition, osteoporosis is critical in patients receiving a liver transplant. Nevertheless, few studies have evaluated bone diseases in patients with more frequently observed chronic liver disease, such as chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Osteoporosis is a disease caused by an imbalance in the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Over the last few decades, many advances have improved our knowledge of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Importantly, activated immune cells affect the progression of osteoporosis, and chronic inflammation may exert an additional effect on the existing pathophysiology of osteoporosis. The  of the intestinal tract may also affect the progression of bone loss in patients with chronic liver disease. Recently, studies regarding the effects of chronic inflammation on dysbiosis in bone diseases have been conducted. However, mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in patients with chronic liver disease are complex and precise mechanisms remain unknown. The following special considerations in patients with chronic liver disease are reviewed: bone diseases in patients who underwent a liver transplant, the association between chronic hepatitis  virus infection treatment and bone diseases, the association between sarcopenia and bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease, and the association between chronic liver disease and avascular necrosis of the hip. Few guidelines are currently available for the management of low bone mineral density or bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease. Due to increased life expectancy and therapeutic advances in chronic liver disease, the importance of managing osteoporosis and other bone diseases in patients with chronic liver disease is expected to increase. Consequently, specific guidelines need to be established in the near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31475121>Sex-Specific Linkages Between Taxonomic and Functional Profiles of Tick Gut Microbiomes.</a></h2><p>Ticks transmit the most diverse array of disease agents and harbor one of the most diverse microbial communities. Major progress has been made in the characterization of the taxonomic profiles of tick . However, the functional profiles of tick microbiome have been comparatively less studied. In this proof of concept we used state-of-the-art functional metagenomics analytical tools to explore previously reported datasets of bacteria found in male and female , and . Results showed that both taxonomic and functional profiles have differences between sexes of the same species. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that male and female of the same species had major differences in the abundance of genes involved in different metabolic pathways including vitamin , amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and antibiotics among others. Partial reconstruction of metabolic pathways using KEGG enzymes suggests that tick microbiome form a complex metabolic network that may increase microbial community resilience and adaptability. Linkage analysis between taxonomic and functional profiles showed that among the KEGG enzymes with differential abundance in male and female ticks only 12% were present in single bacterial genera. The rest of these enzymes were found in more than two bacterial genera, and 27% of them were found in five up to ten bacterial genera. Comparison of bacterial genera contributing to the differences in the taxonomic and functional profiles of males and females revealed that while a small group of bacteria has a dual-role, most of the bacteria contribute only to functional or taxonomic differentiation between sexes. Results suggest that the different life styles of male and female ticks exert sex-specific evolutionary pressures that act independently on the phenomes (set of phenotypes) and genomes of bacteria in tick gut . We conclude that functional redundancy is a fundamental property of male and female tick  and propose that functional metagenomics should be combined with taxonomic profiling of  because both analyses are complementary.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496244>Identification of Novel Urolithin Metabolites in Human Feces and Urine after the Intake of a Pomegranate Extract.</a></h2><p>Urolithins are bioactive gut  metabolites of ellagic acid. Here, we have identified four unknown urolithins in human feces after the intake of a pomegranate extract. The new metabolites occurred only in 19% of the subjects. 4,8,9,10-Tetrahydroxy urolithin, (urolithin M6R), was unambiguously identified by H NMR, UV, and HRMS. Three metabolites were tentatively identified by the UV, HRMS, and chromatographic behavior, as 4,8,10-trihydroxy (urolithin M7R), 4,8,9-trihydroxy (urolithin CR), and 4,8-dihydroxy (urolithin AR) urolithins. Phase II conjugates of the novel urolithins were detected in urine and confirmed their absorption, circulation, and urinary excretion. The production of the new urolithins was not specific of any of the known urolithin metabotypes A and . The new metabolites needed a bacterial 3-dehydroxylase activity for their production, and this is a novel feature as all the previously known urolithins maintained the hydroxyl at 3 position. The ability of production of these "R" urolithins can be considered an additional metabolic feature for volunteer stratification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373124>Microbial community responses reduce soil carbon loss in Tibetan alpine grasslands under short-term warming.</a></h2><p>Changes in labile carbon (LC) pools and microbial communities are the primary factors controlling soil heterotrophic respiration (R ) in warming experiments. Warming is expected to initially increase R but studies show this increase may not be continuous or sustained. Specifically, LC and soil microbiome have been shown to contribute to the effect of extended warming on R . However, their relative contribution is unclear and this gap in knowledge causes considerable uncertainty in the prediction of carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change. In this study, we used a two-step incubation approach to reveal the relative contribution of LC limitation and soil microbial community responses in attenuating the effect that extended warming has on R . Soil samples from three Tibetan ecosystems-an alpine meadow (AM), alpine steppe (AS), and desert steppe (DS)-were exposed to a temperature gradient of 5-25°C. After an initial incubation period, soils were processed in one of two methods: (a) soils were sterilized then inoculated with parent soil microbes to assess the LC limitation effects, while controlling for microbial community responses; or () soil microbes from the incubations were used to inoculate sterilized parent soils to assess the microbial community effects, while controlling for LC limitation. We found both LC limitation and microbial community responses led to significant declines in R by 37% and 30%, respectively, but their relative contributions were ecosystem specific. LC limitation alone caused a greater R decrease for DS soils than AMs or ASs. Our study demonstrates that soil carbon loss due to R in Tibetan alpine soils-especially in copiotrophic soils-will be weakened by microbial community responses under short-term warming.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362767> and gut ultrastructure of Anisakis pegreffii isolated from stranded cetaceans in the Adriatic Sea.</a></h2><p>Inferring the  diversity of helminths enables depiction of evolutionarily established ecological and pathological traits that characterize a particular parasite-host interaction. In turn, these traits could provide valuable information for the development of parasitosis control and mitigation strategy. The parasite Anisakis pegreffii (Nematoda: Anisakidae) realizes the final stage of its life-cycle within gastric chambers of aquatic mammals, causing mild-to-moderate granulomatous gastritis with eosinophilic infiltrate, to severe ulcerative gastritis with mixed inflammatory infiltrate, often associated with bacterial colonies. However, its interaction with the host  remains unknown, and might reveal important aspects of parasite colonization and propagation within the final host.MySeq Illumina sequencing was performed for the 16S rRNA gene from  isolated from larvae, and uterus and gut of adult A. pegreffii parasitizing stranded striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). To assess the potential presence of Brucella ceti within isolated , Brucella-targeted real-time PCR was undertaken. In addition, TEM of the gastrointestinal tract of the infective third-stage (L3) and transitioning fourth-stage larvae (L4) was performed to characterize the morphological differences and the level of larval feeding activity.In total, 230 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified across all samples (n = 20). The number of shared taxa was lower than the number of taxa found specifically in each parasite stage or organ. The dominant taxon was Mycoplasmataceae (genus Mycoplasma) in the gut and uterus of adult A. pegreffii, whereas Fusobacteriaceae (genus Cetobacterium) was the most abundant in 40% of larvae, alongside Mycoplasmataceae. No . ceti DNA was detected in any of the  isolates. TEM revealed differences in gut ultrastructure between L3 and L4, reflecting a feeble, most likely passive, level of feeding activity in L3. from L3 was more related to that of the gut rather than the uterus of adult A. pegreffii. Taxa of the larval  showed qualitative and quantitative perturbations, likely reflecting the propagation through different environments during its life-cycle. This suggests an ontogenetic shift in the alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities from uterus-derived towards cetacean-derived . Although TEM did not reveal active L3 feeding,  of the latter showed similarity to that of an actively feeding adult nematode.</p></html>
