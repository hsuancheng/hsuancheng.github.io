Herein, we have investigated through a multiplex assay whether proteins of energy metabolism could provide biomarkers of IMs.A cohort of thirty-two muscle biopsies and forty plasma samples comprising polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) and control donors was interrogated with monoclonal antibodies against proteins of energy metabolism using reverse phase protein microarrays (RPPA).When compared to controls the expression of the proteins is not significantly affected in the muscle of PM patients. However, the expression of β-actin is significantly increased in DM and sIBM in consistence with muscle and fiber regeneration. Concurrently, the expression of some proteins involved in glucose metabolism displayed a significant reduction in muscle of sIBM suggesting a repression of glycolytic metabolism in these patients. In contrasts to these findings, the expression of the glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2) and of the mitochondrial ATPase Inhibitor Factor 1 (IF1) and Hsp60 were significantly augmented in DM when compared to other IMs in accordance with a metabolic shift prone to cancer development. PKM2 alone or in combination with other biomarkers allowed the discrimination of control and IMs with very high (>95%) sensitivity and specificity. Unfortunately, plasma levels of PKM2 were not significantly altered in DM patients to recommend its use as a non-invasive biomarker of the disease.Expression of proteins of energy metabolism in muscle enabled discrimination of patients with IMs. RPPA identified the glycolysis promoting PKM2 and IF1 proteins as specific biomarkers of dermatomyositis, providing a biochemical link of this IM with oncogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315387>PGC-1α-Mediated Mitochondrial Biogenesis is Involved in Cannabinoid Receptor 2 Agonist AM1241-Induced Microglial Phenotype Amelioration.</a></h2><p>Cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) agonist AM1241 induces anti-inflammation by ameliorating microglial phenotypes, the mechanism, however, is still unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcription protein which can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, and the aim of this study is to investigate whether PGC-1α is involved in AM1241-induced anti-inflammation in N9 microglial cells. We used 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus 10 U/ml interferon γ (IFNγ) to activate microglia into classic activated phenotype (M1 phenotype), and found that co-administration of 10 µM AM1241 increased the expressions of  biogenesis-associated proteins, including nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and COX IV, and up-regulated the biomarker levels of microglial  phenotype, including arginase 1 (Arg-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and down-regulated biomarker levels of M1 phenotype, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), compared to the cells treated with LPS plus IFNγ only (P < 0.05). By using PGC-1α-siRNA, however, we found that down-regulation of PGC-1α significantly reversed the AM1241-induced effects above (P < 0.05). According to the results in this study, we found that PGC-1α may mediate CB2R agonist AM1241-induced anti-inflammation in N9 microglial cells, and the mechanism might be associated with the enhancement of  biogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597355>Mitochondrial Calcium Uptake Is Instrumental to Alternative Macrophage Polarization and Phagocytic Activity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are highly plastic and dynamic cells that exert much of their function through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis depends on a coordinated, finely tuned, and compartmentalized regulation of calcium concentrations. We examined the role of mitochondrial calcium uptake and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in macrophage polarization and function. In primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages, calcium uptake in  was instrumental for alternative () macrophage polarization. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibition with KB-R7943 or MCU knockdown, which prevented mitochondrial calcium uptake, reduced  polarization, while not affecting classical (M1) polarization. Challenging macrophages with  fragments induced spikes of mitochondrial calcium concentrations, which were prevented by MCU inhibition or silencing. In addition,  remodelled in  macrophages during phagocytosis, especially close to sites of  internalization. Remarkably, inhibition or knockdown of MCU significantly reduced the phagocytic capacity of  macrophages. KB-R7943, which also inhibits the membrane sodium/calcium exchanger and Complex I, reduced  energization and cellular ATP levels, but such effects were not observed with MCU silencing. Therefore, phagocytosis inhibition by MCU knockdown depended on the impaired mitochondrial calcium buffering rather than changes in mitochondrial and cellular energy status. These data uncover a new role for MCU in alternative macrophage polarization and phagocytic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27632706>Inhibition of lanthanide nanocrystal-induced inflammasome activation in macrophages by a surface coating peptide through abrogation of ROS production and TRPM2-mediated Ca(2+) influx.</a></h2><p>Lanthanide-based nanoparticles (LNs) hold great promise in medicine. A variety of nanocrystals, including LNs, elicits potent inflammatory response through activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. We have previously identified an LNs-specific surface coating peptide RE-1, with the sequence of 'ACTARSPWICG', which reduced nanocrystal-cell interaction and abrogated LNs-induced autophagy and toxicity in both HeLa cells and liver hepatocytes. Here we show that RE-1 coating effectively inhibited LNs-induced inflammasome activation, mostly mediated by NLRP3, in mouse bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDM) cells, human THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages and also reduced LNs-elicited inflammatory response in vivo. RE-1 coating had no effect on cellular internalization of LNs in BMDM cells, in contrast to the situation in HeLa cells where cell uptake of LNs was significantly inhibited by RE-1. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the inflammasome-inhibiting effect of RE-1, we assessed several parameters known to influence nanocrystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. RE-1 coating did not reduce potassium efflux, which occurred after LNs treatment in BMDM cells and was necessary but insufficient for LNs-induced inflammasome activation. RE-1 did decrease lysosomal damage induced by LNs, but the inhibitor of cathepsin B did not affect LNs-elicited caspase 1 activation and IL-1β release, suggesting that lysosomal damage was not critically important for LNs-induced inflammasome activation. On the other hand, LNs-induced elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), critically important for inflammasome activation, was largely abolished by RE-1 coating, with the reduction on NADPH oxidase-generated ROS playing a more prominent role for RE-1's inflammasome-inhibiting effect than the reduction on -generated ROS. ROS generation further triggered Ca(2+) influx, an event that was mediated by Transient Receptor Potential  (TRPM2) and was necessary for inflammasome activation, and this event was completely inhibited by RE-1 coating. We conclude from these studies that inhibition of ROS production, and the subsequent abrogation of TRPM2-mediated Ca(2+) influx, is the primary mechanism underlying RE-1's inhibitory effect on LNs-induced inflammasome activation. The ability of regulating the inflammatory response of nanocrystals through peptide surface coating may be of great value for in vivo applications of LNs and other engineered nanomaterials.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In most cases macrophages keep us healthy but when their balanced response to damage or homeostatic signals is perturbed, they can drive chronic inflammatory responses and pathology. To fulfil their broad range of functions, macrophages adopt a plethora of activation states. Understanding their regulation and phenotypic heterogeneity is crucial because macrophages are critical in many diseases. Consequently, macrophages have emerged as attractive targets for therapy of diseases in which they determine disease outcome, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and other Western killer diseases. Recent advances in the flourishing field of immunometabolism highlight that the metabolic profile of macrophages directly regulates their activation status and associated functions. In this short review, we summarize how recent research on the metabolic regulation of macrophages has vividly improved our understanding of macrophage activation. Most of our existing knowledge results from in vitro studies with murine bone marrow-derived macrophages which can't fully grasp the complexity of (micro)environmental control of macrophages in tissues. We therefore highlight current weaknesses and missing links in macrophage immunometabolism research and provide future directions to make the step from the well-controlled plastic in vitro cell culture systems to the complex in vivo tissue environment.Copyright © 2018.

Accumulation of brain damage in progressive MS is partly the result of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) attacking myelin sheaths in the CNS. Although there is no cure yet for MS, significant advances have been made in the development of disease modifying agents. Unfortunately, most of these drugs fail to reverse established neurological deficits and can have adverse effects. Recent evidence suggests that MPs polarization is accompanied by profound metabolic changes, whereby pro-inflammatory MPs (M1) switch toward glycolysis, whereas anti-inflammatory MPs () become more oxidative. It is therefore possible that reprograming MPs metabolism could affect their function and repress immune cell activation. This mini review describes the metabolic changes underpinning macrophages polarization and anticipates how metabolic re-education of MPs could be used for the treatment of MS.Inflammation in progressive MS is mediated primarily by MPs.Cell metabolism regulates the function of MPs.DMAs can re-educate the metabolism of MPs to promote healing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28689265>Aerobic Glycolysis Hypothesis Through WNT/Beta-Catenin Pathway in Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration.</a></h2><p>Exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Inflammatory processes are associated with upregulation of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway in exudative AMD. We focus this review on the link between WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation and neovascular progression in exudative AMD through activation of aerobic glycolysis for production of angiogenic factors. Increased WNT/beta-catenin pathway involves hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). WNT/beta-catenin pathway stimulates PI3K/Akt pathway and then HIF-1alpha which activates glycolytic enzymes: glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), and monocarboxylate lactate transporter (MCT-1). This phenomenon is called aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Consequently, phosphorylation of PDK-1 inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Thus, a large part of pyruvate cannot be converted into acetyl-CoA in  and only a part of acetyl-CoA can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Cytosolic pyruvate is converted into lactate through the action of LDH-A. In exudative AMD, high level of cytosolic lactate is correlated with increase of VEGF expression, the angiogenic factor of CNV. Photoreceptors in retina cells can metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis to protect them against oxidative damage, as cancer cells do.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035139>Mitochondrial PKM2 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl2.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported that PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying such a role of PKM2 remain elusive. Here we show that PKM2 translocates to  under oxidative stress. In the , PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl2 at threonine (T) 69. This phosphorylation prevents the binding of Cul3-based E3 ligase to Bcl2 and subsequent degradation of Bcl2. A chaperone protein, HSP90α1, is required for this function of PKM2. HSP90α1's ATPase activity launches a conformational change of PKM2 and facilitates interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2. Replacement of wild-type Bcl2 with phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A mutant sensitizes glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and impairs brain tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, a peptide that is composed of the amino acid residues from 389 to 405 of PKM2, through which PKM2 binds to Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation and impairs brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation, conformation-altered PKM2 and Bcl2 protein correlate with one another in specimens of human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation and conformation-altered PKM2 correlate with both grades and prognosis of glioma malignancy. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism through which mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 and inhibits apoptosis directly, highlight the essential role of PKM2 in ROS adaptation of cancer cells, and implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26643360>Reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism in macrophages as an anti-inflammatory signal.</a></h2><p> are master regulators of metabolism.  generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation using pyruvate (derived from glucose and glycolysis) and fatty acids (FAs), both of which are oxidized in the Krebs cycle, as fuel sources.  are also an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), creating oxidative stress in various contexts, including in the response to bacterial infection. Recently, complex changes in mitochondrial metabolism have been characterized in mouse macrophages in response to varying stimuli in vitro. In LPS and IFN-γ-activated macrophages (M1 macrophages), there is decreased respiration and a broken Krebs cycle, leading to accumulation of succinate and citrate, which act as signals to alter immune function. In IL-4-activated macrophages ( macrophages), the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are intact and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is also utilized. These metabolic alterations in response to the nature of the stimulus are proving to be determinants of the effector functions of M1 and  macrophages. Furthermore, reprogramming of macrophages from M1 to  can be achieved by targeting metabolic events. Here, we describe the role that metabolism plays in macrophage function in infection and immunity, and propose that reprogramming with metabolic inhibitors might be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we studied protective factors for DN using proteomics on glomeruli from individuals with extreme duration of diabetes (ł50 years) without DN and those with histologic signs of DN. Enzymes in the glycolytic, sorbitol, methylglyoxal and mitochondrial pathways were elevated in individuals without DN. In particular, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) expression and activity were upregulated. Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased PKM2 tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and cultured podocytes. Pkm-knockdown immortalized mouse podocytes had higher levels of toxic glucose metabolites, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse albuminuria and glomerular pathology. Conversely, we found that pharmacological activation of PKM2 by a small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1α mRNA in cultured podocytes. In intervention studies using DBA2/J and Nos3 (eNos) KO mouse models of diabetes, TEPP-46 treatment reversed metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney pathology. Thus, PKM2 activation may protect against DN by increasing glucose metabolic flux, inhibiting the production of toxic glucose metabolites and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis to restore mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342181>Optimization of mNeonGreen for Homo sapiens increases its fluorescent intensity in mammalian cells.</a></h2><p>Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is tremendously useful for investigating many cellular and intracellular events. The monomeric GFP mNeonGreen is about 3- to 5-times brighter than GFP and monomeric enhanced GFP and shows high photostability. The maturation half-time of mNeonGreen is about 3-fold faster than that of monomeric enhanced GFP. However, the cDNA sequence encoding mNeonGreen contains some codons that are rarely used in Homo sapiens. For better expression of mNeonGreen in human cells, we synthesized a human-optimized cDNA encoding mNeonGreen and generated an expression plasmid for humanized mNeonGreen under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resultant plasmid was introduced into HEK293 cells. The fluorescent intensity of humanized mNeonGreen was about 1.4-fold higher than that of the original mNeonGreen. The humanized mNeonGreen with a -targeting signal showed mitochondrial distribution of mNeonGreen. We further generated an expression vector of humanized mNeonGreen with 3xFLAG tags at its carboxyl terminus as these tags are useful for immunological analyses. The 3xFLAG-tagged mNeonGreen was recognized well with an anti-FLAG- antibody. These plasmids for the expression of humanized mNeonGreen and mNeonGreen-3xFLAG are useful tools for biological studies in mammalian cells using mNeonGreen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29394289>Lapachol inhibits glycolysis in cancer cells by targeting pyruvate kinase .</a></h2><p>Reliance on aerobic glycolysis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Although pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is a key mediator of glycolysis in cancer cells, lack of selective agents that target PKM2 remains a challenge in exploiting metabolic pathways for cancer therapy. We report that unlike its structural analog shikonin, a known inhibitor of PKM2, lapachol failed to induce non-apoptotic cell death ferroxitosis in hypoxia. However, melanoma cells treated with lapachol showed a dose-dependent inhibition of glycolysis and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption. Accordingly, in silico studies revealed a high affinity-binding pocket for lapachol on PKM2 structure. Lapachol inhibited PKM2 activity of purified enzyme as well as in melanoma cell extracts. Blockade of glycolysis by lapachol in melanoma cells led to decreased ATP levels and inhibition of cell proliferation. Furthermore, perturbation of glycolysis in melanoma cells with lapachol sensitized cells to mitochondrial protonophore and promoted apoptosis. These results present lapachol as an inhibitor of PKM2 to interrogate metabolic plasticity in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27389774>Protective Role of Quercetin in Cadmium-Induced Cholinergic Dysfunctions in Rat Brain by Modulating Mitochondrial Integrity and MAP Kinase Signaling.</a></h2><p>With the increasing evidences of cadmium-induced cognitive deficits associated with brain cholinergic dysfunctions, the present study aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective efficacy of quercetin in rats. A decrease in the binding of cholinergic-muscarinic receptors and mRNA expression of cholinergic receptor genes (M1, , and M4) was observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus on exposure of rats to cadmium (5.0 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) for 28 days compared to controls. Cadmium exposure resulted to decrease mRNA and protein expressions of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions, ultrastructural changes, and learning deficits. Enhanced apoptosis, as evidenced by alterations in key proteins involved in the pro- and anti-apoptotic pathway and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, was evident on cadmium exposure. Simultaneous treatment with quercetin (25 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) resulted to protect cadmium-induced alterations in cholinergic-muscarinic receptors, mRNA expression of genes (M1, , and M4), and expression of ChAT and AChE. The protective effect on brain cholinergic targets was attributed to the antioxidant potential of quercetin, which reduced ROS generation and protected mitochondrial integrity by modulating proteins involved in apoptosis and MAP kinase signaling. The results exhibit that quercetin may modulate molecular targets involved in brain cholinergic signaling and attenuate cadmium neurotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183376>Gut microbiome catabolites as novel modulators of muscle cell glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome supplies essential metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids to skeletal muscle , and the composition and activity of the microbiota is in turn affected by muscle fitness. To further our understanding of the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and muscle, we examined the effect of microbiota-derived phenolic metabolites on the ability of human muscle cells to take up and metabolize glucose. As a model, we used the differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblast line, LHCN-, which expresses typical muscle phenotypic markers. We initially tested a selected panel of parent phenolic compounds and microbial metabolites, and their respective phenolic conjugates, as found in blood. Several of the tested compounds increased glucose uptake and metabolism, notably in high glucose- and insulin-treated myotubes. One of the most effective was isovanillic acid 3 -O-sulfate (IVAS), a metabolite from the microbiome found in the blood, primarily derived from consumed cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside, a major compound in berry fruits. IVAS stimulated a dose-dependent increase in glucose transport through glucose transporter GLUT4- and PI3K-dependent mechanisms. IVAS also up-regulated GLUT1, GLUT4, and PI3K p85α protein, and increased phosphorylation of Akt.

To discover MOMP-regulating proteins, we expressed a library of intracellular single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) ("intrabodies") and selected for those rescuing cells from apoptosis induced by BimS (the short isoform of Bim). One anti-apoptotic intrabody, intrabody 5 (IB5), recognized pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), which is expressed in cancer cells. PKM2 deletion ablated this clonogenic rescue; thus, IB5 activated a latent cytoprotective function of PKM2. This resulted not from pyruvate kinase activity per se but rather from the formation of an active tetrameric conformation of PKM2. A stably tetrameric PKM2 mutant, K422R, promoted cell survival even in the absence of IB5, and IB5 further increased survival.  isolated from IB5-expressing cells were relatively resistant to MOMP in vitro. In cells, IB5 expression up-regulated Mitofusin-1 (Mfn1) and increased mitochondrial length. Importantly, Mfn1 deficiency abrogated IB5's cytoprotective effect.

Defining risk factors for DKD using a reductionist approach has proven challenging. Integrative omics-based systems biology tools have shed new insights in our understanding of DKD and have provided several key breakthroughs for identifying novel predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. In this review, we highlight the role of the Warburg effect in DKD and potential regulating factors such as sphingomyelin, fumarate, and pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  in shifting glucose flux from complete oxidation in  to the glycolytic pathway and its principal branches.

Unfortunately, a significant fraction of patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) relapses mainly because of gene amplification, mutations, or other bypass mechanisms. Recently a growing number of papers showed how, in some cases, resistance due to oncogene overexpression may be associated with drug addiction: cells able to proliferate in the presence of high TKI doses become also TKI dependent, undergoing cellular stress, and apoptosis/death upon drug withdrawal. Notably, if a sub-cellular population survives TKI discontinuation it is also partially re-sensitized to the same drug. Thus, it is possible that a subset of patients relapsing upon TKI treatment may benefit from a discontinuous therapeutic schedule. We focused on two different hematologic malignancies, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), both successfully treatable with TKIs. The two models utilized (LAMA and SUP-) differed in having oncogene overexpression as the sole cause of drug resistance (CML), or additionally carrying kinase domain mutations (ALCL). In both cases drug withdrawal caused a sudden overload of oncogenic signal, enhanced  activity, induced the release of a high amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caused genotoxic stress and massive cell death. In LAMA cells (CML) we could rescue the cells from death by partially blocking downstream oncogenic signaling or lowering ROS detrimental effect by adding reduced glutathione.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964487>Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 participates in macrophage polarization via regulating glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>The M1 and  polarized phenotypes dictate distinctive roles for macrophages as they participate in inflammatory disorders. There has been growing interest in the role of cellular metabolism in macrophage polarization. However, it is currently unclear whether different aspects of a specific metabolic program coordinately regulate this cellular process. In this study, we found that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a key regulatory enzyme in glucose metabolism, plays an important role in the differential activation of macrophages. Knockdown of PDK1 diminished M1, whereas it enhanced  activation of macrophages. Mechanistically, PDK1 knockdown led to diminished aerobic glycolysis in M1 macrophages, which likely accounts for the attenuated inflammatory response in these cells. Furthermore, we found that mitochondrial respiration is enhanced during and required by the early activation of  macrophages. Suppression of glucose oxidation, but not that of fatty acids, inhibits this process. Consistent with its inhibitory role in early  activation, knockdown of PDK1 enhanced mitochondrial respiration in macrophages. Our data suggest that two arms of the glucose metabolism synergistically regulate the differential activation of macrophages. Our findings also highlight the central role of PDK1 in this event via controlling glycolysis and glucose oxidation.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29592883>Gallium Maltolate Disrupts Tumor Iron Metabolism and Retards the Growth of Glioblastoma by Inhibiting Mitochondrial Function and Ribonucleotide Reductase.</a></h2><p>Gallium, a metal with antineoplastic activity, binds transferrin (Tf) and enters tumor cells via Tf receptor1 (TfR1); it disrupts iron homeostasis leading to cell death. We hypothesized that TfR1 on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) would facilitate Tf-Ga transport into the brain enabling it to target TfR-bearing glioblastoma. We show that U-87 MG and D54 glioblastoma cell lines and multiple glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) lines express TfRs, and that their growth is inhibited by gallium maltolate (GaM)  After 24 hours of incubation with GaM, cells displayed a loss of mitochondrial reserve capacity followed by a dose-dependent decrease in oxygen consumption and a decrease in the activity of the iron-dependent  subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2). IHC staining of rat and human tumor-bearing brains showed that glioblastoma, but not normal glial cells, expressed TfR1 and RRM2, and that glioblastoma expressed greater levels of H- and L-ferritin than normal brain. In an orthotopic U-87 MG glioblastoma xenograft rat model, GaM retarded the growth of brain tumors relative to untreated control ( = 0.0159) and reduced tumor mitotic figures ( = 0.045). Tumors in GaM-treated animals displayed an upregulation of TfR1 expression relative to control animals, thus indicating that gallium produced tumor iron deprivation. GaM also inhibited iron uptake and upregulated TfR1 expression in U-87 MG and D54 cells  We conclude that GaM enters the brain via TfR1 on BMECs and targets iron metabolism in glioblastoma  thus inhibiting tumor growth.

Attenuation of dysfunctional  by natural compounds is an emerging strategy for the recovery of abnormal energy metabolism of cancer. To develop a nano-sized curcumin (CUR) in attenuating the energy metabolism of cancer cells, herein, a coral-shaped nano-transporter DNA-FeS-DA nanoparticle was synthesized using double-stranded DNA rich in 'GAG' and 'GC' series as a template and poly-dopamine as an adhesive. CUR was successfully loaded to DNA-FeS-DA with a molar ratio of ssDNA: CUR of 1:16, forming CUR@DNA-FeS-DA. This nano-curcumin can readily enter mitochondrion in MCF-7 cancer cells. The CUR@DNA-FeS-DA nanocomposite displays desirable photothermal effect and stability, while its CUR can be released gradually in the weak acid environment. The expression of both pyruvate kinase  and fatty acid synthase in the MCF-7 cancer cells were noticeably inhibited by CUR@DNA-FeS-DA.

Detailed analysis of microglial activation in stefin B-deficient microglia showed a significantly higher proportion of both pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory  microglia in stefin B-deficient mouse brain compared with control mice. In our recent work, we demonstrated that stefin B-deficient mice were significantly more sensitive to the lethal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, due to increased caspase-11 expression and secreted higher amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Upon LPS stimulation, stefin B was targeted into the , and the lack of stefin B resulted in the increased destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial superoxide generation. The increased caspase-11 gene expression and better pro- inflammatory caspase-1 and -11 activation determined in stefin B deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in enhanced non-canonical inflammasome activation. Since signaling pathways in macrophages could be compared to the ones in microglia we propose that inflammasome activation could play an important role in the pathogenesis of EPM1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26267609>Macrophage-tumor cell fusions from peripheral blood of melanoma patients.</a></h2><p>While the morbidity and mortality from cancer are largely attributable to its metastatic dissemination, the integral features of the cascade are not well understood. The widely accepted hypothesis is that the primary tumor microenvironment induces the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, facilitating their escape into the bloodstream, possibly accompanied by cancer stem cells. An alternative theory for metastasis involves fusion of macrophages with tumor cells (MTFs). Here we culture and characterize apparent MTFs from blood of melanoma patients.We isolated enriched CTC populations from peripheral blood samples from melanoma patients, and cultured them. We interrogated these cultured cells for characteristic BRAF mutations, and used confocal microscopy for immunophenotyping, motility, DNA content and chromatin texture analyses, and then conducted xenograft studies using nude mice.Morphologically, the cultured MTFs were generally large with many pseudopod extensions and lamellipodia. Ultrastructurally, the cultured MTFs appeared to be macrophages. They were rich in  and lysosomes, as well as apparent melanosomes. The cultured MTF populations were all heterogeneous with regard to DNA content, containing aneuploid and/or high-ploidy cells, and they typically showed large sheets (and/or clumps) of cytoplasmic chromatin. This cytoplasmic DNA was found within heterogeneously-sized autophagic vacuoles, which prominently contained chromatin and micronuclei. Cultured MTFs uniformly expressed pan-macrophage markers (CD14, CD68) and macrophage markers indicative of  polarization (CD163, CD204, CD206). They also expressed melanocyte-specific markers (ALCAM, MLANA), epithelial biomarkers (KRT, EpCAM), as well as the pro-carcinogenic cytokine MIF along with functionally related stem cell markers (CXCR4, CD44). MTF cultures from individual patients (5 of 8) contained melanoma-specific BRAF activating mutations. Chromatin texture analysis of deconvoluted images showed condensed DNA (DAPI-intense) regions similar to focal regions described in stem cell fusions. MTFs were readily apparent in vivo in all human melanomas examined, often exhibiting even higher DNA content than the cultured MTFs. When cultured MTFs were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice, they disseminated and produced metastatic lesions at distant sites.Apparent MTFs are present in peripheral blood of patients with cutaneous melanomas, and they possess the ability to form metastatic lesions when transplanted into mice. We hypothesize that these MTFs arise at the periphery of primary tumors in vivo, that they readily enter the bloodstream and invade distant tissues, secreting cytokines (such as MIF) to prepare "niches" for colonization by metastasis initiating cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24983336>Treating NAFLD in OLETF rats with vigorous-intensity interval exercise training.</a></h2><p>There is increasing use of high-intensity interval-type exercise training in the management of many lifestyle-related diseases.This study aimed to test the hypothesis that vigorous-intensity interval exercise is as effective as traditional moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) outcomes in obese, Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats.OLETF rats (age, 20 wk; n = 8-10 per group) were assigned to sedentary (O-SED), moderate-intensity exercise training (O-MOD EX; 20 m·min(-1), 15% incline, 60 min·d(-1), 5 d·wk(-1) of treadmill running), or vigorous-intensity interval exercise training (O-VIG EX; 40 m·min(-1), 15% incline, 6 × 2.5 min bouts per day, 5 d·wk(-1) of treadmill running) groups for 12 wk.Both MOD EX and VIG EX effectively lowered hepatic triglycerides, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), perivenular fibrosis, and hepatic collagen 1α1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (vs O-SED, P < 0.05). In addition, both interventions increased hepatic mitochondrial markers (citrate synthase activity and fatty acid oxidation) and suppressed markers of de novo lipogenesis (fatty acid synthase, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, Elovl fatty acid elongase 6, and steroyl CoA desaturase-1), whereas only MOD EX increased hepatic mitochondrial Beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (β-HAD) activity and hepatic triglyceride export marker apoB100 and lowered fatty acid transporter CD36 compared with O-SED. Moreover, whereas total hepatic macrophage population markers (CD68 and F4/80 mRNA) did not differ among groups, MOD EX and VIG EX lowered M1 macrophage polarization markers (CD11c, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α mRNA) and MOD EX increased  macrophage marker, CD206 mRNA, compared with O-SED.The accumulation of 15 min·d(-1) of VIG EX for 12 wk had similar effectiveness as 60 min·d(-1) of MOD EX in the management of NAFLD in OLETF rats. These findings may have important health outcome implications as we work to design better exercise training programs for patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732846>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Prevents Repolarization of Inflammatory Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are innate immune cells that adopt diverse activation states in response to their microenvironment. Editing macrophage activation to dampen inflammatory diseases by promoting the repolarization of inflammatory (M1) macrophages to anti-inflammatory () macrophages is of high interest. Here, we find that mouse and human M1 macrophages fail to convert into  cells upon IL-4 exposure in vitro and in vivo. In sharp contrast,  macrophages are more plastic and readily repolarized into an inflammatory M1 state. We identify M1-associated inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as the factor responsible for preventing M1→ repolarization. Inhibiting nitric oxide production, a key effector molecule in M1 cells, dampens the decline in mitochondrial function to improve metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming to  macrophages. Thus, inflammatory macrophage activation blunts oxidative phosphorylation, thereby preventing repolarization. Therapeutically restoring mitochondrial function might be useful to improve the reprogramming of inflammatory macrophages into anti-inflammatory cells to control disease.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the supplementary oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to standard radiation therapy as a novel radioprotective approach that would not compromise the antitumor effect of radiation in normal rectal and bladder mucosa in a syngenic prostate cancer (PCa) model.To evaluate the radiosensitizing effect of ALA in vitro, clonogenic survival assays were performed in DU145, PC3, and MyC-CaP cell lines. To evaluate the effect of ALA in vivo a single dose (25 Gy) of radiation with or without ALA was given to healthy mice. Next, a syngenic PCa model of MyC-CaP cells in FVB mice was created, and multiple doses (12 Gy total) of radiation were administered to the mouse pelvic area with or without ALA administration. Resected tumors, recta, and urinary bladders were immunostained with antibodies against Ki-67, γ-H2AX, CD204, and uroplakin-III. Total RNA levels in recta and urinary bladders were analyzed via RT2 Profiler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays related to "Stress & Toxicity PathwayFinder," "," and "Inflammasomes."The addition of in vitro single or in vivo repeated administration of exogenous ALA acted as a radiosensitizer for PCa cells. Rectal toxicity was characterized by histological changes including loss of surface epithelium, fibrosis, severe DNA damage, and the aggregation of  macrophages. Urinary bladder toxicity was characterized by bladder wall thickening and urothelium denuding. The higher dose (300 mg/kg/day) of ALA exerted a better radioprotective profile than the lower dose (30 mg/kg/day) in normal recta and urinary bladders. Out of the 252 genes tested, 35 (13.4%) were detected as relevant genes which may be involved in the radioprotective role of ALA administration. These included interleukin-1a (IL-1a), IL-1b, IL-12, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL3, and NLRP3.Our study provides novel and comprehensive insights into the dual benefits including radiosensitizing PCa tumor tissues and radioprotection of normal pelvic organs from radiation therapy.

A disturbance in the regulation of energy metabolism can be a key reason for the formation of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress, which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard, the aim of this study was to identify the relationship of the copy number of mtDNA in adipose tissue from different locations (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), mesentery (Mes), greater omentum (GO)), liver biopsy samples and mononuclear blood cells (MNCs) with endothelial dysfunction markers (eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) and inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, CRP, leptin) in obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m) with and without type 2 diabetes.The study included 88 obese patients (BMI > 35 kg/) treated at the Kaliningrad Region Hospital. The control group consisted of 20 healthy donors. To measure mtDNA copy number we used droplet digital PCR. The concentrations of molecules (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, eNOS, ET-1, iCAM-1, vCAM-1, VEGF) were measured in plasma using the following sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Quantitative determination of leptin was evaluated by flow-fluorimetry on a «Bio-Plex Protein Assay System». Statistical analysis and graphs were obtained in R Statistical Software (version 3.3.1).The systemic character of chronic subclinical inflammation in obesity is established, and an increase in the level of endothelial dysfunction molecules was observed in the blood plasma. The levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 were positively correlated with increases in BMI, serum glucose and cholesterol levels.The copy number of mtDNA in various fat stores was higher in obese patients with type 2 diabetes than in obese patients without diabetes or in the control subjects and was related to the levels of leptin and proinflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056360>Photobiomodulation therapy promotes neurogenesis by improving post-stroke local microenvironment and stimulating neuroprogenitor cells.</a></h2><p>Recent work has indicated that photobiomodulation (PBM) may beneficially alter the pathological status of several neurological disorders, although the mechanism currently remains unclear. The current study was designed to investigate the beneficial effect of PBM on behavioral deficits and neurogenesis in a photothrombotic (PT) model of ischemic stroke in rats. From day 1 to day 7 after the establishment of PT model, 2-minute daily PBM (CW, 808nm, 350mW/cm, total 294J at scalp level) was applied on the infarct injury area (1.8mm anterior to the bregma and 2.5mm lateral from the midline). Rats received intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) twice daily (50mg/kg) from day 2 to 8 post-stoke, and samples were collected at day 14. We demonstrated that PBM significantly attenuated behavioral deficits and infarct volume induced by PT stroke. Further investigation displayed that PBM remarkably enhanced neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, as evidenced by immunostaining of BrdU, Ki67, DCX, MAP2, spinophilin, and synaptophysin. Mechanistic studies suggested beneficial effects of PBM were accompanied by robust suppression of reactive gliosis and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP production in peri-infarct regions were elevated following PBM treatment. Intriguingly, PBM could effectively switch an M1 microglial phenotype to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype. Our novel findings indicated that PBM is capable of promoting neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. The underlying mechanisms may rely on: 1) promotion of proliferation and differentiation of internal neuroprogenitor cells in the peri-infarct zone; 2) improvement of the neuronal microenvironment by altering inflammatory status and promoting mitochondrial function. These findings provide strong support for the promising therapeutic effect of PBM on neuronal repair following ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We found that partial inhibition of the mitochondrial ATP synthase in the intestine of transgenic mice triggers an anti-inflammatory response through NFκB activation mediated by mitochondrial mtROS. This shielding phenotype is revealed when mice are challenged by DSS-induced colitis, which, in control animals, triggers inflammation, recruitment of M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages, and the activation of the pro-oncogenic STAT3 and Akt/mTOR pathways. In contrast, transgenic mice can polarize macrophages to the  anti-inflammatory phenotype. Using the -targeted antioxidant MitoQ to quench mtROS in vivo, we observe decreased NFκB activation, preventing its cellular protective effects.

We hypothesized that chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) via N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) would intensify liver injury in a rat model of obesity, insulin resistance, and NAFLD. Obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) and lean Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats received control or L-NAME (65-70 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1))-containing drinking water for 4 wk. L-NAME treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced serum NO metabolites and food intake in both groups. Remarkably, despite no increase in body weight, L-NAME treatment increased hepatic triacylglycerol content (+40%, P < 0.05) vs. control OLETF rats. This increase was associated with impaired (P < 0.05) hepatic mitochondrial state 3 respiration. Interestingly, the opposite effect was found in LETO rats, where L-NAME increased (P < 0.05) hepatic mitochondrial state 3 respiration. In addition, L-NAME induced a shift toward proinflammatory M1 macrophage polarity, as indicated by elevated hepatic CD11c (P < 0.05) and IL-1β (P = 0.07) mRNA in OLETF rats and reduced expression of the anti-inflammatory  markers CD163 and CD206 (P < 0.05) in LETO rats. Markers of total macrophage content (CD68 and F4/80) mRNA were unaffected by L-NAME in either group. In conclusion, systemic NOS inhibition in the obese OLETF rats reduced hepatic mitochondrial respiration, increased hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation, and increased hepatic inflammation.

Treatment options for perinatal brain injury are limited and developing therapies that target multiple pathways within the pathophysiology of NE are of great interest. Pifithrin-µ (PFT-µ) is a drug with striking neuroprotective abilities in a preclinical model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced NE wherein cell death is a substantial cause of injury. Work from neurons and tumor cells reports that PFT-µ is able to inhibit p53 binding to the , heat shock protein (HSP)-70 substrate binding and activation of the NF-kB pathway. The purpose of this study is to understand whether the neuroprotective effects of PFT-µ also include direct effects on microglia. We utilized the microglial cell line, BV2, and we studied the dose-dependent effect of PFT-µ on M1-like and -like phenotype using qRT-PCR and Western blotting, including the requirement for the presence of p53 or HSP-70 in these effects. We also assessed phagocytosis and the effects of PFT-µ on genes within metabolic pathways related to phenotype. We noted that PFT-µ robustly reduced the M1-like (lipopolysaccharide, LPS-induced) BV2 response, spared the LPS-induced phagocytic ability of BV2 and had no effect on the genes related to metabolism and that effects on phenotype were partially dependent on the presence of HSP-70 but not p53. This study demonstrates that the neuroprotective effects of PFT-µ in HI-induced NE may include an anti-inflammatory effect on microglia and adds to the evidence that this drug might be of clinical interest for the treatment of NE.© 2015 S.

However, our results reported here indicate co-expression of PKM1 and PKM2 and their possible physical interaction in cancer cells. We show that knockdown of either PKM1 or PKM2 differentially affects net PK activity, viability, and cellular ATP levels of the lung carcinoma cell lines H1299 and A549. The stable knockdown of PK isoforms in A549 cells significantly reduced the cellular ATP level, whereas in H1299 cells the level of ATP was unaltered. Interestingly, the PKM1/2 knockdown in H1299 cells activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy to maintain energy homeostasis. In contrast, knocking down either of the PKM isoforms in A549 cells lacking LKB1, a serine/threonine protein kinase upstream of AMPK, failed to activate AMPK and sustain energy homeostasis and resulted in apoptosis. Moreover, in a similar genetic background of silenced PKM1 or PKM2, the knocking down of AMPKα1/2 catalytic subunit in H1299 cells induced apoptosis. Our findings help explain why previous targeting of PKM2 in cancer cells to control tumor growth has not met with the expected success. We suggest that this lack of success is because of AMPK-mediated energy metabolism rewiring, protecting cancer cell viability. On the basis of our observations, we propose an alternative therapeutic strategy of silencing either of the PKM isoforms along with AMPK in tumors.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050539>Diverse Roles of  in Immune Responses: Novel Insights Into Immuno-Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Lack of immune system cells or impairment in differentiation of immune cells is the basis for many chronic diseases.

For example, M1 macrophages exhibit a broken TCA cycle and have a pro-inflammatory role. By contrast,  macrophages undergo β-oxidation to produce anti-inflammatory responses.

However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on energy metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase , lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the energy demand.

Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), a critical regulator of the metabolism, growth and metastasis of cancer cells, has been confirmed to be overexpressed in various human cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of HSP90 and PKM2 overexpression in HCC remain unknown.The expression of HSP90 and PKM2 in HCC specimens and cells were detected by immunoblotting and immunostaining. The interaction between HSP90 and PKM2 was confirmed by tandem affinity purification, co-immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S transferase (GST)-pulldown assay.In this study, we found that HSP90 could bind to PKM2 and subsequently increased PKM2 abundance in HCC cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that HSP90 level was positively correlated with PKM2 level in HCC tissues. Mechanistically, HSP90 was found to increase the phosphorylation of PKM2 at Thr-328. Protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) formed a protein complex with HSP90 and PKM2, and directly mediated Thr-328 phosphorylation of PKM2 induced by HSP90. Thr-328 phosphorylation was critical for maintaining PKM2 stability and its biological functions in regulating glycolysis,  respiration, proliferation and apoptosis. Functionally, we found that HSP90 promoted the glycolysis and proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells in a PKM2 dependent manner. In vivo experiments disclosed that PKM2 was required for the promoting effects of HSP90 on the growth of HCC cells in mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2 was correlated with poor clinicopathological features including high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, large tumor size, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2, and a combination of these proteins could strongly predict the poor prognosis of HCC patients.We suggest that HSP90 potentiates the glycolysis and proliferation, reduces the apoptosis and thus enhances the growth of HCC cells through PKM2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526248>Centromere protein F (CENPF), a microtubule binding protein, modulates cancer metabolism by regulating pyruvate kinase  phosphorylation signaling.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second leading cause of male cancer-related death in North America. Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered metabolism and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase , a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPF cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer metabolism, potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning.

However, it remains unknown as to whether PKM2 has an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial function. We report in this work that PKM2 overexpression inhibits the expression of Drp1 and results in the mitochondrial fusion. The ATP production was found to be decreased, the mtDNA copy number elevated and the expression level of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I, III, V depressed in PKM2 overexpressed cells. PKM2 overexpression showed a decreased p53 protein level and a shorter p53 half-life. In contrast, PKM2 knockdown resulted in increased p53 expression and prolonged half-life of p53. PKM2 could directly bind with both p53 and MDM2 and promote MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. The dimeric PKM2 significantly suppressed p53 expression compared with the other PKM2 mutants. The reverse relationship between PKM2 and Drp1 was further confirmed in a large number of clinical samples.

However, the prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias in unselected AMA--positive patients and the impact of AMA- on supraventricular arrhythmias have yet to be fully investigated. Methods We analyzed 384 patients (116 men; age, 60 [48-69] years), who underwent AMA- testing following the detection of elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. Supraventricular arrhythmias involving atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, sick sinus syndrome, and atrial standstill were confirmed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram, 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, and physician-assigned diagnoses within the three years before and two years after the AMA- test. Results Seventy-seven (20%) patients were positive for AMA-. The prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias among AMA--positive patients was higher than that among AMA--negative patients (14% vs. 6%, p=0.008). A univariate analysis showed that supraventricular arrhythmias were associated with AMA- positivity, aging, congestive heart failure, and the CHADS score. The multivariate analysis determined that AMA- positivity was an independent risk factor for supraventricular arrhythmias (odds ratio 3.52, p=0.011). Among the AMA--positive patients, the AMA- titer did not differ to a statistically significant extent, regardless of the presence or absence of supraventricular arrhythmias. Multiple supraventricular arrhythmias with extremely low atrial deflections was a characteristic finding in AMA--positive patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Conclusion AMA- enhances the risk of supraventricular arrhythmias, indicating the possible involvement of the atrial myocardium and the formation of an arrhythmogenic substrate.

A lipid profile consisting of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) was obtained on fasting blood samples at baseline and 12 months.FSS scores decreased from a baseline of 5.51 (95% CI: 4.86, 6.16) to a mean of 3.03 (95% CI: 2.23, 3.82) at 12 months (p < 0.001). At 12 months, increases in HDL-C (mean change: +6.0 mg/dl; 95% CI: 0.3, 12.0; p = 0.049) and decreases in BMI (mean change: -2.6 kg/; 95% CI: -3.6, -2.5; p < 0.001), LDL-C (mean change: -10.4 mg/dl; 95% CI:-19.7, -1.2; p = 0.029), TG (mean change: -29.2 mg/dl; 95% CI: -44.3, -14.2; p = 0.001), TG to HDL-C ratio (mean change: -0.6; 95% CI: -1.0, -0.3; p = 0.002) and TC to HDL-C ratio (mean change:-0.6; 95% CI: -1.0, -0.3; p = 0.003) were observed compared to baseline. Improvements in FSS were associated with increases in HDL-C (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.1, -0.0004; p = 0.048) and changes in TC (p = 0.005) from baseline to 12 months.Lipid profile variables are associated with improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a diet-based multimodal intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611892>The effect of physical stimuli on the expression level of key elements in mitochondrial biogenesis.</a></h2><p>Proper mitochondrial function is crucial for intact cellular homeostasis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is clearly involved in the pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative- and age-related chronic disorders. The aim of this study is to stimulate cellular production of important compounds of mitochondrial biogenesis, namely in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)- and Sirtuin (SIRT)-systems. We studied the effect of cold challenge and training on the mRNA expression levels of some compounds of these systems in different brain areas of mice. With regard to the PGC-system, the mRNA levels of the full- and N-truncated isoforms, and those of the two promoters (brain-specific, reference) were measured. In case of Sirtuins, the mRNA levels of SIRT1 and SIRT3-M1//M3 were assessed. We found the following expression level alterations: cooling resulted in the elevation of cortical SIRT3-M1 levels and the decrease of cerebellar SIRT3-M3 levels after 200 min. 900 min of cold exposure resulted in the reduction of cortical SIRT1 and striatal SIRT3-M1 levels. A prominent elevation could be observed in the levels of all PGC-1α isoforms in the cerebellum after 12 days of training. The 12 days of exercise resulted in increased cerebellar SIRT3-M1 and SIRT3- mRNA levels as well. Although the efficacy of cooling core body and brain temperature is questionable, we found that training exerted a clear effect. The cause of the prominent cerebellar elevation of PGC-, and Sirtuin isoforms could be an increase in synaptic plasticity between Purkinje cells, which facilitates better motor coordination and more precise movement integration. We propose that these systems may serve as promising targets for future therapeutic studies in neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we tested whether the targeted inhibition of EGFR may revert this effect and reactivate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Sensitive (HCC827) and resistant (H1975 and H1993) NSCLC cells were treated with a panel of EGFR or MET inhibitors, and then tested for changes of EGFR signaling, glycolytic cascade, and mitochondrial function. Silencing of key glycolytic enzymes was then performed with targeted siRNAs. Furthermore, tumor-bearing nude mice treated with EGFR inhibitors were evaluated with (18)F-FDG PET/CT and tumors were analyzed for glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins.Effective inhibition of EGFR signaling in NSCLC cells induced a dramatic reduction of hexokinase II (HKII) and phospho-pyruvate kinase  (p-PKM2, Tyr105) levels as well as an upregulation of mitochondrial complexes subunits (OXPHOS). Accordingly, a decreased lactate secretion and increased intracellular ATP levels were also observed in response to EGFR inhibitors. Downregulation of HKII and PKM2 by targeted siRNA transfection did not cause upregulation of OXPHOS but enhanced the effects of EGFR TKIs. Conversely, selective inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 caused OXPHOS upregulation and glycolysis inhibition, respectively. Similar findings were obtained in tumors from animals treated with appropriate EGFR inhibitors.Our findings indicate that EGFR inhibitors may reactivate oxidative phosphorylation of cancer cells and provide a mechanistic clue for the rational combination of agents targeting EGFR-dependent proliferation and glucose metabolism in cancer therapy.©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862497>Arabidopsis mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 3 (AtVDAC3) protein interacts with thioredoxin .</a></h2><p>Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are conserved mitochondrial outer membrane proteins.

The goal of the present study was to test whether the 4F-mediated differentiation of MDMs (monocyte-derived macrophages) requires the induction of an oxidative metabolic programme. 4F treatment induced several genes in MDMs that play an important role in lipid metabolism, including PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) and CD36. Addition of 4F was associated with a significant increase in FA (fatty acid) uptake and oxidation compared with vehicle treatment. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by measurement of the OCR (oxygen-consumption rate). 4F increased basal and ATP-linked OCR as well as maximal uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. These changes were associated with a significant increase in ΔΨm (mitochondrial membrane potential). The increase in metabolic activity in 4F-treated MDMs was attenuated by etomoxir, an inhibitor of mitochondrial FA uptake. Finally, addition of the PPARγ antagonist T0070907 to 4F-treated MDMs reduced the expression of CD163 and CD36, cell-surface markers for  macrophages, and reduced basal and ATP-linked OCR. These results support our hypothesis that the 4F-mediated differentiation of MDMs to an anti-inflammatory phenotype is due, in part, to an increase in FA uptake and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28194019>IL-25 stimulates  macrophage polarization and thereby promotes mitochondrial respiratory capacity and lipolysis in adipose tissues against obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity and associated metabolic diseases are characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammatory state with the infiltration of many inflammatory cells, especially macrophages. Immune molecules, including some cytokines, have a close relationship with metabolism. Interleukin (IL)-25 is a member of the IL-17 cytokine family that can regulate macrophages and alleviate some metabolic dysfunction; however, its role and mechanisms in lipid metabolism remain to be extensively clarified. Human serum and liver biopsy specimens, high-fat diet-induced obesity mice and DB/DB (Lepr-/-) animal models were used to examine IL-25 expression in obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). To observe the role of IL-25 in lipid metabolism, model mice were administered with IL-25 or adoptively transferred with IL-25-educated macrophages in vivo, whereas bone marrow-derived macrophages, the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and adipocytes differentiated from 3T3-L1 were used in vitro. IL-25 was decreased in NAFLD patients and obese mice. In addition, IL-25 reduced body weight gain and lipid accumulation, enhanced lipid uptake by macrophages and increased the expression of lipolysis and β-oxidation enzymes via alternatively activating macrophages. IL-25 also promoted lipolysis and suppressed lipogenesis in adipocytes co-cultured with the IL-25-educated macrophages. Furthermore, IL-25 improved the mitochondrial respiratory capacity and oxygen consumption rate of macrophages and produced more NAD/NADH and ATP. In conclusion, IL-25 can stimulate  macrophage polarization and thereby promote lipolysis and mitochondrial respiratory capacity, highlighting the potential for IL-25 to be used as a therapeutic agent against obesity and associated metabolic syndromes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27041089>Direct effects of airborne PM2.5 exposure on macrophage polarizations.</a></h2><p>Exposure of atmospheric particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5μm (PM2.5) is epidemiologically associated with illnesses. Potential effects of air pollutants on innate immunity have raised concerns. As the first defense line, macrophages are able to induce inflammatory response. However, whether PM2.5 exposure affects macrophage polarizations remains unclear.We used freshly isolated macrophages as a model system to demonstrate effects of PM2.5 on macrophage polarizations. The expressions of cytokines and key molecular markers were detected by real-time PCR, and flow cytometry. The specific inhibitors and gene deletion technologies were used to address the molecular mechanisms.PM2.5 increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). PM2.5 also enhanced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 polarization even though there was no evidence in the change of cell viability. However, PM2.5 significantly decreased the number of  in a dose dependent manner. Pre-treatment with NAC, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevented the increase of ROS and rescued the PM2.5-impacted M1 but not  response. However, mTOR deletion partially rescued the effects of PM2.5 to reduce  polarization.PM2.5 exposure significantly enhanced inflammatory M1 polarization through ROS pathway, whereas PM2.5 exposure inhibited anti-inflammatory  polarization through mTOR-dependent pathway.The present studies suggested that short-term exposure of PM2.5 acts on the balance of inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory  macrophage polarizations, which may be involved in air pollution-induced immune disorders and diseases.

The scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), provides innate immune defense against inhaled particles and pathogens; however, a receptor for asbestos has not been identified. We hypothesized that MARCO acts as an initial signaling receptor for asbestos, polarizes macrophages to a profibrotic  phenotype, and is required for the development of asbestos-induced fibrosis. Compared with normal subjects, alveolar macrophages isolated from patients with asbestosis express higher amounts of MARCO and have greater profibrotic polarization. Arginase 1 (40-fold) and IL-10 (265-fold) were higher in patients. In vivo, the genetic deletion of MARCO attenuated the profibrotic environment and pulmonary fibrosis in mice exposed to chrysotile. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from MARCO(-/-) mice polarize to an M1 phenotype, whereas wild-type mice have higher Ym1 (>3.0-fold) and nearly 7-fold more active TGF-β1 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Arg(432) and Arg(434) in domain V of MARCO are required for the polarization of macrophages to a profibrotic phenotype as mutation of these residues reduced FIZZ1 expression (17-fold) compared with cells expressing MARCO. These observations demonstrate that a macrophage membrane protein regulates the fibrotic response to lung injury and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27532680>Prolonged Exposure of Primary Human Muscle Cells to Plasma Fatty Acids Associated with Obese Phenotype Induces Persistent Suppression of Muscle Mitochondrial ATP Synthase β Subunit.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies show reduced abundance of the β-subunit of mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase (β-F1-ATPase) in skeletal muscle of obese individuals. The β-F1-ATPase forms the catalytic core of the ATP synthase, and it is critical for ATP production in muscle. The mechanism(s) impairing β-F1-ATPase metabolism in obesity, however, are not completely understood. First, we studied total muscle protein synthesis and the translation efficiency of β-F1-ATPase in obese (BMI, 36±1 kg/) and lean (BMI, 22±1 kg/) subjects. Both total protein synthesis (0.044±0.006 vs 0.066±0.006%·h-1) and translation efficiency of β-F1-ATPase (0.0031±0.0007 vs 0.0073±0.0004) were lower in muscle from the obese subjects when compared to the lean controls (P<0.05). We then evaluated these same responses in a primary cell culture model, and tested the specific hypothesis that circulating non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in obesity play a role in the responses observed in humans. The findings on total protein synthesis and translation efficiency of β-F1-ATPase in primary myotubes cultured from a lean subject, and after exposure to NEFA extracted from serum of an obese subject, were similar to those obtained in humans. Among candidate microRNAs (i.e., non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression), we identified miR-127-5p in preventing the production of β-F1-ATPase. Muscle expression of miR-127-5p negatively correlated with β-F1-ATPase protein translation efficiency in humans (r = - 0.6744; P<0.01), and could be modeled in vitro by prolonged exposure of primary myotubes derived from the lean subject to NEFA extracted from the obese subject. On the other hand, locked nucleic acid inhibitor synthesized to target miR-127-5p significantly increased β-F1-ATPase translation efficiency in myotubes (0.6±0.1 vs 1.3±0.3, in control vs exposure to 50 nM inhibitor; P<0.05). Our experiments implicate circulating NEFA in obesity in suppressing muscle protein metabolism, and establish impaired β-F1-ATPase translation as an important consequence of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231232>Potential crosstalk of Ca2+-ROS-dependent mechanism involved in apoptosis of Kasumi-1 cells mediated by heme oxygenase-1 small interfering RNA.</a></h2><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires new therapies on the molecular level.

For the first time, we verified that endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways were activated by small interfering RNA that targeted-silenced the expression of HO-1 in AML- Kasumi-1 cells.

Although it has long been known that CL plays an important role in mitochondrial bioenergetics, recent evidence in the yeast model indicates that CL is also essential for intermediary metabolism. To gain insight into the function of CL in energy metabolism in mammalian cells, here we analyzed the metabolic flux of [U-C]glucose in a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line, TAZ-KO, which is CL-deficient because of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the CL-remodeling enzyme tafazzin (TAZ). TAZ-KO cells exhibited decreased flux of [U-C]glucose to [C]acetyl-CoA and  and M4 isotopomers of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase, the predominant enzyme for anaplerotic replenishing of the TCA cycle, was elevated in TAZ-KO cells, which also exhibited increased sensitivity to the pyruvate carboxylase inhibitor phenylacetate. We attributed a decreased carbon flux from glucose to acetyl-CoA in the TAZ-KO cells to a ∼50% decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, which was observed in both TAZ-KO cells and cardiac tissue from TAZ-KO mice. Protein-lipid overlay experiments revealed that PDH binds to CL, and supplementing digitonin-solubilized TAZ-KO  with CL restored PDH activity to WT levels.  from TAZ-KO cells exhibited an increase in phosphorylated PDH, levels of which were reduced in the presence of supplemented CL. These findings indicate that CL is required for optimal PDH activation, generation of acetyl-CoA, and TCA cycle function, findings that link the key mitochondrial lipid CL to TCA cycle function and energy metabolism.© 2019 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895584>Effects of lobeglitazone, a novel thiazolidinedione, on adipose tissue remodeling and brown and beige adipose tissue development in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of long-term treatment with lobeglitazone, a novel thiazolidinedione-based activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, on adipose tissue (AT), focusing on its effects on insulin resistance in obese db/db mice.Seven-week-old male db/db mice were assigned to either a vehicle-treated (n=8) or lobeglitazone-treated (n=8) group. Lobeglitazone (1 mg kg daily) was injected intraperitoneally for 20 weeks.Lobeglitazone treatment for 20 weeks resulted in a remarkably improved glycemic index, including significantly decreased glucose levels, enhanced insulin sensitivity and preserved pancreatic beta cells. Both whole body and subcutaneous AT weight increased in the lobeglitazone-treated group. However, lobeglitazone induced an increase in the number of small adipocyte in both epididymal and subcutaneous AT, with a significant weight decrease in the epididymal AT of db/db mice. Using flow cytometry, the CD11c-positive M1 macrophages and CD206-positive  macrophages in the epididymal AT were observed to exhibit a decreased M1-to- ratio in lobeglitazone-treated db/db mice. Furthermore, in the lobeglitazone-treated group, interscapular brown AT was clearly visualized by F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (F-FDG-PET/CT) and its mass was significantly greater than that of the vehicle-treated group. In the lobeglitazone-treated group, beige-specific gene expression and the number of  in white AT were upregulated. Lobeglitazone, with upregulating interferon regulatory factor-4 (a key transcriptional regulator of thermogenesis), promoted the development of brown adipocytes and the differentiation of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes.Long-term lobeglitazone treatment has a beneficial role in remodeling and ameliorating inflammation in white AT and in glycemic control, in relation to insulin sensitivity in obese db/db mice. Moreover, lobeglitazone induced the differentiation of brown and beige adipocytes. Collectively, our data suggest that lobeglitazone treatment provides promising effects on white and brown AT as well as great improvement in glycemic control, as a potent insulin sensitizer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29051480>NOX4 functions as a mitochondrial energetic sensor coupling cancer metabolic reprogramming to drug resistance.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanisms that couple glycolysis to cancer drug resistance remain unclear.

It is released into mouse and human blood during acute liver injury, where is has a short half-life. The function of CPS1 in blood and the reason for its short half-life in serum are unknown. We show that CPS1 is released normally into mouse and human bile, and pathologically into blood during acute liver injury. Other cytoplasmic and mitochondrial urea cycle enzymes are also found in normal mouse bile. Serum, bile, and purified CPS1 manifest sedimentation properties that overlap with extracellular vesicles, due to the propensity of CPS1 to aggregate despite being released primarily as a soluble protein. During liver injury, CPS1 in blood is rapidly sequestered by monocytes, leading to monocyte -polarization and homing to the liver independent of its enzyme activity. Recombinant CPS1 (rCPS1), but not control r-transferrin, increases hepatic macrophage numbers and phagocytic activity. Notably, rCPS1 does not activate hepatic macrophages directly; rather, it activates bone marrow and circulating monocytes that then home to the liver. rCPS1 administration prevents mouse liver damage induced by Fas ligand or acetaminophen, but this protection is absent in macrophage-deficient mice. Moreover, rCPS1 protects from acetaminophen-induced liver injury even when given therapeutically after injury induction. In summary, CPS1 is normally found in bile but is released by hepatocytes into blood upon liver damage.

With age, most adult patients with GSDIa develop hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), which can progress to hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In this study, we characterized metabolic reprogramming and cellular defense alterations during tumorigenesis in the liver of hepatocyte-specific G6pc deficient (L.G6pc) mice, which develop all the hepatic hallmarks of GSDIa.Liver metabolism and cellular defenses were assessed at pretumoral (four months) and tumoral (nine months) stages in L.G6pc mice fed a high fat/high sucrose (HF/HS) diet.In response to HF/HS diet, hepatocarcinogenesis was highly accelerated since 85% of L.G6pc mice developed multiple hepatic tumors after nine months, with 70% classified as HCA and 30% as HCC. Tumor development was associated with high expression of malignancy markers of HCC, i.e. alpha-fetoprotein, glypican 3 and β-catenin. In addition, L.G6pc livers exhibited loss of tumor suppressors. Interestingly, L.G6pc steatosis exhibited a low-inflammatory state and was less pronounced than in wild-type livers. This was associated with an absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis, while HCA/HCC showed a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the absence of TGF-β1 increase. In HCA/HCC, glycolysis was characterized by a marked expression of PK-, decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and a decrease of pyruvate entry in the , confirming a "Warburg-like" phenotype. These metabolic alterations led to a decrease in antioxidant defenses and autophagy and chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress in L.G6pc livers and tumors. Interestingly, autophagy was reactivated in HCA/HCC.The metabolic remodeling in L.G6pc liver generates a preneoplastic status and leads to a loss of cellular defenses and tumor suppressors that facilitates tumor development in GSDI.Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD1a) is a rare metabolic disease characterized by hypoglycemia, steatosis, excessive glycogen accumulation and tumor development in the liver. In this study, we have observed that GSDIa livers reprogram their metabolism in a similar way to cancer cells, which facilitates tumor formation and progression, in the absence of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, hepatic burden due to overload of glycogen and lipids in the cells leads to a decrease in cellular defenses, such as autophagy, which could further promote tumorigenesis in the case of GSDI.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In addition, mitophagy in macrophages involves PINK1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream MFN2 and MFN2-facilitated recruitment of Parkin to damaged , and macrophage-specific deletion of Mfn2 aggravates kidney fibrosis. Moreover, mitophagy regulators were downregulated in human CKD kidney and TGF-β1-treated human renal macrophages, whereas Mdivi1 treatment suppressed mitophagy mediators and promoted fibrotic response. Taken together, our study is the first to demonstrate that macrophage mitophagy plays a protective role against kidney fibrosis via regulating PINK1/MFN2/Parkin-mediated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362242>circNrxn2 Promoted WAT  via Sponging miR-103 to Relieve Its Inhibition of FGF10 in HFD Mice.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of excess white adipose tissue (WAT) has harmful consequences on metabolic health. WAT  confers beneficial effects on adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In this study, it was found out that circNrxn2 sponged miR-103 and enhanced FGF10 levels in HFD mice WAT. We discovered that circNrxn2 promoted WAT  and mitochondria functions. Furthermore, circNrxn2 also increased  macrophage polarization in HFD mouse adipose tissue, and the PPARγ signaling pathway participated in these biological processes. Moreover, eliminating adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) by clodronate-crippled circNrxn2 promoted WAT , and the simulation co-culture of macrophages and adipocytes results suggested that circNrxn2 promoted WAT  through increasing  macrophage polarization. Our finding revealed that circNrxn2 acted as an endogenous miR-103 sponge, blocked miR-103 effects, and relieved its inhibition of FGF10 expression to promote WAT  through increasing  macrophage polarization.

Glutathione transferase  (GSTM2) activity of astrocytes by catalysing the conjugation of aminochrome with glutathione, can offer protection against aminochrome toxicity. Some medicinal toxicity through this plants may exert protective effect against aminochrome mechanism.In the present study, extracts from plants native to Cameroon, such as  (leaves),  (barks),  (seeds),  (barks) were evaluated for their protection against aminochrome-induced toxicity in human glioblastoma/ astrocytoma U373MG wild type and U373MGsiGT6 cells in which GSTM2 expression was 74% silenced. The cells were pre-incubated with the plant extracts for 2 hr before addition of aminochrome (75 μM) and measurement of cell death/viability by flow cytometry after 24 hr incubation.The extract of A.  (1 μg/ml),  (25 μg/ml),  (25 μg/ml) and  (25μg/ml)  decreased aminochrome-induced toxicity in U373siGST6 and U373MG cells. However, only  and  significantly increased the mitochondria membrane potential in U373siGST6 cells following aminochrome treatment.The results indicate that extracts of some Cameroon plants can provide protection against aminochrome-induced toxicity and mitochondria dysfunction in human glioblastoma/astrocytoma cells. Although further identification of active components of these extracts is needed, potential usefulness of these compounds in Parkinson's disease may be suggested.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30741586>Influenza  protein regulates MAVS-mediated signaling pathway through interacting with MAVS and increasing ROS production.</a></h2><p>Influenza A virus can evade host innate immune response that is involved in several viral proteins with complicated mechanisms.

Serum analysis of 67 patients with fluorescence patterns detected on Hep-2 cells suggestive of PBC-related antibodies and three groups of patients (15 PBC, 16 PBC suspect and 48 disease controls) was carried out. All samples were tested by both a qualitative test multiplexed line-blot Autoimmune Liver Disease Profile Euroline and by a quantitative test EliA- IgG.

All women in this study had suspicious mammography assessment and underwent a breast biopsy. We used indirect immunofluorescence, the crithidia assay for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and multiple ELISAs for extractable nuclear antigens.Autoantibodies were detected in virtually all patients with breast cancer, predominantly of the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes. The profile detected in breast cancer sera showed distinctive features, such as antibodies targeting , centrosomes, centromeres, nucleoli, cytoskeleton, and multiple nuclear dots. The majority of sera showing anti-mitochondrial antibodies did not react with the  component of pyruvate dehydrogenase, characteristic of primary biliary cirrhosis. Anti-centromere antibodies were mainly anti-CENP-B. ELISAs for extractable nuclear antigens and the assays for dsDNA were negative.The distinctive autoantibody profile detected in BC sera is the expression of tumor immunogenicity. Although some of these features resemble those in the rheumatic autoimmune diseases and primary biliary cirrhosis, the data suggest the involvement of an entirely different set of epithelial antigens in breast cancer. High titer autoantibodies targeting centrosomes, centromeres, and  were detected in a small group of healthy women with suspicious mammography assessment and no cancer by biopsy; this suggests that the process triggering autoantibody formation starts in the pre-malignant phase and that future studies using validated autoantibody panels may allow detection of breast cancer risk in asymptomatic women. Autoantibodies developing in breast cancer are not epiphenomena, but likely reflect an antigen-driven autoimmune response triggered by epitopes developing in the mammary gland during breast carcinogenesis. Our results support the validity of the multiple studies reporting association of autoantibodies with breast cancer. Results further suggest significant promise for the development of panels of breast cancer-specific, premalignant-phase autoantibodies, as well as studies on the autoantibody response to tumor associated antigens in the pathogenesis of cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28412312>Updates to a C metabolic flux analysis model for evaluating energy metabolism in cultured cerebellar granule neurons from neonatal rats.</a></h2><p>A hexose phosphate recycling model previously developed to infer fluxes through the major glucose consuming pathways in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) from neonatal rats metabolizing [1,2-C]glucose was revised by considering reverse flux through the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and symmetrical succinate oxidation within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The model adjusts three flux ratios to effect C distribution in the hexose, pentose, and triose phosphate pools, and in TCA cycle malate to minimize the error between predicted and measured C labeling in exported lactate (i.e., unlabeled, single-, double-, and triple-labeled; M, M1, , and M3, respectively). Inclusion of reverse non-oxidative PPP flux substantially increased the number of calculations but ultimately had relatively minor effects on the labeling of glycolytic metabolites. From the error-minimized solution in which the predicted M-M3 lactate differed by 0.49% from that measured by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, the neurons exhibited negligible forward non-oxidative PPP flux. Thus, no glucose was used by the pentose cycle despite explicit consideration of hexose phosphate recycling.  consumed only 16% of glucose while 45% was exported as lactate by aerobic glycolysis. The remaining 39% of glucose was shunted to pentose phosphates presumably for de novo nucleotide synthesis, but the proportion metabolized through the oxidative PPP vs. the reverse non-oxidative PPP could not be determined. The lactate exported as M1 (2.5%) and M3 (1.2%) was attributed to malic enzyme, which was responsible for 7.8% of pyruvate production (vs. 92.2% by glycolysis). The updated model is more broadly applicable to different cell types by considering bi-directional flux through the non-oxidative PPP. Its application to cultured neurons utilizing glucose as the sole exogenous substrate has demonstrated substantial oxygen-independent glucose utilization by aerobic glycolysis as well as the oxidative PPP and/or reverse non-oxidative PPP, but negligible glucose consumption by the pentose cycle.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we show that PKM2 is a physiological substrate of SIRT5 and that SIRT5-regulated hypersuccinylation inhibits the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2 by promoting its tetramer-to-dimer transition. Moreover, a succinylation-mimetic PKM2 K311E mutation promotes nuclear accumulation and increases protein kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that SIRT5-dependent succinylation promotes PKM2 entry into nucleus, where a complex of PKM2-HIF1α is formed at the promoter of IL-1β gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Activation of PKM2 using TEPP-46 attenuates Sirt5-deficiency-mediated IL-1β upregulation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Finally, we find that Sirt5-deficient mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, which is associated with Sirt5 deficiency prompted PKM2 hypersuccinylation and boosted IL-1β production. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism by which SIRT5 suppresses the pro-inflammatory response in macrophages at least in part by regulating PKM2 succinylation, activity, and function.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

To the best of our knowledge on the role of  in the modulation of neuroinflammation, we focused on the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), known to control mitochondrial functions and to be implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In primary microglial cultures, the M1 stimulus lipopolysaccharide induced an early and transitory decrease in UCP2 levels. The initial UCP2 down-regulation was paralleled by mitochondrial inner membrane potential (mMP) depolarization and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. The key role of UCP2 in controlling mMP and reactive oxygen species production was confirmed by both pharmacological inhibition and down-regulation by RNA interference. Additionally, UCP2-silenced microglia stimulated with lipopolysaccharide showed an enhanced inflammatory response, characterized by a greater production of nitric oxide and interleukin-6. UCP2 was differently regulated by  stimuli, as indicated by its persistent up-regulation by interleukin-4. In UCP2-silenced microglia, interleukin-4 failed to induce  genes (mannose receptor 1 and interleukin-10) and to reduce M1 genes (inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumour necrosis factor-α). Our findings indicate that UCP2 is central to the process of microglial activation, with opposite regulation of M1 and  responses, and point to UCP2 manipulation as a potential strategy for redirecting microglial response towards protective phenotypes in several brain diseases where neuroinflammation is recognized to contribute to neurodegeneration. We show that the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is central to the process of microglial activation, with opposite regulation of M1 and  responses. In UCP2-silenced microglia, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers an enhanced inflammatory response characterized by a greater expression of M1 genes, whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4) fails in inducing  genes and reducing M1 genes. We propose UCP2 manipulation as a potential strategy for redirecting microglial response towards protective phenotypes.© 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465230>Acetylcholine Attenuates Hypoxia/Reoxygenation Injury by Inducing Mitophagy Through PINK1/Parkin Signal Pathway in H9c2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Acetylcholine (ACh) protected against cardiac injury via promoting autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, however, the involvement of mitophagy in ACh-elicited cardioprotection remains unknown. In the present study, H9c2 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and ACh treatment during reoxygenation. Mitophagy markers PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin translocation were examined using western blot and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected with fluorescence staining. We found that H/R-treated cells exhibited reduced levels of PINK1 and Parkin in , accompanied with decreased autophagy flux (reduced LC3-II/LC3-I and increased p62). Conversely, ACh increased PINK1 and Parkin translocation to  and enhanced autophagy proteins. Confocal imaging of Parkin and MitoTracker Green-labeled  further confirmed ACh-induced mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, which was reversed by  receptor antagonist methoctramine and  receptor siRNA, suggesting ACh could induce mitophagy by  receptor after H/R. Mitophagy inhibitor 3-methaladenine abolished ACh-induced mitoprotection, manifesting as aggravated mitochondrial morphology disruption, ATP and membrane potential depletion, increased ROS overproduction, and apoptosis. Furthermore, PINK1/Parkin siRNA attenuated the protective effects of ACh against ATP loss and oxidative stress due to mitochondrial-dependent injury. Taken together, ACh promoted mitochondrial translocation of PINK1/Parkin to stimulate cytoprotective mitophagy via  receptor, which may provide beneficial targets in the preservation of cardiac homeostasis against H/R injury.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909720>Mitochondrial Substrate-Level Phosphorylation as Energy Source for Glioblastoma: Review and Hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant of the primary adult brain cancers. Ultrastructural and biochemical evidence shows that GBM cells exhibit mitochondrial abnormalities incompatible with energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Under such conditions, the mitochondrial F0-F1 ATP synthase operates in reverse at the expense of ATP hydrolysis to maintain a moderate membrane potential. Moreover, expression of the dimeric  isoform of pyruvate kinase in GBM results in diminished ATP output, precluding a significant ATP production from glycolysis. If ATP synthesis through both glycolysis and OxPhos was impeded, then where would GBM cells obtain high-energy phosphates for growth and invasion? Literature is reviewed suggesting that the succinate-CoA ligase reaction in the tricarboxylic acid cycle can substantiate sufficient ATP through mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation (mSLP) to maintain GBM growth when OxPhos is impaired. Production of high-energy phosphates would be supported by glutaminolysis-a hallmark of GBM metabolism-through the sequential conversion of glutamine → glutamate → alpha-ketoglutarate → succinyl CoA → succinate. Equally important, provision of ATP through mSLP would maintain the adenine nucleotide translocase in forward mode, thus preventing the reverse-operating F0-F1 ATP synthase from depleting cytosolic ATP reserves. Because glucose and glutamine are the primary fuels driving the rapid growth of GBM and most tumors for that matter, simultaneous restriction of these two substrates or inhibition of mSLP should diminish cancer viability, growth, and invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253638>Antipurinergic therapy for autism-An in-depth review.</a></h2><p>Are the symptoms of autism caused by a treatable metabolic syndrome that traces to the abnormal persistence of a normal, alternative functional state of ? A small clinical trial published in 2017 suggests this is possible. Based on a new unifying theory of pathogenesis for autism called the cell danger response (CDR) hypothesis, this study of 10 boys, ages 5-14years, showed that all 5 boys who received antipurinergic therapy (APT) with a single intravenous dose of suramin experienced improvements in all the core symptoms of autism that lasted for 5-8weeks. Language, social interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive movements all improved. Two children who were non-verbal spoke their first sentences. None of these improvements were observed in the placebo group. Larger and longer studies are needed to confirm this promising discovery. This review introduces the concept of  (anti-inflammatory) and M1 (pro-inflammatory)  that are polarized along a functional continuum according to cell stress. The pathophysiology of the CDR, the complementary functions of M1 and  , relevant gene-environment interactions, and the metabolic underpinnings of behavior are discussed as foundation stones for understanding the improvements in ASD behaviors produced by antipurinergic therapy in this small clinical trial.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

M1 macrophages are commonly associated with the generation of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas  macrophages are anti-inflammatory and often associated with tumor progression and fibrosis development. Macrophages produce high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent evidence suggests ROS can potentially regulate macrophage phenotype. In addition, macrophages phenotypes are closely related to their metabolic patterns, particularly fatty acid/cholesterol metabolism.

Depending on the type of infection and the microenvironment macrophages can rapidly change their phenotype towards the proinflammatory M1 or antiinflammatory  one. The process of changing the cell phenotype is termed "reprogramming". This process plays a central role in the immune response and therefore its disturbance triggers the development of disease. Reprogramming of macrophages is provided by intracellular signaling pathways. These paths can also control epigenetic, post-transcriptional and metabolic mechanisms of phenotypic activity of macrophages. Epigenetic mechanisms can be divided into the reprogramming mechanisms towards M1 and  phenotype. A key component of post-transcriptional regulation is micro-mRNA (miR). On M1- and -stimuli macrophages express different sets of miRs. MiRs may form a positive feedback mechanism for quick reprogramming of macrophages and negative feedback mechanisms, to limit excessive inflammation in the case of M1 phenotype and to restrict fall bactericidal activity in the case of  phenotype. Reprogramming of macrophages leads to a change in the metabolism of these cells. Formation of M1 phenotype accompanied by a shift of the arginine metabolism towards NO-synthase activation and increased production of NO, an increase in the contribution of glycolysis to ATP production, increased deposition of bacteriostatic iron. Formation of the  phenotype is accompanied by a shift of the arginine metabolism towards arginase 1 activation and increasing production of urea, increased ATP synthesis in  and increased capture of fatty acids, increased the capture of heme iron. Metabolic control of macrophage phenotype also involves the positive and negative feedback. In general, macrophage reprogramming involves very good coordinated and adapted to each other changes in the activity of signaling, epigenetic, post-translational and metabolic mechanisms. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of reprogramming will assist in selecting the correct effective therapeutic targets to develop new ways for correction of impaired immunity.

Human kallikrein (hKLK1) protects against fibrosis in various pathogenic states. However, the effects of hKLK1 overexpression on cardiac aging-related fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Moreover, the role of hKLK1 in regulating macrophage function leading to cardiac fibrosis has not been investigated. Thus, in this study, we determined the effects of hKLK1 on cardiac aging and explored the mechanisms through which hKLK1 regulated aging-related fibrosis. Echocardiographic measurements showed that aging caused significant alternations in cardiac morphology, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in rats, and hKLK1 overexpression protected against aging-induced cardiac dysfunction. Compared with wild-type hearts, the hKLK1 transgene decreased the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction and excess oxidative stress, leading to decreased recruitment and retention of alternatively activated () macrophages and reduced secretion of profibrotic cytokines mediated by the TGF-β1-Smad3 signaling pathway in hearts of aging rats. Furthermore, these cardioprotective effects of hKLK1 overexpression were associated with the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. HO-induced senescence promoted the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into -type cells induced by IL-4 treatment. Bradykinin treatment relieved the migratory capacity of macrophages induced by HO. Thus, hKLK1 overexpression reduced cardiac fibrosis and improved aging-related cardiac dysfunction through reduced shift of macrophages to  macrophages, indicating that hKLK1 may alleviate aging-related cardiac dysfunction.-Hu, D., Dong, R., Yang, Y., Chen, Z., Tang, Y., Fu, M., Wang, D.

Previously, we showed that -driven pre-senescent phenotype diminishes the capability of vitiligo melanocytes to cope with stressful stimuli. In the current study, we investigated markers of mitochondrial energy metabolism including the PGC1a axis, and then we determined the index of mitochondrial impairment using a cytomic approach. We found in cultured epidermal vitiligo melanocytes, compared to healthy ones, low ATP, increased proton leakage, and altered expression of several glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase II, pyruvic dehydrogenase kinase 1 and pyruvic kinase ), We suggest that the low ATP production may be sufficient in steady-state conditions but it is unable to cover further needs. We also found in vitiligo melanocyrtes hyper-activation of the PGC1α axis, finalized to counteract the energy defect. Cytomic analysis, supported by MitoTracker Red pattern and ex-vivo immunohistochemistry, suggested an increased mitochondrial mass, possibly useful to ensure the essential ATP level. Finally, pharmacological cardiolipin stabilization reverted the energetic impairment, confirming the initial mitochondrial role. In conclusion, we report new insight in the pathogenetic mechanism of viitligo and indicate that the mitochondrial failure rescue by cardiolipin manipulation may be a new intriguing target in treatment development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197174>SIRT2-Mediated Deacetylation and Tetramerization of Pyruvate Kinase Directs Glycolysis and Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Sirtuins participate in sensing nutrient availability and directing metabolic activity to match energy needs with energy production and consumption. However, the pivotal targets for sirtuins in cancer are mainly unknown. In this study, we identify the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) as a critical target of the sirtuin SIRT2 implicated in cancer. PKM2 directs the synthesis of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, the latter of which is transported to  for use in the Krebs cycle to generate ATP. Enabled by a shotgun mass spectrometry analysis founded on tissue culture models, we identified a candidate SIRT2 deacetylation target at PKM2 lysine 305 (K305). Biochemical experiments including site-directed mutants that mimicked constitutive acetylation suggested that acetylation reduced PKM2 activity by preventing tetramerization to the active enzymatic form. Notably, ectopic overexpression of a deacetylated PKM2 mutant in Sirt2-deficient mammary tumor cells altered glucose metabolism and inhibited malignant growth. Taken together, our results argued that loss of SIRT2 function in cancer cells reprograms their glycolytic metabolism via PKM2 regulation, partially explaining the tumor-permissive phenotype of mice lacking Sirt2 Cancer Res; 76(13); 3802-12.©2016 AACR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27499608>The cellular and compartmental profile of mouse retinal glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ~P transferring kinases.</a></h2><p>The homeostatic regulation of cellular ATP is achieved by the coordinated activity of ATP utilization, synthesis, and buffering. Glucose is the major substrate for ATP synthesis through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas intermediary metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle utilizes non-glucose-derived monocarboxylates, amino acids, and alpha ketoacids to support mitochondrial ATP and GTP synthesis. Cellular ATP is buffered by specialized equilibrium-driven high-energy phosphate (~P) transferring kinases. Our goals were twofold: 1) to characterize the gene expression, protein expression, and activity of key synthesizing and regulating enzymes of energy metabolism in the whole mouse retina, retinal compartments, and/or cells and 2) to provide an integrative analysis of the results related to function.mRNA expression data of energy-related genes were extracted from our whole retinal Affymetrix microarray data. Fixed-frozen retinas from adult C57BL/6N mice were used for immunohistochemistry, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and enzymatic histochemistry. The immunoreactivity levels of well-characterized antibodies, for all major retinal cells and their compartments, were obtained using our established semiquantitative confocal and imaging techniques. Quantitative cytochrome oxidase (COX) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was determined histochemically.The Affymetrix data revealed varied gene expression patterns of the ATP synthesizing and regulating enzymes found in the muscle, liver, and brain. Confocal studies showed differential cellular and compartmental distribution of isozymes involved in glucose, glutamate, glutamine, lactate, and creatine metabolism. The pattern and intensity of the antibodies and of the COX and LDH activity showed the high capacity of photoreceptors for aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS. Competition assays with pyruvate revealed that LDH-5 was localized in the photoreceptor inner segments. The combined results indicate that glycolysis is regulated by the compartmental expression of hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase M1, and pyruvate kinase  in photoreceptors, whereas the inner retinal neurons exhibit a lower capacity for glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis. Expression of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, -associated adenylate kinase, and several -associated creatine kinase isozymes was highest in the outer retina, whereas expression of cytosolic adenylate kinase and brain creatine kinase was higher in the cones, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells indicating the diversity of ATP-buffering strategies among retinal neurons. Based on the antibody intensities and the COX and LDH activity, Müller glial cells (MGCs) had the lowest capacity for glycolysis, aerobic glycolysis, and OXPHOS. However, they showed high expression of glutamate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate thiokinase, GABA transaminase, and ~P transferring kinases. This suggests that MGCs utilize TCA cycle anaplerosis and cataplerosis to generate GTP and ~P transferring kinases to produce ATP that supports MGC energy requirements.Our comprehensive and integrated results reveal that the adult mouse retina expresses numerous isoforms of ATP synthesizing, regulating, and buffering genes; expresses differential cellular and compartmental levels of glycolytic, OXPHOS, TCA cycle, and ~P transferring kinase proteins; and exhibits differential layer-by-layer LDH and COX activity. New insights into cell-specific and compartmental ATP and GTP production, as well as utilization and buffering strategies and their relationship with known retinal and cellular functions, are discussed. Developing therapeutic strategies for neuroprotection and treating retinal deficits and degeneration in a cell-specific manner will require such knowledge.

The patients' general condition, clinical manifestations, serum biochemical and immunological parameters were detected. Of the 102 PBC patients, 91 (89.21%) patients were female. The main symptoms in these patients were fatigue, poor appetite, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, stomachache, and abdominal distension. The major signs were jaundice, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, edema, and ascites. The main features of serum biochemical parameters in these patients included the increase of alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), especially the GGT. The anti-mitochondrial antibodies- (AMA-) in 81 and 21 patients was positive and negative, respectively. The differences between the AMA-MA positive and negative groups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). According to clinical manifestation, 102 patients were classified into 2 groups: A non-cirrhosis group (n=56) and a cirrhosis group (n=46). The positive rates in these 2 groups, such as ANA, AMA-, anti-gp210, anti-Sp100, anti-Ro52, anti-PML, were 54.35%, 89.13%, 41.30%, 13.04%, 43.38% and 10.87% vs 57.14%, 71.43%, 42.86%, 12.5%, 51.79% and 3.71%, respectively, with no significant difference between them (P>0.05). However, there was significant difference in the positive rate of anti-3E-EPO between the above 2 groups (86.78% vs 58.93%, P<0.05). The positive rates of AMA- and anti-3E-EPO in 30 patients diagnosed by hepatic histopathological examination were higher than those of other antibodies. PBC mainly affects middle-aged women, and its clinical manifestation is various. The autoantibody tests play an important role in diagnosis of PBC. Checking for AMA-A2 and anti-3E-BPO can improve the positive rate of PBC. Liver histopathological examination may provide useful information on disease severity, which can determine the histological stage when the patient's serum autoantibodies are negative.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26388461>AAV6-mediated Cardiac-specific Overexpression of Ribonucleotide Reductase Enhances Myocardial Contractility.</a></h2><p>Impaired systolic function, resulting from acute injury or congenital defects, leads to cardiac complications and heart failure. Current therapies slow disease progression but do not rescue cardiac function. We previously reported that elevating the cellular 2 deoxy-ATP (dATP) pool in transgenic mice via increased expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme that catalyzes deoxy-nucleotide production, increases myosin-actin interaction and enhances cardiac muscle contractility. For the current studies, we initially injected wild-type mice retro-orbitally with a mixture of adeno-associated virus serotype-6 (rAAV6) containing a miniaturized cardiac-specific regulatory cassette (cTnT(455)) composed of enhancer and promotor portions of the human cardiac troponin T gene (TNNT2) ligated to rat cDNAs encoding either the Rrm1 or Rrm2 subunit. Subsequent studies optimized the system by creating a tandem human RRM1-RRM2 cDNA with a P2A self-cleaving peptide site between the subunits. Both rat and human Rrm1/Rrm2 cDNAs resulted in RNR enzyme overexpression exclusively in the heart and led to a significant elevation of left ventricular (LV) function in normal mice and infarcted rats, measured by echocardiography or isolated heart perfusions, without adverse cardiac remodeling. Our study suggests that increasing RNR levels via rAAV-mediated cardiac-specific expression provide a novel gene therapy approach to potentially enhance cardiac systolic function in animal models and patients with heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26926996>The glycolytic enzyme PKM2 bridges metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction in coronary artery disease.</a></h2><p>Abnormal glucose metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress accelerate cardiovascular disease, a chronic inflammatory condition causing high morbidity and mortality. Here, we report that in monocytes and macrophages of patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), overutilization of glucose promotes excessive and prolonged production of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β, driving systemic and tissue inflammation. In patient-derived monocytes and macrophages, increased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux fuel the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which in turn promote dimerization of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and enable its nuclear translocation. Nuclear PKM2 functions as a protein kinase that phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT3, thus boosting IL-6 and IL-1β production. Reducing glycolysis, scavenging superoxide and enforcing PKM2 tetramerization correct the proinflammatory phenotype of CAD macrophages. In essence, PKM2 serves a previously unidentified role as a molecular integrator of metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress and tissue inflammation and represents a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease.© 2016 Shirai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745857>Differential Expression Patterns of Glycolytic Enzymes and -Dependent Apoptosis in PCOS Patients with Endometrial Hyperplasia, an Early Hallmark of Endometrial Cancer,  and the Impact of Metformin .</a></h2><p>The underlying mechanisms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)-induced endometrial dysfunction are not fully understood, and although accumulating evidence shows that the use of metformin has beneficial effects in PCOS patients, the precise regulatory mechanisms of metformin on endometrial function under PCOS conditions have only been partially explored. To address these clinical challenges, this study aimed to assess the protein expression patterns of glycolytic enzymes, estrogen receptor (ER), and androgen receptor (AR) along with differences in -dependent apoptosis in PCOS patients with and without endometrial hyperplasia  and to investigate the effects of metformin in PCOS patients with endometrial hyperplasia . Here, we showed that compared to non-PCOS patients and PCOS patients without hyperplasia, the endometria from PCOS patients with hyperplasia had a distinct protein expression pattern of glycolytic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase isozyme  isoform (PKM2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). In PCOS patients with endometrial hyperplasia, increased glandular epithelial cell secretion and infiltrated stromal cells in the glands were associated with decreased PDH immunoreactivity in the epithelial cells. Using endometrial tissues from PCOS patients with hyperplasia, we found that in response to metformin treatment , hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression was decreased, whereas phosphofructokinase (PFK), PKM2, and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression was increased compared to controls. Although there was no change in PDH expression, metformin treatment increased the expression of TFAM and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, our  study showed that while endometrial ERβ expression was no different between non-PCOS and PCOS patients regardless of whether or not hyperplasia was present, ERα and AR protein expression was gradually increased in women with PCOS following the onset of endometrial hyperplasia. Our  study showed that treatment with metformin inhibited ERα expression without affecting ERβ expression. Our findings suggest that decreased glycolysis and increased mitochondrial activity might contribute to the onset of ERα-dependent endometrial hyperplasia and that metformin might directly reverse impaired glycolysis and normalize mitochondrial function in PCOS patients with endometrial hyperplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26964347>[Structural and Functional Modifications of Human Lymphocytes in Dynamics of UV-Induced Development of Their Apoptosis].</a></h2><p>The flow-cytometric analysis of condition of human peripheral blood lymphocytes in dynamics of development of the apoptosis induced by exposure to UV-light (240-390 nanometers) at a dose of 1510 J/ was carried out.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key transmitter of growth factor and anchorage stimulation, is aberrantly overexpressed or activated in most solid tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). We determined whether FAK can act as an intrinsic driver to promote aerobic glycolysis and tumorigenesis. FAK inhibition decreases and overexpression increases intracellular glucose levels during unfavorable conditions, including growth factor deficiency and cell detachment. Amplex glucose assay, fluorescence and carbon-13 tracing studies demonstrate that FAK promotes glucose consumption and glucose-to-lactate conversion. Extracellular flux analysis indicates that FAK enhances glycolysis and decreases mitochondrial respiration. FAK increases key glycolytic proteins, including enolase, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporter. Furthermore, active/tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK directly binds to PKM2 and promotes PKM2-mediated glycolysis. On the other hand, FAK-decreased levels of mitochondrial complex I can result in reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Attenuation of FAK-enhanced glycolysis re-sensitizes cancer cells to growth factor withdrawal, decreases cell viability and reduces growth of tumor xenografts. These observations, for the first time, establish a vital role of FAK in cancer glucose metabolism through alterations in the OXPHOS-to-glycolysis balance. Broadly targeting the common phenotype of aerobic glycolysis and more specifically FAK-reprogrammed glucose metabolism will disrupt the bioenergetic and biosynthetic supply for uncontrolled growth of tumors, particularly glycolytic PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598224>Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Modulate Macrophages in Clinically Relevant Lung Injury Models by Extracellular Vesicle Mitochondrial Transfer.</a></h2><p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a major cause of respiratory failure in critically ill patients. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising candidate for a cell-based therapy. However, the mechanisms of MSCs' effects in ARDS are not well understood. In this study, we focused on the paracrine effect of MSCs on macrophage polarization and the role of extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated mitochondrial transfer.To determine the effects of human MSCs on macrophage function in the ARDS environment and to elucidate the mechanisms of these effects.Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in noncontact coculture with human MSCs when stimulated with LPS or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with ARDS. Murine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were cultured ex vivo with/without human MSC-derived EVs before adoptive transfer to LPS-injured mice.MSCs suppressed cytokine production, increased  macrophage marker expression, and augmented phagocytic capacity of human MDMs stimulated with LPS or ARDS BALF. These effects were partially mediated by CD44-expressing EVs. Adoptive transfer of AMs pretreated with MSC-derived EVs reduced inflammation and lung injury in LPS-injured mice. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in MDMs prevented the modulatory effects of MSCs. Generating dysfunctional  in MSCs using rhodamine 6G pretreatment also abrogated these effects.In the ARDS environment, MSCs promote an antiinflammatory and highly phagocytic macrophage phenotype through EV-mediated mitochondrial transfer. MSC-induced changes in macrophage phenotype critically depend on enhancement of macrophage oxidative phosphorylation. AMs treated with MSC-derived EVs ameliorate lung injury in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28863345>The Stromal Microenvironment Modulates Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cells.</a></h2><p>Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are replicationally quiescent mature B-cells. In short-term cultures, supporting stromal cells provide a survival advantage to CLL cells by inducing transcription and translation without promoting proliferation. We hypothesized that the stromal microenvironment augments malignant B cells' metabolism to enable the cells to cope with their energy demands for transcription and translation. We used extracellular flux analysis to assess the two major energy-generating pathways, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glycolysis, in primary CLL cells in the presence of three different stromal cell lines. OxPhos, measured as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximum respiration capacity, was significantly higher in 28 patients' CLL cells cocultured with bone marrow-derived NK.Tert stromal cells than in CLL cells cultured alone (P = .004 and <.0001, respectively). Similar OCR induction was observed in CLL cells cocultured with -10B4 and HS-5 stromal lines. In contrast, heterogeneous changes in the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of glycolysis) were observed in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of CLL cells' metabolomics profile indicated stroma-mediated stimulation of nucleotide synthesis. Quantitation of ribonucleotide pools showed a significant two-fold increase in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells, indicating that the stroma may induce CLL cellular bioenergy and the RNA building blocks necessary for the transcriptional requirement of a prosurvival phenotype. The stroma did not impact the proliferation index (Ki-67 staining) of CLL cells. Collectively, these data suggest that short-term interaction (≤24 hours) with stroma increases OxPhos and bioenergy in replicationally quiescent CLL cells.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

We hypothesized that antibiotics cause mammalian mitochondrial damage while causing bacterial lethality. Mitochondrial toxicity of azithromycin in human mammary epithelia MCF-12A and fibroblasts were tested by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression and DNA damage were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. We found azithromycin suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential gradient of MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Ultrastructure exams showed that the antibiotic caused vacuolated and swollen  with disrupted cristae in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts compared to the morphology of  in the cells without antibiotic treatment. Fluorescent microscopy also showed azithromycin-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide, after 3 h of culture. The DNA oxidative damage product, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, significantly increased in the media after MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts were cultured in the media containing azithromycin for 24 h. Azithromycin upregulated gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (), glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase 2 (), phosphofructokinase 1 (), pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (), and glucose transporters in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Lactate production also increased in the culture media. After treatment with azithromycin, healthy MCF-12A and fibroblast cells increased aerobic glycolysis-the "Warburg Effect"-to generate energy. In summary, azithromycin caused mitochondrial toxicity, ROS overproduction, DNA oxidative damage, upregulation of the  gene, and aerobic glycolysis in healthy mammalian cells. Over-usage of antibiotics could contribute to tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration and aggravate existing -associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391270>Attenuation of Equine Lentivirus Alters Mitochondrial Protein Expression Profile from Inflammation to Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is an equine lentivirus similar to HIV-1, targets host immune cells, and causes a life-long infection in horses. The Chinese live EIAV vaccine is attenuated from long-term passaging of a highly virulent strain  The parent pathogenic strain (EIAV) induces a host inflammatory storm to cause severe pathological injury of animals. However, the vaccine strain (EIAV) induces a high level of apoptosis to eliminate infected cells. To investigate how these processes are regulated, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis and functional study in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) and found that the divergent mitochondrial protein expression profiles caused by EIAV strains with different virulence led to disparate mitochondrial function, morphology, and metabolism. This in turn promoted the distinct transformation of macrophage inflammatory polarization and intrinsic apoptosis. In EIAV-infected cells, a high level of glycolysis and increased mitochondrial fragmentation were induced, resulting in the M1-polarized proinflammatory-type transformation of macrophages and the subsequent production of a strong inflammatory response. Following infection with EIAV, the infected cells were transformed into -polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages by inhibition of glycolysis. In this case, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairment of the electron transport chain led to increased levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. These results correlated with viral pathogenicity loss and may help provide an understanding of the key mechanism of lentiviral attenuation. Following viral infection, the working pattern and function of the cell can be transformed through the impact on . It still unknown how the mitochondrial response changes in cells infected with viruses in the process of virulence attenuation. EIAV is the only effective lentiviral vaccine for large-scale use in the world. EIAV is the parent pathogenic strain. Unlike EIAV-induced inflammation storms, EIAV can induce high levels of apoptosis. For the first time, we found that, after the mitochondrial protein expression profile is altered, EIAV-infected cells are transformed into M1-polarized-type macrophages and cause inflammatory injury and that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated in EIAV-infected cells. These studies shed light on how the mitochondrial protein expression profile changes between cells infected by pathogenic lentivirus strains and cells infected by attenuated lentivirus strains to drive different cellular responses, especially from inflammation to apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374571>Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Constitutional thinness (CT) is a state of low but stable body weight (BMI ≤18 kg/). CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (mean ± SEM: 2174 ± 142 μm 2) compared with controls (3586 ± 216 μ) (P < 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; P < 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784 ± 27 compared with 675 ± 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; P < 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or "" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold change >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( P = 3 × 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (P = 3.6 × 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals. We propose that increased mitochondrial function in adipose tissue is an important mediator in sustaining the low body weight in CT individuals.

Herein we discover that the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), but not the related isoform PKM1, is methylated by co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). PKM2 methylation reversibly shifts the balance of metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells. Oxidative phosphorylation depends on mitochondrial calcium concentration, which becomes critical for cancer cell survival when PKM2 methylation is blocked. By interacting with and suppressing the expression of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsPRs), methylated PKM2 inhibits the influx of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to . Inhibiting PKM2 methylation with a competitive peptide delivered by nanoparticles perturbs the metabolic energy balance in cancer cells, leading to a decrease in cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. Collectively, the CARM1-PKM2 axis serves as a metabolic reprogramming mechanism in tumorigenesis, and inhibiting PKM2 methylation generates metabolic vulnerability to InsPR-dependent mitochondrial functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296435>Levels of the Autophagy-Related 5 Protein Affect Progression and Metastasis of Pancreatic Tumors in Mice.</a></h2><p>Cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) undergo autophagy, but its effects vary with tumor stage and genetic factors. We investigated the consequences of varying levels of the autophagy related 5 (Atg5) protein on pancreatic tumor formation and progression.We generated mice that express oncogenic Kras in primary pancreatic cancer cells and have homozygous disruption of Atg5 (A5;Kras) or heterozygous disruption of Atg5 (A5;Kras), and compared them with mice with only oncogenic Kras (controls). Pancreata were analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Primary tumor cells were isolated and used to perform transcriptome, metabolome, intracellular calcium, extracellular cathepsin activity, and cell migration and invasion analyses. The cells were injected into wild-type littermates, and orthotopic tumor growth and metastasis were monitored. Atg5 was knocked down in pancreatic cancer cell lines using small hairpin RNAs; cell migration and invasion were measured, and cells were injected into wild-type littermates. PDAC samples were obtained from independent cohorts of patients and protein levels were measured on immunoblot and immunohistochemistry; we tested the correlation of protein levels with metastasis and patient survival times.A5;Kras mice, with reduced Atg5 levels, developed more tumors and metastases, than control mice, whereas A5;Kras mice did not develop any tumors. Cultured A5;Kras primary tumor cells were resistant to induction and inhibition of autophagy, had altered mitochondrial morphology, compromised mitochondrial function, changes in intracellular Ca oscillations, and increased activity of extracellular cathepsin L and D. The tumors that formed in A5;Kras mice contained greater numbers of type 2 macrophages than control mice, and primary A5;Kras tumor cells had up-regulated expression of cytokines that regulate macrophage chemoattraction and differentiation into  macrophage. Knockdown of Atg5 in pancreatic cancer cell lines increased their migratory and invasive capabilities, and formation of metastases following injection into mice. In human PDAC samples, lower levels of ATG5 associated with tumor metastasis and shorter survival time.In mice that express oncogenic Kras in pancreatic cells, heterozygous disruption of Atg5 and reduced protein levels promotes tumor development, whereas homozygous disruption of Atg5 blocks tumorigenesis.

However, the effects of -AA on the cardiac function during the process of DCM and the potential mechanisms are not fully known. The present study was designed to dynamically observe the cardiac function, mitochondrial changes, and  receptor binding characteristics in rats long-term stimulated with -AA in vivo.-AA-positive model was established by actively immunizing healthy male Wistar rats with synthetic M2AChR-el2 peptide for 18 months.

The ultrastructure of  was observed under electron microscopy. The  receptor binding characteristics were determined by radioactive ligand binding assay.After immunization for 12 months, compared with vehicle group, M2AChR-el2-immunized rats showed decreased myocardial contractility and cardiac diastolic function evidenced by declined maximal rate of rise of ventricular pressure and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, respectively. Additionally, mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation were observed. At 18 months, M2AChR-el2-immunized rats manifested significant decreased cardiac systolic and diastolic function and pathological changes such as enlargement of right ventricular cavity and wall thinning; and the mitochondrial damage was aggravated. Furthermore, the  receptor maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of the M2AChR-el2-immunized rats significantly decreased, while the  receptor dissociation constant (Kd) was increased.Our study suggested that long-term stimulation with -AA leaded to the ventricular dilatation and gradual deterioration of cardiac dysfunction.

However, how these factors are intertwined in the development of obesity/insulin resistance remains unclear. Here, we examine the role of mitochondrial fat oxidation on lipid-induced inflammation in skeletal muscle. We used skeletal muscle-specific Cpt1b knockout mouse model where the inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation results in accumulation of lipid metabolites in muscle and elevated circulating free fatty acids. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cytokine- and members of TLR-signalling pathways were decreased in Cpt1b muscle. Inflammatory signalling pathways were not activated when evaluated by multiplex and immunoblot analysis. In addition, the inflammatory response to fatty acids was reduced in primary muscle cells derived from Cpt1b mice. Gene expression of Cd11c, the M1 macrophage marker, was decreased; while Cd206, the  macrophage marker, was increased in skeletal muscle of Cpt1b mice. Finally, expression of pro-inflammatory markers was decreased in white adipose tissue of Cpt1b mice. We show that the inflammatory response elicited by elevated intracellular lipids in skeletal muscle is repressed in Cpt1b mice, strongly supporting the hypothesis that mitochondrial processing of fatty acids is essential for the lipid-induction of inflammation in muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417049>Succinate dehydrogenase activity regulates PCB3-quinone-induced metabolic oxidative stress and toxicity in HaCaT human keratinocytes.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their metabolites are environmental pollutants that are known to have adverse health effects. 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-benzo-2,5-quinone (4-ClBQ), a quinone metabolite of 4-monochlorobiphenyl (PCB3, present in the environment and human blood) is toxic to human skin keratinocytes, and breast and prostate epithelial cells. This study investigates the hypothesis that 4-ClBQ-induced metabolic oxidative stress regulates toxicity in human keratinocytes. Results from Seahorse XF96 Analyzer showed that the 4-ClBQ treatment increased extracellular acidification rate, proton production rate, oxygen consumption rate and ATP content, indicative of metabolic oxidative stress. Results from a q-RT-PCR assay showed significant increases in the mRNA levels of hexokinase 2 (hk2), pyruvate kinase  (pkm2) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), and decreases in the mRNA levels of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) subunit C and D (sdhc and sdhd). Pharmacological inhibition of G6PD-activity enhanced the toxicity of 4-ClBQ, suggesting that the protective function of the pentose phosphate pathway is functional in 4-ClBQ-treated cells. The decrease in sdhc and sdhd expression was associated with a significant decrease in complex II activity and increase in mitochondrial levels of ROS. Overexpression of sdhc and sdhd suppressed 4-ClBQ-induced inhibition of complex II activity, increase in mitochondrial levels of ROS, and toxicity. These results suggest that the 4-ClBQ treatment induces metabolic oxidative stress in HaCaT cells, and while the protective function of the pentose phosphate pathway is active, inhibition of complex II activity sensitizes HaCaT cells to 4-ClBQ-induced toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732839>A Metabolic Roadblock in Inflammatory Macrophages.</a></h2><p>In this issue of Cell Reports, Van den Bossche et al.

Overweight/obese but otherwise healthy men and women (n = 7 each; age = 29±9 y; BMI = 29.8±2.7 kg/) performed 18 training sessions over 6 wk on a cycle ergometer.

Peak oxygen uptake increased by 12% after training (32.6±4.5 vs. 29.1±4.2 ml/kg/min) and resting mean arterial pressure decreased by 7% (78±10 vs. 83±10 mmHg), with no difference between groups (both p<0.01, main effects for time).

Continuous glucose monitoring measured under standard dietary conditions before and 48-72 h following training revealed lower 24 h average blood glucose concentration in men following training (5.4±0.6 vs. 5.9±0.5 mmol/L, p<0.05), but not women (5.5±0.4 vs. 5.5±0.6 mmol/L). This was associated with a greater increase in GLUT4 protein content in men compared to women (138% vs. 23%, p<0.05). Short-term interval training using a 10 min protocol that involved only 1 min of hard exercise, 3x/wk, stimulated physiological changes linked to improved health in overweight adults.

We have recently shown that salt has a proinflammatory effect and boosts the activation of Th17 cells and the activation of classical, LPS-induced macrophages (M1). Here, we examined how the activation of alternative () macrophages is affected by salt. In stark contrast to Th17 cells and M1 macrophages, high salt blunted the alternative activation of BM-derived mouse macrophages stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13, M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages. Salt-induced reduction of M(IL-4+IL-13) activation was not associated with increased polarization toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype. In vitro, high salt decreased the ability of M(IL-4+IL-13) macrophages to suppress effector T cell proliferation. Moreover, mice fed a high salt diet exhibited reduced  activation following chitin injection and delayed wound healing compared with control animals. We further identified a high salt-induced reduction in glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolic output, coupled with blunted AKT and mTOR signaling, which indicates a mechanism by which NaCl inhibits full  macrophage activation. Collectively, this study provides evidence that high salt reduces noninflammatory innate immune cell activation and may thus lead to an overall imbalance in immune homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129293>The phenotype of peritoneal mouse macrophages depends on the  and ATP/ADP homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Different macrophage subtypes have different morphologies/shapes and functions. Naïve M0 macrophages are elongated. Pro-inflammatory M1 that produce the bactericidal molecule iNos are round. Anti-inflammatory  macrophages that produce the pro-healing enzyme Arg-1 are highly elongated. We showed previously that the morphologies of M0 and  but not M1 macrophages are RhoA-dependent. Macrophage-specific deletion of RhoA causes the extreme elongation (hummingbird phenotype) of M0 and  but not M1 macrophages. The M1 and  macrophages also differ in their metabolic status. Here, we studied the effect of the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors, antimycin A and oligomycin A, at a suboptimal dose, which depolarizes  but does not eliminate mitochondrial functions, on the /energy production and phenotype of wild-type and RhoA-deleted M0, M1 and  peritoneal mouse macrophages. We found that, while untreated M1 macrophages had the lowest and the  had the highest level of ATP the ATP/ADP ratio was nearly identical between M0, M1 and  macrophages. Inhibitor treatment resulted in approximately 60% increase in ATP level and ATP/ADP ratio in M0 and  macrophages, and decrease in the level of filamentous (F) actin, and these changes correlated with a drastic shortening/tail retraction of M0 and  macrophages, and decreased expression of Arg-1 in  macrophages. The treatment of M1 macrophages caused only a 30% increase in the ATP level and ATP/ADP ratio, and while it did not affect the shape of M1 macrophages, it increased the production of iNos. This indicates that the maintenance of mouse macrophage phenotypes depends on mitochondrial function and ATP/ADP homeostasis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Laboratory findings revealed hepatic dysfunction and positivity for anti-mitochondrial  antibody (AMA-). Hepatosplenomegaly and systemic lymphadenopathy were detected by enhanced computed tomography. One week after her first visit, hypoxemia, ascites, and Coomb test-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia had newly appeared in addition to worsened fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Results of axillary lymph node, skin, and bone-marrow biopsies led to the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), for which CEPP therapy (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, procarbazine, and prednisolone) was initiated. Her serum levels of hepatobiliary enzymes normalized and AMA- became negative after treatment. The unexpected positivity for AMA- might have been caused by AITL cell-activated intrahepatic immune cells or the tumor cells themselves inflicting bile duct injury that mimicked primary biliary cholangitis. Alternatively, cross reactivity due to the overproduction of immunoglobulins may have caused this phenomenon. The present case may shed light on of the mechanisms of liver dysfunction accompanying AITL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26825903>Clinicopathologic Characteristics and Outcomes of Lupus Nephritis With Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>Few studies have analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of lupus nephritis (LN) patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). The clinical and renal histopathologic data of 154 patients with biopsy-proven LN from 2011 to 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were followed up for a median period of 16.8 ± 9.4 months, and their outcomes were analyzed. Multivariate Cox analysis was used to evaluate the independent factors for poor outcomes. Among the 154 LN patients, 26 (16.88%) were seropositive for ANCA. The incidences of alopecia, oral ulcer, photosensitivity and skin lesion, and psychosomatic manifestations in the ANCA-positive group were significantly higher than in the ANCA-negative group (P = 0.007, 0.02, 0.02, and 0.03, respectively). Compared with the ANCA-negative group, the ANCA-positive group had significantly lower levels of complement C3 (P = 0.03). Additionally, the positive rate of antinucleosome antibodies, antihistone antibodies, antimitochondrial antibody , and anticardiolipin antibodies were higher significantly in the ANCA-positive patients than in the ANCA-negative patients (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.03, 0.005, respectively). The ANCA-positive group had a notably higher chronic index than the ANCA-negative group (P = 0.01). During the follow-up, the complete remission rate in the ANCA-negative group was higher than that in the ANCA-positive group (P = 0.01). The cumulative renal survival rate in the ANCA-positive group was significantly lower than in the ANCA-negative group (log-rank = 6.59, P = 0.01). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (HR, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.03; P = 0.005), NLR (HR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.40; P = 0.03), and ANCA (HR, 3.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 10.09; P = 0.03) were independent risk factors for patients' renal survival after adjusting for age, sex, crescent formation, and glomerulosclerosis. The study found ANCA in LN patients is not rare, and patients with ANCA present with more severe clinicopathologic injuries. Thus, ANCA is an independent risk factor for poor renal outcomes in LN patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29148269>Salidroside attenuates neuroinflammation and improves functional recovery after spinal cord injury through microglia polarization regulation.</a></h2><p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe neurological disease; however, few drugs have been proved to treat SCI effectively. Neuroinflammation is the major pathogenesis of SCI secondary injury and considered to be the therapeutic target of SCI. Salidroside (Sal) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects in airway, adipose and myocardial tissue; however, the role of Sal in SCI therapeutics has not been clarified. In this study, we showed that Sal could improve the functional recovery of spinal cord in rats as revealed by increased BBB locomotor rating scale, angle of incline, and decreased cavity of spinal cord injury and apoptosis of neurons in vivo. Immunofluorescence double staining of microglia marker and M1/ marker demonstrated that Sal could suppress M1 microglia polarization and activate  microglia polarization in vivo. To verify how Sal exerts its effects on microglia polarization and neuron protection, we performed the mechanism study in vitro in microglia cell line BV-2 and neuron cell line PC12. The results showed that Sal prevents apoptosis of PC12 cells in coculture with LPS-induced M1 BV-2 microglia, also the inflammatory secretion phenotype of M1 BV-2 microglia was suppressed by Sal, and further studies demonstrated that autophagic flux regulation through AMPK/mTOR pathway was involved in Sal regulated microglia polarization after SCI. Overall, our study illustrated that Sal could promote spinal cord injury functional recovery in rats, and the mechanism may relate to its microglia polarization modulation through AMPK-/mTOR-mediated autophagic flux stimulation.© 2017 The Authors.

The type and intensity of this response depends in part upon the thoroughness of decellularization and removal of cell debris from the source tissue. Proinflammatory responses have been associated with negative downstream remodeling events including scar tissue formation, encapsulation, and seroma formation. The relative effects of specific cellular components upon the inflammatory response are not known. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of different cell remnants that may be present in ECM scaffold materials upon the host innate immune response, both in vitro and in vivo. Collagen scaffolds were supplemented with one of three different concentrations of DNA, , or cell membranes. Murine macrophages were exposed to the various supplemented scaffolds and the effect upon macrophage phenotype was evaluated. In vivo studies were performed using an abdominal wall defect model in the rat to evaluate the effect of the scaffolds upon the macrophage response. Murine macrophages exposed in vitro to scaffolds supplemented with DNA, , and cell membranes showed increased expression of proinflammatory M1 marker iNOS and no expression of the proremodeling  marker Fizz1 regardless of supplementation concentration. A dose-dependent response was observed in the rat model for collagen scaffolds supplemented with cell remnants. DNA, , and cell membrane remnants in collagen scaffolds promote a proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype in vivo and in vitro. These results reinforce the importance of a thorough decellularization process for ECM biologic scaffold materials.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we investigated the effects of qiliqiangxin (QL) on primary rat CMECs exposed to hypoxia and the underlying mechanisms. Rat CMECs were successfully isolated and passaged to the second generation. CMECs that were pre-treated with QL (0.5 mg/mL) and/or HIF-1α siRNA were cultured in a three-gas hypoxic incubator chamber (5% CO , 1% O , 94% N ) for 12 hours. Firstly, we demonstrated that compared with hypoxia group, QL effectively promoted the proliferation while attenuated the apoptosis, improved mitochondrial function and reduced ROS generation in hypoxic CMECs in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Meanwhile, QL also promoted angiogenesis of CMECs via HIF-1α/VEGF signalling pathway. Moreover, QL improved glucose utilization and metabolism and increased ATP production by up-regulating HIF-1α and a series of glycolysis-relevant enzymes, including glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Our findings indicate that QL can protect CMECs against hypoxia injury via promoting glycolysis in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Lastly, the results suggested that QL-dependent enhancement of HIF-1α protein expression in hypoxic CMECs was associated with the regulation of AMPK/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway, and we speculated that QL also improved HIF-1α stabilization through down-regulating prolyl hydroxylases 3 (PHD3) expression.© 2018 The Authors.

After 12 weeks of being fed a high-cholesterol diet, TLR4→LDLR mice developed fewer atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta compared to WT→LDLR mice. This effect was associated with an increase in multilocular lipid droplets and  in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that there was an increase in capillary density and  macrophage infiltration, accompanied by a decrease in tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression in the localized PVAT of TLR4→LDLR mice. In vitro studies indicated that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from WT mice demonstrated an M1-like phenotype and expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by palmitate. These effects were attenuated in BMDMs isolated from TLR4 mice. Furthermore, brown adipocytes incubated with conditioned medium (CM) derived from palmitate-treated BMDMs, exhibited larger and more unilocular lipid droplets, and reduced expression of brown adipocyte-specific markers and perilipin-1 compared to those observed in brown adipocytes exposed to CM from palmitate-treated BMDMs of TLR4 mice. This decreased potency was primarily due to TNF-α, as demonstrated by the capacity of the TNF-α neutralizing antibody to reverse these effects.These results suggest that haematopoietic-specific deletion of TLR4 promotes PVAT homeostasis, which is involved in reducing macrophage-induced TNF-α secretion and increasing mitochondrial biogenesis in brown adipocytes.Copyright © 2017.

In the presence of oxygen, we demonstrated that glucose consumption, lactate production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were significantly increased upon LMP1 expression in NPC cells and in a LMP1 variant derived from NPC patients-transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells. The amounts of the α subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α), a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis, and its targets, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and the pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) isoform, were also consistently elevated by LMP1. Moreover, in parallel with reductions in the oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial membrane potential in cells, an augmented extracellular lactate concentration was observed due to LMP1 induction.

Here, we show that mice with reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) due to myeloid-specific deletion of CR6-interacting factor 1 (Crif1), an essential mitoribosomal factor involved in biogenesis of OxPhos subunits, have M1-like polarization of macrophages and systemic insulin resistance with adipose inflammation. Macrophage GDF15 expression is reduced in mice with impaired oxidative function, but induced upon stimulation with rosiglitazone and IL-4. GDF15 upregulates the oxidative function of macrophages, leading to -like polarization, and reverses insulin resistance in ob/ob mice and HFD-fed mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Crif1. Thus, reduced macrophage oxidative function controls systemic insulin resistance and adipose inflammation, which can be reversed with GDF15 and leads to improved oxidative function of macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980910>Compounds of PAH mixtures dependent interaction between multiple signaling pathways in granulosa tumour cells.</a></h2><p>Mechanism of PAH mixtures, using granulosa tumour cells, was investigated.

Without healing, one injury predisposes to another, leading to disability, chronic disease, accelerated aging, and death. Over 60% of adults and 30% of children and teens in the United States now live with a chronic illness. Advances in mass spectrometry and metabolomics have given scientists a new lens for studying health and disease. This study defines the healing cycle in metabolic terms and reframes the pathophysiology of chronic illness as the result of metabolic signaling abnormalities that block healing and cause the normal stages of the cell danger response (CDR) to persist abnormally. Once an injury occurs, active progress through the stages of healing is driven by sequential changes in cellular bioenergetics and the disposition of oxygen and carbon skeletons used for fuel, signaling, defense, repair, and recovery. >100 chronic illnesses can be organized into three persistent stages of the CDR. One hundred and two targetable chemosensory G-protein coupled and ionotropic receptors are presented that regulate the CDR and healing. Metabokines are signaling molecules derived from metabolism that regulate these receptors. Reframing the pathogenesis of chronic illness in this way, as a systems problem that maintains disease, rather than focusing on remote trigger(s) that caused the initial injury, permits new research to focus on novel signaling therapies to unblock the healing cycle, and restore health when other approaches have failed.Copyright © 2018 The Author.

PA has gained considerable research attention, but the mechanism of its anti-cancer effects remains unclear. In this study, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) was discovered as a PA target via the drug affinity responsive target stability. Molecular docking and enzyme assay revealed that PA is a competing activator of PKM2, and mimics the natural activator, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. PKM2 activation should augment the flux of glycolysis. However, decreased glucose uptake and lactate production after PA treatment was observed in SK-BR-3 breast carcinoma cells, indicating a blockage or downregulation of glycolysis. The potential of previously reported triterpenoids in blocking hexokinase II (HK2) activity inspired us to investigate the inhibition effect of PA on HK2 activity. Molecular docking and enzyme assay confirmed that PA was an inhibitor of HK2, with an IC of 5.01 µM. The possible consequences of glycometabolic regulation by PA, such as dissociation of HK2 from the , release of mitochondrial cytochrome (Cyt) c, depletion of ATP, and generation of reactive oxygen species, were further validated. Furthermore, the details of the possible linkage of targeting PKM2 and HK2 with previously reported actions of PA were discussed.

Targeted metabolomics profiling during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp testing may help identify aberrant metabolic pathways contributing to insulin resistance in CKD. Using targeted metabolomics profiling, we examined the plasma metabolome in 95 adults without diabetes in the fasted state (58 with CKD, 37 with normal glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We assessed heterogeneity in fasting metabolites and the response to insulin to identify potential metabolic pathways linking CKD with insulin resistance. Baseline differences and effect modification by CKD status on changes with insulin clamp testing were adjusted for confounders. Mean GFR among participants with CKD was 37.3 compared with 89.3 ml/min per 1.73  among controls. Fasted-state differences between CKD and controls included abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and the TCA cycle. Insulin infusion markedly decreased metabolite levels, predominantly amino acids and their metabolites. CKD was associated with attenuated insulin-induced changes in nicotinamide, arachidonic acid, and glutamine/glutamate metabolic pathways.

Based on the highly dynamic properties of macrophages, in recent years the repolarization of TAMs from pro-tumoral  phenotype to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype by various strategies has emerged as a promising cancer immunotherapy approach for improving cancer therapy. Herein, we present an aromatic secondary amine-functionalized Bodipy dye  and its -targetable derivative  as fluorescent NO probes for discriminating M1 macrophages from  macrophages in terms of their difference in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) levels. The two probes possess the unique ability to simultaneously respond to two secondary oxides of NO, , NO and ONOO, thus being more sensitive and reliable for reflecting intracellular NO than most of the existing fluorescent NO probes that usually respond to NO only. With  as a representative, the discrimination between M1 and  macrophages, evaluation of the repolarization of TAMs from pro-tumoral  phenotype to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, and visualization of NO communication during the immune-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells by M1 macrophages have been realized.

Current methods to distinguish macrophage subtypes rely on tissue biopsy. Optical imaging techniques based on light scattering are of interest as they can be translated into biopsy-free strategies. Because  are relatively strong subcellular light scattering centers, and  macrophages are known to have enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis compared to M1, we hypothesized that M1 and  macrophages may have different angular light scattering profiles. To test this, we developed an in vitro angle-resolved forward light scattering measurement system. We found that M1 and  macrophage monolayers scatter relatively unequal amounts of light in the forward direction between 1.6 deg and 3.2 deg with  forward scattering significantly more light than M1 at increasing angles. The ratio of forward scattering can be used to identify the polarization state of macrophage populations in culture.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28233992>Are Dopamine Oxidation Metabolites Involved in the Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons in the Nigrostriatal System in Parkinson's Disease?</a></h2><p>In 1967, L-dopa was introduced as part of the pharmacological therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) and, in spite of extensive research, no additional effective drugs have been discovered to treat PD. This brings forward the question: why have no new drugs been developed? We consider that one of the problems preventing the discovery of new drugs is that we still have no information on the pathophysiology of the neurodegeneration of the neuromelanin-containing nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Currently, it is widely accepted that the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, i.e., in the substantia nigra pars compacta, involves mitochondrial dysfunction, the formation of neurotoxic oligomers of alpha-synuclein, the dysfunction of protein degradation systems, neuroinflammation, and oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, the initial trigger of these mechanisms in the nigrostriatal system is still unknown. It has been reported that aminochrome induces the majority of these mechanisms involved in the neurodegeneration process. Aminochrome is formed within the cytoplasm of neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons during the oxidation of dopamine to neuromelanin. The oxidation of dopamine to neuromelanin is a normal and harmless process, because healthy individuals have intact neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, aminochrome-induced neurotoxicity is prevented by two enzymes: DT-diaphorase and glutathione transferase -2, which explains why melanin-containing dopaminergic neurons are intact in healthy human brains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26049634>The potential regulatory role of vitamin D in the bioenergetics of inflammation.</a></h2><p>The extraskeletal health benefits of vitamin D still need scientific endorsement. Obesity and related chronic diseases are pathogenically linked by inflammation, which carries a considerable energetic cost. Recent techniques for the determination of the bioenergetic demand of inflammation, offer an avenue to cement the regulatory role of vitamin D in this process.Nuclear vitamin D receptors may be translocated into  of certain cell types, opening up a pathway for direct action on cellular bioenergetics.

Autosomal-dominant inheritance of a R94Q mutation in MFN2 causes the axonal subtype 2A2A which is characterized by early onset and progressive atrophy of distal muscles caused by motoneuronal degeneration. Here, we studied mitochondrial shape, respiration, cytosolic, and mitochondrial ATP content as well as mitochondrial quality control in MFN2-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing wildtype or R94Q MFN2. Under normal culture conditions, R94Q cells had slightly more fragmented  but a similar mitochondrial oxygen consumption, membrane potential, and ATP production as wildtype cells. However, when inducing mild oxidative stress 24 h before analysis using 100 µM hydrogen peroxide, R94Q cells exhibited significantly increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial ATP production. This was accompanied by increased glucose uptake and an up-regulation of hexokinase 1 and pyruvate kinase , suggesting increased pyruvate shuttling into . Interestingly, these changes coincided with decreased levels of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in R94Q cells. We conclude that  harboring the disease-causing R94Q mutation in MFN2 are more susceptible to oxidative stress, which causes uncoupling of respiration and ATP production possibly by a less efficient mitochondrial quality control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30978175>N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) delays post-ovulatory oocyte aging in mouse.</a></h2><p>The quality of post-ovulatory oocytes decreases with aging. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a broadly used antioxidant, on oocyte quality in mouse post-ovulatory oocyte aging in vitro. NAC at 0.6mM concentration was added to culture medium (), and the quality of oocytes was analyzed at 6h, 12h, 18h and 24h of culture. We found that the frequency of spindle defects decreased in NAC-treated oocytes compared to those without NAC treatment. NAC treatment significantly decreased abnormal distribution of cortical granules (CGs) in oocytes during aging for 18h and 24h. Decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also observed. Increased intracellular ATP levels and decreased abnormal distribution of  could be observed with NAC supplementation during post-ovulatory oocyte aging in vitro.

By using an integrated high-throughput transcriptional-metabolic profiling and analysis pipeline, we characterized systemic changes during murine macrophage M1 and  polarization.  polarization was found to activate glutamine catabolism and UDP-GlcNAc-associated modules. Correspondingly, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of N-glycosylation decreased  polarization and production of chemokine CCL22. In M1 macrophages, we identified a metabolic break at Idh, the enzyme that converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, providing mechanistic explanation for TCA cycle fragmentation. (13)C-tracer studies suggested the presence of an active variant of the aspartate-arginosuccinate shunt that compensated for this break. Consistently, inhibition of aspartate-aminotransferase, a key enzyme of the shunt, inhibited nitric oxide and interleukin-6 production in M1 macrophages, while promoting mitochondrial respiration. This systems approach provides a highly integrated picture of the physiological modules supporting macrophage polarization, identifying potential pharmacologic control points for both macrophage phenotypes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Different killer toxins, K1, K2, K28, and Klus, have been described. Each toxin is encoded by a medium-size (1.5- to 2.3-kb) M double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) located in the cytoplasm. M dsRNAs require L-A helper virus for maintenance. L-A belongs to the Totiviridae family, and its dsRNA genome of 4.6 kb codes for the major capsid protein Gag and a minor Gag-Pol protein, which form the virions that separately encapsidate L-A or the M satellites. Different L-A variants exist in nature; on average, 24% of their nucleotides are different. Previously, we reported that L-A-lus was specifically associated with Mlus, suggesting coevolution, and proposed a role of the toxin-encoding M dsRNAs in the appearance of new L-A variants. Here we confirm this by analyzing the helper virus in K2 killer wine strains, which we named L-A-2. L-A-2 is required for  maintenance, and neither L-A nor L-A-lus shows helper activity for  in the same genetic background. This requirement is overcome when coat proteins are provided in large amounts by a vector or in ski mutants. The genome of another totivirus, L-BC, frequently accompanying L-A in the same cells shows a lower degree of variation than does L-A (about 10% of nucleotides are different). Although L-BC has no helper activity for M dsRNAs, distinct L-BC variants are associated with a particular killer strain. The so-called L-BC-lus (in Klus strains) and L-BC-2 (in K2 strains) are analyzed.Killer strains of S. cerevisiae secrete protein toxins that kill nonkiller yeasts. The "killer phenomenon" depends on two dsRNA viruses: L-A and M. M encodes the toxin, and L-A, the helper virus, provides the capsids for both viruses. Different killer toxins exist: K1, K2, K28, and Klus, encoded on different M viruses. Our data indicate that each M dsRNA depends on a specific helper virus; these helper viruses have nucleotide sequences that may be as much as 26% different, suggesting coevolution. In wine environments, K2 and Klus strains frequently coexist. We have previously characterized the association of Mlus and L-A-lus. Here we sequence and characterize L-A-2, the helper virus of , establishing the helper virus requirements of , which had not been completely elucidated. We also report the existence of two specific L-BC totiviruses in Klus and K2 strains with about 10% of their nucleotides different, suggesting different evolutionary histories from those of L-A viruses.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30774633>Deficiency in IL-33/ST2 Axis Reshapes Mitochondrial Metabolism in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated Macrophages.</a></h2><p>The polarization and function of macrophages play essential roles in controlling immune responses. Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family that has been shown to influence macrophage activation and polarization, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Mitochondrial metabolism has been reported to be a central player in shaping macrophage polarization; previous studies have shown that both aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation uniquely regulate the functions of M1 and  macrophages. Whether IL-33 polarizes macrophages by reshaping mitochondrial metabolism requires further investigation. In this work, we examined the mitochondrial metabolism of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from either wild type (WT), -overexpressing, or IL-33 receptor knockout ( ) mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that after LPS stimulation, compared with WT BMDMs,   BMDMs had reduced cytokine production and increased numbers and activity of   the metabolism regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-C coactivator-1 α (PGC1α). This was demonstrated by increased mitochondrial DNA copy number,  counts,  fission- and fusion-related gene expression, oxygen consumption rates, and ATP production, and decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rates. For -overexpressing BMDMs, the metabolic reprogramming upon LPS stimulation was similar to WT BMDMs, and was accompanied by increased M1 macrophage activity. Our findings suggested that the pleiotropic IL-33/ST2 pathway may influence the polarization and function of macrophages by regulating mitochondrial metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279518>Anti-mitochondrial  Antibodies and Myopathy.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982966>PGC-1α deficiency causes spontaneous kidney inflammation and increases the severity of nephrotoxic AKI.</a></h2><p>PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α, PPARGC1A) regulates the expression of genes involved in energy homeostasis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Here we identify inactivation of the transcriptional regulator PGC-1α as a landmark for experimental nephrotoxic acute kidney injury (AKI) and describe the in vivo consequences of PGC-1α deficiency over inflammation and cell death in kidney injury. Kidney transcriptomic analyses of WT mice with folic acid-induced AKI revealed 1398 up- and 1627 downregulated genes. Upstream transcriptional regulator analyses pointed to PGC-1α as the transcription factor potentially driving the observed expression changes with the highest reduction in activity. Reduced PGC-1α expression was shared by human kidney injury. Ppargc1a mice had spontaneous subclinical kidney injury characterized by tubulointerstitial inflammation and increased Ngal expression. Upon AKI, Ppargc1a mice had lower survival and more severe loss of renal function, tubular injury, and reduction in expression of mitochondrial PGC-1α-dependent genes in the kidney, and an earlier decrease in mitochondrial mass than WT mice. Additionally, surviving Ppargc1a mice showed higher rates of tubular cell death, compensatory proliferation, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB activation, and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration. Specifically, Ppargc1a mice displayed increased M1 and decreased  responses and expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In cultured renal tubular cells, PGC-1α targeting promoted spontaneous cell death and proinflammatory responses. In conclusion, PGC-1α inactivation is a key driver of the gene expression response in nephrotoxic AKI and PGC-1α deficiency promotes a spontaneous inflammatory kidney response that is magnified during AKI. © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Thus, we investigated the effects of MB on HO-1 protein content and enzyme activity, and its protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced oxidative damage in RAW264.7 macrophage. The cell viability and the release of lactate dehydrogenase of RAW264.7 were determined. The mitochondrial functions were valuated through these indexes: content of adenosine triphosphate, superoxide dismutase, concentration of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile, high content screening tested generation of ROS, MMP and intracellular concentration of calcium ion. qRT-PCR valuated macrophage phenotype markers expression. Lastly, flow cytometry and caspase-3 detection analyzed RAW264.7 apoptosis. Our data showed that (1) Both pretreatment and posttreatment of MB increased HO-1 protein content and enzyme activity; (2) MB rescued cells from HO-induced mitochondrial dysfunction; (3) High content screening revealed that MB alleviated the changes including generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular concentration of calcium ion in HO exposed RAW264.7; (4) MB attenuated HO-induced apoptosis; (5) MB pretreatment decreased the expression of M1 macrophage markers (Tnf and Nos2) while increasing the expression of  macrophage markers (Mrc1 and Il10); (6) The beneficial effect of MB was abolished by zinc protoporphyrin IX (HO-1 activity inhibitor) or HO-1 siRNA.

Here, we show that embryogenesis-associated mouse RGC differentiation depends on mitophagy, the programmed autophagic clearance of . The elimination of  during RGC differentiation was coupled to a metabolic shift with increased lactate production and elevated expression of glycolytic enzymes at the mRNA level. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of either mitophagy or glycolysis consistently inhibited RGC differentiation. Local hypoxia triggered expression of the mitophagy regulator BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L, best known as NIX) at peak RGC differentiation. Retinas from NIX-deficient mice displayed increased mitochondrial mass, reduced expression of glycolytic enzymes and decreased neuronal differentiation. Similarly, we provide evidence that NIX-dependent mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial elimination during macrophage polarization towards the proinflammatory and more glycolytic M1 phenotype, but not to  macrophage differentiation, which primarily relies on oxidative phosphorylation. In summary, developmentally controlled mitophagy promotes a metabolic switch towards glycolysis, which in turn contributes to cellular differentiation in several distinct developmental contexts.© 2017 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28690845>Diagnostic autoantibodies for autoimmune liver diseases.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune liver diseases are conditions of low prevalence that comprise the triad of autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis) and primary sclerosing cholangitis and their poorly characterised overlapping syndromes. Diagnostic autoantibodies are associated with autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis but not with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Autoantibodies are useful disease markers that facilitate early diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis and allow for therapeutic intervention to prevent progression to liver cirrhosis and associated complications. Adult onset type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is associated with F-actin reactive smooth muscle autoantibody, antinuclear autoantibody in 60% of patients, and autoantibody to SLA/LP in 15-20%. Juvenile onset type 2 autoimmune hepatitis is associated with LKM-1 and LC-1 autoantibodies. Primary biliary cholangitis is associated with a -associated autoantibody designated  in >90% of patients and with disease-specific antinuclear autoantibodies in 50% that bind to antigens in the nuclear core complex and in multiple nuclear dots. Autoantibodies to the nuclear core complex target gp210, nucleoporin p62 and nuclear lamin B receptor. Autoantibodies to multiple nuclear dots target Sp100 and PML antigens. Liver autoantibodies in asymptomatic patients with normal liver function may precede the subsequent development of overt autoimmune liver disease. For routine diagnostic immunology laboratories, initial screening for liver autoantibodies by immunofluorescence remains the method of choice with confirmation for reactivity with their target antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or line blot when required.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301887>Loss of pyruvate kinase  limits growth and triggers innate immune signaling in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Despite their inherent proximity to circulating oxygen and nutrients, endothelial cells (ECs) oxidize only a minor fraction of glucose in , a metabolic specialization that is poorly understood. Here we show that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) limits glucose oxidation, and maintains the growth and epigenetic state of ECs. We find that loss of PKM2 alters mitochondrial substrate utilization and impairs EC proliferation and migration in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that the NF-κB transcription factor RELB is responsive to PKM2 loss, limiting EC growth through the regulation of P53. Furthermore, S-adenosylmethionine synthesis is impaired in the absence of PKM2, resulting in DNA hypomethylation, de-repression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) and activation of antiviral innate immune signalling.

Broadly speaking, MΦs dependent on glucose are pro-inflammatory, classically activated MΦs (CAM), which contribute to adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. In contrast, MΦs that primarily metabolize fatty acids are alternatively activated MΦs (AAM) and maintain tissue insulin sensitivity. In actuality, there is much flexibility and overlap in the CAM-AAM spectrum in vivo dependent upon various stimuli in the microenvironment. We hypothesized that specific lipid trafficking proteins, e.g. fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), would direct MΦ fatty acid transport and metabolism to limit inflammation and contribute to the maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis.Bone marrow derived MΦs (BMDMs) from Fatp1 (-/-) and Fatp1 (+/+) mice were used to investigate FATP1-dependent substrate metabolism, bioenergetics, metabolomics, and inflammatory responses. We also generated C57BL/6J chimeric mice by bone marrow transplant specifically lacking hematopoetic FATP1 (Fatp1 (B-/-)) and controls Fatp1 (B+/+). Mice were challenged by high fat diet (HFD) or low fat diet (LFD) and analyses including MRI, glucose and insulin tolerance tests, flow cytometric, histologic, and protein quantification assays were conducted. Finally, an FATP1-overexpressing RAW 264.7 MΦ cell line (FATP1-OE) and empty vector control (FATP1-EV) were developed as a gain of function model to test effects on substrate metabolism, bioenergetics, metabolomics, and inflammatory responses.Fatp1 is downregulated with pro-inflammatory stimulation of MΦs. Fatp1 (-/-) BMDMs and FATP1-OE RAW 264.7 MΦs demonstrated that FATP1 reciprocally controled metabolic flexibility, i.e. lipid and glucose metabolism, which was associated with inflammatory response. Supporting our previous work demonstrating the positive relationship between glucose metabolism and inflammation, loss of FATP1 enhanced glucose metabolism and exaggerated the pro-inflammatory CAM phenotype. Fatp1 (B-/-) chimeras fed a HFD gained more epididymal white adipose mass, which was inflamed and oxidatively stressed, compared to HFD-fed Fatp1 (B+/+) controls. Adipose tissue macrophages displayed a CAM-like phenotype in the absence of Fatp1. Conversely, functional overexpression of FATP1 decreased many aspects of glucose metabolism and diminished CAM-stimulated inflammation in vitro. FATP1 displayed acyl-CoA synthetase activity for long chain fatty acids in MΦs and modulated lipid mediator metabolism in MΦs.Our findings provide evidence that FATP1 is a novel regulator of MΦ activation through control of substrate metabolism. Absence of FATP1 exacerbated pro-inflammatory activation in vitro and increased local and systemic components of the metabolic syndrome in HFD-fed Fatp1 (B-/-) mice. In contrast, gain of FATP1 activity in MΦs suggested that Fatp1-mediated activation of fatty acids, substrate switch to glucose, oxidative stress, and lipid mediator synthesis are potential mechanisms. We demonstrate for the first time that FATP1 provides a unique mechanism by which the inflammatory tone of adipose and systemic metabolism may be regulated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24738611>Ectopic lipid storage in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is not mediated by impaired mitochondrial oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by lipid deposition within the liver [intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL)], is associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MS). It has been suggested that impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial function may contribute to ectopic lipid deposition, and the associated MS, by altering post-prandial energy storage. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cross-sectional study of 17 patients with NAFLD [mean±S.D.; age, 45±11 years; body mass index (BMI), 31.6±3.4 kg/] and 18 age- and BMI-matched healthy controls (age, 44±11 years; BMI, 30.5±5.2 kg/). We determined body composition by MRI, IHCL and intramyocellular (soleus and tibialis anterior) lipids (IMCLs) by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function by dynamic phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) of quadriceps muscle. Although matched for BMI and total adiposity, after statistical adjustment for gender, patients with NAFLD (defined by IHCL ≥ 5.5%) had higher IHCLs (25±16% compared with 2±2%; P<0.0005) and a higher prevalence of the MS (76% compared with 28%) compared with healthy controls. Despite this, the visceral fat/subcutaneous fat ratio, IMCLs and muscle mitochondrial function were similar between the NAFLD and control groups, with no significant difference in the rate constants of post-exercise phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery (1.55±0.4 compared with 1.51±0.4 min-1), a measure of muscle mitochondrial function. In conclusion, impaired muscle mitochondrial function does not seem to underlie ectopic lipid deposition, or the accompanying features of the MS, in patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25967974>Enhanced M1 and Impaired  Macrophage Polarization and Reduced Mitochondrial Biogenesis via Inhibition of AMP Kinase in Chronic Kidney Disease.</a></h2><p>Macrophage polarization plays a pivotal role in the process of inflammation which is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Macrophages polarization under the condition of CKD remains poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that CKD promotes macrophage M1 polarization.A rat model of CKD was established by reduced renal mass (RRM). Polarization of macrophages was induced in ex vivo macrophages from RRM rats and cultured ones under the condition of uremic serum. The markers were evaluated by RT-PCR, western blot, and flow cytometer.Our data showed that macrophages from RRM rats displayed enhanced M1 and impaired  polarization as revealed by increased M1 markers (tumor necrosis factor α, IL-6, IL-12p40, nitric oxide) and decreased  markers (IL-10, CD206, arginase activity) in response to LPS and IL-4 induction, respectively. Treatment with uremic sera in peritoneal and bone marrow derived macrophages from normal rats led to similar results. Moreover, macrophages from RRM rats and cultured under the condition of uremic sera had reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. The disturbed macrophage polarization and mitochondrial biogenesis were accompanied by reduced activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK). Enhancing activation of AMPK restored mitochondrial biogenesis and  macrophage polarization.These observations suggest that CKD disturbs macrophage polarization and mitochondrial biogenesis through inhibition of AMPK. This might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for intervention of chronic inflammation in CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30539788>Macrophage Raptor Deficiency-Induced Lysosome Dysfunction Exacerbates Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an increasingly prevalent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatocellular damage. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been investigated extensively in the context of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of mTORC1 in NASH remains largely unknown.mTORC1 activity in macrophages in human mild and severe NASH liver was compared. Mice with macrophage-specific deletion of the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) subunit and littermate controls were fed a high-fructose, palmitate, and cholesterol diet for 24 weeks or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet for 4 weeks to develop NASH.We report that in human beings bearing NASH, macrophage mTORC1 activity was lower in livers experiencing severe vs mild NASH liver. Moreover, macrophage mTORC1 disruption exacerbated the inflammatory response in 2 diet-induced NASH mouse models. Mechanistically, in response to apoptotic hepatocytes (AHs), macrophage polarization toward a  anti-inflammatory phenotype was inhibited in Raptor-deficient macrophages. During the digestion of AHs, macrophage mTORC1 was activated and coupled with dynamin-related protein 1 to facilitate the latter's phosphorylation, leading to mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium release. Ionomycin or A23187, calcium ionophores, prevented Raptor deficiency-mediated failure of lysosome acidification and subsequent lipolysis. Blocking dynamin-related protein 1-dependent  fission impaired lysosome function, resulting in reduced production of anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukins 10 and 13.Persistent mTORC1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to the progression of NASH by causing lysosome dysfunction and subsequently attenuating anti-inflammatory -like response in macrophages during clearance of AHs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The formation of complexes was followed by potentiometric titration and further demonstrated by V RMN. The viability and proliferation of B16F10 cells were reduced up 50% by the xyloglucan and its complex, both at 200 μg/mL, from 24 to 72 h. Cytotoxic effects of XGC and XGC:VO do not involve changes in cell cycle progression. Only XGC:VO (200 μg/mL) promoted the cell death evidenced by annexin V stain. XGC increased the respiration and lactate levels in melanoma cells, while XGC:VO reduced about 50% the respiration and levels of pyruvate, without alter the lactate levels, indicating that both xyloglucan preparations interfere with the metabolism of B16F10 cells.

As influenced by their environment, microglia assume a diversity of phenotypes and retain the capability to shift functions to maintain tissue homeostasis. In comparison with peripheral macrophages, microglia demonstrate similar and unique features with regards to phenotype polarization, allowing for innate immunological functions. Microglia can be stimulated by LPS or IFN-γ to an M1 phenotype for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines or by IL-4/IL-13 to an  phenotype for resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Increasing evidence suggests a role of metabolic reprogramming in the regulation of the innate inflammatory response. Studies using peripheral immune cells demonstrate that polarization to an M1 phenotype is often accompanied by a shift in cells from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis for energy production. More recently, the link between polarization and mitochondrial energy metabolism has been considered in microglia. Under these conditions, energy demands would be associated with functional activities and cell survival and thus, may serve to influence the contribution of microglia activation to various neurodegenerative conditions. This review examines the polarization states of microglia and their relationship to mitochondrial metabolism. Additional supporting experimental data are provided to demonstrate mitochondrial metabolic shifts in primary microglia and the BV-2 microglia cell line induced under LPS (M1) and IL-4/IL-13 () polarization.Published 2015.

The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease.We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection.Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the  phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of  related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards  related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by BHB.Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH.Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and β-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here, a new [Formula: see text]-scavenging Mn complex with a new polyamino-polycarboxylate macrocycle (4,10-dimethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-diacetate) containing 2 quinoline units (MnQ2), designed to improve complex stability and cell permeability, was compared to parental Mn complex with methyls replacing quinolines (MnM2). MnQ2 was more stable than MnM2 (log K = 19.56(8) vs. 14.73(2) for the equilibrium Mn + L, where L = Q2 and ) due to the involvement of quinoline in metal binding and to the hydrophobic features of the ligand which improve metal desolvation upon complexation. As oxidative stress model, H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation. MnQ2 and MnM2 (10 μmol L) were added at reoxygenation for 1 or 2 h. The more lipophilic MnQ2 showed more rapid cell and mitochondrial penetration than MnM2. Both MnQ2 and MnM2 abated endogenous ROS and mitochondrial [Formula: see text], decreased cell lipid peroxidation, reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, in terms of efficiency of the respiratory chain and preservation of membrane potential (Δψ) and permeability, decreased the activation of pro-apoptotic caspases 9 and 3, and increased cell viability. Of note, MnQ2 was more effective than MnM2 to exert cytoprotective anti-oxidant effects in the short term. Compounds with redox-inert Zn replacing the functional Mn were ineffective. This study provides clues which further our understanding of the structure-activity relationships of Mn-chelates and suggests that Mn-polyamino-polycarboxylate macrocycles could be developed as new anti-oxidant drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826427>Pyruvate kinase : A multifarious enzyme in non-canonical localization to promote cancer progression.</a></h2><p>Rewiring glucose metabolism, termed as Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis, is a common signature of cancer cells to meet their high energetic and biosynthetic demands of rapid growth and proliferation. Pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) is a key player in such metabolic reshuffle, which functions as a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme in the cytosol of highly-proliferative cancer cells. During the recent decades, PKM2 has been extensively studied in non-canonical localizations such as nucleus, , and extracellular secretion, and pertained to novel biological functions in tumor progression. Such functions of PKM2 open a new avenue for cancer researchers. This review summarizes up-to-date functions of PKM2 at various subcellular localizations of cancer cells and draws attention to the translocation of PKM2 from cytosol into the nucleus induced by posttranslational modifications. Moreover, PKM2 in tumor cells could have an important role in resistance acquisition processes against various chemotherapeutic drugs, which have raised a concern on PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target. Finally, we summarize the current status and future perspectives to improve the potential of PKM2 as a therapeutic target for the development of anticancer therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, serological tests have many limitations, including inconvenience, invasiveness, and infection risks. Thus, a less invasive approach to detect AMA- titer is desirable. We examined salivary AMA- of potential PBC patients and found that AMA- could be detected only in saliva of serum AMA--positive PBC patients, but not in saliva of serum AMA--negative PBC patients, oral lichen planus patients (OLP) patients, or healthy controls. Furthermore, the concentration of salivary AMA- was positively correlated with the amount of serum AMA- in patients. The salivary inflammatory cytokines were increased in the PBC, consistent with the results of serum test. These findings indicated that saliva might be a less invasive and cost-effective medium to accurately test for AMA- levels and this is a promising development for the diagnosis and monitoring of PBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045080>PKM2 Thr454 phosphorylation increases its nuclear translocation and promotes xenograft tumor growth in A549 human lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is a key enzyme of glycolysis which is highly expressed in many tumor cells, and plays an important role in the Warburg effect. In previous study, we found PIM2 phosphorylates PKM2 at Thr454 residue (Yu, etl 2013). However, the functions of PKM2 Thr454 modification in cancer cells still remain unclear. Here we find PKM2 translocates into the nucleus after Thr454 phosphorylation. Replacement of wild type PKM2 with a mutant (T454A) enhances mitochondrial respiration, decreases pentose phosphate pathway, and enhances chemosensitivity in A549 cells. In addition, the mutant (T454A) PKM2 reduces xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. These findings demonstrate that PKM2 T454 phosphorylation is a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the underlying mechanism is complex and remains to be investigated. Herein, we report that the upregulated miR-92a reduced the RNA-binding motif 4 (RBM4) protein expression, leading to the imbalanced expression of the neuronal polypyrimidine tract-binding (nPTB) protein through alternative splicing-coupled nonsense mediated decay (NMD) mechanism. Increase in nPTB protein enhances the relative level of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 IIIc (FGFR2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) transcripts which contribute to the progression and metabolic signature of CRC cells. Expression profiles of RBM4 and downstream alternative splicing events are consistently observed in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues.

Macrophages mainly exhibit M1 phenotype, which contributes to the inflammation and fibrosis in DN. Studies indicate that autophage plays an important role in M1/ activation. However, the effect of mitophage on M1/ macrophage phenotype transformation in DN is unknown. This study investigates the role of mitophage on macrophage polarization in DN. In vivo experiments show that macrophages are exhibited to M1 phenotype and display a lower level of mitophagy in the kidney of streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Additionally, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is positive correlated with the P62 expression, while negative correlated with LC3. Electronic microscope analysis shows  swelling, crista decrease and lysosome reduction in DN rats compared with NC rats. In vitro, RAW264.7 macrophages switch to M1 phenotype under high glucose conditions. Mitophagy is downregulated in such high glucose induced M1 macrophages. Furthermore, macrophages tend to switch to the M1 phenotype, expressing higher iNOS and TNF-α when impair mitophagy by 3-MA. Rapamycin, an activator of mitophagy, signifcantly blocks high-glucose induced M1 makers (iNOS and TNF-α) expression, meanwhile enhances  makers (MR and Arg-1) expression. These results demonstrate that mitophage participates in the regulation of M1/ macrophage phenotype in diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Acute exercise increases insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle; however, whether  are involved in these processes remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of insulin stimulation at rest and after acute exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory function (JO2) and hydrogen peroxide emission (JH2O2), and the associations with insulin sensitivity in obese, sedentary men. Nine men (means ± SD: 57 ± 6 years; BMI 33 ± 5 kg.) underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in two separate trials 1-3 weeks apart: one under resting conditions, and another 1 hour after high-intensity exercise (4x4 min cycling at 95% HRpeak). Muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline, and pre/post clamp to measure JO2 with high-resolution respirometry and JH2O2 via Amplex UltraRed from permeabilized fibers. Post-exercise, both JO2 and JH2O2 during ADP stimulated state-3/OXPHOS respiration were lower compared to baseline (P<0.05), but not after subsequent insulin stimulation. JH2O2 was lower post-exercise and after subsequent insulin stimulation compared to insulin stimulation in the rest trial during succinate supported state-4/leak respiration (P<0.05). In contrast, JH2O2 increased during complex-I supported leak respiration with insulin after exercise compared with resting conditions (P<0.05). Resting insulin sensitivity and JH2O2 during complex-I leak respiration were positively correlated (r = 0.77, P<0.05). We conclude that in obese, older and sedentary men, acute exercise modifies skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 emission responses to hyperinsulinemia in a respiratory state-specific manner, which may have implications for metabolic diseases involving insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516080>Endometriosis may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in cumulus cells from subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization-intracytoplasmic sperm injection, as reflected by decreased adenosine triphosphate production.</a></h2><p>To determine whether endometriosis is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in cumulus (granulosa [GC]) cells of subjects undergoing IVF-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).Prospective cohort study.An IVF clinic in a tertiary academic care center.Eleven women with endometriosis and 39 controls.None.Cumulus cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and genomic DNA (gDNA) number.Cumulus cell ATP content was 65% lower in subjects with surgically proven endometriosis (median 312.5 attomoles/ng total DNA, interquartile range = 116.0-667.8) compared with controls (median 892.4 attomoles/ng total DNA, interquartile range = 403.0-1,412.2).

Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) has abnormally high expression in various tumor cells, and it has been implicated in the survival of tumors. However, whether and how Res inhibits PKM2 expression is poorly understood. In the present study, we found that treatment with Res inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. The IC values of Res against DLD1, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells were 75 ± 4.54, 50 ± 3.65, and 50 ± 3.32 μM, respectively. To elucidate mechanisms underlying its antitumor activities, serial experiments were performed. Results showed that reduction of PKM2 expression in tumor cells by Res treatment increased the expression of ER stress and mitochondrial fission proteins but reduced cell viability and the levels of fusion proteins. These phenomena were reversed by artificial overexpression of PKM2. Quantitative analyses showed that the expression of microRNA-326 (miR-326) was increased upon Res treatment. Treatment with the miR-326 mimic reduced PKM2 expression, promoting recovery from ER stress and mitochondrial fission. Overall, these results demonstrate that miR-326/PKM2-mediated ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction participate in apoptosis induced by Res. These results provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms by which Res suppresses tumors and further support for the use of Res as an antitumor drug.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855493>Vitamin D-dependent induction of cathelicidin in human macrophages results in cytotoxicity against high-grade B cell lymphoma.</a></h2><p>Infiltration by macrophages represents a characteristic morphological hallmark in high-grade lymphatic malignancies such as Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Although macrophages can, in principle, target neoplastic cells and mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) regularly fail to exert direct cytotoxic functions. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this observation remain unclear. We demonstrate that inflammatory M1 macrophages kill proliferating high-grade B cell lymphoma cells by releasing the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin in a vitamin D-dependent fashion. We show that cathelicidin directly induces cell death by targeting  of BL cells. In contrast, anti-inflammatory  macrophages and -like TAMs in BL exhibit an altered vitamin D metabolism, resulting in a reduced production of cathelicidin and consequently in inability to lyse BL cells. However, treatment of  macrophages with the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25D3, or a vitamin D receptor agonist effectively induces cathelicidin production and triggers tumoricidal activity against BL cells. Furthermore, rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity of vitamin D-treated  macrophages is cathelicidin-dependent. Finally, vitamin D treatment of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D)-deficient volunteers in vivo or primary TAMs in vitro improves rituximab-mediated ADCC against B cell lymphoma cells. These data indicate that activation of the vitamin D signaling pathway activates antitumor activity of TAMs and improves the efficacy of ADCC.Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30218320>TanshinoneIIA Alleviates Inflammatory Response and Directs Macrophage Polarization in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated RAW264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>TanshinoneIIA (TanIIA) has been demonstrated to possess numerous biological effects. However, the specific effect of TanIIA on macrophage polarization has not been reported. In this study, it was revealed that TanIIA might play a pivotal role in macrophage polarization. As our results indicated, cell morphology was changed in RAW264.7 cells which were treated with LPS or LPS/TanIIA (0.1 μM, 1 μM, 10 μM). Subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured by ELISA kits. Furthermore, TanIIA enhanced the expression of  macrophage markers (Arg1 and FIZZ1) and decreased the expression of markers associated with M1 macrophage polarization (iNOS and IL-1β). Increased expression of CD206 was also detected by flow cytometry in TanIIA-treated groups. Mechanistically, it was revealed that TanIIA modulated macrophage polarization by ameliorating mitochondrial function and regulating TLR4-HMGB1/CEBP-β pathway. In addition, increased expression of miR-155 was observed in RAW264.7 cells incubated with LPS and were effectively inhibited by TanIIA. Taken together, it was suggested that TanIIA inhibits inflammatory response and promotes macrophage polarization toward an  phenotype, which provides new evidence for the anti-inflammation activity of TanIIA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28981199>MicroRNA-661 modulates redox and metabolic homeostasis in colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Cancer cell survival and metastasis are dependent on metabolic reprogramming that is capable of increasing resistance to oxidative and energetic stress. Targeting these two processes can be crucial for cancer progression. Herein, we describe the role of microRNA-661 (miR661) as epigenetic regulator of colon cancer (CC) cell metabolism. MicroR661 induces a global increase in reactive oxygen species, specifically in mitochondrial superoxide anions, which appears to be mediated by decreased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway, and by a higher dependency on mitochondrial respiration. MicroR661 overexpression in non-metastatic human CC cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, and a reduced tolerance to metabolic stress. This seems to be a general effect of miR661 in CC, since metastatic CC cell metabolism is also compromised upon miR661 overexpression. We propose hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase  as two key players related to the observed metabolic reprogramming. Finally, the clinical relevance of miR661 expression levels in stage-II and III CC patients is discussed. In conclusion, we propose miR661 as a potential modulator of redox and metabolic homeostasis in CC.© 2017 The Authors.

Based on their activation, they might display classical/M1 or alternative/ phenotypes. M1 macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO).  macrophages upregulate arginase-1 and reduce NO and ROS levels; they also release anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and polyamines, thus promoting angiogenesis and tissue healing. Moreover, M1 and  display key metabolic differences; M1 polarization is characterized by an enhancement in glycolysis and in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) along with a decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), whereas  are characterized by an efficient OxPhos and reduced PPP. Recent Advances: The glutamine-related metabolism has been discovered as crucial for  polarization. Vice versa, flux discontinuities in the Krebs cycle are considered additional M1 features; they lead to increased levels of immunoresponsive gene 1 and itaconic acid, to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-downregulation and to succinate, citrate, and isocitrate over-expression.A macrophage classification problem, particularly in vivo, originating from a gap in the knowledge of the several intermediate polarization statuses between the M1 and  extremes, characterizes this field. Moreover, the detailed features of metabolic reprogramming crucial for macrophage polarization are largely unknown; in particular, the role of β-oxidation is highly controversial.Manipulating the metabolism to redirect macrophage polarization might be useful in various pathologies, including an efficient skeletal muscle regeneration. Unraveling the complexity pertaining to metabolic signatures that are specific for the different macrophage subsets is crucial for identifying new compounds that are able to trigger macrophage polarization and that might be used for therapeutical purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112529>Modulation of the mechanism of apoptosis in cancer cell lines by treatment with silica-based nanostructured materials functionalized with different metallodrugs.</a></h2><p>The mesoporous silica-based material SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous-15) has been modified with the aminodiol ligand 3-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyltriethoxysilane (PADOH) to give the corresponding material SBA-PADOH.

In addition, mechanistic aspects of the apoptosis triggered by the synthesized materials have been studied in vitro in tumour cell lines derived from three distinct types of cancer in order to elucidate their growth inhibition and interference with the expression of tumour necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α) and the first apoptosis signal receptor (Fas or tumour necrosis factor receptor 6). It was observed that the antiproliferative and proapoptotic capacity of the materials depends on their functionalization with the different cytotoxic prodrugs (organotin or titanocene derivatives).

ITCH is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been shown to polarize macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We therefore investigated the effect of ITCH deficiency on the development of atherosclerosis. ApoE-/-ITCH-/- mice fed a western diet for 12 weeks showed increased circulating  macrophages together with a reduction in plaque formation. Bone marrow transplantation recreated the haemopoietic phenotype of increased circulating  macrophages but failed to affect plaque development. Intriguingly, the loss of ITCH lead to a reduction in circulating cholesterol levels through interference with nuclear SREBP2 clearance. This resulted in increased LDL reuptake through upregulation of LDL receptor expression. Furthermore, ApoE-/-ITCH-/- mice exhibit reduced hepatic steatosis, increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and an increased reliance on fatty acids as energy source. We found that ITCH ubiquitinates SIRT6, leading to its breakdown, and thus promoting hepatic lipid infiltration through reduced fatty acid oxidation. The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase ITCH modulates lipid metabolism impacting on atherosclerosis progression independently from effects on myeloid cells polarization through control of SIRT6 and SREBP2 ubiquitination.

Alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, notably impaired glucose oxidation, and increased mitochondrial fission, contribute to right ventricle (RV) dysfunction in PH. We hypothesized that the impairment of RV and left ventricular (LV) function in group 2 PH results in part from a proglycolytic isoform switch from pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoform 1 to 2 and from increased mitochondrial fission, due either to upregulation of expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) or its binding partners, mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 or 51 kDa (MiD49 or 51).  Group 2 PH was induced by supra-coronary aortic banding (SAB) in 5-week old male Sprague Dawley rats. Four weeks post SAB, echocardiography showed marked reduction of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (2.9 ± 0.1 vs. 4.0 ± 0.1 mm) and pulmonary artery acceleration time (24.3 ± 0.9 vs. 35.4 ± 1.8 ms) in SAB vs. sham rats. Nine weeks post SAB, left and right heart catheterization showed significant biventricular increases in end systolic and diastolic pressure in SAB vs. sham rats (LV: 226 ± 15 vs. 103 ± 5 mmHg, 34 ± 5 vs. 7 ± 1 mmHg; RV: 40 ± 4 vs. 22 ± 1 mmHg, and 4.7 ± 1.5 vs. 0.9 ± 0.5 mmHg, respectively). Picrosirius red staining showed marked biventricular fibrosis in SAB rats. There was increased muscularization of small pulmonary arteries in SAB rats. Confocal microscopy showed biventricular mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation in SAB vs. sham cardiomyocytes. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed a marked biventricular reduction in  size in SAB hearts. Immunoblot showed marked biventricular increase in PKM2/PKM1 and MiD51 expression. Mitofusin 2 and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 were increased in SAB LVs.  SAB caused group 2 PH. Impaired RV function and RV fibrosis were associated with increases in mitochondrial fission and expression of MiD51 and PKM2. While these changes would be expected to promote increased production of reactive oxygen species and a glycolytic shift in metabolism, further study is required to determine the functional consequences of these newly described mitochondrial abnormalities.</p></html>
