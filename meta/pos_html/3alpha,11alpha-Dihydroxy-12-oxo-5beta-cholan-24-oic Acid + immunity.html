Immunol. 1993. 23: 1417-1421). The role of TCR complementarity-determining region (CDR) residues 93 and 100-102 was examined by site-directed mutagenesis, following expression of the TCR alpha and beta extracellular domains from one clone as a TCR zeta fusion heterodimer in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells. For the first time we have measured direct binding of tetrameric HLA B*2705/NP383-391 complexes to transfected TCR. Independently peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APC) were used to induce TCR-mediated degranulation of RBL transfectants. Our results show a key role for the conserved TCRalpha CDR3 J alpha-encoded residue Y102 in recognition of HLA B27/NP383-391. Thus the Y102D mutation abolished both tetramer binding and degranulation in the presence of peptide-pulsed APC. Even the Y102F mutation, differing only by a single hydroxyl group from the native TCR, abolished detectable degranulation. Further mutations F93A and S100R also abolished recognition. Interestingly, the N101A mutation recognized HLA B27/NP in functional assays despite having significantly reduced tetramer binding, a finding consistent with "kinetic editing" models of T cell activation. Modeling of the GRb TCR CDR3alpha loop suggests that residue Y102 contacts the HLA B*2705 alpha1 helix. It is thus possible that selection of germ-line TCRAJ-encoded residues at position 102 may be MHC driven.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25828073>Identification of systemic immune response markers through metabolomic profiling of plasma from calves given an intra-nasally delivered respiratory vaccine.</a></h2><p>Vaccination procedures within the cattle industry are important disease control tools to minimize economic and welfare burdens associated with respiratory pathogens. However, new vaccine, antigen and carrier technologies are required to combat emerging viral strains and enhance the efficacy of respiratory vaccines, particularly at the point of pathogen entry. New technologies, specifically metabolomic profiling, could be applied to identify metabolite immune-correlates representative of immune protection following vaccination aiding in the design and screening of vaccine candidates. This study for the first time demonstrates the ability of untargeted UPLC-MS metabolomic profiling to identify metabolite immune correlates characteristic of immune responses following mucosal vaccination in calves. Male Holstein Friesian calves were vaccinated with Pfizer Rispoval® PI3 + RSV intranasal vaccine and metabolomic profiling of post-vaccination plasma revealed 12 metabolites whose peak intensities differed significantly from controls. Plasma levels of glycocholic , N-[(3α,5β,12α)-3,12-Dihydroxy-7,24-dioxocholan-24-yl]glycine, uric  and biliverdin were found to be significantly elevated in vaccinated animals following secondary vaccine administration, whereas hippuric  significantly decreased. In contrast, significant upregulation of taurodeoxycholic  and propionylcarnitine levels were confined to primary vaccine administration. Assessment of such metabolite markers may provide greater information on the immune pathways stimulated from vaccine formulations and benchmarking early metabolomic responses to highly immunogenic vaccine formulations could provide a means for rapidly assessing new vaccine formulations. Furthermore, the identification of metabolic systemic immune response markers which relate to specific cell signaling pathways of the immune system could allow for targeted vaccine design to stimulate key pathways which can be assessed at the metabolic level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15009427>Human beta-defensin-2 functions as a chemotactic agent for tumour necrosis factor-alpha-treated human neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are the effector cells in both innate and adaptive immunity, where they perform the functions of phagocytosis and killing of bacteria. They respond to a large number of chemoattractants, but their response to epithelial cell-derived human beta-defensins (hBD) has not been investigated. Here we report that hBD-2, but not hBD-1, is a specific chemoattractant for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-treated human neutrophils. The optimal concentration required for maximal chemotactic activity was 5 micro g/ml. The effect of hBD-2 on neutrophils was dependent on the G-protein-phospholipase C pathway, as demonstrated by inhibition by pertussis toxin and U-73122. In addition, ligand-receptor analysis indicated that the binding of hBD-2 was markedly inhibited by macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-, a specific and unique ligand for CCR6. Furthermore, anti-CCR6 antibody could almost completely suppress the cell migration induced by hBD-2, suggesting that hBD-2 mainly utilizes CCR6 as a functional receptor. Thus, our finding that hBD-2 is a potent chemoattractant for human neutrophils through specific receptors provides a novel mechanism by which this peptide contributes to the host defence system by recruiting neutrophils to /infection sites. This also suggests an important link between epithelial cell-derived antibacterial peptides and neutrophils during infection or .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25997679>miR-19b downregulates intestinal SOCS3 to reduce intestinal  in Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>Although aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression has frequently been observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its biological functions and targets remain largely unknown. Present study found that miR-19b was significantly downregulated in active Crohn's disease (CD). Using bioinformatics analysis, suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a physiological regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that controls several immuno-inflammatory diseases, was predicted to be a potential target of miR-19b. An inverse correlation between miR-19b and SOCS3 protein levels, but not mRNA, was identified in active-CD intestinal tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in Caco2 cells and HT29 cells, it was experimentally validated that miR-19b is a direct regulator of SOCS3. Using a luciferase reporter assay, it was confirmed that miR-19b directly recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SOCS3. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-19b decreased SOCS3 expression, leading to increased production of macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in Caco2 cells. In contrast, knockdown of miR-19b increased SOCS3 and decreased MIP-3α. Finally, intracolonically delivered miR-19b decreased the severity of colitis induced with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic  (TNBS). Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-19b suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting SOCS3 to modulate chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby prevents the pathogenesis of CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679709>Unique glandular ex-vivo Th1 and Th17 receptor motifs in Sjögren's syndrome patients using single-cell analysis.</a></h2><p>Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease in which the underlying cause has yet to be elucidated. The main objective of this study was to determine the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of individual infiltrating T helper (Th)-1 and 17 cells of pSS patients using single-cell analysis. Single-cell analysis of ex-vivo infiltrating T cells demonstrated that pSS patients had higher frequencies of activated Th17 cells. Single-cell TCR sequencing revealed that TCRβ variable (TRBV)3-1/joint (J)1-2 (CLFLSMSACVW) and TRBV20-1/J1-1 (SVGSTAIPP*T) were expressed by activated Th1 and Th17 cells in both cohorts. Uniquely, TCRα variable (TRAV)8-2/J5 (VVSDTVLETAGE) was expressed by Th1 cells present only in patients and complementarity-determining region (CDR)3α-specific motif (LSTD*E) present in both Th1/Th17 cells. The study demonstrates that both activated Th1 and Th17 cells of pSS patients showed restricted clonal diversities of which two CDR3 motifs were present in controls and patients, with another two motifs unique to pSS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Calcium mobilization assays performed with mCCR6 transfectants showed significant responses upon addition of mMIP-. Murine MIP- RNA is expressed in thymus, small intestine and colon, whereas mCCR6 RNA is expressed in spleen and lymph nodes. RT-PCR analysis of FACS-sorted lymphoid and antigen presenting cell subsets showed mCCR6 expression mainly in B cells, CD8- splenic dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells. The cloning and functional characterization of the mCCR6 and mMIP- will allow the study of the role of these proteins in mouse models of  and immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9294138>CCR6, a CC chemokine receptor that interacts with macrophage inflammatory protein  and is highly expressed in human dendritic cells.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cells initiate immune responses by ferrying antigen from the tissues to the lymphoid organs for presentation to lymphocytes. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this migratory behavior. We have identified a chemokine receptor which appears to be selectively expressed in human dendritic cells derived from CD34+ cord blood precursors, but not in dendritic cells derived from peripheral blood monocytes. When stably expressed as a recombinant protein in a variety of host cell backgrounds, the receptor shows a strong interaction with only one chemokine among 25 tested: the recently reported CC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein . Thus, we have designated this receptor as the CC chemokine receptor 6. The cloning and characterization of a dendritic cell CC chemokine receptor suggests a role for chemokines in the control of the migration of dendritic cells and the regulation of dendritic cell function in immunity and infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22900503>Recent advances targeting innate -mediated therapies against HIV-1 infection.</a></h2><p>Early defence mechanisms of innate  respond rapidly to infection against HIV-1 in the genital mucosa. Additionally, innate  optimises effective adaptive immune responses against persistent HIV infection. Recent research has highlighted the intrinsic roles of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G, tripartite motif-containing protein 5, tetherin, sterile α-motif and histidine/aspartic  domain-containing protein 1 in restricting HIV-1 replication. Likewise, certain endogenously secreted antimicrobial peptides, namely α/β/θ-defensins, lactoferrins, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, trappin-2/elafin and macrophage inflammatory protein-3α are reportedly protective. Whilst certain factors directly inhibit HIV, others can be permissive. Interferon-λ3 exerts an anti-HIV function by activating Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription-mediated innate responses. Morphine has been found to impair intracellular innate , contributing to HIV establishment in macrophages. Interestingly, protegrin-1 could be used therapeutically to inhibit early HIV-1 establishment. Moreover, chloroquine inhibits plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation and improves effective T-cell responses. This minireview summarizes the recently identified targets for innate -mediated therapies and outlines the challenges that lie ahead in improving treatment of HIV infection.© 2012 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17828267>Germline-encoded recognition of diverse glycolipids by natural killer T cells.</a></h2><p>Natural killer T cells expressing 'invariant' T cell receptor alpha-chains (TCRalpha chains) containing variable (V) and joining (J) region V(alpha)14-J(alpha)18 (V(alpha)14i) rearrangements recognize both endogenous and microbial glycolipids in the context of CD1d. How cells expressing an invariant TCRalpha chain and a restricted set of TCRbeta chains recognize structurally diverse antigens is not clear. Here we show that a V(alpha)14i TCR recognized many alpha-linked glycolipids by means of a 'hot-spot' of germline-encoded amino  in complementarity-determining regions , 1alpha and 2beta. This hot-spot did not shift during the recognition of structurally distinct antigens, suggesting that the V(alpha)14i TCR functions as a pattern-recognition receptor, conferring on natural killer T cells the ability to sense and respond in an innate way to pathogens displaying antigenic alpha-linked glycolipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474775>Reproducible selection of high avidity CD8+ T-cell clones following secondary acute virus infection.</a></h2><p>The recall of memory CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), elicited by prior virus infection or vaccination, is critical for immune protection. The extent to which this arises as a consequence of stochastic clonal expansion vs. active selection of particular clones remains unclear. Using a parallel adoptive transfer protocol in combination with single cell analysis to define the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3α and CDR3β regions of individual T-cell receptor (TCR) heterodimers, we characterized the antigen-driven recall of the same memory CTL population in three individual recipients. This high-resolution analysis showed reproducible enrichment (or diminution) of particular TCR clonotypes across all challenged animals. These changes in clonal composition were TCRα- and β chain-dependent and were directly related to the avidity of the TCR for the virus-derived peptide (p) + major histocompatibility complex class I molecule. Despite this shift in clonotype representation indicative of differential selection, there was no evidence of overall repertoire narrowing, suggesting a strategy to optimize CTL responses while safeguarding TCR diversity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10064080>Selective expression of liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC) in intestinal epithelium in mice and humans.</a></h2><p>The liver and activation-regulated chemokine (LARC), also termed MIP- and Exodus, is a novel human CC chemokine with a selective chemotactic activity for lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Here we describe genomic and cDNA clones encoding the murine orthologue of LARC (mLARC). The gene consists of four exons and three introns. The 5'-noncoding region of about 400 bp contains typical TATA and CAAT boxes but no other potential regulatory elements so far described. The cDNA encodes a CC chemokine of 97 amino  residues with the highest homology to human LARC (64% amino  identity). The 3'-noncoding region contains as many as five potential mRNA destabilization signals. mLARC was strongly and transiently induced in the murine monocytoid cell line J774 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not by cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta or IL-4. In normal mice, mLARC mRNA was expressed selectively in intestinal tissues such as small intestine and colon. Upon treatment with LPS, mLARC expression was enhanced in intestinal tissues and induced in some lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. Because of alternative splicing, there are two types of transcripts encoding mLARC and its variant mLARCvar with and without an N-terminal alanine in the mature protein, respectively. Both types of transcripts appeared to be expressed in various mouse tissues. In situ hybridization revealed that epithelial cells of intestinal tissues, especially those lining lymphoid follicles, expressed mLARC. Localization of LARC mRNA in epithelial cells was also demonstrated in a human appendix. Furthermore, mLARC was efficiently chemotactic for cells such as gammadelta type T cells in intestinal epithelium and naive B cells in Peyer's patches. Thus, in both humans and mice, LARC may be physiologically involved in formation and function of the mucosal lymphoid tissues by attracting lymphocytes and dendritic cells toward epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652398>Preferential expression and function of Toll-like receptor 3 in human astrocytes.</a></h2><p>In contrast to other tissues, the central nervous system (CNS) is essentially devoid of MHC expression and shielded from antibodies by the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, a rapid local innate immune response by resident brain cells is required to effectively fight infectious agents. This study analyzed the expression and function of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in cultured human astrocytes. Quantitative PCR for TLRs 1 to 10 showed a basal expression of TLR3 that could be enhanced by IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, and IFN-beta. The other TLRs were barely detectable and not inducible by the same cytokines. IFN-gamma-activated astrocytes responded to TLR3 ligand poly (I:C) engagement with IL-6 production, while ligands of other TLRs, like LPS, lipoteichoic , peptidoglycan, flagellin, and CpG, had no effect. Poly (I:C) also triggered astrocyte production of TNF-alpha and the chemokines CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, CCL20/MIP-, and CXCL10/IP-10. The adapter molecules MyD88 (full length and short isoform), TIRAP/Mal, and TICAM-1/TRIF, which are required for TLR signaling, were all expressed by astrocytes. Thus, resting and activated human astrocytes express preferentially TLR3 and, upon TLR3 engagement, produce IL-6 and chemokines active on T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. These data indicate that astrocytes function as sentinels for viral infections in the CNS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20534460>Oligoclonality and innate-like features in the TCR repertoire of type II NKT cells reactive to a beta-linked self-glycolipid.</a></h2><p>TCR-mediated recognition of beta-linked self-glycolipids bound to CD1d is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the TCR repertoire of a CD1d-restricted type II NKT cell subset reactive to sulfatide involved in the regulation of autoimmunity and antitumor . The sulfatide/CD1d-tetramer(+) cells isolated from naïve mice show an oligoclonal TCR repertoire with predominant usage of the Valpha3/Valpha1-Jalpha7/Jalpha9 and Vbeta8.1/Vbeta3.1-Jbeta2.7 gene segments. The CDR3 regions of both the alpha- and beta-chains are encoded by either germline or nongermline gene segments of limited lengths containing several conserved residues. Presence of dominant clonotypes with limited TCR gene usage for both TCR alpha- and beta-chains in type II NKT cells reflects specific antigen recognition not found in the type I NKT cells but similar to the MHC-restricted T cells. Although potential CD1d-binding tyrosine residues in the CDR2beta region are conserved between most type I and type II NKT TCRs, CDR 1alpha and  regions differ significantly between the two subsets. Collectively, the TCR repertoire of sulfatide-reactive type II NKT cells exhibits features of both antigen-specific conventional T cells and innate-like cells, and these findings provide important clues to the recognition of beta-linked glycolipids by CD1d-restricted T cells in general.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100021>Fine-Tuning of the RIG-I-Like Receptor/Interferon Regulatory Factor 3-Dependent Antiviral Innate Immune Response by the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/β-Catenin Pathway.</a></h2><p>Induction of an antiviral innate immune response relies on pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic -inducible gene 1-like receptors (RLR), to detect invading pathogens, resulting in the activation of multiple latent transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Upon sensing of viral RNA and DNA, IRF3 is phosphorylated and recruits coactivators to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and selected sets of IRF3-regulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as those for ISG54 (Ifit2), ISG56 (Ifit1), and viperin (Rsad2). Here, we used wild-type, glycogen synthase kinase 3α knockout (GSK-3α(-/-)), GSK-3β(-/-), and GSK-3α/β double-knockout (DKO) embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as GSK-3β(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells in which GSK-3α was knocked down to demonstrate that both isoforms of GSK-3, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, are required for this antiviral immune response. Moreover, the use of two selective small-molecule GSK-3 inhibitors (CHIR99021 and BIO-acetoxime) or ES cells reconstituted with the catalytically inactive versions of GSK-3 isoforms showed that GSK-3 activity is required for optimal induction of antiviral innate . Mechanistically, GSK-3 isoform activation following Sendai virus infection results in phosphorylation of β-catenin at S33/S37/T41, promoting IRF3 DNA binding and activation of IRF3-regulated ISGs.

Their impaired synthesis and production lead to adverse health effects. Some environmental toxicants, including phthalate esters (PAEs), are associated with endocrine disruption. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) also cause adrenal toxicity and alteration of GC biosynthesis and their functions. Using in silico tools of Schrodinger Maestro 9.4, we performed a molecular docking study of 32 ligands including PAEs of a known endocrine-disrupting potential with the selected enzymes of the GC biosynthesis pathway (GBP) such as CYP11A1, CYP11B2, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, CYP21A2 and 3α/20β-HSD. Binding affinities of the PAEs were compared with known inhibitors of these enzymes. Amongst PAEs, diphenyl benzene-1, 2 - dicarboxylate (DPhP) showed the lowest docking score of -8.95616 kcal mol against CYP21A1. Besides, benzyl butyl benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (BBzP), bis(7-methylnonyl) benzene-1,2 dicarboxylate (DIDP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (DEHP) also showed comparable molecular interaction with enzymes of GBP. DPhP showed a significant molecular interaction with different enzymes of GBP such as CYP21A1, CYP11A1 and CYP11B2. These interactions mainly included H-bonding, hydrophobic, polar and van dar Waals' interactions. Interestingly, this in silico study revealed that certain PAEs have more inhibitory potential against enzymes of GBP than their respective known inhibitors. Such studies become more relevant in the risk assessment of exposure to mixtures of phthalate eaters.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16155407>Iron chelator induces MIP-alpha/CCL20 in human intestinal epithelial cells: implication for triggering mucosal adaptive .</a></h2><p>A previous report by this laboratory demonstrated that bacterial iron chelator (siderophore) triggers inflammatory signals, including the production of CXC chemokine IL-8, in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Microarray-based gene expression profiling revealed that iron chelator also induces macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha (MIP-)/CC chemokine-ligand 20 (CCL20). As CCL20 is chemotactic for the cells involved in host adaptive , this suggests that iron chelator may stimulate IECs to have the capacity to link mucosal innate and adaptive . The basal medium from iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO)-treated HT-29 monolayers was as chemotactic as recombinant human CCL20 at equivalent concentrations to attract CCR6(+) cells. The increase of CCL20 protein secretion appeared to correspond to that of CCL20 mRNA levels, as determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The efficacy of DFO at inducing CCL20 mRNA was also observed in human PBMCs and in THP-1 cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Interestingly, unlike other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, a time-dependent experiment revealed that DFO slowly induces CCL20, suggesting a novel mechanism of action. A pharmacologic study also revealed that multiple signaling pathways are differentially involved in CCL20 production by DFO, while some of those pathways are not involved in TNF-alpha-induced CCL20 production. Collectively, these results demonstrate that, in addition to some bacterial products known to induce host adaptive immune responses, direct chelation of host iron by infected bacteria may also contribute to the initiation of host adaptive  in the intestinal mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26429912>Structural Basis for Clonal Diversity of the Public T Cell Response to a Dominant Human Cytomegalovirus Epitope.</a></h2><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous and persistent human pathogen that is kept in check by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Individuals expressing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule HLA-A2 produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the immunodominant CMV epitope NLVPMVATV (NLV). The NLV-specific T cell repertoire is characterized by a high prevalence of TCRs that are frequently observed in multiple unrelated individuals. These public TCRs feature identical, or nearly identical, complementarity-determining region 3α (CDR3α) and/or CDR3β sequences. The TCRs may express public CDR3α motifs alone, public CDR3β motifs alone, or dual public CDR3αβ motifs. In addition, the same public CDR3α motif may pair with different CDR3β motifs (and the reverse), giving rise to highly diverse NLV-specific TCR repertoires. To investigate the structural underpinnings of this clonal diversity, we determined crystal structures of two public TCRs (C7 and C25) in complex with NLV·HLA-A2. These TCRs utilize completely different CDR3α and CDR3β motifs that, in addition, can associate with multiple variable α and variable β regions in NLV-specific T cell repertoires. The C7·NLV·HLA-A2 and C25·NLV·HLA-A2 complexes exhibit divergent TCR footprints on peptide-MHC such that C25 is more focused on the central portion of the NLV peptide than is C7. These structures combined with molecular modeling show how the public CDR3α motif of C25 may associate with different variable α regions and how the public CDR3α motif of C7 may pair with different CDR3β motifs. This interchangeability of TCR V regions and CDR3 motifs permits multiple structural solutions to binding an identical peptide-MHC ligand and thereby the generation of a clonally diverse public T cell response to CMV.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15769541>Directed cell migration via chemoattractants released from degradable microspheres.</a></h2><p>Chemotaxis, cell migration directed by spatial concentration gradients of chemoattractant molecules, is critical for proper function of the immune system. Materials capable of generating defined chemoattractant gradients via controlled release may be useful for the design of improved vaccines and immunotherapies that draw specific cells to an immunization site. To this end, we encapsulated formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys (fN'LFN'YK) peptides or macrophage inflammatory protein- (MIP- or CCL20) in degradable poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres that provided sustained release for more than 2 weeks in vitro. fN'LFN'YK and MIP- chemoattract dendritic cells (DCs), the key antigen-presenting cells involved in generation of primary immune responses, and their precursors, monocytes. Using an in vitro videomicroscopy migration assay, we detected strong chemotaxis of human monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs through 3D collagen gels toward microspheres releasing fN'LFN'YK. Similarly, microparticles releasing MIP- were able to attract mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Strikingly, prolonged attraction of DCs from distances up to 500 microm from the source to the point of contact with individual microspheres was observed.

II. Pyrogenic and anti-pyrogenic activity in vitro of some endogenous steroids of man.</a></h2><p>The pyrogenic properties of some C-19 and C-21 steroids were examined by in vitro incubation of human blood leukocytes with serum-buffer solutions of the steroids and injection of the 18-hr supernatants into rabbits. In previous studies this method demonstrated release of leukocyte endogenous pyrogen by etiocholanolone. With two exceptions, steroids known to cause fever in man, such as 11beta-OH etiocholanolone and -hydroxy-5beta-pregnane-20-one were also pyrogenic in vitro. All steroids tested which are nonpyrogenic in man, such as androsterone, 3beta-OH etiocholanolone, and , 17alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one were also nonpyrogenic in vitro. Solubility in aqueous solution did not correlate with pyrogenic capacity. Inhibition of pyrogen release from human leukocytes in vitro by hydrocortisone and estradiol was demonstrated. Hydrocortisone-treated leukocytes released less pyrogen than did normal leukocytes when stimulated either by etiocholanolone or by phagocytosis of heat-killed staphylococci. On the other hand, estradiol-treated blood leukocytes and mononuclear cells showed significant suppression of pyrogen release when phagocytosis, but not etiocholanolone, was used as the stimulus. When blood cells were incubated with progesterone, greater than normal amounts of pyrogen were released following phagocytosis, and the inhibiting effect of estradiol could be partially reversed. Neither estradiol nor hydrocortisone appeared to act on rabbit leukocytes. These studies indicate that a variety of naturally-occurring steroids may alter pyrogen release from leukocytes. Alterations in steroid balance in man may influence normal temperature regulation and contribute to clinical fevers.</p></html>
