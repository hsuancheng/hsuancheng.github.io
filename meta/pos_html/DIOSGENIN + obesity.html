Thus, the purpose of the present study was to further confirm its effects of prevention and then to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying its activity in mice. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6J mice and ob/ob mice were used as the experimental models. Serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were determined, and the mRNA and protein expression levels were detected. The results indicated that dioscin alleviated body weight and liver lipid accumulation symptoms, increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated oxidative damage, suppressed inflammation, inhibited triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis, promoted fatty acid β-oxidation, down-regulated MAPK phosphorylation levels, and induced autophagy to alleviate fatty liver conditions. Dioscin prevents diet induced  and NAFLD by increasing energy expenditure. This agent should be developed as a new candidate for  and NAFLD prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28610976>Dioscin suppresses TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and suppresses A549 lung cancer migration and invasion.</a></h2><p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important cellular process, occurs during cancer development and progression, has a crucial role in metastasis by enhancing the motility of tumor cells. Dioscin is a polyphenolic component isolated from Phyllanthus amarus, which exhibits a wide range of pharmacological and physiological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-, anti-fungal, and anti-viral activities. However, the possible role of dioscin in the EMT is unclear. We investigated the suppressive effect of dioscin on the EMT. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is known to induce EMT in a number of cancer cell types and promote lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion. To verify the inhibitory role of dioscin in lung cancer migration and invasion, we investigated the use of dioscin as inhibitors of TGF-β1-induced EMT in A549 lung cancer cells in vitro. Here, we found that dioscin prominently increased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and expression of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and Snail during the TGF-β1-induced EMT. In addition, dioscin inhibited the TGF-β1-induced increase in cell migration and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells. Also, dioscin remarkably inhibited TGF-β1-regulated activation of MMP-2/9, Smad2, and p38. Taken together, our findings provide new evidence that dioscin suppresses lung cancer migration, and invasion in vitro by inhibiting the TGF-β1-induced EMT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These hormones are inactive precursors that are transformed into active sex steroids in peripheral target tissues. These hormones are used for the energy, vitality and the natural support of most bodily functions that involve the endocrine system. DHEA is a 19 carbon steroid hormone, is lipophilic, and can be converted to DHEAs by activity of the enzyme sulphotransferasein the liver and adrenal glands. These are naturally synthesized in our body through cholesterol- pregnenolone pathway and can also be synthesized from various other sources like , geniestein, wild yam, soy and cholesterol in laboratory. It serves as an indirect precursor to estrogen and testosterone and other steroid hormones. This hormone progressively declines at the rate of 2% per year. DHEA evidence a large variety of pharmacological activities like antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-allergic,  treatment and cardiovascular property. It is beneficial in autoimmune disorders like lupus erythematosus, immune modulation, muscle building and hormonal problems. DHEA is known as an anti-ageing hormone, in osteoporosis and in dementia. It can also be used as a supplement as directed by the physician in various condition.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of dioscin on regulating insulin resistance of adipose tissue induced by a high‑fat diet (HFD). An animal model was established successfully using C57BL/6J mice with high‑fat feeding, followed by treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dioscin through gavage for 18 weeks, and randomly divided into a control group, a HFD model group and a dioscin group treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dioscin for 12 weeks. Histopathological changes in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical parameters of the serum were also monitored, including glucose, insulin, total triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and adipose insulin resistance (Adipo‑IR) levels. Expression of the mRNA and associated proteins of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1)/phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values of mice fed with a HFD were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). However, dioscin administration significantly decreased HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05), suggesting the effects of dioscin on attenuating insulin resistance. RT‑qPCR results indicated that the associated genes of the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway were significantly downregulated by HFD compared with the control group (P<0.05), while dioscin significantly increased the expression of those genes compared with the control group (P<0.05). Similarly, the significant increase in phosphorylated (p‑)IRS‑1/IRS‑1 (P<0.05) and p‑Akt/Akt (P<0.05) values were substantially reversed by dioscin treatment. Dioscin pronouncedly mitigated insulin resistance in adipose tissues through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway and has potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for the therapy of HFD‑induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27761903>The role of perivascular adipose tissue in -induced vascular dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Under physiological conditions, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) attenuates agonist-induced vasoconstriction by releasing vasoactive molecules including hydrogen peroxide, angiotensin 1-7, adiponectin, methyl palmitate, hydrogen sulfide, NO and leptin. This anticontractile effect of PVAT is lost under conditions of . The central mechanism underlying this PVAT dysfunction in  is likely to be an ' triad' (consisting of PVAT hypoxia, inflammation and oxidative stress) that leads to the impairment of PVAT-derived vasoregulators. The production of hydrogen sulfide, NO and adiponectin by PVAT is reduced in , whereas the vasodilator response to leptin is impaired (vascular leptin resistance). Strikingly, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine is reduced only in PVAT-containing, but not in PVAT-free thoracic aorta isolated from diet-induced obese mice, indicating a unique role for PVAT in -induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, PVAT dysfunction has also been observed in small arteries isolated from the gluteal/visceral fat biopsy samples of obese individuals. Therefore, PVAT may represent a new therapeutic target for vascular complications in . A number of approaches are currently being tested under experimental conditions. Potential therapeutic strategies improving PVAT function include body weight reduction, enhancing PVAT hydrogen sulfide release (e.g. rosiglitazone, atorvastatin and cannabinoid CB receptor agonists) and NO production (e.g. arginase inhibitors), inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inhibition of inflammation with melatonin or cytokine antagonists, activators of AMP-activated kinase (e.g. metformin, resveratrol and ) and adiponectin releasers or expression enhancers.This article is part of a themed section on Molecular Mechanisms Regulating Perivascular Adipose Tissue - Potential Pharmacological Targets?

Here, dietary fenugreek seed flour and  were evaluated on a model of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by abdominal aortas isolated from rats receiving high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHSD). 60 male Wistar rats were randomized into six groups: (i) negative control getting conventional rat feed regimen; (ii) positive control receiving HFHSD; (iii) a test group fed 2 g/kg bw/day fenugreek seed flour (containing 10 mg/kg bw/day ) + HFHSD; (iv) three test groups fed 1, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day  + HFHSD. Alimentary treatments were carried out for six weeks. The abdominal aortas were isolated, and 2 mm wide rings were sectioned off and mounted at a resting tension of 10 mN in organ baths containing Krebs solution (36 °C) exposed to 95% O₂ and 5% CO₂. After 60-min incubation, a norepinephrine concentration-response (E/c) curve was generated to determine their half-maximal effective concentration (EC) value. After 60-min wash-out, a pre-contraction with norepinephrine EC was made, followed by an acetylcholine E/c curve. Plasma glutathione levels, glutathione-handling enzyme activities and blood antioxidant capacities were also determined. HFHSD significantly decreased the dilatory response to acetylcholine and increased plasma glutathione levels and these effects were significantly reversed by fenugreek seed flour, 10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day . Both fenugreek and  treatments prevent HFHSD-induced endothelial dysfunction and redox changes. As fenugreek treatment was more effective at lower acetylcholine concentrations than  treatments, components of fenugreek other than  may contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary fenugreek seed flour.</p></html>
