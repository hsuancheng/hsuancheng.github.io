<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993784>[Advances in study of dioscin--a natural product].</a></h1><p>Dioscin, a typical saponin, is widely present in the family of Dioscoreaceae, Liliaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Rosaceae, especially in Dioscoreaceae, including Discorea nipponica Makino, Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright and Dioscorea panthaica Prain et Burkill. Traditional Chinese medicine reported that dioscin plays a role in expectorant, relaxing the muscles and stimulating the blood circulation, aiding digestion and diuresis. With the development of science and technology in recent years, some new extraction and separation techniques and methods have been applied to the study of dioscin, and more and more pharmacological effects were found. Modern pharmacology studies have confirmed that dioscin had some activities on desensitization, anti-inflammatory, -lowering, anti-tumor, hepatoprotection and anti-viral. After oral administration, dioscin is metabolized to , which is the true active ingredient and is an important raw material to synthesize steroid hormone drugs. Therefore, the studies on dioscin are valueable and promising. In this review, we make a summary on the researches of dioscin including the extraction technology, separation and prepara- tion, chemical synthesis, drug , determination and pharmacological researches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25733328>Methyl protodioscin increases ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux while inhibiting gene expressions for synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides by suppressing SREBP transcription and microRNA 33a/b levels.</a></h1><p>Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) regulate homeostasis of LDL, HDL and triglycerides. This study was aimed to determine if inhibition of SREBPs by methyl protodioscin (MPD) regulates downstream gene and protein expressions of  metabolisms. In THP-1 macrophages, MPD increases levels of ABCA1 mRNA and protein in dose- and time-dependent manners, and apoA-1-mediated cholesterol efflux. The underlying mechanisms for the effects is that MPD inhibits the transcription of SREBP1c and SREBP2, and decreases levels of microRNA 33a/b hosted in the introns of SREBPs, which leads to reciprocally increase ABCA1 levels. In HepG2 cells, MPD shows the same effects as these observed in THP-1 macrophages. MPD also decreases the gene expressions of HMGCR, FAS and ACC for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. MPD further promotes LDL receptor through reducing the PCSK9 level. Collectively, the study demonstrates that MPD potentially increase HDL cholesterol while reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Male Wistar rats received a hypercholesterolemic diet (HD), HD + atorvastatin (HD+ATV), HD + ezetimibe (HD+EZT), HD +  (HD+DG), HD+ATV+EZT, or HD+ATV+DG for 40 days. We also included a control normal group (ND). The labelled compounds were administered on day 30. The animals were placed in metabolic cages for daily feces collection. At day 40 the rats were sacrificed.  extracts from blood, liver, spinal cord, testicles, kidneys, epididymis, intestine, and feces were analyzed for radioactivity. Cholesterol activity was the highest in the liver in HD rats. DG diminished one half of this activity in HD+DG and HD+ATV+DG groups in comparison with the HD group. HD+ATV rats showed four to almost ten-fold cholesterol activity in the spinal cord compared with the ND or HD rats. Fecal elimination of neutral steroids was approximately two-fold higher in the HD+DG and HD+ATV+DG groups. Taurocholic acid activity was four to ten-fold higher in HD+DG intestine as compared to the other experimental groups. Taurocholic activity in the liver of HD and HD+DG groups was two and a half higher than in ND. Our results show that the combination of DG and ATV induced the highest cholesterol reduction in the liver and other tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27810341> ameliorates gestational diabetes through inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1.</a></h1><p>Gestational diabetes (GD) is a pathological condition, affecting 2-5% of pregnant women.  (DSG) possesses a variety of biological activities. The present study was designed to examine the effect of DSG on GD and to investigate the possible mechanism in C57BL/KsJ-Lep (db/+) mice. We found that DSG could remarkably ameliorated GD in pregnant db/+ mice, as reflected by the improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance, and the decrease of fasting blood glucose and insulin level and the increase of hepatic glycogen content. The results showed that DSG could inhibit oxidative stress in pregnant db/+ mice, as evidenced by decrease of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, increase of glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. DSG could also attenuate the abnormal changes of lipid profiles, including TC, TG and LDL, in pregnant db/+ mice. The increase of the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 (SREBP-1) and its target genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), was inhibited by DSG in pregnant db/+ mice. Moreover, overexpression of SREBP-1 by LV-SREBP-1 injection could markedly inhibit the protective effect of DSG against disorder of glucose and lipid  and oxidative stress in GD mice. The data demonstrated that SREBP-1 may be of major target of DSG that mediated its anti-diabetic activities in GD. The data provide novel insights into the biological activities of DSG and pave way for the investigation of the anti-diabetic activities against GD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Given the key roles of macrophages in cholesterol  and atherogenesis, it is critical to investigate macrophage cholesterol efflux and development of atherosclerotic lesion after Dgn treatment.This study was designed to evaluate the potential effects of Dgn on macrophage cholesterol  and the development of aortic atherosclerosis, and to explore its underlying mechanisms.Dgn significantly up-regulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein, but didn't affect liver X receptor α levels in foam cells derived from human THP-1 macrophages and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) as determined by western blotting. The miR-19b levels were markedly down-regulated in Dgn-treated THP-1 macrophages/MPM-derived foam cells. Cholesterol transport assays revealed that treatment with Dgn alone or together with miR-19b inhibitor notably enhanced ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, resulting in the reduced levels of total cholesterol, free cholesterol and cholesterol ester as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The fecal 3H-sterol originating from cholesterol-laden MPMs was increased in apolipoprotein E knockout mice treated with Dgn or both Dgn and antagomiR-19b. Treatment with Dgn alone or together with antagomiR-19b elevated plasma high-density lipoprotein levels, but reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein levels. Accordingly, aortic  deposition and plaque area were reduced, and collagen content and ABCA1 expression were increased in mice treated with Dgn alone or together with antagomiR-19b. However, miR-19b overexpression abrogated the -lowering and atheroprotective effects induced by Dgn.The present study demonstrates that Dgn enhances ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux and inhibits aortic atherosclerosis progression by suppressing macrophage miR-19b expression.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Oxidative stress along with inflammation is the major causative factor leading to diabetic complications. The present study examined the protective effect of , a steroidal saponin, in diabetes induced early kidney injury.Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (45mg/kg) in rats followed by treatment for 28 days with  (5, 10 and 20mg/kg, oral). Blood glucose levels,  profile, serum advanced glycation end-products, biomarkers of kidney damage like urinary protein excretion, kidney hypertrophy index and creatinine in serum and urine were determined. Biochemical analysis of oxidative stress parameters such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione,  peroxidation (LPO) and myeloperoxidase level were evaluated in kidney homogenates. Histopathological evaluation of kidney was also studied.Treatment with  significantly ameliorated the altered oxidative stress levels in STZ induced diabetic rats resulting in decreased LPO and increased endogenous antioxidant levels in a dose-dependent manner. Blood glucose was significantly decreased at 20mg/kg. The distorted levels of biomarkers suggestive of kidney damage were significantly normalized by  providing protection to kidneys also confirmed by histopathological studies. Decreased myeloperoxidase levels in  treatment groups revealed its anti-inflammatory activity.The above study justifies  as a promising candidate in diabetes associated complication through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to further confirm its effects of prevention and then to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying its activity in mice. High- diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6J mice and ob/ob mice were used as the experimental models. Serum and hepatic biochemical parameters were determined, and the mRNA and protein expression levels were detected. The results indicated that dioscin alleviated body weight and liver  accumulation symptoms, increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated oxidative damage, suppressed inflammation, inhibited triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis, promoted fatty acid β-oxidation, down-regulated MAPK phosphorylation levels, and induced autophagy to alleviate fatty liver conditions. Dioscin prevents diet induced obesity and NAFLD by increasing energy expenditure. This agent should be developed as a new candidate for obesity and NAFLD prevention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446497>Isolation and prevention of calcium oxalate-induced apoptotic death and oxidative stress in MDCK cells by .</a></h1><p>Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) has been shown to be the most frequent constituent of kidney stones. The interactions of cells with COM crystals produce a variety of physiological and pathological changes including the development of oxidative stress, cellular injury and apoptosis. On the other hand, , a steroidal sapogenin, is well known for its antioxidant activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether  protects MDCK renal epithelial cells from COM-induced apoptotic death.  was isolated from fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum by silica gel column chromatography. It was obtained in high yields (1.23%) and the purity was ascertained by HPTLC analysis.

However, the pharmacological data are insufficient and the mechanisms have not been reported. Thus, this study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of dioscin against NAFLD. The primary cultured hepatocytes, AML-12 and HepG-2 cells were treated with palmic acid (PA) after dioscin treatment. The mice and rats were induced by high  diet to establish the in vivo models of NAFLD. Dioscin obviously alleviated liver  accumulation symptoms and improved the levels of serum and hepatic biochemical parameters in vitro and in vivo. Further investigations revealed that dioscin significantly attenuated  via adjusting SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway to regulate the expression levels of SREBP-1c, CPT, FAS, SCD, FoxO1 and ATGL. In addition, suppression of SIRT1 by Nicotinamide or abrogation of AMPK by Compound C eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on . Therefore, our findings further demonstrated that dioscin markedly prevented NAFLD through adjusting  via SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway, which should be developed as a new candidate for NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Diet intervention, particularly naturaceutical antioxidants have anti-diabetic potential and avert oxidative damage linked with diabetic pathogenesis. The present study investigated the effects of , a saponin from fenugreek, on the changes in  profile in plasma, liver, heart and brain in high- diet-streptozotocin (HFD-STZ)-induced diabetic rats.  was administered to HFD-STZ induced diabetic rats by orally at 60 mg kg(-1) body weight for 30 days to assess its effects on body weight gain, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids in plasma, liver, heart and brain.The levels of body weight, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, VLDL-C and LDL-C were increased significantly (P < 0.05) whereas HDL-C level decreased in the HFD/STZ diabetic rats. Administration of  to HFD-STZ diabetic rats caused a decrease in body weight gain, blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and also it modulated  profile in plasma and tissues.The traditional plant fenugreek and its constituents mediate its anti-diabetic potential through mitigating hyperglycaemic status, altering insulin resistance by alleviating metabolic dysregulation of  profile in both plasma and tissues.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916869>Protodioscin ameliorates oxidative stress, inflammation and histology outcome in Complete Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis rats.</a></h1><p>Protective effect of protodioscin or methyl protodioscin against inflammation had been reported in various inflammation diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of protodioscin against Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis rats. Rats randomly divided into model groups were injected with CFA, companied with different dose of protodioscin (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight). The histology, changes in biochemical parameters and inflammatory cytokines expression were detected for anti-inflammation effect evaluation of protodioscin. CFA treatment induced arthritic rats with swelling paw, ankle inflammation, and area of lymphocyte infiltration, upregulated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, cyclo-oxygenase 2, and IL-6 as well as prostaglandin E2), articular elastase, myeloperoxidase,  peroxidase and nitrite oxide levels, downregulated glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In contrast, protodioscin ameliorated all the changes induced by CFA in rats, suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect of protodioscin. We concluded that protodioscin administration into CFA-induced arthritis rats protected against CFA-induced oxidative stress, neutrophil infiltration, and inflammation, suggesting the anti-inflammatory effect and the therapeutic potential of protodioscin for arthritis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466631>Ameliorative effects of protodioscin on experimental diabetic nephropathy.</a></h1><p>Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most common and serious complications of diabetes mellitus.The present study aimed to investigate the effects of protodioscin on renal damage in high- diet-fed and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.After 4 weeks of feeding a high- diet, male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected 35 mg/kg streptozotocin intraperitoneally. The diabetic rats were divided into 4 groups, and treated orally with carboxymethylcellulose sodium, metformin, or protodioscin (20 or 40 mg/kg). After 12 weeks of treatment, blood, urine, and renal tissue were collected for biochemical and histological examination.Protodioscin significantly reduced the levels of blood glucose, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen, and also the excretion of urinary protein and albumin in diabetic rats. Histological examinations showed that protodioscin ameliorated the diabetes-induced glomerular and tubular pathological changes. Furthermore, protodioscin significantly reduced the renal concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, and TNF-α.These results indicate that protodioscin has ameliorative effects on diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2018.

Cyclophosphamide (CP) is the most commonly used anticancer and immunosuppressant drug, which causes several toxic effects, especially on the reproductive system. Patients who need to use CP therapy exhibit reduced fertility or infertility, which impacts both physically and emotionally on the decision to use this drug, especially among young men. We hypothesized that the treatment with TT dry extract would protect the male reproductive system against CP toxicity. Mice received dry extract of TT (11 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 14 days. Saline or CP was injected intraperitoneally at a single dose (100 mg/kg) on the 14th day. Animals were euthanized 24 h after CP administration, and testes and epididymis were removed for biochemical and histopathological analysis and sperm evaluation. The dry extract of TT was evaluated by HPLC analysis and demonstrated the presence of protodioscin (1.48%, /). CP exposure increased  peroxidation, reactive species, and protein carbonylation and altered antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and GR). Moreover, acute exposure to CP caused a reduction on 17 -HSD activity, which may be related to the reduction in serum testosterone levels, histopathological changes observed in the testes, and the quality of the semen. The present study highlighted the role of TT dry extract to ameliorate the alterations induced by CP administration in mice testes, probably due to the presence of protodioscin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631375>Attenuation of Streptozotocin-Induced  Profile Anomalies in the Heart, Brain, and mRNA Expression of HMG-CoA Reductase by  in Rats.</a></h1><p>Diabetes mellitus is associated with significant morbidity and mortality that contributes to pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. , a naturally occurring aglycone, is present abundantly in fenugreek.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of dioscin on regulating insulin resistance of adipose tissue induced by a high‑ diet (HFD). An animal model was established successfully using C57BL/6J mice with high‑ feeding, followed by treatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg dioscin through gavage for 18 weeks, and randomly divided into a control group, a HFD model group and a dioscin group treated with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day dioscin for 12 weeks. Histopathological changes in adipose tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical parameters of the serum were also monitored, including glucose, insulin, total triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and adipose insulin resistance (Adipo‑IR) levels. Expression of the mRNA and associated proteins of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS‑1)/phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values of mice fed with a HFD were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.01). However, dioscin administration significantly decreased HOMA‑IR and Adipo‑IR values in a dose‑dependent manner (P<0.05), suggesting the effects of dioscin on attenuating insulin resistance. RT‑qPCR results indicated that the associated genes of the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway were significantly downregulated by HFD compared with the control group (P<0.05), while dioscin significantly increased the expression of those genes compared with the control group (P<0.05). Similarly, the significant increase in phosphorylated (p‑)IRS‑1/IRS‑1 (P<0.05) and p‑Akt/Akt (P<0.05) values were substantially reversed by dioscin treatment. Dioscin pronouncedly mitigated insulin resistance in adipose tissues through the IRS‑1/PI3K/Akt pathway and has potential to be used as a novel therapeutic agent for the therapy of HFD‑induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928123>Consumption of Japanese Yam Improves Lipid  in High-Cholesterol Diet-Fed Rats.</a></h1><p>We investigated the effects of dietary Japanese yam (Dioscorea japonica Thunb.) on lipid . Male Wistar rats (6 wk old) were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 6 wk and then supplemented with 26% of Japanese yam or 0.5% of its constituent  for a further 4 wk of high-cholesterol feeding (C6-J4 and C6-D4 groups, respectively). In the C6-J4 group, body weight gains significantly decreased, but skeletal muscle fiber sizes in quadriceps significantly increased compared with the other groups. Furthermore, Japanese yam supplementation resulted in the reduction of triglyceride contents in their liver, quadriceps, and intra-abdominal visceral fat.  supplementation resulted in an increase in the numbers of skeletal muscle fibers and decrease in the fat accumulations in liver and of the lipid contents in quadriceps. Although quadriceps cholesterol contents decreased concomitantly with increased serum HDL-cholesterol in both the groups, fecal bile acid, fecal cholesterol contents, and fecal weight were higher in the C6-J4 group than in the C6-D4 group. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that Japanese yam inhibited micellar cholesterol solubility in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that Japanese yam is more effective than  in reducing fat accumulation and improving cholesterol  during chronic consumption of a high-cholesterol diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253490>Advances in the pharmacological activities and mechanisms of .</a></h1><p>, a well-known steroid sapogenin derived from plants, has been used as a starting material for production of steroidal hormones.

The present study aimed to examine whether dioscin exerts anti-atherosclerotic activity and inhibits foam cell formation. A high-fat induced AS model and ox-LDL treated macrophages were established and received treatment of dioscin. Anti-atherosclerotic activity in vivo was assessed by atherosclerotic lesions size and aortic lipid contents. Macrophage formed foam cells were positively identified by oil red o staining. Moreover, the expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB in aorta tissue and macrophages was examined by western blotting assay. Our results showed that dioscin not only reduced the levels of plasma lipid, TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6, but also inhibited atherosclerotic development in AS rats, as evidenced by decreased atherosclerotic lesions size and aortic lipid level. In vitro study revealed dioscin directly reduced foam cell formation, decreased intracellular cholesterol accumulation and lowered TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6 secretion in ox-LDL treated macrophages. Interestingly, further work found dioscin significantly reduced expression of LOX-1 and NF-κB in the aortic tissue and ox-LDL treated macrophages. In summary, our study was the first to confirm anti-atherosclerotic activity of dioscin in vivo and vitro.

High  (HF) diet-fed mice and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was used to evaluate the effect of DSG. We showed that DSG attenuated metabolic dysfunction in HF diet-fed mice, as evidenced by reduction of blood glucose level and improvement of glucose and insulin intolerance. DSG ameliorated oxidative stress, reduced body weight,  pads, and systematic  profiles and attenuated  accumulation. DSG inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and reduced adipocyte size through regulating key factors. DSG inhibited PPARγ and its target gene expression both in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and  tissues in HF diet-fed mice. Overexpression of PPARγ suppressed DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation. DSG significantly increased nuclear expression of ERβ. Inhibition of ERβ significantly suppressed DSG-exerted suppression of adipocyte differentiation and PPARγ expression. In response to DSG stimulation, ERβ bound with RXRα and dissociated RXRα from PPARγ, leading to the reduction of transcriptional activity of PPARγ. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of DSG on adipocyte differentiation and demonstrate that ERβ-exerted regulation of PPARγ expression and activity is critical for DSG-inhibited adipocyte differentiation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that dioscin significantly restored fructose-induced renal injury by decreasing the levels of Cr, BUN, and rehabilitating histopathological changes. In addition, dioscin markedly adjusted the levels of MDA, SOD and GSH-Px, reduced ROS level in renal tissue, and decreased the levels of TG, FFA, α-SMA and COL1A. Mechanistic study showed that dioscin significantly up-regulated the expression levels of Sirt3, SOD2, and then suppressed inflammation by decreasing the expression levels of NF-kB, HMGB1, c-Jun, c-Fos, COX2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, dioscin-caused high levels of Sirt3 and SOD2 attenuated oxidative stress by regulating the expression levels of Nrf2, GST, Keap1, regulated  by controlling the expression levels of SREBP-1c, SCD-1, FASn, ACC, CPT1, and adjusted TGF-β1/Smad signal to inhibit renal fibrosis. In summary, dioscin showed protective effects against fructose-induced renal damage via adjusting Sirt3-mediated oxidative stress, renal fibrosis,  and inflammation, which should be considered as one candidate to treat renal injury in the future. We also suggest that the patients with renal injury can take more Shanyao for the therapy and treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The main constituent of DT is black tea originating from Camellia sinensis that is supplemented by 12 other medicinal plants. Black tea contains a large amount of the flavonoids catechins especially epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative capacity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of DT intake on inflammatory cytokines, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and  biomarkers in T2DM.The study included 50 patients with T2DM. The patients had received 3 cups (600ml) of DT extract or placebo (PL) extract per day during a period of 12 weeks. Intracellular cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) as well as the glycemic and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after the treatment period. The active constituents of the medicinal plants included in DT were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).Ingestion of DT suppressed CD4+ T cell expression of IL-1β and Il-8 (p<0.05) and up-regulated the expression of IL-10 and the Treg/IL-17 ratio (p<0.05) which was not shown in PL. A significant decrease in HbA1c and LDL was observed at the end of the study period (p<0.05) in DT. The GC/MS analyses of DT indicated the presence of lupeol, β-Amyrin and β-sitosterol. Also analyses of individual herbs showed the presence of higher levels of lupeol and β-Amyrin in Nuga Ficus bengalensis and β-sitosterol in the Attikka Ficus racemosa, indicating that the active ingredients of DT are concentrated in these two herbs.The present study provides evidence that DT has hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Interestingly, DT has anti-inflammatory effects. These properties are attributed to the flavonoids, triterpenes and phytosterol contents of the tea. We suggest that DT protects against diabetes complications in the long term.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these lipids was studied in detail by investigating the effects of several structural aspects including the type of hydrophobic tails, the chain length and saturation degree. In addition, several assays were used to study their interactions with plasmid DNA, and results reveal that these lipids could condense DNA into nanosized particles with appropriate size and zeta-potentials. MTT-based cell viability assays showed that lipoplexes 5 had low cytotoxicity. The in vitro gene transfection studies showed the hydrophobic tails clearly affected the TE, and hexadecanol-containing lipid 5b gives the best TE, which was 2.2 times higher than bPEI 25k in the presence of 10% serum. The results not only demonstrate that these lipids might be promising non-viral gene vectors, but also afford us clues for further optimization of lipidic gene delivery materials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179466>Effects of Sanyaku and Its Constituent  on the Fasted and Postprandial Hypertriacylglycerolemia in High--Diet-Fed KK- A  Mice.</a></h1><p>In this study, we examined the fasted and postprandial triacylglycerol (TG) levels in KK- A  mice fed a high- diet (HFD) or a HFD containing either 500 ppm (0.05%) of  or 500 ppm (0.05%) of -containing Chinese yam sanyaku. Oral  tolerance tests revealed that, not only in the fasting state but also after loading of  emulsion, plasma levels of TG were significantly reduced in sanyaku- and - fed mice. Levels of  oxidation, especially in the dark phase (from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.), were increased in the sanyaku and  groups. Moreover mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, coactivator 1α were moderately upregulated in the liver of sanyaku- and -ingested mice. These results suggest that consecutive ingestion of  or -containing sanyaku at the dose achievable in a human diet potentially ameliorates fasted and postprandial hypertriacylglycerolemia, which could be associated with the improvement of TG .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29339101>Atherogenic diet induced  accumulation induced NFκB level in heart, liver and brain of Wistar rat and  as an anti-inflammatory agent.</a></h1><p>Atherogenic Diet (AD) was given to rats to understand the key role of inflammatory mediators in atherosclerotic lesion formation, as a serendipitous study, the diet induced inflammatory mediators in liver and brain, whereas pancreas, kidney and spleen were not affected. The efficacy of  in ameliorating atherosclerotic progression in heart and suppression of inflammatory mediators in liver and brain of Wistar rat fed on AD diet was investigated. Atherogenic diet triggered inflammatory mediators in heart, liver and brain by upregulating TNF-α, COX-2 and NFkBp65 which are the inflammatory hub, played a key role in pathophysiologic conditions. Endothelial dysfunction, liver tissue with prominent steatosis and the stress evoked in the brain by the atherogenic diet triggered these inflammatory mediators. TNF-α and COX-2 expression was upregulated and its elevation was associated with NFkBp65 activation in heart, liver and brain of atherogenic diet induced rat.  downregulated these inflammatory mediators, thereby prevented the atherosclerotic disease progression and concomitant suppression of inflammatory mediators in liver and brain.Copyright © 2018.

Many studies have suggested that  overload is the key initial factor that contributes to hepatic steatosis. Our previous study indicated that  (DSG) has a beneficial effect on energy , but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Human normal hepatocytes (LO2 cells) were incubated with palmitic acid to establish the cell model of nonalcoholic fatty liver. The effects of DSG on , glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress,  consumption and  synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that palmitic acid induced obvious  accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular  content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of  synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular  accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty acid β-oxidation and decreasing  synthesis. The above changes might be mediated by the activation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A pathway and inhibition of the SREBP-1c/FAS pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26400229>[Effectiveness of phytotherapy in supportive treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus II. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum)].</a></h1><p>Fenugreek seeds are known for their characteristic smell of soup seasoning and as an ingredient of Indian curry. Traditionally the seeds are used as macerate for the treatment of diabetes, cough, and flatulence, to increase breast milk secretion, and for anti-inflammatory and aphrodisiac effects. The use is limited by its unpleasant smell and bitter taste which can be modified by adding mint leaves to the macerate. Antidiabetic properties are attributed mainly to galactomannan, 4-hydroxyisoleucin (4-OH-Ile),  and trigonelline. These substances demonstrate direct antidiabetic properties in clinical studies by increasing insulin secretion (4-OH-Ile), decreasing insulin resistance and glucose resorption from the GIT (galactomannan) and improvement in B-cells regeneration (trigonelline). Besides this main effect, the herb improves blood  spectre (4-OH-Ile, ), and has reno-protective (4-OH-Ile, trigonelline), neuroprotective (trigonelline) and antioxidant (, trigonelline) effects. Antidiabetic efficacy of trigonelline is comparable to glibenclamide treatment and more effective than sitagliptine therapy. Given the large body of evidence and promising results in comparison with standard pharmacotherapy, fenugreek active substances have a potential to become a source of new antidiabetic medication.Key words: fenugreek Trigonella foenum-graecum diabetes mellitus type 2 biological activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408964>Complex formation equilibria between cholesterol and  analogues in monolayers determined by the Langmuir method.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between  analogues [DioA:  acetate (DAc) and (25)-5α,6β-dihydroxyspirostan-3β-ol acetate (DSol)] and cholesterol (Ch) monolayers at the air/water interface. The surface tension of pure and mixed  monolayers at 22 °C was measured by using the Langmuir method with a Teflon trough and a Nima 9002 tensiometer. The surface tension values were used to calculate the π-A isotherms and to determine the molecular surface areas. The interactions between Ch and each DioA resulted in significant deviations from the additivity rule. The theory described in this work was used to determine the stability constants, the areas occupied by one molecule of Ch-DAc or Ch-DSol, and the complex formation energy (Gibbs free energy) values.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479> Supplementation Prevents  Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h1><p> (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile acid content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile acids. A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral  was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral  accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735081>Cardiovascular Effect of  in Ovariectomized Rats.</a></h1><p> is a phytoestrogen and a constituent of Dioscorea. It has several biological effects, and some of them are anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antitumor, and vasodilatory. The present study investigated both the vasorelaxing and antioxidant mechanisms of  in isolated rat aortic rings. Female rats weighing 200-220 g were subjected to sham or OVX operations at 8 weeks of age. Ovariectomy was performed for menopause induction after anesthesia.

In this study, the blood glucose regulation activity and mechanism of total saponins from P. kingianum (TSPK) were investigated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats in this research.TSPK (0.025g/kg and 0.1mg/kg) was administrated by gavage to STZ-induced diabetic rats for 8 weeks. Changes of body weight, food intakes, blood glucose, serum insulin and  indexes were observed. Genome-wide expression profiling was applied to explore the gene expression alternation after treated with TSPK. Expressions of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the relative transcript level of glucose kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase (GK/G6P) in the liver were investigated. Meanwhile, contents of AMPK, and glucose transporter subtype-4 (GLUT4) in skeletal muscle, and peroxysome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) in adipose tissue were investigated.TSPK could effectively alleviate hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic rats. Genome-wide expression profiling showed that TSPK up-regulated the expression of GLUT4 while down-regulated the expression of G6P in insulin signal pathway. In the liver, the expression of AMPK and GK are increased. Further more, TSPK promoted the expressions of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle, and PPAR-γ in adipose tissue, respectively.These results provide possible mechanisms for the antidiabetic effects of TSPK. TSPK could promote not only glycogenesis but also glucose utilization in peripheral tissue. Our results suggested that TSPK may be used as adjuvant therapy to control blood glucose and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic individuals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the mechanisms of  (DG) that promote cholesterol homeostasis and alleviate hypercholesterolemia remain elusive. To investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of the promotion of cholesterol  by DG, a rat model of hypercholesterolemia was induced by providing a high- diet for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the rats were intragastrically administered high-dose DG (0.3 g/kg/d), low-dose DG (0.15 g/kg/d) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) once a day for 8 weeks. The serum and hepatic cholesterol were tested, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and the ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) transporters were measured. The results indicate that DG could reduce body weight, decrease the serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels compared to those in the controls. Simultaneously, liver tissue pathological morphology analyses revealed that DG could attenuate hepatic steatosis compared to that in the high- diet group. Further investigation demonstrated that DG significantly decreased the expression of NPC1L1 and LXR-α in the intestine and markedly increased the expression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver and intestine. Compared to the high- diet group, the rats in the DG-treated groups ameliorated hypercholesterolemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that DG may not only inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by downregulating NPC1L1 but also enhance cholesterol excretion by increasing the expression of ABCG5/G8. DG could be a new candidate for the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To culture the C. elegans, cholesterol was given as sterol molecule to maintain the optimum survival of worms.  (DG), a plant derived steroidal saponin, structurally similar to cholesterol has been used as a precursor for the synthesis of steroidal hormones. In this study, worms were cultured with cholesterol (Cho) and cholesterol-free (Cho) medium with DG (5, 10 and 50μg/mL) at 20°C. It was observed that worms cultured in (Cho) exhibits late egg production, reduced  level and short lifespan, while addition of DG overcomes all defective facts. Combinations of both cholesterol and DG further extend the lifespan (20.8%), hinder  level and resistance to oxidative, thermal and high glucose stress. The intracellular ROS quantification was done by flouroscenic probe H2DCF-DA and confirmed that DG had significantly reduced ROS level (35.85%). Increased lifespan of worms were observed in the medium treated with DG which activates the nuclear translocation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, followed by downstream antioxidant gene sod-3 as evidenced by GFP tagged strain. The expression of Phase II detoxification enzyme GST-4 significantly (p<0.001) increased in transgenic worms exposed to DG with 50mM glucose, and storage of  in intestinal cells was reduced in N2 wild type worms. Genetic requirement of DG induced longevity was studied with different mutant strains of mev-1, daf-16, skn-1, and eat-2. These studies have proved that DG is a sterol source to worms and modulate the DAF-16, SOD-3 and GST-4 expression levels to extend the lifespan of worms. The present study has also highlighted the use of phytosterols as an alternative to cholesterol.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.</p></html>
