Aerobic production of  (or  overflow) results from changes in the expression of central metabolism genes. Acetyl-CoA synthetase scavenges extracellular  in glucose-limited cultures. Once converted to acetyl-CoA, it can be catabolized by the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the glyoxylate pathway. In this work, we assessed the significance of these pathways on  overflow during glucose excess and limitation. Gene expression, enzyme activities, and metabolic fluxes were studied in E. coli knock-out mutants related to the glyoxylate pathway operon and its regulators. The relevance of post-translational regulation by AceK-mediated phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase for pathway functionality was underlined. In chemostat cultures performed at increasing dilution rates,  overflow occurs when growing over a threshold glucose uptake rate. This threshold was not affected in a glyoxylate-pathway-deficient strain (lacking isocitrate lyase, the first enzyme of the pathway), indicating that it is not relevant for  overflow. In carbon-limited chemostat cultures,  (maeB, sfcA, and pck), the glyoxylate operon and, especially, acetyl-CoA synthetase are upregulated. A mutant in acs (encoding acetyl-CoA synthetase) produced  at all dilution rates. This work demonstrates that, in E. coli,  production occurs at all dilution rates and that overflow is the result of unbalanced synthesis and scavenging activities. The over-expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase by cAMP-CRP-dependent induction limits this phenomenon in cultures consuming glucose at low rate, ensuring the recycling of the acetyl-CoA and acetyl-phosphate pools, although establishing an energy-dissipating substrate cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21381310>[Peculiarities of ethanol oxidation by the producer of surface-active substances Acinetobacter calcoaceticus K-4].</a></h2><p>Activity of key-enzymes of C2-metabolism was determined in the cells of strain-producer of surface-active substances Acinetobacter calcoaceticus K-4 grown on ethanol.

Aspergillus nidulans acuF mutants isolated by their inability to use  as a carbon source specifically lack PEPCK. The acuF gene has been cloned and shown to encode a protein with high similarity to PEPCK from bacteria, plants, and fungi. The regulation of acuF expression has been studied by Northern blotting and by the construction of lacZ fusion reporters. Induction by  is abolished in mutants unable to metabolize  via the TCA cycle, and induction by amino acids metabolized via 2-oxoglutarate is lost in mutants unable to form 2-oxoglutarate. Induction by  and proline is not additive, consistent with a single mechanism of induction. Malate and succinate result in induction, and it is proposed that PEPCK is controlled by a novel mechanism of induction by a TCA cycle intermediate or derivative, thereby allowing  to occur during growth on any carbon source metabolized via the TCA cycle. It has been shown that the facB gene, which mediates  induction of enzymes specifically required for  utilization, is not directly involved in PEPCK induction. This is in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where Cat8p and Sip4p, homologs of FacB, regulate PEPCK as well as the expression of other genes necessary for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources in response to the carbon source present. This difference in the control of  reflects the ability of A. nidulans and other filamentous fungi to use a wide variety of carbon sources in comparison with S. cerevisiae. The acuF gene was also found to be subject to activation by the CCAAT binding protein AnCF, a protein homologous to the S. cerevisiae Hap complex and the mammalian NFY complex.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30890173>Precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli for efficient tyrosine production from .</a></h2><p> is one of promising feedstocks owing to its cheap price and great abundance. Considering that tyrosine production is gradually shifting to microbial production method, its production from  can be attempted to further improve the economic feasibility of its production.Here, we engineered a previously reported strain, SCK1, for efficient production of tyrosine from . Initially, the  uptake and gluconeogenic pathway were amplified to maximize the flux toward tyrosine. As flux distribution between glyoxylate and TCA cycles is critical for efficient precursor supplementation, the activity of the glyoxylate cycle was precisely controlled by expression of isocitrate lyase gene under different-strength promoters. Consequently, the engineered strain with optimal flux distribution produced 0.70 g/L tyrosine with 20% of the theoretical maximum yield which are 1.6-fold and 1.9-fold increased values of the parental strain.Tyrosine production from  requires precise tuning of the glyoxylate cycle and we obtained substantial improvements in production titer and yield by synthetic promoters and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs).

In the present study the major metabolic pathways of glucose metabolism were determined in isolated liver cells using [2-13C] and 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy. 2. The relative reaction rates of glucose synthesis to the TCA cycle were determined from the 13C distribution in glucose where the overall 13C enrichment of glucose was 6.41 +/- 1.94% (mean +/- SD; n = 6) and the mean 13C enrichment of C1, C2, C5, C6 to C3, C4 was 2.63 +/- 0.30. 3. Since the distribution of tracer in glucose is a function of the relative entry rates of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA into the oxaloacetate pool this was calculated to be 0.32 +/- 0.15 and the factor for carbon exchange (1/P) between the gluconeogenic pathway and the TCA cycle was calculated to be 1.03 +/- 0.20. 4. With this carbon exchange factor and the approximated 13C enrichment of acetyl-CoA the intramitochondrial 13C enrichment of phosphoenolpyruvate was calculated and the "true" rate of hepatic  from phosphoenolpyruvate estimated. 5. Since  was metabolized solely in liver cells the 13C enrichment of acetyl-CoA could be approximated from that of 3-hydroxybutyrate. 6. The carbon 13 enrichment of 3-hydroxybutyrate and phosphoenolpyruvate was 5.89 +/- 0.90% and 5.96 +/- 1.67%, respectively. 7.

This highlights the importance of developing robust high-throughput assays to measure drug-induced GS in whole cells. We have optimized a colorimetric method to measure GS-catalyzed gamma-glutamyltransferase (GT) activity in rat L6 skeletal muscle cells (96-well-plate format) and human skeletal muscle cells (24-well-plate format). We observe a fourfold increase in GT activity in dexamethasone treated L6 cells, as compared to untreated cells, with good reproducibility in the measurements (errors of less than 5%). This assay can distinguish between partial agonists such as halopredone  and complete agonists such as prednisolone and measure the potency of known glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists like mifepristone. Importantly, the ability of corticosteroids to induce GS-catalyzed GT activity correlates well with their whole cell GR binding potency, indicating a GR-specific effect. Interestingly, in general, induction of GT activity by commonly administered anti-inflammatory corticosteroid drugs is comparable in rat and human skeletal muscle cells, which emphasizes the potential of a rat model system to study GS induction and muscle wasting by these drugs in humans.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662514>Understanding the Role of Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Capsules (Chinese Medicine) for Treatment of Endometriosis in the Rat Model: Using NMR Based Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study is to identify the changes of metabolites in the rat endometriosis models treated with  (GZFLC), a classic Chinese medicinal formula, and to explore the effects of GZFLC on the serum levels of transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) and the mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) in the endometriotic tissues. Forty female Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group (Normal group), Model group, Danazol group, and GZFLC group. The serum levels of TGF-1 were measured using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of VEGF and GLUT-4 in the endometriotic tissue of the rat endometriosis models were measured using real-time quantitative PCR. The metabolites in urine were detected by H NMR method. Eight identified metabolites of the NMR resonance were involved in the glycolysis metabolism. Among the 8 metabolites, Lactate, , TMA, and Formate were downregulated with GZFLC. Citrate, TMAO, Taurine, and Hippurate were unregulated with GZFLC. The serum levels of TGF-1 in the Danazol and GZFLC groups were significantly higher than those of Normal group and significantly lower than the Model group. GZFLC treatment significantly decreased the GLUT-4 and VEGF mRNA expression levels in the endometriotic tissues of the endometriosis rats ( < 0.05). GZFLC significantly decreased the GLUT-4 mRNA expression levels in rats of GZFLC group compared with Danazol group.

In H4IIE rat hepatoma cells, glucocorticoids, retinoic acid and cyclic AMP (cAMP) increase PEPCK gene transcription whereas insulin and phorbol esters have the opposite effect. Insulin and phorbol esters are dominant as they prevent cAMP- and glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription. In contrast, insulin and phorbol esters both stimulate transcription of gene 33 in the same H4IIE cells, with the same time course as seen for their inhibitory effect on PEPCK gene transcription. We now report that the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, mimics the action of insulin and phorbol esters on expression of both gene 33 and PEPCK gene in H4IIE cells. Okadaic acid stimulates gene 33 mRNA accumulation whereas it inhibits cAMP- and glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK mRNA accumulation. The effect of okadaic acid on the PEPCK gene is mediated through the PEPCK promoter as, in a cell line, HL1C, stably transfected with a PEPCK-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene, okadaic acid inhibits cAMP- and glucocorticoid-stimulated CAT expression. Desensitization of the protein kinase C pathway by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13- for 16 h abolishes the subsequent action of the phorbol ester but does not markedly affect the inhibition of cAMP- and glucocorticoid-stimulated CAT expression by insulin or okadaic acid. Even though insulin and okadaic acid appear to repress PEPCK gene expression through a pathway initially distinct from that used by phorbol esters, transient-transfection studies show that the final target of the action of okadaic acid, insulin and phorbol ester is the same DNA element.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25612669>The multifactorial interplay of diet, the microbiome and appetite control: current knowledge and future challenges.</a></h2><p>The recent availability of high-throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies has rapidly advanced approaches to analysing the role of the gut microbiome in governance of human health, including gut health, and also metabolic, cardiovascular and mental health, inter alia. Recent scientific studies suggest that energy intake (EI) perturbations at the population level cannot account for the current obesity epidemic, and significant work is investigating the potential role of the microbiome, and in particular its metabolic products, notably SCFA, predominantly , propionate and butyrate, the last of which is an energy source for the epithelium of the large intestine. The energy yield from dietary residues may be a significant factor influencing energy balance. This review posits that the contribution towards EI is governed by EI diet composition (not just fibre), the composition of the microbiome and by the levels of physical activity. Furthermore, we hypothesise that these factors do not exist in a steady state, but rather are dynamic, with both short- and medium-term effects on appetite regulation. We suggest that the existing modelling strategies for bacterial dynamics, specifically for growth in chemostat culture, are of utility in understanding the dynamic interplay of diet, activity and microbiomic organisation. Such approaches may be informative in optimising the application of dietary and microbial therapy to promote health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468285>Flux analysis of central metabolic pathways in Geobacter metallireducens during reduction of soluble Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid.</a></h2><p>We analyzed the carbon fluxes in the central metabolism of Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15 using 13C isotopomer modeling.  labeled in the first or second position was the sole carbon source, and Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid was the sole terminal electron acceptor. The measured labeled  uptake rate was 21 mmol/g (dry weight)/h in the exponential growth phase. The resulting isotope labeling pattern of amino acids allowed an accurate determination of the in vivo global metabolic reaction rates (fluxes) through the central metabolic pathways using a computational isotopomer model. The tracer experiments showed that G. metallireducens contained complete biosynthesis pathways for essential metabolism, and this strain might also have an unusual isoleucine biosynthesis route (using acetyl coenzyme A and pyruvate as the precursors). The model indicated that over 90% of the  was completely oxidized to CO2 via a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle while reducing iron. Pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase were present under these conditions, but enzymes in the glyoxylate shunt and malic enzyme were absent.  and the pentose phosphate pathway were mainly employed for biosynthesis and accounted for less than 3% of total carbon consumption. The model also indicated surprisingly high reversibility in the reaction between oxoglutarate and succinate. This step operates close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, possibly because succinate is synthesized via a transferase reaction, and the conversion of oxoglutarate to succinate is a rate-limiting step for carbon metabolism. These findings enable a better understanding of the relationship between genome annotation and extant metabolic pathways in G. metallireducens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19253280>Staphylococcus aureus ClpC ATPase is a late growth phase effector of metabolism and persistence.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus Clp ATPases (molecular chaperones) alter normal physiological functions including an aconitase-mediated effect on post-stationary growth,  catabolism, and entry into death phase (Chatterjee et al., J.

The results suggest that ClpC is involved in regulating the expression of genes and/or proteins of , the pentose-phosphate pathway, pyruvate metabolism, the electron transport chain, nucleotide metabolism, oxidative stress, metal ion homeostasis, stringent response, and programmed cell death. Thus, one major function of ClpC is balancing late growth phase carbon metabolism. Furthermore, these changes in carbon metabolism result in alterations of the intracellular concentration of free NADH, the amount of cell-associated iron, and fatty acid metabolism. This study provides strong evidence for ClpC as a critical factor in staphylococcal energy metabolism, stress regulation, and late-stationary phase survival; therefore, these data provide important insight into the adaptation of S. aureus toward a persister state in chronic infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7575903>[Value of megestrol  in treatment of cachexia in head-neck tumors].</a></h2><p>Mortality of 70% of all patients with tumors in the head and neck is linked with anorexia and cachexia.

Five groups of substances are now used to treat tumor-induced cachexia: corticosteroids, progestational drugs, cyproheptadine, hydrazine sulfate, and anabolic steroids.

Sporulation, meiosis, and associated metabolic fluxes in S. cerevisiae strain CH1211 were studied in several experimental protocols involving changes of carbon source (, lactate, or pyruvate) or cell density in sporulation medium, or changing the phase of batch growth at which cells were harvested before transfer to sporulation medium. In -based sporulation medium, the rate at which cells utilized glyoxylate and gluconeogenic pathways correlated positively with the percentage of asci per cell at 72 h. In contrast, in lactate sporulation medium the frequency of sporulation correlated negatively with both the rate of lactate consumption and the fluxes through  and the pyruvate-carboxylase catalyzed step. In the presence of lactate, the respiratory capacity did correlate positively with the percentage of asci per cell. The experimental data suggest that  limits fluxes to anabolic precursors during sporulation. In contrast, sporulation on lactate appears to be influenced by catabolic processes or, even more precisely, by the respiratory capacity of yeast cells. The results obtained are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic fluxes may be required for an efficient sporulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15806547>Glucose metabolism at high density growth of E. coli B and E. coli K: differences in metabolic pathways are responsible for efficient glucose utilization in E. coli B as determined by microarrays and Northern blot analyses.</a></h2><p>In a series of previous reports it was established by implementing metabolic flux, NMR/MS, and Northern blot analysis that the glyoxylate shunt, the TCA cycle, and  uptake by acetyl-CoA synthetase are more active in Escherichia coli BL21 than in Escherichia coli JM109. These differences were accepted as the reason for the differences in the glucose metabolism and  excretion of these two strains. Examination of the bacterial metabolism by microarrays and time course Northern blot showed that in addition to the glyoxylate shunt, the TCA cycle and the  uptake, other metabolic pathways are active differently in the two strains. These are , sfcA shunt, ppc shunt, glycogen biosynthesis, and fatty acid degradation. It was found that in E. coli JM109,  is produced by pyruvate oxidase (poxB) using pyruvate as a substrate rather than by phosphotransacetylase- kinase (Pta-AckA) system which uses acetyl-CoA. The inactivation of the  enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (ppsA), the activation of the anaplerotic sfcA shunt, and low and stable pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceE, aceF) cause pyruvate accumulation which is converted to  by pyruvate oxidase B. The behavior of the ppsA, acs, and aceBAK in JM109 was dependent on the glucose supply strategy. When the glucose concentration was high, no transcription of these genes was observed and  concentration increased, but at low glucose concentrations these genes were expressed and the  concentration decreased. It is possible that there is a major regulatory molecule that controls not only ppsA and aceBAK but also acs.

In adipose tissue slices, release of glycerol or fatty acids into the medium was not different among treatments, but glycerol release was greater (P < .01) from subcutaneous AT than from perirenal AT. Basal fatty acid release and the free fatty acid pool were greater (P < .05) for perirenal AT than for subcutaneous AT; fatty acid release and the fatty acid response (increased NEFA in media and tissue) were increased more by lipolytic stimuli in subcutaneous AT than in perirenal AT. Adipose tissue from CW had the greatest (P < .05) fatty acid response under conditions of near-maximal stimulation; rates from TE were intermediate to those from CW and CE.

Lactate, glutamine, or  did not contribute to milk glucose or galactose (0-2%). In milk, ¹³C-free glycerol enrichment was one-fourth that in plasma but free glycerol concentration in milk was fourfold higher than in plasma. Using [U-¹³C]glycerol and by accounting for tracer dilution, glycerol alone contributed to 10±2 and 69±11% of the hexoneogenesis of milk glucose and galactose, respectively.

The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is a promising biocatalyst that can utilize VFAs and convert them into triacylglycerides (TAGs). However, currently there is limited knowledge on the metabolism of Y. lipolytica when cultured on VFAs. To develop a better understanding, we used  as the sole carbon source to culture two strains, a control strain and a previously engineered strain for lipid overaccumulation. For both strains, metabolism during the growth phase and lipid production phase were investigated by metabolic flux analysis using two parallel sodium  tracers. The resolved flux distributions demonstrate that the glyoxylate shunt pathway is constantly active and the flux through  varies depending on strain and phase. In particular, by regulating the activities of malate transport and pyruvate kinase, the cells divert only a portion of the glyoxylate shunt flux required to satisfy the needs for anaplerotic reactions and NADPH production through  and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Excess flux flows back to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production. As with the case of glucose as the substrate, the primary source for lipogenic NADPH is derived from the oxidative PPP.Copyright © 2016 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

The diabetic, acidotic coma as an acute deficiency of acetyl-CoA and ATP].</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of beta-oxidation of fatty acids developed more than a century before have no compliance with actual physical chemical data. The oxidation of long-chain C 16:0 palmitic saturated fatty acid occurs not by sequential formation of eight molecules of acetyl-KoA but by force of formation of double bond and its hydrolysis on two short-chain C 8:0 fatty acids. Only short-chain fatty acids can become shorter under "chipping" of C 2- with formation of C 4-butyric acid (butyrate) and its metabolites (beta-hidroxibutirate, acetoacetate, acetone). The critical moment of oxidation is a hydrolysis of acetoacetyl-KoA on two molecules of acetyl-KoA. The molecule of ATP is to be expended on hydrolysis. The foundation of nonspecific biological reaction of stress--ketoacidosis,--is a decrease in mitochondrions of acetyl-KoA pool formed both from glycogen and glucose and fatty acids. The oxalate  inputs into Krebs cycle inadequate amount of acetyl-KoA which limits synthesis of ATP. The insulin has no direct involvement into development of ketoacidosis but prepares conditions to facilitate nonspecific etiological factor to initiate diabetic ketoacidosis. These are the pooling of small amount of glycogen in cytozol and the predominance in cytozol of cells and adipocytes of palmitic triglycerides which are slowly hydrolyzed by hormone-dependent lipase to release non-esterified fatty acids into intercellular medium. The increase of their concentration in blood plasma precedes ketoacidosis which is developing in patients without diabetes mellitus too. When cells begin to oxidize unsaturated linoleic and linolenic acids with large number of double binds instead of medium-chain fatty acids, oleinic and palmitic fatty acids to support beta-oxidation in mitochondrions and synthesis of ATP the amount of butyric acid, beta-hidroxibutiryl-KoA and acetoacetyl-KoA increases and of acetyl-KoA decreases. The cause of fatal outcome is the development of metabolic acidosis, hyperhydration of cerebral cells with development of edema and a physiologic respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis. The decarboxylation of acetoacetate and formation of acetone--initial stage of --formation of glucose from fatty acids--is manifested poorly both in primates and humans. From theoretical positions, to arrest ketoacidosis and to restore synthesis of AFT, it is reasonable to apply the infusion of optimal amount of acetyl-KoA which as nonpolar tioester can get over hematoencephalic barrier, plasma membrane and inner membrane of mitochondrions.

To test the hypothesis that feeding of AcOH exerts beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes, we fed either a standard diet or one containing 0.3% AcOH to KK-A(y) mice for 8 weeks. Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels were lower in mice fed AcOH for 8 weeks than in control mice. AcOH also reduced the expression of genes involved in  and lipogenesis, which is in part regulated by 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver. Finally, sodium , in the form of neutralized AcOH, directly activated AMPK and lowered the expression of genes such as for glucose-6-phosphatase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 in rat hepatocytes. These results indicate that the hypoglycemic effect of AcOH might be due to activation of AMPK in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18689527>Role of acetyl coenzyme A synthesis and breakdown in alternative carbon source utilization in Candida albicans.</a></h2><p>Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is the central intermediate of the pathways required to metabolize nonfermentable carbon sources. Three such pathways, i.e., , the glyoxylate cycle, and beta-oxidation, are required for full virulence in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. These processes are compartmentalized in the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxosomes, necessitating transport of intermediates across intracellular membranes. Acetyl-CoA is trafficked in the form of  by the carnitine shuttle, and we hypothesized that the enzymes that convert acetyl-CoA to/from , i.e., acetyl-CoA hydrolase (ACH1) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS1 and ACS2), would regulate alternative carbon utilization and virulence. We show that C. albicans strains depleted for ACS2 are unviable in the presence of most carbon sources, including glucose, , and ethanol; these strains metabolize only fatty acids and glycerol, a substantially more severe phenotype than that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae acs2 mutants. In contrast, deletion of ACS1 confers no phenotype, though it is highly induced in the presence of fatty acids, perhaps explaining why acs2 mutants can utilize fatty acids. Strains lacking ACH1 have a mild growth defect on some carbon sources but are fully virulent in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis. Both ACH1 and ACS2 complement mutations in their S. cerevisiae homolog. Together, these results show that acetyl-CoA metabolism and transport are critical for growth of C. albicans on a wide variety of nutrients. Furthermore, the phenotypic differences between mutations in these highly conserved genes in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans support recent findings that significant functional divergence exists even in fundamental metabolic pathways between these related yeasts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16739990>Proteome changes after metabolic engineering to enhance aerobic mineralization of cis-1,2-dichloroethylene.</a></h2><p>Metabolically engineered Escherichia coli has previously been used to degrade cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE). The strains express the six genes of an evolved toluene ortho-monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia G4 (TOM-Green, which formed a reactive epoxide) with either (1) gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSHI, which forms glutathione) and the glutathione S-transferase IsoILR1 from Rhodococcus AD45 (which adds glutathione to the reactive cis-DCE epoxide) or (2) with an evolved epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (EchA F108L/I219L/C248I which converts the reactive cis-DCE epoxide to a diol). Here, the impact of this metabolic engineering for bioremediation was assessed by investigating the changes in the proteome through a quantitative shotgun proteomics technique (iTRAQ) by tracking the changes due to the sequential addition of TOM-Green, IsoILR1, and GSHI and due to adding the evolved EchA versus the wild-type enzyme to TOM-Green. For the TOM-Green/EchA system, 8 proteins out of 268 identified proteins were differentially expressed in the strain expressing EchA F108L/I219L/C248I relative to wild-type EchA (e.g., EchA, protein chain elongation factor EF-Ts, 50S ribosomal subunits L7/L12/L32/L29, cysteine synthase A, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, iron superoxide dismutase). For the TOM-Green/IsoILR1/GSHI system, the expression level of 49 proteins was changed out of 364 identified proteins. The induced proteins due to the addition of TOM-Green, IsoILR1, and GSHI were involved in the oxidative defense mechanism, pyruvate metabolism, and glutathione synthesis (e.g., 30S ribosomal subunit proteins S3 and S16, 50S ribosomal subunit protein L20, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, lactate dehydrogenase,  kinase, cysteine synthase A). Enzymes involved in indole synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, , and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were repressed (e.g., tryptophanase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase). Hence, the metabolic engineering that leads to enhanced aerobic degradation of 1 mM cis-DCE (2.4-4-fold more chloride ions released) and reduced toxicity from cis-DCE epoxide results in enhanced synthesis of glutathione coupled with an induced stress response as well as repression of fatty acid synthesis, , and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14630934>Role of transcriptional regulation in controlling fluxes in central carbon metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A chemostat culture study.</a></h2><p>In contrast to batch cultivation, chemostat cultivation allows the identification of carbon source responses without interference by carbon-catabolite repression, accumulation of toxic products, and differences in specific growth rate. This study focuses on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, grown in aerobic, carbon-limited chemostat cultures. Genome-wide transcript levels and in vivo fluxes were compared for growth on two sugars, glucose and maltose, and for two C2-compounds, ethanol and . In contrast to previous reports on batch cultures, few genes (180 genes) responded to changes of the carbon source by a changed transcript level. Very few transcript levels were changed when glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient was compared with maltose (33 transcripts), or when  was compared with ethanol (16 transcripts). Although metabolic flux analysis using a stoichiometric model revealed major changes in the central carbon metabolism, only 117 genes exhibited a significantly different transcript level when sugars and C2-compounds were provided as the growth-limiting nutrient. Despite the extensive knowledge on carbon source regulation in yeast, many of the carbon source-responsive genes encoded proteins with unknown or incompletely characterized biological functions. In silico promoter analysis of carbon source-responsive genes confirmed the involvement of several known transcriptional regulators and suggested the involvement of additional regulators. Transcripts involved in the glyoxylate cycle and  showed a good correlation with in vivo fluxes. This correlation was, however, not observed for other important pathways, including the pentose-phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and, in particular, glycolysis. These results indicate that in vivo fluxes in the central carbon metabolism of S. cerevisiae grown in steadystate, carbon-limited chemostat cultures are controlled to a large extent via post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645487>[Effect of diethylnitrosamine on renal metabolic pathway in rats].</a></h2><p>To explore the renal metabolic markers relavant to the renal toxicity of diethylnitrosamine and the metabolic pathways involved in the renal metabolic markers.  Methods: Nineteen Sprague Dawley rats were assigned into 2 groups: A normal control group (n=9) and a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) administration group (n=10). The rats in the normal control group were given sterilized water for free drinking. The rats in the DEN administration group were given 0.1 mg/mL DEN solution for free drinking. After 18 weeks, the kidney tissues were collected and tested for nuclear magnetic resonance detection and pathological examination.  Results: The content of kidneys metabolites in the rats with the DEN administration was changed significantly.

The metabolic pathway used for  from C2 compounds in streptomycetes has not yet been characterized. In the course of a sequencing project we identified the gene for malate synthase (aceB), a key enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle in S. arenae. The gene was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame of 1632 bp codes for a potential protein of 61.360 kDa. A comparison with the sequences of malate synthase from other organisms shows that the phylogenetic distance to the E. coli aceB gene is no closer than that to genes from plants or fungi. Malate synthase activity was detected in cell extracts from S. arenae. Its dependence on media conditions and on the growth phase was investigated. A purification procedure was established which allows a 188-fold enrichment of the enzyme. The molecular weight of the monomer determined by SDS PAGE confirms the weight calculated from the gene sequence. However, the holoenzyme appears to be dimeric as shown by gel filtration. All other known malate synthases from eubacteria are monomeric, while those of fungi or plants are oligomeric (di-, tri-, tetra- or octameric). The apparent Km value for glyoxylate is significantly higher than that of the malate synthases of all other species published so far. The enzyme is inactive at pH values of 7 and below; the strain cannot grow on ethanol or  as the sole carbon source at media pH values of 7 or below.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383867>Glycerol supports growth of the Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms in the absence of glucose: Analysis of metabolic adaptations on glycerol-rich conditions.</a></h2><p>The bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei (BSF), the parasite protist causing sleeping sickness, primarily proliferate in the blood of their mammalian hosts. The skin and adipose tissues were recently identified as additional major sites for parasite development. Glucose was the only carbon source known to be used by bloodstream trypanosomes to feed their central carbon metabolism, however, the metabolic behaviour of extravascular tissue-adapted parasites has not been addressed yet. Since the production of glycerol is an important primary function of adipocytes, we have adapted BSF trypanosomes to a glucose-depleted but glycerol-rich culture medium (CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc) and compared their metabolism and proteome to those of parasites grown in standard glucose-rich conditions (CMM_Glc). BSF were shown to consume 2-folds more oxygen per consumed carbon unit in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc and were 11.5-times more sensitive to SHAM, a specific inhibitor of the plant-like alternative oxidase (TAO), which is the only mitochondrial terminal oxidase expressed in BSF. This is consistent with (i) the absolute requirement of the mitochondrial respiratory activity to convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as deduced from the updated metabolic scheme and (ii) with the 1.8-fold increase of the TAO expression level compared to the presence of glucose. Proton NMR analysis of excreted end products from glycerol and glucose metabolism showed that these two carbon sources are metabolised through the same pathways, although the contributions of the  and succinate branches are more important in the presence of glycerol than glucose (10.2% versus 3.4% of the excreted end products, respectively). In addition, metabolomic analyses by mass spectrometry showed that, in the absence of glucose, 13C-labelled glycerol was incorporated into hexose phosphates through . As expected, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of glycerol kinase expression abolished glycerol metabolism and was lethal for BSF grown in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc. Interestingly, BSF have adapted their metabolism to grow in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc by concomitantly increasing their rate of glycerol consumption and decreasing that of glucose. However, the glycerol kinase activity was 7.8-fold lower in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc, as confirmed by both western blotting and proteomic analyses. This suggests that the huge excess in glycerol kinase that is not absolutely required for glycerol metabolism, might be used for another yet undetermined non-essential function in glucose rich-conditions. Altogether, these data demonstrate that BSF trypanosomes are well-adapted to glycerol-rich conditions that could be encountered by the parasite in extravascular niches, such as the skin and adipose tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18324491>Upregulation of glyoxylate cycle genes upon Paracoccidioides brasiliensis internalization by murine macrophages and in vitro nutritional stress condition.</a></h2><p>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the etiologic agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, is a facultative intracellular human pathogen that can persist within macrophage phagolysosomes, indicating that the fungus has evolved defense mechanisms in order to survive under nutritionally poor environments. The analysis of P. brasiliensis transcriptome revealed several virulence factor orthologs of other microorganisms, including the glyoxylate cycle genes. This cycle allows the utilization of two-carbon (C2) compounds as carbon source in . Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that these genes were upregulated when P. brasiliensis was recovered from murine macrophages, without any additional in vitro growth. The induction of this cycle, in response to macrophage microenvironments, was shown to be coordinated with the upregulation of the gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. In addition, assays employing RNA extracted from P. brasiliensis grown in a medium with  instead of glucose also showed increased levels of glyoxylate cycle transcripts. Our main results suggest that P. brasiliensis uses the glyoxylate cycle as an important adaptive metabolic pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21744875>Metabolic signatures of lung cancer in biofluids: NMR-based metabonomics of blood plasma.</a></h2><p>In this work, the variations in the metabolic profile of blood plasma from lung cancer patients and healthy controls were investigated through NMR-based metabonomics, to assess the potential of this approach for lung cancer screening and diagnosis. PLS-DA modeling of CPMG spectra from plasma, subjected to Monte Carlo Cross Validation, allowed cancer patients to be discriminated from controls with sensitivity and specificity levels of about 90%. Relatively lower HDL and higher VLDL + LDL in the patients' plasma, together with increased lactate and pyruvate and decreased levels of glucose, citrate, formate, , several amino acids (alanine, glutamine, histidine, tyrosine, valine), and methanol, could be detected. These changes were found to be present at initial disease stages and could be related to known cancer biochemical hallmarks, such as enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and , together with suppressed Krebs cycle and reduced lipid catabolism, thus supporting the hypothesis of a systemic metabolic signature for lung cancer. Despite the possible confounding influence of age, smoking habits, and other uncontrolled factors, these results indicate that NMR-based metabonomics of blood plasma can be useful as a screening tool to identify suspicious cases for subsequent, more specific radiological tests, thus contributing to improved disease management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27233038>The FBPase Encoding Gene glpX Is Required for , Bacterial Proliferation and Division In Vivo of Mycobacterium marinum.</a></h2><p>Lipids have been identified as important carbon sources for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to utilize in vivo.

The functions of glpX were studied in M. marinum, a closely related species to Mtb. The glpX deletion strain (ΔglpX) displayed altered , attenuated virulence, and altered bacterial proliferation. Metabolic profiles indicate an accumulation of the FBPase substrate, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) and altered gluconeogenic flux when ΔglpX is cultivated in a gluconeogenic carbon substrate, . In both macrophages and zebrafish, the proliferation of ΔglpX was halted, resulting in dramatically attenuated virulence. Intracellular ΔglpX exhibited an elongated morphology, which was also observed when ΔglpX was grown in a gluconeogenic carbon source. This elongated morphology is also supported by the observation of unseparated multi-nucleoid cell, indicating that a complete mycobacterial division in vivo is correlated with intact .

We previously reported a novel mitochondrial retrograde regulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; nuclear photosynthesis genes are regulated in response to mitochondrial respiratory electron transport (RET). However, the physiological roles of this retrograde regulation are not yet fully understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of this alga to reveal what kinds of genes are responsive to this RET signal, using Chlamydomonas macroarrays containing 10,368 expressed sequence tag clones. From the analysis, we identified 147 inducible and 35 repressive genes based on a couple of criteria: induction/repression by activated respiration caused by exogenously added , and the cancellations of these responses by treatment with antimycin A, an inhibitor of RET. Interestingly, genes for respiration, photosynthesis, glycolysis/, protein biosynthesis, cell wall biogenesis and flagella were significantly induced by RET-derived signals. From these findings, we discuss the physiological role of mitochondrial retrograde signaling in this unicellular alga, in terms of the coordination of cell proliferation with energy-producing metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21062960>Transaldolase exchange and its effects on measurements of  in humans.</a></h2><p>The deuterated water method is used extensively to measure  in humans. This method assumes negligible exchange of the lower three carbons of fructose 6-phsophate via transaldolase exchange since this exchange will result in enrichment of carbon 5 of glucose in the absence of net . The present studies tested this assumption. ²H₂O and acetaminophen were ingested and [1-¹³C] infused in 11 nondiabetic subjects after a 16-h fast. Plasma and urinary glucuronide enrichments were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and during a 0.35 mU·kg FFM⁻¹·min⁻¹ insulin infusion. Rates of endogenous glucose production measured with [3-³H]- and [6,6-²H₂]glucose did not differ either before (14.0 ± 0.7 vs. 13.8 ± 0.7 μmol·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) or during the clamp (10.4 ± 0.9 vs. 10.9 ± 0.7 μmol·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹), consistent with equilibration and quantitative removal of tritium during triose isomerase exchange. Plasma [3-¹³C] glucose-to-[4-¹³C]glucose and urinary [3-¹³C] glucuronide-to-[4-¹³C]glucuronide ratios were <1.0 (P < 0.001) in all subjects both before (0.66 ± 0.04 and 0.60 ± 0.04) and during (059 ± 0.05 and 0.56 ± 0.06) the insulin infusion, respectively, indicating that ∼35-45% of the labeling of the 5th carbon of glucose by deuterium was due to transaldolase exchange rather than . When corrected for transaldolase exchange, rates of  were lower (P < 0.001) and glycogenolysis higher (P < 0.001) than uncorrected rates both before and during the insulin infusion. In conclusion, assuming negligible dilution by glycerol and near-complete triose isomerase equilibration, these data provide strong experimental evidence that transaldolase exchange occurs in humans, resulting in an overestimate of  and an underestimate of glycogenolysis when measured with the ²H₂O method. Use of appropriate ¹³C tracers provides a means of correcting for transaldolase exchange.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut microbiota and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. , propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic , endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile acid metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk.

Each cow received 2 treatments: control (no infusion) and infusion of 650 g of PG into the rumen at the time of the morning feeding. Propylene glycol was infused on the day of sampling only. Samples of arterial, portal, and hepatic blood as well as ruminal fluid were obtained at 0.5 h before feeding and at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5, 7, 9, and 11 h after feeding. Infusion of PG did not affect ruminal pH or the total concentration of ruminal volatile fatty acids, but did decrease the molar proportion of ruminal . The ruminal concentrations of PG, propanol, and propanal as well as the molar proportion of propionate increased with PG infusion. The plasma concentrations of PG, ethanol, propanol, propanal, glucose, L-lactate, propionate, and insulin increased with PG and the plasma concentrations of  and beta-hydroxybutyrate decreased. The net portal flux of PG, propanol, and propanal increased with PG. The hepatic uptake of PG was equivalent to 19% of the intraruminal dose. When cows were dosed with PG, the hepatic extraction of PG was between 0 and 10% depending on the plasma concentration of PG, explaining the slow decrease in arterial PG. The increased net hepatic flux of L-lactate with PG could account for the entire hepatic uptake of PG, which suggests that the primary hepatic pathway for PG is oxidation to l-lactate. The hepatic uptake of propanol increased with PG, but no effects of PG on the net hepatic and net splanchnic flux of glucose were observed. Despite no effect of PG on net portal flux and net hepatic flux of propionate, the net splanchnic flux of propionate increased and the data suggest that propionate produced from hepatic metabolism of propanol is partly released to the blood. The data suggest that PG affects metabolism of the cows by 2 modes of action: 1) increased supply of l-lactate and propionate to  and 2) insulin resistance of peripheral tissues induced by increased concentrations of PG and propanol as well as a decreased ratio of ketogenic to glucogenic metabolites in arterial blood plasma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396473>Inverse relationship between human erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and short-chain fatty acid levels.</a></h2><p>In muscle cells, fructose is initially metabolised to fructose-6-phosphate. In the liver, fructose is metabolised to fructose-1-phosphate and thence to glyceraldehydes, which in turn can either enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate or  via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. High levels of fructose-1-phosphate inhibit both glycogenolysis and . We hypothesised that, if systemically absorbed short-chain fatty acids constitute a major metabolic fate of unabsorbed dietary fructose, then levels of erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate would be inversely correlated with plasma levels of short-chain fatty acids. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis in respect of the three main short-chain fatty acids , propionate and butyrate. Venous blood samples from 39 patients (16 male, 23 female, mean (standard error) age 42.4 (3.3) years) were analysed. Erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate was measured using quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis, while plasma , propionate and butyrate levels were measured using gas-liquid chromatography. The erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate level was inversely correlated with the plasma  (r = -0.30, p = 0.06), propionate (r = -0.31, p = 0.05) and butyrate (r = -0.40, p = 0.01).

To decipher MR-1 metabolism, we integrated genome-scale flux balance analysis (FBA) into a multiple-substrate Monod model to perform the dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA). The dFBA employed a static optimization approach (SOA) by dividing the batch time into small intervals (i.e., ∼400 mini-FBAs), then the Monod model provided time-dependent inflow/outflow fluxes to constrain the mini-FBAs to profile the pseudo-steady-state fluxes in each time interval. The mini-FBAs used a dual-objective function (a weighted combination of "maximizing growth rate" and "minimizing overall flux") to capture trade-offs between optimal growth and minimal enzyme usage. By fitting the experimental data, a bi-level optimization of dFBA revealed that the optimal weight in the dual-objective function was time-dependent: the objective function was constant in the early growth stage, while the functional weight of minimal enzyme usage increased significantly when lactate became scarce. The dFBA profiled biologically meaningful dynamic MR-1 metabolisms: 1. the oxidative TCA cycle fluxes increased initially and then decreased in the late growth stage; 2. fluxes in the pentose phosphate pathway and  were stable in the exponential growth period; and 3. the glyoxylate shunt was up-regulated when  became the main carbon source for MR-1 growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15272001>Lipid utilization, , and seedling growth in Arabidopsis mutants lacking the glyoxylate cycle enzyme malate synthase.</a></h2><p>The aim of this research was to test the role of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme malate synthase (MLS) in lipid utilization, , and seedling growth in Arabidopsis. We hypothesized that in the absence of MLS, succinate produced by isocitrate lyase (ICL) could still feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas glyoxylate could be converted to sugars using enzymes of the photorespiratory pathway. To test this hypothesis we isolated knock-out mls mutants and studied their growth and metabolism in comparison to wild type and icl mutant seedlings. In contrast to icl seedlings, which grow slowly and are unable to convert lipid into sugars (Eastmond, P. J., Germain, V., Lange, P. R., Bryce, J. H., Smith, S. M. & Graham, I. A. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 5669-5674), mls seedlings grow faster, use their lipid more rapidly, and are better able to establish as plantlets. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses show that icl seedlings exhibit many features characteristic of carbohydrate starvation, whereas mls seedlings differ relatively little from wild type. In the light mls seedlings generate more sugars than icl seedlings, and when fed with [14C], 14C-labeling of sugars is three times greater than in icl seedlings and more than half that in wild type seedlings. The mls seedlings also accumulate more glycine and serine than icl or wild type seedlings, consistent with a diversion of glyoxylate into these intermediates of the photorespiratory pathway.

The changes in gene expression observed for the known -regulated genes (aceA, aceB, pta, and ack) were well consistent with the literature data of northern analyses and enzyme assays, indicating the utility of the metabolic array in transcriptome analysis of C. glutamicum. In addition to the known responses, many previously unrecognized co-regulated genes were identified. For example, several TCA cycle genes, such as gltA, sdhA, sdhB, fumH, and mdh, and the gluconeogenic gene pck were up-regulated in the  medium. On the other hand, a few genes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as many amino acid biosynthetic genes, were down-regulated in .

This study has focused on the effect of lead on glucose homeostasis with regard to metabolic function of pancreas and liver. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreas of rats and exposed to lead for 24h, then insulin release along with markers of ER stress and oxidative stress were evaluated. In another part, lead was administered to rats for 32 days and after evaluating criteria of diabetes, the activity of  and glycogenolysis enzymes, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were measured in the liver. Lead disrupted insulin secretory function of islets through activating GSK-3β and ER stress, and increased activity of gluconeogenic enzymes in the liver featured by glucose intolerance. Chronic exposure to lead can disrupt glucose homeostasis by affecting pancreas and liver mainly through induction of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the effects of propionate on mRNA expression of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1), mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC), key gluconeogenic enzymes, and capacity for glucose synthesis in liver of dairy cattle. In experiment 1, six multiparous mid-lactation Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3×3 Latin square design consisting of a 6-d acclimation or washout phase followed by 8h of postruminal infusion of either propionate (1.68mol), glucose (0.84mol), or an equal volume (10mL/min) of water. In experiment 2, twelve male Holstein calves [39±4 kg initial body weight (BW)] were blocked by birth date and assigned to receive, at 7d of age, either propionate [2mmol·h(-1)·(BW(0.75))(-1)],  [3.5mmol·h(-1)·(BW(.75))(-1)], or an equal volume (4mL/min) of saline. In both experiments, blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8h relative to the start of infusion and liver biopsy samples were collected at the end of the infusion for mRNA analysis. Liver explants from experiment 1 were used to measure tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and  using (13)C mass isotopomer distribution analysis from (13)C3 propionate. Dry matter intake and milk yield were not altered by infusions in cows. Serum insulin concentration in cows receiving propionate was elevated than cows receiving water, but was not different from cows receiving glucose. Hepatic expression of PCK1 and G6PC mRNA and glucose production in cows receiving propionate were not different from cows receiving water, but tended to be higher compared with cows receiving glucose. Hepatic expression of PCK2 and PC mRNA was not altered by propionate infusion in cows. Blood glucose, insulin, and glucagon in calves receiving propionate were not different than controls. Calves receiving propionate had increased PCK1 mRNA, tended to have increased G6PC mRNA, and had similar PC mRNA compared with saline controls. These data indicate a tendency for in vivo effects of propionate to alter hepatic gene expression in mid-lactation cows and neonatal calves, which are consistent with a feed-forward effect of propionate to regulate its own metabolism toward  through changes in hepatic PCK1 mRNA.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Certain hepatocellular carcinoma lack increased  and prefer to uptake  than glucose for metabolism. Autophagy plays a role in preserving energies and nutrients when there is limited external nutrient supply and maintains glucose level of blood though supporting gluconeogenesis in the liver. As the role of autophagy and gluconeogenesis in HCC following the glycolic activity was not clear, we cultured HCC cells with different glycolytic levels in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to induce autophagy and conducted the activity of gluconeogenesis. Both autophagy and gluconeogenesis were induced in low glycolytic HCC cells (HepG2). In glycolytic Hep3B cells, only autophagy without gluconeogenesis was induced upon starvation. When autophagy was blocked, the level of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was reduced in HepG2 cells and not in Hep3B. Altogether, we investigated contribution of hepatic gluconeogenesis to the metabolic phenotype of HCC cells and the role of autophagy as a potential mechanism regulating gluconeogenesis in low glycolytic HCC.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Acetyl-CoA is metabolized via the glyoxalate bypass, located in peroxisomes, enabling .  induction of enzymes specific for  utilization as well as glyoxalate bypass enzymes is via the Zn2-Cys6 binuclear cluster activator FacB. However, enzymes of the glyoxalate bypass as well as fatty acid beta-oxidation and peroxisomal proteins are also inducible by fatty acids. We have isolated mutants that cannot grow on fatty acids. Two of the corresponding genes, farA and farB, encode two highly conserved families of related Zn2-Cys6 binuclear proteins present in filamentous ascomycetes, including plant pathogens. A single ortholog is found in the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Yarrowia lipolytica, but not in the Ashbya, Kluyveromyces, Saccharomyces lineage. Northern blot analysis has shown that deletion of the farA gene eliminates induction of a number of genes by both short- and long-chain fatty acids, while deletion of the farB gene eliminates short-chain induction. An identical core 6-bp in vitro binding site for each protein has been identified in genes encoding glyoxalate bypass, beta-oxidation, and peroxisomal functions.

Biochemical mediators of cachexia include cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, and tumor-produced catabolic factors, such as lipid-mobilizing factor, proteolysis-inducing factor, and anemia-inducing factor. Mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of obstruction may include extrinsic occlusion of the bowel due to pelvic, mesenteric omental masses, or intestinal motility disorders due to infilor tration of the mesentery or bowel muscle and nerves. The relief of malnutrition and cachexia may be attempted through nutritional support, pharmacological approach (megestrol , cyclooxygenase inhibitors) and palliative treatment of bowel obstruction. Very few agents have been demonstrated to have true anticachectic activity, so future research should be addressed to the identification of drugs able to block the activity of tumor-produced catabolic factors.

SCFAs may exert multiple beneficial effects on human lipid and glucose metabolism. However, their actions and underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the direct effects of propionate on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism using human HepG2 hepatocytes. Here, we demonstrate that propionate at a physiologically-relevant concentration effectively suppresses palmitate-enhanced glucose production in HepG2 cells but does not affect intracellular neutral lipid levels. Our results indicated that propionate can decline in  by down-regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a major regulator of the hepatic glucose metabolism. Mechanistic studies also revealed that propionate-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation can be ascribed to Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) activation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca concentration. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the propionate receptor GPR43 prevented propionate-inducible activation of AMPK and abrogates the -inhibitory action. Thus, our data indicate that the binding of propionate to hepatic GPR43 elicits CaMKKβ-dependent activation of AMPK through intracellular Ca increase, leading to suppression of .

Gene expression was analysed in growing and starving cells at different time points by full-genome mRNA profiling using DNA macroarrays. During the transition to stationary phase we observed extensive reprogramming of gene expression, with approximately 1,000 genes being strongly repressed and approximately 900 strongly up-regulated in a time-dependent manner. The genes involved in the response to glucose starvation can be assigned to two main classes: (i) general stress/starvation genes which respond to various stress or starvation stimuli, and (ii) genes that respond specifically to starvation for glucose. The first class includes members of the sigma(B)-dependent general stress regulon, as well as 90 vegetative genes, which are strongly down regulated in the course of the stringent response. Among the genes in the second class, we observed a decrease in the expression of genes encoding proteins required for glucose uptake, glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Conversely, many carbohydrate utilisation systems that depend on phosphotransferase systems (PTS) or ABC transporters were activated. The expression of genes required for utilisation or generation of  indicates that  constitutes an important energy source for B. subtilis during periods of glucose starvation. Finally, genome wide mRNA profiling data can be used to predict new metabolic pathways in B. subtilis. Thus, our data suggest that glucose-starved cells are able to degrade branched-chain fatty acids to pyruvate and succinate via propionyl-CoA using the methylcitrate pathway. This pathway appears to link lipid degradation to  in glucose-starved cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24837393>The key to : metabolic fluxes of acetic acid bacteria under cocoa pulp fermentation-simulating conditions.</a></h2><p>Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) play an important role during cocoa fermentation, as their main product, , is a major driver for the development of the desired cocoa flavors. Here, we investigated the specialized metabolism of these bacteria under cocoa pulp fermentation-simulating conditions. A carefully designed combination of parallel 13C isotope labeling experiments allowed the elucidation of intracellular fluxes in the complex environment of cocoa pulp, when lactate and ethanol were included as primary substrates among undefined ingredients. We demonstrate that AAB exhibit a functionally separated metabolism during coconsumption of two-carbon and three-carbon substrates.  is almost exclusively derived from ethanol, while lactate serves for the formation of acetoin and biomass building blocks. Although this is suboptimal for cellular energetics, this allows maximized growth and conversion rates. The functional separation results from a lack of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and malic enzymes, typically present in bacteria to interconnect metabolism. In fact,  is driven by pyruvate phosphate dikinase. Consequently, a balanced ratio of lactate and ethanol is important for the optimum performance of AAB. As lactate and ethanol are individually supplied by lactic acid bacteria and yeasts during the initial phase of cocoa fermentation, respectively, this underlines the importance of a well-balanced microbial consortium for a successful fermentation process. Indeed, AAB performed the best and produced the largest amounts of  in mixed culture experiments when lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were both present.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8238339>14C-labeled propionate metabolism in vivo and estimates of hepatic  relative to Krebs cycle flux.</a></h2><p>Purposes of this study were 1) to estimate in humans, using 14C-labeled propionate, the rate of hepatic  relative to the rate of Krebs cycle flux; 2) to compare those rates with estimates previously made using [3-14C]lactate and [2-14C]; 3) to determine if the amount of ATP required for that rate of  could be generated in liver, calculated from that rate of Krebs cycle flux and splanchnic balance measurements, previously made, and 4) to test whether hepatic succinyl-CoA is channeled during its metabolism through the Krebs cycle. [2-14C]propionate, [3-14C]-propionate, and [2,3-14C]succinate were given along with phenyl  to normal subjects, fasted 60 h. Distributions of 14C were determined in the carbons of blood glucose and of glutamate from excreted phenylacetylglutamine. Corrections to the distributions for 14CO2 fixation were made from the specific activities of urinary urea and the specific activities in glucose, glutamate, and urea previously found on administering [14C]-bicarbonate. Uncertainties in the corrections and in the contributions of pyruvate and Cori cyclings limit the quantitations. The rate of  appears to be two or more times the rate of Krebs cycle flux and pyruvate's decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA, metabolized in the cycle, less than one-twenty-fifth the rate of its decarboxylation. Such estimates were previously made using [3-14C]lactate. The findings support the use of phenyl  to sample hepatic alpha-ketoglutarate. Ratios of specific activities of glucose to glutamate and glucose to urinary urea and expired CO2 indicate succinate's extensive metabolism when presented in trace amounts to liver. Utilizations of the labeled compounds by liver relative to other tissues were in the order succinate = lactate > propionate > .

The basal diet comprised grass silage, hay, and concentrate (34:22:42, DM basis) and was supplemented with isoenergetic VFA infusions (3.58 Mcal/d). A 3:1 molar mixture of  and propionate was replaced gradually with butyrate at the rates of 0, 200, 400, or 600 g/d. When the amount of infused butyrate increased, isobutyrate, butyrate, and isovalerate in plasma and acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate in whole blood increased linearly, but plasma glucose concentration decreased. The latter was associated with a trend toward higher plasma urea concentration, suggesting that more AA were used for  as the supply of propionate decreased and that of butyrate increased. Milk yield was not changed. The concentrations of milk fat and protein increased, and that of lactose decreased linearly, with the rate of butyrate infusion. Milk fat yield increased, and lactose yield tended to decrease, with increased butyrate infusion. These results indicate that changes in the supply of butyrate do not affect markedly milk yield in cows yielding less than 20 kg/d but cause marked changes in milk composition. The increase in ruminal butyrate supply increased ketogenesis and decreased  in the liver of lactating dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8740908>Metabolic rates during sporulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on .</a></h2><p>We have quantified yeast carbon and oxygen consumption fluxes and estimated anabolic fluxes through glyoxylate and gluconeogenic pathways under various conditions of sporulation on . The percentage of sporulation reached a maximum of 55% to 60% after 48 h in sporulation medium, for cells harvested from logarithmic growth in  minimal medium. When cells were harvested in the stationary phase of growth before transfer to sporulation medium, the maximum percentage of sporulation decreased to 40% along with the occurrence of meiosis as could be judged by counting of bi- and tetra-nucleated cells. In both experiments, the rates of  and oxygen consumption decreased as a function of time when exposed to sporulation medium. Apparently, the decrease of metabolic rates was not due to alkalinization. By systematically varying the cell concentration in sporulation medium from 1.4 x 10(7) to 20 x 10(7) cell ml-1, the percentage of sporulating cells was found to decrease in parallel with the rate of  consumption. When the sporulation efficiency attained under the different experimental conditions was plotted as a function of the rate of  consumption, a linear correlation was found. Anabolic fluxes estimation revealed a decrease of the rate through gluconeogenic and glyoxylate pathways occurring during sporulation progression. The pattern of metabolic fluxes progressively evolved toward a predominance of more oxidative catabolic fluxes than those exhibited under growth conditions. The results obtained are discussed in terms of a characteristic pattern of metabolic fluxes and energetics, associated to the development of yeast sporulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9497443>Hepatic response to increased exogenous supply of plasma amino acids by infusion into the mesenteric vein of Holstein-Friesian cows in late gestation.</a></h2><p>The hepatic responses of late gestation, dry dairy cows to acute (6 h) infusions of an amino acid (AA) mixture (Synthamin; 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8 and 17.6 mumol/min) into the mesenteric vein were determined. Neither blood flow nor O2 consumption across the portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver was significantly altered by infusion. Similarly, there were no effects on net absorption, or hepatic removal, of , propionate, butyrate or NH3. Glucose PDV appearance was unchanged but hepatic glucose production increased (P = 0.032) by 0.2 mumol/min per mumol/min of AA infused. Additional extraction of alanine, glycine (both infused) and glutamine (not infused) by the liver was sufficient to account for most of the extra C required for glucose synthesis. The N that would be liberated from these glucogenic AA would also account for a large proportion of the increase in urea-N produced in response to the AA infusion. This supports the concept of a correlation between  and ureagenesis. Furthermore, the amide-N liberated from the extracted glutamine would contribute up to 0.17 of hepatic NH3 flux and assist in balancing N inputs into the carbamoyl phosphate and arginosuccinate entry points of the ornithine cycle. Rates of fractional extraction of the various AA by the liver were best fitted by linear equations, indicating that even at the highest rates of administration (approximately twice maximal physiological absorption) the transport systems were not saturated. Hepatic fractional extractions of infused essential AA were highest for methionine (0.83) and phenylalanine (0.87) with the lowest proportion removed observed for valine (0.25), leucine (0.30), lysine (0.31) and isoleucine (0.49). For the non-essential AA, the highest apparent fractional extractions were for glycine (0.73), arginine (0.79) and tyrosine (0.63) followed by alanine (0.54), proline (0.47) and serine (0.37). Hepatic removal of AA-N exceeded the increase in urea-N formation such that, at the highest rate of infusion, approximately 10 mmol/min of the extracted AA was apparently available for hepatic anabolism, more than is required to account for assumed increases in liver mass and export protein synthesis. Similarly, the amount of AA available for peripheral tissue protein gain, when assessed against phenylalanine supply as the limitation, would be the equivalent of a maximum of 0.5 g protein retained/min (6 mmol AA-N/min). This would provide sufficient AA for replenishment of peripheral (muscle) protein stores plus support of the placenta and fetus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21092215>Metabolic response of Geobacter sulfurreducens towards electron donor/acceptor variation.</a></h2><p>Geobacter sulfurreducens is capable of coupling the complete oxidation of organic compounds to iron reduction.

We examined the (13)C-labeling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids obtained from G. sulfurreducens cultured with (13)C-.Using (13)C-based metabolic flux analysis, we observed that donor and acceptor variations gave rise to differences in gluconeogenetic initiation, tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Culturing G. sulfurreducens cells with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor and  as the electron donor resulted in pyruvate as the primary carbon source for . When fumarate was provided as the electron acceptor and  as the electron donor, the flux analysis suggested that fumarate served as both an electron acceptor and, in conjunction with , a carbon source. Growth on fumarate and  resulted in the initiation of  by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and a slightly elevated flux through the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle as compared to growth with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor. In addition, the direction of net flux between acetyl-CoA and pyruvate was reversed during growth on fumarate relative to Fe(III), while growth in the presence of Fe(III) and  which provided hydrogen as an electron donor, resulted in decreased flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.We gained detailed insight into the metabolism of G. sulfurreducens cells under various electron donor/acceptor conditions using (13)C-based metabolic flux analysis.

We hypothesized that GNG would increase in HSU conditions as a result of metabolic shifts in the liver and skeletal muscle. A significant and progressive atrophy was observed in the soleus (30, 47 and 55%) and gastrocnemius muscles (0, 15 and 17%) after 3, 7 and 14 days of HSU, respectively. Fractional hepatic GNG was determined following the incorporation of deuterium from deuterated water ((2)H(2)O) into C-H bonds of newly synthesized glucose after an 8 h fast. Enrichment of plasma glucose with (2)H was measured using the classic method of Landau et al. (the 'hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) method'), based on specific (2)H labelling of glucose carbons, and the novel method of Chacko et al. ('average method'), based on the assumption of equal (2)H enrichment on all glucose carbons (except C2). After 3 days of HSU, fractional GNG was significantly elevated in the HSU group, as determined by either method (∼13%, P < 0.05). After 7 and 14 days of HSU,  was not significantly different. Both analytical methods yielded similar time-dependent trends in gluconeogenic rates, but GNG values determined using the average method were consistently lower (∼30%) than those found by the HMT method. To compare and validate the average method against the HMT method further, we starved animals for 13 h to allow for hepatic GNG to contribute 100% to endogenous glucose production. The HMT method yielded 100% GNG, while the average method yielded GNG of ∼70%. As both methods used the same values of precursor enrichment, we postulated that the underestimation of gluconeogenic rate was as a result of differences in the measurements of product enrichment ((2)H labelling of plasma glucose). This could be explained by the following factors: (i) loss of deuterium via exchange between  and glucose; (ii) interference caused by fragment m/z 169, representing multiple isobaric species; and (iii) interference from other sugars at m/z 169. In conclusion, HSU caused a time-dependent increase in hepatic , irrespective of the analytical methods used.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271774>A concerted systems biology analysis of phenol metabolism in Rhodococcus opacus PD630.</a></h2><p>Rhodococcus opacus PD630 metabolizes aromatic substrates and naturally produces branched-chain lipids, which are advantageous traits for lignin valorization. To provide insights into its lignocellulose hydrolysate utilization, we performed C-pathway tracing, C-pulse-tracing, transcriptional profiling, biomass composition analysis, and metabolite profiling in conjunction with C-metabolic flux analysis (C-MFA) of phenol metabolism. We found that 1) phenol is metabolized mainly through the ortho-cleavage pathway; 2) phenol utilization requires a highly active TCA cycle; 3) NADPH is generated mainly via NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; 4) active cataplerotic fluxes increase plasticity in the TCA cycle; and 5)  occurs partially through the reversed Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP). We also found that phenol-fed R. opacus PD630 generally has lower sugar phosphate concentrations (e.g., fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase) compared to metabolite pools in C-glucose-fed Escherichia coli (set as internal standards), while its TCA metabolites (e.g., malate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate) accumulate intracellularly with measurable succinate secretion. In addition, we found that phenol utilization was inhibited by benzoate, while catabolite repressions by other tested carbon substrates (e.g., glucose and ) were absent in R. opacus PD630. Three adaptively-evolved strains display very different growth rates when fed with phenol as a sole carbon source, but they maintain a conserved flux network. These findings improve our understanding of R. opacus' metabolism for future lignin valorization.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Romeo, Mol. Microbiol. 29:1321-1330, 1998). Its key regulatory role in central carbon metabolism, both as an activator of glycolysis and as a potent repressor of glycogen biosynthesis and , prompted us to examine the involvement of csrA in  metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We found that growth of csrA rpoS mutant strains was very poor on  as a sole carbon source. Surprisingly, growth also was inhibited specifically by the addition of modest amounts of  to rich media (e.g., tryptone broth). Cultures grown in the presence of >/=25 mM  consisted substantially of glycogen biosynthesis (glg) mutants, which were no longer inhibited by . Several classes of glg mutations were mapped to known and novel loci. Several hypotheses were examined to provide further insight into the effects of  on growth and metabolism in these strains. We determined that csrA positively regulates acs (acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase; Acs) expression and isocitrate lyase activity without affecting key TCA cycle enzymes or phosphotransacetylase. TCA cycle intermediates or pyruvate, but not glucose, galactose, or glycerol, restored growth and prevented the glg mutations in the presence of . Furthermore, amino acid uptake was inhibited by  specifically in the csrA rpoS strain. We conclude that central carbon flux imbalance, inhibition of amino acid uptake, and a deficiency in  metabolism apparently are combined to cause metabolic stress by depleting the TCA cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7551815>Impaired glucose uptake and intact  in perfused rat liver after carbon tetrachloride injury.</a></h2><p>The dynamics of glucose movement across perfused livers were assessed in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-injured rats. Rats were given CCl4 for 8 weeks and became glucose intolerant and hyperinsulinemic. The fasted rat liver was cyclically perfused with 4 mM lactate and various concentrations (0-20 mM) of glucose for 20 min. In the CCl4-injured liver, net glucose output was less suppressed at high glucose levels than in the normal liver (147 +/- 70 vs 18 +/- 10 mumol at 20 mM glucose, P < 0.05). Deposition of the carbon from [14C] glucose into glycogen was stimulated at high glucose levels and was markedly reduced in the CCl4-injured liver compared to the normal liver (0.58 +/- 0.33 mumol vs 1.44 +/- 0.20 mumol at 20 mM, P < 0.01). Conversion of [14C] lactate to [14C] glucose was not different between the CCl4-injured and the normal liver at each glucose level. Deposition of the carbon from [14C]  into glycogen in the CCl4-injured liver was larger than that in the normal liver at 0 mM glucose (0.81 +/- 0.15 mumol vs 0.32 +/- 0.06 mumol, P < 0.01), but was similar to the normal at 20 mM glucose. In the CCl4-injured liver, utilization of exogenous glucose was impaired at high glucose levels, and gluconeogenetic activity was not impaired at low glucose levels. These changes in the hepatic glucose metabolism seem to account for postprandial hyperglycemia without fasting hypoglycemia associated with liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8069456>Cultured trout liver cells: utilization of substrates and response to hormones.</a></h2><p>The characterization of a recently established system for the short-term culture of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver cells in chemically defined medium has been extended to studies on the metabolic competence of the cells and the characterization of their response to hormones. Three areas of metabolism have been addressed: a) the utilization of the exogenously added substrates fructose, lactate, glucose, dihydroxyacetone, and glycerol for glucose and lactate formation; b) the effects of the pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon on cellular glucose formation, lactate formation, and fatty acid synthesis; and c) the effects of insulin and dexamethasone on the estradiol-dependent production of vitellogenin. Incubation of trout liver cells with fructose, lactate, glucose, dihydroxyacetone, or glycerol resulted in enhanced rates of cellular glucose and lactate production. Substrate-induced effects usually were more clearly expressed after extended (20 h) than after acute (5 h) culture periods. Addition of the hormones insulin or glucagon caused dose-dependent alterations in the flux of substrates to glucose and lactate. Rates of de novo synthesis of fatty acids from [14C] were stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon during acute and extended incubation periods. Treatment of liver cells isolated from male trout for 72 h with estradiol induced vitellogenin production and secretion into the medium. However, the addition of insulin or dexamethasone drastically reduced this estrogen-induced vitellogenesis. These results indicate that trout liver cells cultured in defined medium maintain central metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, , lipogenesis, and vitellogenesis as well as their responsiveness to various hormones, for at least 72 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8447207>Metabolic consequences of different perioperative fluid therapies in the neonatal period.</a></h2><p>Carbohydrate and fat metabolism during and after anaesthesia and surgery was studied in 14 neonates with major congenital non-cardiac anomalies. They were either given a glucose solution until surgery or starved for at least 4 h before surgery. Ringer- alone or Ringer- plus 10% glucose was used for the intraoperative fluid therapy. After anaesthesia all neonates were given a 10% glucose solution. Concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glycerol and 3-hydroxybutyrate were measured at predetermined intervals pre-, intra- and postoperatively. Blood glucose concentrations rose during surgery both in neonates given glucose before and during surgery (n = 6) and in neonates not given glucose before and during surgery (n = 6). Increased intraoperative levels of free fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate were found in neonates not given glucose before and during surgery. The triglyceride levels were equal in both groups. In two neonates given glucose before surgery and Ringer- during surgery increased levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate were found, particularly in one patient who became hypoglycaemic. In conclusion, starved neonates without intraoperative glucose supply mobilized fat and maintained blood glucose concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286363>Lack of isocitrate lyase in Chlamydomonas leads to changes in carbon metabolism and in the response to oxidative stress under mixotrophic growth.</a></h2><p>Isocitrate lyase is a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle. This cycle plays an essential role in cell growth on , and is important for  as it bypasses the two oxidative steps of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in which CO₂ is evolved. In this paper, a null icl mutant of the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is described. Our data show that isocitrate lyase is required for growth in darkness on  (heterotrophic conditions), as well as for efficient growth in the light when  is supplied (mixotrophic conditions). Under these latter conditions, reduced  assimilation and concomitant reduced respiration occur, and biomass composition analysis reveals an increase in total fatty acid content, including neutral lipids and free fatty acids. Quantitative proteomic analysis by ¹⁴N/¹⁵N labelling was performed, and more than 1600 proteins were identified. These analyses reveal a strong decrease in the amounts of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and  in parallel with a shift of the TCA cycle towards amino acid synthesis, accompanied by an increase in free amino acids. The decrease of the glyoxylate cycle and , as well as the decrease in enzymes involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids in the icl mutant are probably major factors that contribute to remodelling of lipids in the icl mutant. These modifications are probably responsible for the elevation of the response to oxidative stress, with significantly augmented levels and activities of superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase, and increased resistance to paraquat.© 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601271>Metabolic perturbations in mutants of glucose transporters and their applications in metabolite production in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Most microorganisms have evolved to maximize growth rate, with rapid consumption of carbon sources from the surroundings. However, fast growing phenotypes usually feature secretion of organic compounds. For example, E. coli mainly produced  in fast growing condition such as glucose rich and aerobic condition, which is troublesome for metabolic engineering because  causes acidification of surroundings, growth inhibition and decline of production yield. The overflow metabolism can be alleviated by reducing glucose uptake rate.As glucose transporters or their subunits were knocked out in E. coli, the growth and glucose uptake rates decreased and biomass yield was improved. Alteration of intracellular metabolism caused by the mutations was investigated with transcriptome analysis and C metabolic flux analysis (C MFA). Various transcriptional and metabolic perturbations were identified in the sugar transporter mutants. Transcription of genes related to glycolysis, chemotaxis, and flagella synthesis was downregulated, and that of , Krebs cycle, alternative transporters, quorum sensing, and stress induced proteins was upregulated in the sugar transporter mutants. The specific production yields of value-added compounds (enhanced green fluorescent protein, γ-aminobutyrate, lycopene) were improved significantly in the sugar transporter mutants.The elimination of sugar transporter resulted in alteration of global gene expression and redirection of carbon flux distribution, which was purposed to increase energy yield and recycle carbon sources. When the pathways for several valuable compounds were introduced to mutant strains, specific yield of them were highly improved. These results showed that controlling the sugar uptake rate is a good strategy for ameliorating metabolite production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401395>Pterocarpan-enriched soy leaf extract ameliorates insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β-cell proliferation in type 2 diabetic mice.</a></h2><p>In Korea, soy (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) leaves are eaten as a seasonal vegetable or pickled in soy sauce. Ethyl  extracts of soy leaves (EASL) are enriched in pterocarpans and have potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-diabetic effect of EASL in C57BL/6J mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced type 2 diabetes. Mice were randomly divided into normal diet (ND), HFD (60 kcal% fat diet), EASL (HFD with 0.56% (wt/wt) EASL), and Pinitol (HFD with 0.15% (wt/wt) pinitol) groups. Weight gain and abdominal fat accumulation were significantly suppressed by EASL. Levels of plasma glucose, HbA1c, and insulin in the EASL group were significantly lower than those of the HFD group, and the pancreatic islet of the EASL group had greater size than those of the HFD group. EASL group up-regulated neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), paired box 4 (Pax4), and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (MafA), which are markers of pancreatic cell development, as well as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS2, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), which are related to insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, EASL suppressed genes involved in hepatic  and steatosis. These results suggest that EASL improves plasma glucose and insulin levels in mice with HDF-induced type 2 diabetes by regulating β-cell proliferation and insulin sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11514507>Three target genes for the transcriptional activator Cat8p of Kluyveromyces lactis: acetyl coenzyme A synthetase genes KlACS1 and KlACS2 and lactate permease gene KlJEN1.</a></h2><p>The aerobic yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and the predominantly fermentative Saccharomyces cerevisiae share many of the genes encoding the enzymes of carbon and energy metabolism. The physiological features that distinguish the two yeasts appear to result essentially from different organization of regulatory circuits, in particular glucose repression and . We have isolated the KlCAT8 gene (a homologue of S. cerevisiae CAT8, encoding a DNA binding protein) as a multicopy suppressor of a fog1 mutation. The Fog1 protein is a homologue of the Snf1 complex components Gal83p, Sip1p, and Sip2p of S. cerevisiae. While CAT8 controls the key enzymes of  in S. cerevisiae, KlCAT8 of K. lactis does not (I. Georis, J. J. Krijger, K. D. Breunig, and J. Vandenhaute, Mol. Gen. Genet. 264:193-203, 2000). We therefore examined possible targets of KlCat8p. We found that the acetyl coenzyme A synthetase genes, KlACS1 and KlACS2, were specifically regulated by KlCAT8, but very differently from the S. cerevisiae counterparts. KlACS1 was induced by  and lactate, while KlACS2 was induced by ethanol, both under the control of KlCAT8. Also, KlJEN1, encoding the lactate-inducible and glucose-repressible lactate permease, was found under a tight control of KlCAT8.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11016849>Differences in regulation of yeast  revealed by Cat8p-independent activation of PCK1 and FBP1 genes in Kluyveromyces lactis.</a></h2><p>The yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is can utilise a wide range of non-fermentable carbon compounds as sole sources of carbon and energy, and differs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in being able to carry out oxidative and fermentative metabolism simultaneously. In S. cerevisiae, growth on all non-fermentable carbon sources requires Cat8p, a transcriptional activator that controls the expression of gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle genes via CSREs (Carbon Source Responsive Elements). The down-regulation of Cat8p by fermentable carbon sources is the primary factor responsible for the tight repression of  by glucose in S. cerevisiae. To analyse the regulation of  in K. lactis, we have cloned and characterised the K. lactis homologue of CAT8 (KlCAT8). The gene was isolated by multicopy suppression of a fog2/klsnf1 mutation, indicating a similar epistatic relationship between KlSNF1 and KlCAT8 as in the case of the S. cerevisiae homologues. KlCAT8 encodes a protein of 1445 amino acids that is 40% identical to ScCat8p. The most highly conserved block is the putative Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA-binding domain, but additional conserved regions shared with members of the zinc-cluster family from Aspergillus define a subfamily of Cat8p-related proteins. KlCAT8 complements the growth defect of a Sccat8 mutant on non-fermentable carbon sources. In K. lactis, deletion of KlCAT8 severely impairs growth on ethanol,  and lactate, but not on glycerol. Derepression of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle--malate synthase and particularly isocitrate lyase--was impaired in a Klcat8 mutant, whereas Northern analysis revealed that derepression of KlFBP1 and KlPCK1 does not require KlCat8p. Taken together, our results indicate that in K. lactis  is not co-regulated with the glyoxylate cycle, and only the latter is controlled by KlCat8p.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916421>Protective potential of Averrhoa bilimbi fruits in ameliorating the hepatic key enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a mutifactorial disease which leads to several complications. Currently available drug regimens for management of diabetes have certain drawbacks. Need for safer and effective medicines from natural sources having potent antidiabetic activity. Averrhoa bilimbi Linn. (Oxalidaceae) is a medicinal plant and is reported to possess hypoglycemic activity.To investigate the antidiabetic potential of Averrhoa bilimbi fruit extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (40mg/kg body weight). The diabetic rats were treated orally with ethyl  fraction of A. bilimbi fruits (ABE) (25mg/kg body weight) and metformin (100mg/kg body weight) by intragastric intubation for 60days. After 60days, the rats were sacrificed; blood, liver and pancreas were collected. Several indices such as blood glucose, plasma insulin, toxicity markers and the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes were assayed. The phytochemicals present in the ABE was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.ABE significantly (p<0.05) reduced the level of blood glucose and hepatic toxicity markers and increased plasma insulin in diabetic rats. ABE modulated the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, significantly increased the activities of hexokinase (59%) and pyruvate kinase (68%) and reduced the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase (32%) and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (20%). The histological studies of the pancreas also supported our findings. The results were compared with metformin, a standard oral hypoglycemic drug. GC-MS analysis of ABE revealed the presence of 11 chemical constituents in the extract.ABE exerts its antidiabetic effect by promoting glucose metabolism via  and inhibiting hepatic endogenous glucose production via gluconeogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Most of them are also required for the utilization of fatty acids. This is the case for acuD and acuE, which encode the two glyoxylate cycle-specific enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, respectively, but also for acuL that we have identified as AN7287, and characterized in this study. Deletion of acuL resulted in the same phenotype as the original acuL217 mutant. acuL encodes a 322-amino acid protein which displays all the structural features of a mitochondrial membrane carrier, and shares 60% identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae succinate/fumarate mitochondrial antiporter Sfc1p (also named Acr1p). Consistently, the AcuL protein was shown to localize in mitochondria, and partial cross-complementation was observed between the S. cerevisiae and A. nidulans homologues. Extensive phenotypic characterization suggested that the acuL gene is involved in the utilization of carbon sources that are catabolized via the TCA cycle, and therefore require . In addition, acuL proves to be co-regulated with acuD and acuE. Overall, our data suggest that AcuL could link the glyoxylate cycle to  by exchanging cytoplasmic succinate for mitochondrial fumarate.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Glucose turnover was measured before (~16-h fast) and during hyperglycemic (~10 mM) moderate-dose insulin (~0.35 mU·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) clamp. ¹³C3/¹³C4 in T2DM vs. ND was <1.0 and not different at baseline and clamp, indicating equivalent TA. To determine whether incomplete triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) exchange contributed to asymmetric ¹³C3/¹³C4, [U-¹³C]glycerol was infused in lieu of [1-¹³C] during a separate visit in a subset of ND (n = 7) subjects. Ratio of ¹³C3/¹³C4 obtained following either tracer was <1.0 at baseline and during clamp, indicating that TPI exchange was essentially complete and did not contribute to asymmetric glucose enrichment.

TA correction resulted in equivalent estimates of corrected  in T2DM and ND that were ~25-35% lower than uncorrected  both at baseline and during the clamp. The asymmetric enrichment of glucose from ¹³C-gluconeogenic tracers is attributable to TA exchange and can be utilized to correct for TA exchange.

The approach was based on metabolic control analysis following selective inhibition of enzyme activity. Both 3-nitropropionate and itaconate decreased the proportion of either [1-14C] or [2-14C] converted to sucrose, and increased the proportion metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Kinetic analysis of isocitrate lyase activity from endosperm revealed that itaconate is a pure uncompetitive inhibitor (Ki' = 11. 9 +/- 0.98 &mgr;M) with respect to isocitrate. In contrast, 3-nitropropionate is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor. The half-time for inhibition of isocitrate lyase by 3-nitropropionate was 5-10 min, whereas the half-time for reactivation was in excess of 10 h. Incubating endosperm in 3-nitropropionate resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in isocitrate lyase activity that remained stable in tissue extracts for at least 4 h. From a comparison of the extent of in situ inactivation of isocitrate lyase by 3-nitropropionate and the effect of this compound on the rate of sucrose production from [2-14C], the flux control coefficient of isocitrate lyase on  from  in castor bean endosperm was calculated to be 0.66 +/- 0.09. It is concluded that isocitrate lyase activity is quantitatively important in the control of gluconeogenic flux, and suggested that developmental changes in the amount of this enzyme may be an important factor in determining the conversion of lipid to sugar in young castor bean seedlings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12723097>Ryegrass-based diet and barley supplementation: partition of energy-yielding nutrients among splanchnic tissues and hind limbs in finishing lambs.</a></h2><p>Splanchnic metabolism of energy-yielding nutrients and their uptake by the hind limb were studied in finishing lambs receiving ryegrass harvested at grazing stage (ear at 10 cm) with or without barley supplementation. Six ruminally cannulated and multicatherized lambs (40.2 +/- 1.5 kg) were fed with frozen ryegrass (RG) at 690 kJ of metabolizable energy intake (MEI) x d(-1) x BW(-0.75) successively with and without barley supplementation (RG + B), according to a triplicated Latin square design. Barley supplementation represented 21% of DM intake and increased the MEI by 32% (P < 0.002). In ruminal fluid, barley supplementation increased the  and butyrate concentrations by 21.2 and 49.6%, respectively (P < 0.04), without modifying those of propionate. Thus, molar proportions of  and butyrate were not modified, and those of propionate tended (P < 0.06) to decrease from 26 to 23%. As a result, the net portal appearance of propionate was not modified. Net portal appearance of butyrate and beta-hydroxybutyrate increased (P < 0.03), and that of  was not modified. Consequently, hepatic uptake of butyrate increased and probably spared  from hepatic metabolism. The hepatic fractional extraction of propionate decreased (P < 0.03), whereas the net flux of lactate switched from a net release to a net uptake, suggesting an alteration in the contribution of gluconeogenic substrates to glucose synthesis without modification in net hepatic glucose release. As a consequence, barley supplementation increased net splanchnic release of  (P < 0.02), propionate (P < 0.001), and beta-hydroxybutyrate (P < 0.01) by 60, 157, and 78%, respectively. In addition, the net splanchnic release of insulin increased (P < 0.03) because of a decrease (P < 0.02) in its hepatic extraction. Despite those changes, the net uptake of nutrients by the hind limb was not modified and even decreased in the case of glucose (P < 0.02), suggesting a stimulation of lipogenesis in adipose tissues. Results from the present study suggested that supplementation of a ryegrass-based diet would likely have little effect on the orientation of muscle energy metabolism and on meat quality because the net uptake of nutrients by the hind limb was unchanged.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18095657>1H NMR-based metabolomic analysis of liver, serum, and brain following ethanol administration in rats.</a></h2><p>Ethanol is a widely used drug that is consumed in large amounts for pharmacologic effects.

We adopted a proton NMR-based metabolomic approach to study ethanol-induced metabolic changes in liver, blood, and brain tissue from rats exposed to either a single dose of ethanol or a chronic 4 day binge-ethanol protocol. Both acute and binge ethanol caused (i) decreased glucose, lactate, and alanine in liver and serum; (ii) increased  in liver and serum; and (iii) increased acetoacetate in serum. Binge-ethanol increased liver beta-hydroxybutyrate and decreased betaine. Pretreatment with the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) increased betaine and reduced ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in livers of binge-ethanol animals, as compared to those not pretreated with BHT. We found no change in brain metabolites after a single dose of ethanol. Unsupervised principal component (PC) analysis of spectral data from liver and serum successfully discriminated treatment groups, based largely on the biochemical differences outlined above, confirming the results of manual analysis.

This is a new mechanism that biochemically elucidates the well-known, yet unexplained, "empty calorie" phenomenon of ethanol.

Examination of glutamate production by the recombinant C. glutamicum strains revealed that the PEP carboxykinase-deficient mutant showed about fourfold higher, the pck-overexpressing strain two- to threefold lower glutamate production than the parental strain. Inactivation and overexpression of pck in a lysine-producer of C. glutamicum led to an only 20% higher and lower lysine accumulation, respectively. The results show that PEP carboxykinase activity in C. glutamicum is counteractive to the production of glutamate and lysine and indicate that the enzyme is an important target in the development of strains producing amino acids derived from citric acid cycle intermediates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8799277>Correction of 13C mass isotopomer distributions for natural stable isotope abundance.</a></h2><p>Metabolism of singly or multiply 13C-labeled substrates leads to the production of molecules that contain 13C atoms at various positions. Molecules differing only in the number of isotopic atoms incorporated are referred to as mass isotopomers. The distribution of mass isotopomers of many molecules can be measured by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry after chemical derivatization. Quantification of metabolite mass isotopomer abundance resulting from biological processes necessitates correction of the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the derivatized metabolite for contributions due to naturally occurring isotopes of its elements. This correction must take into account differences in the relative natural abundance distribution of each mass isotopomer (skewing). An IBM-compatible computer program was developed which (i) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of unlabeled and labeled standards given the molecular formula of the derivatized molecule or fragment ion, and (ii) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of the singly and multiply labeled molecule or fragment via non-linear fitting to the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the unlabeled molecule or fragment. The output of this program is used to correct measured mass isotopomer distributions for contributions from natural isotope abundances and to verify measured values for theoretical consistency. Differences between predicted and measured unlabeled and 13C-labeled isotopomer distributions for hydroxamate di-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl (di-TBDMS) derivatized pyruvate were measured. The program was applied to the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose labeled from [U-13C3]glycerol and of fatty acids labeled from [U-13C6]glucose and either [2-13C2]  or [U-13C2]. In some of these cases, the measured mass isotopomer distributions corrected by the program were different from those corrected by the classical technique. Implications of these differences including those on the calculation of glucose production due to  in isolated perfused rat liver are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24062879>Ethanol and  acting as carbon/energy sources negatively affect yeast chronological aging.</a></h2><p>In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the chronological lifespan (CLS) is defined as the length of time that a population of nondividing cells can survive in stationary phase. In this phase, cells remain metabolically active, albeit at reduced levels, and responsive to environmental signals, thus simulating the postmitotic quiescent state of mammalian cells. Many studies on the main nutrient signaling pathways have uncovered the strong influence of growth conditions, including the composition of culture media, on CLS. In this context, two byproducts of yeast glucose fermentation, ethanol and acetic acid, have been proposed as extrinsic proaging factors. Here, we report that ethanol and acetic acid, at physiological levels released in the exhausted medium, both contribute to chronological aging. Moreover, this combined proaging effect is not due to a toxic environment created by their presence but is mainly mediated by the metabolic pathways required for their utilization as carbon/energy sources. In addition, measurements of key enzymatic activities of the glyoxylate cycle and , together with respiration assays performed in extreme calorie restriction, point to a long-term quiescent program favoured by glyoxylate/ flux contrary to a proaging one based on the oxidative metabolism of ethanol/ via TCA and mitochondrial respiration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16087660>Enhanced rate of ethanol elimination from blood after intravenous administration of amino acids compared with equicaloric glucose.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of an amino acid mixture given intravenously (i.v.) on the rate of ethanol elimination from blood compared with equicaloric glucose and Ringer's  as control treatments.In a randomized cross-over study, six healthy men (mean age 23 years) fasted overnight before receiving either Ringer's , glucose or the amino acid mixture (Vamin 18 g N/l) by constant rate i.v. infusion over 4.5 h. Ethanol (0.4 g/kg) was given by an i.v. infusion lasting 60 min during the time each of the treatments was administered. At various times post-infusion, blood samples were taken for determination of ethanol by headspace gas chromatography. Blood glucose and heart rate were monitored at regular intervals. Concentration-time profiles of ethanol were plotted for each subject and the rate of ethanol disappearance from blood as well as other pharmacokinetic parameters were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance.The rate of ethanol elimination from blood was increased significantly (P < 0.001) after treatment with amino acids (mean +/- SD, 0.174 +/- 0.011 g/l/h) compared with equicaloric glucose (0.121 +/- 0.016 g/l/h) or Ringer's  (0.110 +/- 0.013 g/l/h). Heart rate was also slightly higher during infusion of the amino acid mixture (P < 0.05).When the rate of ethanol elimination from blood is relatively slow, such as after an overnight fast, it can be increased by approximately 60% after treatment with i.v. amino acids. The efficacy of amino acid treatment was not related to the supply of calories because glucose was no more effective than Ringer's . We suggest that amino acids might increase hepatic oxygen consumption, resulting in a more effective conversion of NADH to NAD+ in mitochondria. An important feature of the experimental design was ensuring hepatic availability of amino acids during much of the time that ethanol was being metabolized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19465526>Complete genome sequence of the chemolithoautotrophic marine magnetotactic coccus strain MC-1.</a></h2><p>The marine bacterium strain MC-1 is a member of the alpha subgroup of the proteobacteria that contains the magnetotactic cocci and was the first member of this group to be cultured axenically. The magnetotactic cocci are not closely related to any other known alphaproteobacteria and are only distantly related to other magnetotactic bacteria. The genome of MC-1 contains an extensive (102 kb) magnetosome island that includes numerous genes that are conserved among all known magnetotactic bacteria, as well as some genes that are unique. Interestingly, certain genes that encode proteins considered to be important in magnetosome assembly (mamJ and mamW) are absent from the genome of MC-1. Magnetotactic cocci exhibit polar magneto-aerotaxis, and the MC-1 genome contains a relatively large number of identified chemotaxis genes. Although MC-1 is capable of both autotrophic and heterotrophic growth, it does not appear to be metabolically versatile, with heterotrophic growth confined to the utilization of . Central carbon metabolism is encoded by genes for the citric acid cycle (oxidative and reductive), glycolysis, and .

However, its role during growth on carbon sources requiring glucoeneogenesis is less well investigated. We analyzed a defined pyruvate kinase gene (pyk) deletion mutant of Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is unable to grow on ribose as sole carbon source. Unexpectedly, the pyk deletion mutant was also unable to grow on  or citrate as sole carbon sources unless low amounts of pyruvate were added to the growth medium. A spontaneous suppressor mutant of the pyk deletion strain that regained the ability to grow on  was isolated. DNA microarray experiments revealed increased expression of the malic enzyme gene malE. The point mutation upstream of malE identified in this mutant was responsible for the loss of carbon-source-dependent regulation, as revealed by transcriptional fusion analysis. Overexpression of malE was sufficient to restore growth of the pyk deletion strain on  or citrate. The requirement of increased malic enzyme levels to re-route the carbon flux at the interface between glycolysis,  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in order to compensate for the absence of pyruvate kinase indicates a metabolic flux bifurcation at the metabolic node phosphoenolpyruvate. Whereas during growth of C. glutamicum on  or citrate most of the phosphoenolpyruvate generated from oxaloacetate is metabolized in , a fraction is converted by pyruvate kinase in the glycolytic direction to sustain proper pyruvate availability for biomass synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10328823>Yeast mutants of glucose metabolism with defects in the coordinate regulation of carbon assimilation.</a></h2><p>The enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and  are tightly regulated by transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and posttranslational mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have previously identified four genes, ACN8, ACN9, ACN17, and ACN18, whose mutant phenotype includes two- to fourfold elevated levels of enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, , and acetyl-CoA metabolism. The affected enzymes are elevated on nonfermentable carbon sources but are still fully repressed by glucose. Catabolite inactivation of the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase is not affected in the mutants. Instead, the phenotype appeared to be manifested primarily at the level of transcription. The ACN8, ACN17, and ACN18 genes were isolated by functional complementation of the respective mutant's inability to utilize  as a carbon and energy source, and these genes were shown to encode subunits of metabolic enzymes. ACN8 was identical to FBP1, which encodes the gluconeogenic enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, while ACN17 and ACN18 were identical to the SDH2 and SDH4 genes, respectively, that encode subunits of the respiratory chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase. Mutants defective in other glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenic enzymes also display the elevated enzyme phenotype, indicating that the enzyme superinduction is a general property of gluconeogenic dysfunction. Glucose 6-phosphate levels were diminished in the mutants, suggesting that endogenous glucose synthesis can regulate the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11243575>Modulation by cyclic AMP and phorbol myristate  of cephaloridine-induced injury in rat renal cortical slices.</a></h2><p>Intracellular signaling pathways of cAMP and protein kinase C (PKC) have been suggested to modulate the generation of free radicals. We investigated the effects of cAMP and phorbol myristate  (PMA), a PKC activator, on cephaloridine (CER)-induced renal cell injury, which has been reported to be due to the generation of free radicals. Incubation of rat renal cortical slices with CER resulted in increases in lipid peroxidation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and in decreases in  and p-aminohippurate (PAH) accumulation in rat renal cortical slices, suggesting free radical-induced injury in slices exposed to CER. A derivative of cAMP ameliorated not only the increase in lipid peroxidation but also the renal cell damage induced by CER. This amelioration by a cAMP derivative of lipid peroxidation and renal cell damage caused by CER was blocked by KT 5720, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Lipid peroxidation and the indices of cell injury were increased by PMA. PMA also enhanced CER-induced lipid peroxidation and cell damage in the slices.

We performed a primed constant sodium L-lactate infusion in 11 moderate to severely brain injured adults. Blood was collected before and periodically during the infusion study. We quantified global cerebral uptake of glucose and lactate and other systemic metabolites associated with energy metabolism. Our hypothesis was that cerebral lactate uptake, as measured by the arteriovenous difference of lactate (AVDlac), would increase in severely injured TBI patients in the neurocritical care unit. Infusion of sodium L-lactate changed net cerebral lactate release, where the arteriovenous difference of lactate is negative, to net cerebral lactate uptake. Results from a mixed effects model of AVDlac with the fixed effects of infusion time, arterial lactate concentration, arterial glucose concentration and arteriovenous difference of glucose shows that doubling arterial lactate concentration (from .92 to 1.84 mM) results in an increase in AVDlac from -.078 mM to .090 mM. We did not detect changes in systemic glucose during the course of the infusion study and observed significant changes in alanine (30% [20 39]), glutamine (34% [24 43]),  (87% [60 113]), valine (40% [28 51]), and leucine (24% [16 32]) from baseline levels.

It refers to changes occurring in stationary phase cells over a relatively long period of time. How long these cells can survive in such a non-dividing state defines the chronological lifespan. Several factors influence cell survival including two well known normal by-products of yeast glucose fermentation such as ethanol and acetic acid. In fact, the presence in the growth medium of these C2 compounds has been shown to limit the chronological lifespan. In the chronological aging paradigm, a pro-aging role has also emerged for the deacetylase Sir2, the founding member of the Sirtuin family, whose loss of function increases the depletion of extracellular ethanol by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that lack of Sir2 strongly influences carbon metabolism. In particular, we point out a more efficient  utilization which in turn may have a stimulatory effect on ethanol catabolism. This correlates with an enhanced glyoxylate/gluconeogenic flux which is fuelled by the acetyl-CoA produced from the  activation. Thus, when growth relies on a respiratory metabolism such as that on ethanol or , SIR2 inactivation favors growth. Moreover, in the chronological aging paradigm, the increase in the  metabolism implies that sir2Δ cells avoid acetic acid accumulation in the medium and deplete ethanol faster; consequently pro-aging extracellular signals are reduced. In addition, an enhanced  allows replenishment of intracellular glucose stores which may be useful for better long-term cell survival.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The acetone bioproduction from the traditional acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation is limited by the non-specificity of products and competitive utilization of food-based substrates. Using genetically modified Escherichia coli to produce acetone as sole product from the cost-effective non-food based substrates showed great potential to overcome these problems.A novel acetone biosynthetic pathway were constructed based on genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum (thlA encoding for thiolase, adc encoding for acetoacetate decarboxylase, ctfAB encoding for coenzyme A transferase) and Escherichia coli MG1655 (atoB encoding acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, atoDA encoding for acetyl-CoA: acetoacetyl-CoA transferase subunit α and β). Among these constructs, one recombinant MG1655 derivative containing the hybrid pathway consisting of thlA, atoDA, and adc, produced the highest level of acetone from . Reducing the  pathway had little effect on acetone production, while blocking the TCA cycle by knocking out the icdA gene enhanced the yield of acetone significantly. As a result, acetone concentration increased up to 113.18 mM in 24 h by the resting cell culture coupling with gas-stripping methods.An engineered E. coli strain with optimized hybrid acetone biosynthetic pathway can utilize  as substrate efficiently to synthesize acetone without other non-gas byproducts. It provides a potential method for industrial biomanufacturing of acetone by engineered E. coli strains from non-food based substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9591745>Role of glucose and glutamine synthesis in the differential recovery of 13CO2 from infused [2-13C] versus [1-13C] .</a></h2><p>Carbon exchange in the Krebs cycle may result in underestimation of substrate oxidation measured with 13C-labeled substrates, since carbon labeled in position 2 of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) could be incorporated into glucose (via ) and glutamine. Five healthy volunteers were therefore infused with [1-13C] and [2-13C]  at a rate of 0.5 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 165 minutes on two different occasions in randomized order. Whole body  turnover did not differ between the two tracers: 7.9+/-0.3 and 7.5+/-0.6 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1) (nonsignificant [NS]) for [1-13C] and [2-13C] , respectively. Isotopic 13C enrichment was higher in expired CO2 (0.177+/-0.021 v 0.089+/-0.009 atom percent excess [APE], P < .01) and lower in glucose (0.074+/-0.017 v0.291+/-0.061 mole percent excess [MPE], P < .01) for [1-13C]  compared with [2-13C] , respectively, at the end of the infusions. Glutamine isotopic enrichment was slightly but not significantly higher when infusing [1-13C]  versus [2-13C]  (0.348+/-0.038 v0.495+/-0.069 MPE, NS, respectively). At the end of the experiment, the recovery of 13CO2 from [1-13C]  was 44.8%+/-2.7%, and from [2-13C] , 22.6%+/-1.3%. A significant correlation was observed between the differences in 13C enrichment of CO2 for the two tracers and glucose (deltaCO2=0.424 x deltaglucose + 0.001, R2=.9856, P=.0007) or glutamine (deltaCO2=0.621 x deltaglutamine + 0.004, R2=.9573, P=.0038) during the infusion. These results suggest that (1) although  appears to be more responsible than glutamine for the differential recovery of [2-13C] versus [1-13C] , other secondary pathways are probably also implicated; and (2) different recovery correction factors should be applied when measuring substrate oxidation with a stable isotope tracer depending on the expected position of 13C in acetyl-CoA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23888892>(1)H NMR spectroscopic studies on the characterization of renal cell lines and identification of novel potential markers of in vitro nephrotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Cell cultures are increasingly used in the evaluation of chemically-induced nephrotoxicity. The utili of renal cell culture systems in toxicology would be improved, however, if better characterized and more specific markers of toxicity were available. High resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy is well suited to the study of toxicological events and has identified many novel markers of nephrotoxicity in vivo. In this study, (1)H NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize the biochemical composition of two renal cell lines of different nephronal origin, LLC-PK1 (pig proximal tubule) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, distal tubule). The early biochemical responses of these cell lines to the model proximal tubular toxin S-(1,2dichlorovinyl)i-L-cysteine (DCVC) and the renal medullary toxin 2-chloroethanamine (CEA) have also been investigated. For each line, 500 MHz (1)H NMR spectra of protein-free acetone extracts of cells and culture medium gave characteristic and reproducible profiles of low MW constituents, including amino and organic acids, glucose and soluble membrane precursors, such as choline and myo-inositol. Treatment-related changes in several low MW compounds not routinely measured in toxicological studies were revealed by NMR specboscopy before marked cytotoxicity was observed by phase contrast microscopy. For example, LLC-PK1 cells treated with 60 μM DCVC showed a marked decrease in intracellular choline levels within 3 h which suggests an effect on the balance of choline synthesis and utilization. Wrthin 9 h of treatment with DCVC there were decreases in intracellular  and alanine concentrations which may be indicative of a decrease in fatty acid oxidation and biglyceride metabolism accompanied by an increase in . In MDCK cells, 1 h post treatment with 5 mM CEA, intracellular glycine was decreased.

To define phase variation at the transcriptomic level in pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain N16961, we compared the RNA-seq-derived transcriptomes among the smooth parent N16961, its rugose derivative (N16961R) and a smooth form obtained directly from the rugose at high frequencies consistent with phase variation (N16961SD).Differentially regulated genes which clustered into co-expression groups were identified for specific cellular functions, including  metabolism, , and anaerobic respiration, suggesting an important link between these processes and biofilm formation in this species. Principal component analysis separated the transcriptome of N16961SD from the other phase variants.

The following observations indicate that activation of PKC is a condition necessary for alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation of hepatic functions, but not sufficient to mimic the receptor-mediated effects in the absence of external physiological stimuli. 1) alpha 1-Adrenoceptor activation promoted the translocation of PKC from the cytosol to its active form in the plasma membrane. 2) Activation of PKC by the phorbol ester 12-myristate 13- or exogenous diacylglycerols or by elevation of endogenous levels of diacylglycerols by inhibiting diacylglycerol kinase mimicked the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated actions. However, the time course and magnitude of the nonreceptor responses differ from those mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation. In addition, nonreceptor-mediated activation of PKC decreased the alpha 1-adrenoceptor responsiveness. 3) Inhibition of PKC by either H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinilsulfonyl)2-methylpiperazine] or staurosporine inhibited all of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-induced responses, except . The vasopressin effects were not inhibited by H-7, indicating that PKC activation is a distinct feature of the hepatic alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation that is not shared by all the Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonists.

Integration of the data into the transcriptional regulatory network model of C. glutamicum revealed a high connectivity of the deduced regulatory interactions and suggested that GlxR controls at least (i) sugar uptake, glycolysis, and , (ii) , lactate, gluconate, and ethanol metabolism, (iii) aromatic compound degradation, (iv) aerobic and anaerobic respiration, (v) glutamate uptake and nitrogen assimilation, (vi) fatty acid biosynthesis, (vii) deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis, (viii) the cellular stress response, and (ix) resuscitation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7797543>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but not p70/p85 ribosomal S6 protein kinase, is required for the regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression by insulin. Dissociation of signaling pathways for insulin and phorbol ester regulation of PEPCK gene expression.</a></h2><p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in hepatic . Glucagon (via the second messenger cAMP) and glucocorticoids stimulate the transcription of the PEPCK gene, whereas insulin and phorbol esters inhibit, in a dominant fashion, these effects. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, prevents the stimulation of glycogen synthesis, glucose transport, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and p70/p85 ribosomal S6 protein kinase by insulin. We now show that wortmannin can also block the inhibition of glucocorticoid- and cAMP-stimulated PEPCK gene expression by insulin. PEPCK-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion gene experiments demonstrate that wortmannin blocks an activity that is required for insulin signaling to elements within the PEPCK promoter. Phorbol esters mimic the action of insulin on the regulation of PEPCK gene expression, but wortmannin does not block the effect of these agents. Thus, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for the regulation of PEPCK gene expression by insulin, but not by phorbol esters. The immunosuppressant rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of insulin or phorbol ester stimulation of p70/p85 ribosomal S6 protein kinase, has no significant effect on the regulation of PEPCK gene expression by insulin or phorbol esters. Thus, p70/p85 ribosomal S6 protein kinase does not have a role in signaling to the PEPCK promoter by insulin or phorbol esters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553893>Oral nitazoxanide treatment of experimental neurocysticercosis induces  in Taenia crassiceps cysticerci.</a></h2><p>Neurocysticercosis is the most frequent helminthiasis of the central nervous system and is caused by the presence of Taenia solium cysticerci. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antiprotozoal activity due to interference with the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of NTZ on the energetic metabolism of Taenia crassiceps cysticerci intracranially inoculated BALB /c mice. The infected animals were treated with a single oral dose of NTZ 30 days after the inoculation. Analysis of the organic acids was performed through high performance liquid chromatography. Glucose was detected only in the treated groups, alongside with a significant decrease in lactate, pyruvate and oxaloacetate concentrations which indicate an increase in . The non-detection of alpha-ketoglutarate indicated the use of the fumarate reductase pathway in all groups. It was possible to confirm the drugs mode of action due to the non-detection of  in the treated groups. There was an increase in the fatty acids oxidation. Therefore it was possible to observe that NTZ induces  as well as the increase of alternative energetic pathways such as fatty acids oxidation in T. crassiceps cysticerci.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Metabolic peculiarities in different members of the  led us to perform proteomic studies in the presence of the two-carbon molecule , which predominates in the nutrient-poor environment of the phagosome. To investigate the expression rates of proteins of different members of , including one isolate of  (01) and three isolates of  (03, 339, and EPM83), using sodium  as a carbon source, proteins were quantified using label-free and data-independent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Protein profiles of the isolates were statistically analyzed, revealing proteins that were differentially expressed when the fungus was cultivated in a non-preferential carbon source rather than glucose. A total of 1,160, 1,211, 1,280, and 1,462 proteins were reproducibly identified and relatively quantified in  and the  isolates 03, 339, and EPM83, respectively. Notably, 526, 435, 744, and 747 proteins were differentially expressed among  and the  isolates 03, 339, and EPM, respectively, with a fold-change equal to or higher than 1.5. This analysis revealed that reorganization of metabolism occurred through the induction of proteins related to , glyoxylic/glyoxylate cycle, response to stress, and degradation of amino acids in the four isolates. The following differences were observed among the isolates: higher increases in the expression levels of proteins belonging to the TCA and respiratory chain in EPM83 and 01; increase in ethanol production in 01; utilization of cell wall components for  in 03 and EPM83; and increased β-oxidation and methylcitrate cycle proteins in 01and EPM83.

To identify such specific tracer, livers from 48-h starved rats were perfused with recirculating buffer containing [3-13C]lactate, [2-13C], or alpha-keto[3-13C]isocaproate. Conscious 48-h starved rats were infused with the same tracers for 5 h. The labeling patterns of liver glutamate and extracellular glucose were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In vivo data were corrected for 13CO2 reincorporation into C-1 of glutamate and C-3 and C-4 of glucose, using data from control rats infused with NaH13CO3. With [3-13C]lactate the labeling pattern of liver glutamate was the same in perfused organs and in vivo. In contrast, with [2-13C] and alpha-keto[3-13C]isocaproate the labeling pattern of liver glutamate in vivo was clearly influenced by the expected labeling pattern of citric acid cycle intermediates formed in non-gluconeogenic organs, presumably glutamine made in muscle. Indeed, the labeling pattern of plasma glutamine and liver glutamate were similar in experiments with [3-13C]lactate but different in experiments with [2-13C] and alpha-keto[3-13C]isocaproate. Similar conclusions were drawn from the labeling patterns of glucose. Therefore, labeled lactate appears as the best tracer for studies of liver intermediary metabolism in vivo. Our data also show that a substantial fraction of alpha-ketoisocaproate metabolism occurs in peripheral tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23031654>Structural and mechanistic investigations on Salmonella typhimurium  kinase (AckA): identification of a putative ligand binding pocket at the dimeric interface.</a></h2><p>Bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium can utilize  as the sole source of carbon and energy.  kinase (AckA) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta), key enzymes of  utilization pathway, regulate flux of metabolites in glycolysis, , TCA cycle, glyoxylate bypass and fatty acid metabolism.Here we report kinetic characterization of S. typhimurium AckA (StAckA) and structures of its unliganded (Form-I, 2.70 Å resolution) and citrate-bound (Form-II, 1.90 Å resolution) forms. The enzyme showed broad substrate specificity with k(cat)/K(m) in the order of  > propionate > formate. Further, the Km for acetyl-phosphate was significantly lower than for  and the enzyme could catalyze the reverse reaction (i.e. ATP synthesis) more efficiently. ATP and Mg(2+) could be substituted by other nucleoside 5'-triphosphates (GTP, UTP and CTP) and divalent cations (Mn(2+) and Co(2+)), respectively. Form-I StAckA represents the first structural report of an unliganded AckA. StAckA protomer consists of two domains with characteristic βββαβαβα topology of ASKHA superfamily of proteins. These domains adopt an intermediate conformation compared to that of open and closed forms of ligand-bound Methanosarcina thermophila AckA (MtAckA). Spectroscopic and structural analyses of StAckA further suggested occurrence of inter-domain motion upon ligand-binding. Unexpectedly, Form-II StAckA structure showed a drastic change in the conformation of residues 230-300 compared to that of Form-I. Further investigation revealed electron density corresponding to a citrate molecule in a pocket located at the dimeric interface of Form-II StAckA. Interestingly, a similar dimeric interface pocket lined with largely conserved residues could be identified in Form-I StAckA as well as in other enzymes homologous to AckA suggesting that ligand binding at this pocket may influence the function of these enzymes.The biochemical and structural characterization of StAckA reported here provides insights into the biochemical specificity, overall fold, thermal stability, molecular basis of ligand binding and inter-domain motion in AckA family of enzymes. Dramatic conformational differences observed between unliganded and citrate-bound forms of StAckA led to identification of a putative ligand-binding pocket at the dimeric interface of StAckA with implications for enzymatic function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16181237>In vivo activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and free fatty acid-induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Free fatty acids (FFAs) induce hepatic insulin resistance and enhance hepatic . Glucocorticoids (GCs) also stimulate hepatic . The aim of this study was to investigate whether the FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance is mediated by increased activity of hepatic 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), accompanied by elevated hepatic cortisol levels.Following a 10-h overnight fast, six healthy male volunteers were investigated. A euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed during lipid or saline infusion. To assess hepatic 11beta-HSD1 activity, plasma cortisol levels were measured after oral administration of cortisone  during lipid or saline infusion. In addition, 11beta-HSD activities were determined in vivo by calculating the urinary ratios of GC metabolites.Lipid infusion increased FFAs (5.41 +/- 1.00 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.20 mmol/l; P < 0.005) and significantly increased insulin resistance [glucose infusion rate (GIR) 6.02 +/- 2.60 vs. 4.08 +/- 2.15 mg/kg/min; P < 0.005]. After lipid and saline infusions no changes in 11beta-HSD1 activity were found, neither by changes in cortisone  to cortisol conversion nor by differences in urinary free cortisol (UFF) or cortisone (UFE), 5beta-tetrahydrocortisol (THF), 5alpha-THF, cortisone (THE), UFF/UFE and (5alpha-THF + THF)/THE ratios.We found no change in hepatic and whole-body 11beta-HSD1 activity during acute FFA-induced insulin resistance.

While many studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity of PFCAs, few have investigated renal toxicity.Here, we used comparative proteomic and metabonomic technologies to provide a global perspective on renal response to PFDoA. Male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After 2-D DIGE and MALDI TOF/TOF analysis, 79 differentially expressed proteins between the control and the PFDoA treated rats (0.2 and 0.5 mg-dosed groups) were successfully identified. These proteins were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, , glycolysis, electron transport, and stress response. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic analysis showed an increase in pyruvate, lactate, , choline, and a variety of amino acids in the highest dose group. Furthermore, the profiles of free amino acids in the PFDoA treated groups were investigated quantitatively by high-coverage quantitative iTRAQ-LC MS/MS, which showed levels of sarcosine, asparagine, histidine, 1-methylhistidine, Ile, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Cys, and Met increased markedly in the 0.5 mg dosed group, while homocitrulline, α-aminoadipic acid, β-alanine, and cystathionine decreased.These observations provide evidence that disorders in glucose and amino acid metabolism may contribute to PFDoA nephrotoxicity. Additionally, α(2u) globulin may play an important role in protecting the kidneys from PFDoA toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704548>Control of food intake by metabolism of fuels: a comparison across species.</a></h2><p>Research with laboratory species suggests that meals can be terminated by peripheral signals carried to brain feeding centres via hepatic vagal afferents, and that these signals are affected by oxidation of fuels. Pre-gastric fermentation in ruminants greatly alters fuels, allowing mechanisms conserved across species to be studied with different types and temporal absorption of fuels. These fuels include SCFA, glucose, lactate, amino acids and long-chain fatty acid (FA) isomers, all of which are absorbed and metabolised by different tissues at different rates. Propionate is produced by rumen microbes, absorbed within the timeframe of meals, and quickly cleared by the liver. Its hypophagic effects are variable, likely due to its fate; propionate is utilised for  or oxidised and also stimulates oxidation of acetyl-CoA by anapleurosis. In contrast,  has little effect on food intake, likely because its uptake by the ruminant liver is negligible. Glucose is hypophagic in non-ruminants but not ruminants and unlike non-ruminant species, uptake of glucose by ruminant liver is negligible, consistent with the differences in hypophagic effects between them. Inhibition of FA oxidation increases food intake, whereas promotion of FA oxidation suppresses food intake. Hypophagic effects of fuel oxidation also vary with changes in metabolic state. The objective of this paper is to compare the type and utilisation of fuels and their effects on feeding across species. We believe that the hepatic oxidation theory allows insight into mechanisms controlling feeding behaviour that can be used to formulate diets to optimise energy balance in multiple species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10834593>Net absorption and hepatic metabolism of glucose, L-lactate, and volatile fatty acids by steers fed diets containing sorghum grain processed as dry-rolled or steam-flaked at different densities.</a></h2><p>We determined the effect of processing method (dry-rolled [DR] vs steam-flaked [SF]) and degree of processing (flake density; FD) of SF sorghum grain on splanchnic (gut and liver) metabolism of energy-yielding nutrients by growing steers. Diets contained 77% sorghum grain, either DR or SF, with SF at densities of 437, 360, or 283 g/L (SF34, SF28, or SF22). Eight multicatheterized steers (340 kg initial BW) were used in a randomized complete block design. Net output or uptake of glucose, L-lactate, VFA, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) were measured across portal-drained viscera (PDV), liver, and splanchnic (PDV plus liver) tissues. Net absorption of glucose across PDV was negative and similar for all treatments (average of -104 g/d). Decreasing FD of SF sorghum grain linearly increased (P < or = .04) net absorption and splanchnic output of L-lactate by 20 and 130%, respectively, and hepatic synthesis (P = .06) and splanchnic output (P = .01) of glucose by 50%. Reducing FD did not alter output or uptake of  or n-butyrate by gut and liver tissues, but linearly decreased (P = .06) splanchnic output of BHBA by 40%. Net absorption (P = .18) and splanchnic output (P = .15) of propionate tended to be increased linearly by 50% with decreasing FD. Neither processing method (SF vs DR) nor degree of processing (varying FD) altered hepatic nutrient extraction ratios or estimated net absorption and splanchnic output of energy. Maximal contribution of propionate, L-lactate, and amino acids (alpha-amino N) to  averaged 49, 11, and 20%, respectively. Feeding steers SF compared to DR diets did not alter net output or uptake of energy-yielding nutrients across splanchnic tissues, except net absorption of  tended to be greater (P = .13) for steers fed DR. Increasing degree of grain processing in the present study, by incrementally decreasing FD, tended to linearly increase the net absorption of glucose precursors (propionate and lactate), resulting in linear increases in synthesis and output of glucose by the liver to extrasplanchnic tissues (e.g., muscle).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8320225>Cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate as a component of a new branch in  in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H.</a></h2><p>A unique compound, cyclic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (cDPG), is the major soluble carbon and phosphorus solute in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H under optimal conditions of cell growth.

It was demonstrated that cells could grow exponentially under conditions in which 2-PG and 2,3-DPG, rather than cDPG, were the major solutes. While the total concentration of these three phosphorylated molecules was maintained, rapid interconversion of 13C label among them was observed. Label flow from 2-PG to 2,3-DPG to cDPG to polymer is the usual direction in this pathway in exponentially growing cells, while the reverse reactions sometimes predominate in the stationary phase.

Here, we describe multiend point responses of adult zebrafish (8 months old) upon 21-day exposure to a commonly prescribed corticosteroid, fludrocortisone  (FLU), at concentrations between 0.006 and 42 μg/L. No remarkable reproductive impacts were observed, while physiological effects, including plasma glucose level and blood leukocyte numbers were significant altered even at 42 ng/L. Ovary parameters and transcriptional analysis of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-liver axis revealed negligible effects. Significant alterations of the circadian rhythm network were observed in the zebrafish brain. Transcripts of several biomarker genes, including per1a and nr1d1, displayed strong transcriptional changes, which occurred at environmental relevant concentrations of 6 and 42 ng/L FLU. Importantly, the development and behavior of F1 embryos were significant changed. Heartbeat, hatching success and swimming behavior of F1 embryos were all increased even at 6 and 42 ng/L. All effects were further confirmed by exposure of eleuthero-embryos. Significant transcriptional changes of biomarker genes involved in gluconeogenesis, immune response and circadian rhythm in eleuthero-embryos confirmed the observations in adult fish. Hatching success, heartbeat, and swimming activity were increased at 81 ng/L and higher, as with F1 embryos.

Here, we explored the role of the Csr system in the glucose- transition as a model of the glycolysis-to- switch. Mutations in the Csr system influence the reorganization of gene expression after glucose exhaustion and disturb the timing of  reconsumption after glucose exhaustion. Analysis of metabolite concentrations during the transition revealed that the Csr system has a major effect on the energy levels of the cells after glucose exhaustion. This influence was demonstrated to result directly from the effect of the Csr system on glycogen accumulation. Mutation in glycogen metabolism was also demonstrated to hinder metabolic adaptation after glucose exhaustion because of insufficient energy. This work explains how the Csr system influences  fitness during the glycolysis- switch and demonstrates the role of glycogen in maintenance of the energy charge during metabolic adaptation. Glycogen is a polysaccharide and the main storage form of glucose from bacteria such as  to yeasts and mammals. Although its function as a sugar reserve in mammals is well documented, the role of glycogen in bacteria is not as clear. By studying the role of posttranscriptional regulation during metabolic adaptation, for the first time, we demonstrate the role of sugar reserve played by glycogen in  Indeed, glycogen not only makes it possible to maintain sufficient energy during metabolic transitions but is also the key component in the capacity of cells to resume growth. Since the essential posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr is a major regulator of glycogen accumulation, this work also sheds light on the central role of posttranscriptional regulation in metabolic adaptation.Copyright © 2017 Morin et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766116>Examining  glycolytic pathways, catabolite repression, and metabolite channeling using Δ mutants.</a></h2><p> breakdowns glucose into essential building blocks and ATP/NAD(P)H for the cell, occupying a central role in its growth and bio-production.

The downregulation of EMPP via the  deletion significantly decreased the growth rate, while EDP overexpression in the Δ mutant failed to improve its growth rates due to metabolic burden.

To understand the complex biochemical and developmental changes undergone by R. leguminosarum bv. viciae during bacteroid development, microarray experiments were first performed with cultured bacteria grown on a variety of carbon substrates (glucose, pyruvate, succinate, inositol, , and acetoacetate) and then compared to bacteroids. Bacteroid metabolism is essentially that of dicarboxylate-grown cells (i.e., induction of dicarboxylate transport,  and alanine synthesis, and repression of sugar utilization). The decarboxylating arm of the tricarboxylic acid cycle is highly induced, as is gamma-aminobutyrate metabolism, particularly in bacteroids from early (7-day) nodules. To investigate bacteroid development, gene expression in bacteroids was analyzed at 7, 15, and 21 days postinoculation of peas. This revealed that bacterial rRNA isolated from pea, but not vetch, is extensively processed in mature bacteroids. In early development (7 days), there were large changes in the expression of regulators, exported and cell surface molecules, multidrug exporters, and heat and cold shock proteins. fix genes were induced early but continued to increase in mature bacteroids, while nif genes were induced strongly in older bacteroids. Mutation of 37 genes that were strongly upregulated in mature bacteroids revealed that none were essential for nitrogen fixation.

Although the feedback from metabolic consequence is believed to be important, much less is understood. This work demonstrates that the gluconeogenic genes in Escherichia coli, ppsA, sfcA, and maeB, provide a feedback loop to the global regulator, cAMP receptor protein (CRP), in carbon source transition. Disruption of one of the gluconeogenic pathways has no phenotype in balanced growth, but causes a significant delay in the diauxic transition from glucose to . To investigate the underlying mechanism, we measured the transcriptome profiles during the transition using DNA microarray, and network component analysis was employed to obtain the transcription factor activities. Results showed that one of the global regulators, CRP, was insufficiently activated during the transition in the ppsA deletion mutant. Indeed, addition of cAMP partially rescued the delay in transition. These results suggest that the gluconeogenic flux to phosphoenolpyruvate is important for full activation of adenylate cyclase through the phosphorylated enzyme IIA(glu) of the phosphotransferase system. Reduction of this flux causes insufficient activation of CRP and a global metabolic deficiency, which exemplifies a significant feedback interaction from metabolism to the a global regulatory system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19202299>Carbon catabolite control of the metabolic network in Bacillus subtilis.</a></h2><p>The histidine-containing protein (HPr) is the energy coupling protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent carbohydrate:phosphotransferase system (PTS), which catalyzes the transport of carbohydrates in bacteria. In Bacillus subtilis and close relatives, global regulation of carbon catabolite control occurs on the binding of the complex of CcpA (catabolite control protein A) and P-Ser-HPr (seryl-phosphorylated form of HPr) to the catabolite responsive elements (cre) of the target operons, the constituent genes of which are roughly estimated to number 300. The complex of CcpA and P-Ser-HPr triggers the expression of several genes involved in the formation of  and acetoin, major extracellular products of B. subtilis grown on glucose. It also triggers the expression of an anabolic operon (ilv-leu) involved in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, which subsequently leads to cell propagation. On the other hand, this complex represses many genes and operons, which include an entrance gene for the TCA cycle (citZ), several transporter genes for TCA cycle-intermediates, some respiration genes, and many catabolic and anabolic genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate metabolism, as well as for certain extracellular enzymes and secondary metabolites. Furthermore, these bacteria have CcpA-independent catabolite regulation systems, each of which involves a transcriptional repressor of CggR or CcpN. CggR and CcpN are derepressed under glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth conditions, and enhance glycolysis and  respectively. Another CcpA-independent catabolite repression system involves P-His-HPr (histidyl-phosphorylated form of HPr). P-His-HPr phosphorylates and activates glycerol kinase, whose product is necessary for antitermination of the glycerol utilization operon through GlpP, the antiterminators (LicT and SacT, Y) of several operons for the utilization of less-preferred PTS-sugars, and some transcriptional activators such as LevR for the levan utilization operon. This phosphorylation is reduced due to the decreased level of P-His-HPr during active transport of a preferred PTS-carbohydrate such as glucose, resulting in catabolite repression of the target operons.Thus CcpA-dependent and independent networks for carbon metabolism play a major role in the coordinate regulation of catabolism and anabolism to ensure optimum cell propagation in the presence and the absence of a preferred PTS-carbohydrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675502>Characterization of the metabolic requirements in yeast meiosis.</a></h2><p>The diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes mitosis in glucose-rich medium but enters meiosis in  sporulation medium.

In this study, we apply flux balance analyses to uncover optimal principles driving the operation of metabolic networks over the entire period of sporulation. A meiosis-specific metabolic network is constructed, and flux distribution is simulated using ten objective functions combined with time-course expression-based reaction constraints. By systematically evaluating the correlation between computational and experimental fluxes on pathways and macromolecule syntheses, the metabolic requirements of cells are determined: sporulation requires maximization of ATP production and macromolecule syntheses in the early phase followed by maximization of carbohydrate breakdown and minimization of ATP production in the middle and late stages. Our computational models are validated by in silico deletion of enzymes known to be essential for sporulation. Finally, the models are used to predict novel metabolic genes required for sporulation. This study indicates that yeast cells have distinct metabolic requirements at different phases of meiosis, which may reflect regulation that realizes the optimal outcome of sporulation. Our meiosis-specific network models provide a framework for an in-depth understanding of the roles of enzymes and reactions, and may open new avenues for engineering metabolic pathways to improve sporulation efficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26397812>glpx Gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Is Required for In Vitro Gluconeogenic Growth and In Vivo Survival.</a></h2><p>Several enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism and  play a critical role in survival and pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The only known functional fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) in Mtb is encoded by the glpX gene and belongs to the Class II sub-family of FBPase. We describe herein the generation of a ΔglpX strain using homologous recombination. Although the growth profile of ΔglpX is comparable to that of wild type Mtb when grown on the standard enrichment media, its growth is dysgonic with individual gluconeogenic substrates such as oleic acid, glycerol and . In mice lung CFU titers of ΔglpX were 2-3 log10 lower than the wild-type Mtb strain. The results indicate that glpX gene encodes a functional FBPase and is essential for both in vitro and in vivo growth and survival of Mtb. Loss of glpX results in significant reduction of FBPase activity but not complete abolition. These findings verify that the glpX encoded FBPase II in Mtb can be a potential target for drug discovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21831320>Catabolic regulation analysis of Escherichia coli and its crp, mlc, mgsA, pgi and ptsG mutants.</a></h2><p>Most bacteria can use various compounds as carbon sources. These carbon sources can be either co-metabolized or sequentially metabolized, where the latter phenomenon typically occurs as catabolite repression. From the practical application point of view of utilizing lignocellulose for the production of biofuels etc., it is strongly desirable to ferment all sugars obtained by hydrolysis from lignocellulosic materials, where simultaneous consumption of sugars would benefit the formation of bioproducts. However, most organisms consume glucose prior to consumption of other carbon sources, and exhibit diauxic growth. It has been shown by fermentation experiments that simultaneous consumption of sugars can be attained by ptsG, mgsA mutants etc., but its mechanism has not been well understood. It is strongly desirable to understand the mechanism of metabolic regulation for catabolite regulation to improve the performance of fermentation.In order to make clear the catabolic regulation mechanism, several continuous cultures were conducted at different dilution rates of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.7 h⁻¹ using wild type Escherichia coli. The result indicates that the transcript levels of global regulators such as crp, cra, mlc and rpoS decreased, while those of fadR, iclR, soxR/S increased as the dilution rate increased. These affected the metabolic pathway genes, which in turn affected fermentation result where the specific glucose uptake rate, the specific  formation rate, and the specific CO₂ evolution rate (CER) were increased as the dilution rate was increased. This was confirmed by the ¹³C-flux analysis. In order to make clear the catabolite regulation, the effect of crp gene knockout (Δcrp) and crp enhancement (crp⁺) as well as mlc, mgsA, pgi and ptsG gene knockout on the metabolism was then investigated by the continuous culture at the dilution rate of 0.2 h⁻¹ and by some batch cultures. In the case of Δcrp (and also Δmlc) mutant, TCA cycle and glyoxylate were repressed, which caused  accumulation. In the case of crp⁺ mutant, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and  were activated, and simultaneous consumption of multiple carbon sources can be attained, but the glucose consumption rate became less due to repression of ptsG and ptsH by the activation of Mlc. Simultaneous consumption of multiple carbon sources could be attained by mgsA, pgi, and ptsG mutants due to increase in crp as well as cyaA, while glucose consumption rate became lower.The transcriptional catabolite regulation mechanism was made clear for the wild type E. coli, and its crp, mlc, ptsG, pgi, and mgsA gene knockout mutants. The results indicate that catabolite repression can be relaxed and crp as well as cyaA can be increased by crp⁺, mgsA, pgi, and ptsG mutants, and thus simultaneous consumption of multiple carbon sources including glucose can be made, whereas the glucose uptake rate became lower as compared to wild type due to inactivation of ptsG in all the mutants considered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24929951>Leptin reverses diabetes by suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</a></h2><p>Leptin treatment reverses hyperglycemia in animal models of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D), spurring great interest in the possibility of treating patients with this hormone. The antidiabetic effect of leptin has been postulated to occur through suppression of glucagon production, suppression of glucagon responsiveness or both; however, there does not appear to be a direct effect of leptin on the pancreatic alpha cell. Thus, the mechanisms responsible for the antidiabetic effect of leptin remain poorly understood. We quantified liver-specific rates of hepatic  and substrate oxidation in conjunction with rates of whole-body , glycerol and fatty acid turnover in three rat models of poorly controlled diabetes, including a model of diabetic ketoacidosis. We show that the higher rates of hepatic  in all these models could be attributed to hypoleptinemia-induced activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in higher rates of adipocyte lipolysis, hepatic conversion of glycerol to glucose through a substrate push mechanism and conversion of pyruvate to glucose through greater hepatic acetyl-CoA allosteric activation of pyruvate carboxylase flux. Notably, these effects could be dissociated from changes in plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations and hepatic gluconeogenic protein expression. All the altered systemic and hepatic metabolic fluxes could be mimicked by infusing rats with Intralipid or corticosterone and were corrected by leptin replacement. These data demonstrate a critical role for lipolysis and substrate delivery to the liver, secondary to hypoleptinemia and HPA axis activity, in promoting higher hepatic  and hyperglycemia in poorly controlled diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459144>Brain pyruvate recycling and peripheral metabolism: an NMR analysis ex vivo of  and glucose metabolism in the rat.</a></h2><p>The occurrence of pyruvate recycling in the rat brain was studied in either pentobarbital anesthetized animals or awake animals receiving a light analgesic dose of morphine, which were infused with either [1-13C]glucose +  or glucose + [2-13C] for various periods of time. Metabolite enrichments in the brain, blood and the liver were determined from NMR analyses of tissue extracts. They indicated that: (i) Pyruvate recycling was revealed in the brain of both the anesthetized and awake animals, as well as from lactate and alanine enrichments as from glutamate isotopomer composition, but only after infusion of glucose + [2-13C]. (ii) Brain glucose was labelled from [2-13C] at the same level in anaesthetized and awake rats (approximately 4%). Comparing its enrichment with that of blood and liver glucose indicated that brain glucose labelling resulted from hepatic . (iii) Analysing glucose 13C-13C coupling in the brain, blood and the liver confirmed that brain glucose could be labelled in the liver through the activities of both pyruvate recycling and . (iv) The rate of appearance and the amount of brain glutamate C4-C5 coupling, a marker of pyruvate recycling when starting from [2-13C], were lower than those of brain glucose labelling from hepatic metabolism. (v) The evaluation of the contributions of glucose and  to glutamate metabolism revealed that more than 60% of brain glutamate was synthesized from glucose whereas only 7% was from  and that glutamate C4-C5 coupling was mainly due to the metabolism of glucose labelled through hepatic . All these results indicate that, under the present conditions, the pyruvate recycling observed through the labelling of brain metabolites mainly originates from peripheral metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448714>Systemic and characteristic metabolites in the serum of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at different stages as revealed by a (1)H-NMR based metabonomic approach.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus is a typical heterogeneous metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Investigating the changes in metabolic pathways during the evolution of diabetes mellitus may contribute to the understanding of its metabolic features and pathogenesis. In this study, serum samples were collected from diabetic rats and age-matched controls at different time points: 1 and 9 weeks after streptozotocin (STZ) treatment. (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR)-based metabonomics with quantitative analysis was performed to study the metabolic changes. The serum samples were also subjected to clinical chemistry analysis to verify the metabolic changes observed by metabonomics. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated that the levels of serum metabolites in diabetic rats are different from those in control rats. These findings indicate that the metabolic characteristics of the two groups are markedly different at 1 and 9 weeks. Quantitative analysis showed that the levels of some metabolites, such as pyruvate, lactate, citrate, acetone, acetoacetate, , glycerol, and valine, varied in a time-dependent manner in diabetic rats. These results suggest that serum metabolites related to glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, , fatty acid β-oxidation, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and the tyrosine metabolic pathways are involved in the evolution of diabetes. The metabolic changes represent potential features and promote a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development of diabetes mellitus. This work further suggests that (1)H NMR metabonomics is a valuable approach for providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16236157>Hormonal regulation of  in cereal aleurone is strongly cultivar-dependent and gibberellin action involves SLENDER1 but not GAMYB.</a></h2><p>Storage oil is a major constituent in the cereal aleurone layer. The aim of this study was to investigate how gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulate conversion of oil to sugar in barley aleurone. The activity of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase (ICL) was surveyed in eight barley cultivars. Surprisingly, some cultivars do not require GA for the induction of ICL (e.g. Himalaya), whereas some do (e.g. Golden Promise). Furthermore, in Golden Promise, GA also stimulates triacylglycerol breakdown and enhances the net flux of carbon from  to sugar. In contrast, ABA strongly represses ICL activity and the flux of carbon from oil to sugar in both Golden Promise and Himalaya. Biolistics using a promoter reporter showed that GA and ABA regulate ICL at the level of transcription. Studies using barley and rice mutants and pharmacological agents show that GA-dependent induction of ICL activity is mediated by SLENDER1 and requires cGMP, but does not involve the transcription factor GAMYB. Gibberellin and ABA therefore act antagonistically to regulate  in the aleurone layer as well as controlling the production and secretion of hydrolases into the starchy endosperm. We suggest that the variation between different barley cultivars might be a result of selective breeding to alter seed dormancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22691627>Comparative proteomic analysis of transition of saccharomyces cerevisiae from glucose-deficient medium to glucose-rich medium.</a></h2><p>When glucose is added to Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in non-fermentable carbon sources, genes encoding ribosomal, cell-cycle, and glycolytic proteins are induced. By contrast, genes involved in mitochondrial functions, , and the utilization of other carbon sources are repressed. Glucose also causes the activation of the plasma membrane ATPase and the inactivation of gluconeogenic enzymes and mitochondrial enzymes. The goals of this study were to use the iTRAQ-labeling mass spectrometry technique to identify proteins whose relative levels change in response to glucose re-feeding and to correlate changes in protein abundance with changes in transcription and enzymatic activities. We used an experimental condition that causes the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes when glucose starved cells are replenished with glucose. Identification of these enzymes as being down-regulated by glucose served as an internal control. Furthermore, we sought to identify new proteins that were either up-regulated or down-regulated by glucose.We have identified new and known proteins that change their relative levels in cells that were transferred from medium containing low glucose to medium containing high glucose. Up-regulated proteins included ribosomal subunits, proteins involved in protein translation, and the plasma membrane ATPase. Down-regulated proteins included small heat shock proteins, mitochondrial proteins, glycolytic enzymes, and gluconeogenic enzymes. Ach1p is involved in  metabolism and is also down-regulated by glucose.We have identified known proteins that have previously been reported to be regulated by glucose as well as new glucose-regulated proteins. Up-regulation of ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in translation may lead to an increase in protein synthesis and in nutrient uptake. Down-regulation of glycolytic enzymes, gluconeogenic enzymes, and mitochondrial proteins may result in changes in glycolysis, , and mitochondrial functions. These changes may be beneficial for glucose-starved cells to adapt to the addition of glucose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170979>Storage lipids as a source of carbon skeletons for asparagine synthesis in germinating seeds of yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus L.).</a></h2><p>The (14)C- metabolism and regulatory functions of sucrose and sodium fluoride (NaF) were examined in embryo axes and cotyledons isolated from yellow lupine seeds and grown in vitro. After 15 min of incubating organs in solutions of labeled , more radioactivity was found in amino acids (particularly in glutamate, asparagine and glutamine) than in sugars. After 120 min of incubation, (14)C was still localized mainly in amino acids (particularly in asparagine and glutamate). The (14)C atoms from position C-1 of  were mostly localized in the liberated (14)CO(2), whereas those from position C-2 were incorporated chiefly into amino acids, sugars and the insoluble fraction of the studied organs. The addition of NaF caused a decrease in the amount of (14)C incorporated into amino acids and in the insoluble fraction. The influence of NaF on incorporation of (14)C into sugars differed between organs. In embryo axes, NaF inhibited this process, but in cotyledons it stimulated (14)C incorporation into glucose. The release of (14)CO(2) with the C-1 and C-2 carbon atoms from  was more intensive in embryo axes and cotyledons grown on a medium without sucrose. This process was markedly limited by NaF, which inhibits glycolysis and . Alternative pathways of carbon flow from fatty acids to asparagine are discussed.Copyright 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Among the substrates metabolized are glucose and  which both can also serve as substrates for amino acid production. Based on biochemical, genetic and regulatory studies and on quantitative determination of metabolic fluxes during utilization of  and/or glucose, this review summarizes the present knowledge on the different steps of the fundamental pathways of  utilization in C. glutamicum, namely, on  transport,  activation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glyoxylate cycle and . It becomes evident that, although the pathways of  utilization follow the same theme in many bacteria, important biochemical, genetic and regulatory peculiarities exist in C. glutamicum. Recent genome wide and comparative expression analyses in C. glutamicum cells grown on glucose and on  substantiated previously identified transcriptional regulation of  activating enzymes and of glyoxylate cycle enzymes. Additionally, a variety of genes obviously also under transcriptional control in response to the presence or absence of  in the growth medium were uncovered. These genes, thus also belonging to the  stimulon of C. glutamicum, include genes coding for TCA cycle enzymes (e.g. aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase), for  (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), for glycolysis (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1) and genes coding for proteins with hitherto unknown function.

The growth on ethanol or  was largely restored by the addition of low concentrations of aspartate, glutamate, fumarate, citrate, oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate and glucose, but not of succinate, leucine and lysine. The expression of the DIC gene in wild-type yeast was repressed in media containing ethanol or  with or without glycerol.

(13)C nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C-NMR) was used to elucidate the metabolic pathways operating in an enriched GAO culture dominated by two known GAOs (81.2%). The experiments consisted of adding (13)C- (labelled on position 1 or 2) to the culture under anaerobic conditions, and operating the culture through a cycle consisting of an anaerobic, an aerobic and a further anaerobic phase. The carbon transformations over the cycle were monitored using in vivo(13)C-NMR.

Comparison of the labelling patterns in hydroxyvalerate at the end of the first and the second anaerobic periods in pulse experiments with 2-(13)C- showed that the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway was used for the breakdown of glycogen. This conclusion was further supported by the labelling pattern on glycogen observed in the pulse experiments with 1-(13)C-, which can only be explained by the operation of ED with recycling of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via .

RCB15 is a benzimidazole derivative that may be used against such diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of RCB15 on the alternative energetic pathways of Taenia crassiceps cysticerci. The cysticerci were in vitro exposed to albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO) or RCB15 at different concentrations during 24h. The cysticerci extract and the culture medium were analyzed through spectrophotometry and high performance liquid chromatography as to detect glucose, urea, creatinine and organic acids of the energetic metabolism. The drugs did not influence the protein catabolism. Fatty acids oxidation was enhanced through significantly higher  concentrations in the groups treated with RCB15 and ABZSO. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were decreased which indicates the use of fatty acids towards acetyl-CoA synthesis. There was a decrease in glucose uptake and pyruvate concentrations. The absence of lactate indicates the use of pyruvate in . Therefore it is possible to conclude that RCB15 enhanced the alternative energetic pathways of cysticerci in vitro exposed to different concentration, with emphasis on the fatty acids catabolism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we have examined genetic alterations resulting in glycogen overproduction as a possible means to direct the flux of carbon away from the  pool. Glycogen overaccumulation was achieved either by using a regulatory glgQ mutation or by transforming cells with a plasmid containing the glycogen biosynthesis genes glgC (encoding ADPG pyrophosphorylase) and glgA (encoding glycogen synthase) under their native promoter. Both strategies resulted in an approximately five-fold increase in glycogen levels but had no significant effect on  excretion. The glgC and glgA genes were then placed under the control of the isopropyl---D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible tac promoter, and this construct was used to stimulate glycogen production in a mutant defective in  biosynthesis due to deletion of the ack ( kinase) and pta (phosphotransacetylase) genes. If glycogen overproduction in the ack pta strain was induced during the late log phase, biomass production increased by 15 to 20% relative to uninduced controls. Glycogen overaccumulation had a significant influence on carbon partitioning: The output of carbon dioxide peaked earlier than in the control strain, and the levels of an unusual fermentation byproduct, pyruvate, were reduced. Exogenous pyruvate was metabolized more rapidly, suggesting higher activity of  or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle as a result of glycogen overproduction. Potential mechanisms of the observed metabolic alterations are discussed. Our results suggest that ack pta mutants over producing glycogen may be a suitable starting point for constructing E. coli strains with improved characteristics in high-cell-density fermentations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30966272>Biosynthetic Pathway and Genes of Chitin/Chitosan-Like Bioflocculant in the Genus Citrobacter.</a></h2><p>Chitin/chitosan, one of the most abundant polysaccharides in nature, is industrially produced as a powder or flake form from the exoskeletons of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps. Intriguingly, many bacterial strains in the genus  secrete a soluble chitin/chitosan-like polysaccharide into the culture medium during growth in . Because this polysaccharide shows strong flocculation activity for suspended solids in water, it can be used as a bioflocculant (BF). The BF synthetic pathway of  IFO 13545 is expected from known bacterial metabolic pathways to be as follows:  is metabolized in the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt via acetyl-CoA. Next, fructose 6-phosphate is generated from the intermediates of the TCA cycle through  and enters into the hexosamine synthetic pathway to form UDP--acetylglucosamine, which is used as a direct precursor to extend the BF polysaccharide chain. We conducted the draft genome sequencing of IFO 13545 and identified all of the candidate genes corresponding to the enzymes in this pathway in the 5420-kb genome sequence. Disruption of the genes encoding acetyl-CoA synthetase and isocitrate lyase by homologous recombination resulted in little or no growth on , indicating that the cell growth depends on  assimilation via the glyoxylate shunt. Disruption of the gene encoding glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase, a key enzyme for the hexosamine synthetic pathway, caused a significant decrease in flocculation activity, demonstrating that this pathway is primarily used for the BF biosynthesis. A gene cluster necessary for the polymerization and secretion of BF, named , was also identified for the first time. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of several key genes in the expected pathway was conducted to know their expression in  assimilation and BF biosynthesis.

For structural analysis, proteins are frequently isotopically labeled with deuterium (2H), 13C, or 15N by growing E. coli cultures in a medium containing the appropriate isotope. When large quantities of fully deuterated proteins are required, E. coli is often grown in minimal media with deuterated succinate or  as the carbon source because these are less expensive. Despite the widespread use of BL21, we found no data on the effect of different minimal media and carbon sources on BL21 growth. In this study, we assessed the growth behavior of E. coli BL21 in minimal media with different gluconeogenic carbon sources. Though BL21 grew reasonably well on glycerol and pyruvate, it had a prolonged lag-phase on succinate (20 h),  (10 h), and fumarate (20 h), attributed to the physiological adaptation of E. coli cells. Wild-type strain NCM3722 (K12) grew well on all the substrates. We also examined the growth of E. coli BL21 in minimal media that differed in their salt composition but not in their source of carbon. The commonly used M9 medium did not support the optimum growth of E. coli BL21 in minimal medium. The addition of ferrous sulphate to M9 medium (otherwise lacking it) increased the growth rate of E. coli cultures and significantly increased their cell density in the stationary phase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29729383>Ameliorative potential of Lavandula stoechas in metabolic syndrome via multitarget interactions.</a></h2><p>Decoction and infusion prepared from aerial parts of Lavandula stoechas L.

The anti-insulin resistance effects of BE and EE were evaluated on palmitate induced insulin resistance model of H4IIE, C2C12 and 3T3L1 cells by using several metabolic parameters. Specifically, whole genome transcriptome analysis was performed by using microarray over 55.000 genes in control, insulin resistant and EE (25 µg/mL) treated insulin resistant H4IIE cells. Anti-inflammatory effects of both extracts were analyzed in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.Both EE and BE at low doses (25-50 µg/mL) significantly decreased hepatic  in H4IIE cell line by suppressing the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase. In C2C12 myotubes, both extracts increased the insulin stimulated glucose uptake more effectively than metformin. Both extracts decreased the isoproterenol induced lipolysis in 3T3L1 cell line. Moreover, they also effectively increased the expression of lipoprotein lipase protein level in insulin resistant myotubes at low doses. EE increased the protein level of PPARγ and stimulated the activation AKT in insulin resistant H4IIE and C2C12 cell lines. The results obtained from biochemical assays, mRNA/protein studies and whole genome transcriptome analyses were found to be complementary and provided support for the hypothesis that EE might be biologically active against insulin resistance and act through the inhibition of liver  and AKT activation. Besides, LPS induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages was mainly inhibited by EE through suppression of iNOS/NO signaling, IL1β and COX-2 genes. HPLC-TOF/MS analysis of EE of L. stoechas mainly resulted in caffeic acid, apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid and its methyl ester, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, ferrulic acid and salicylic acid.Data suggest that EE of L. stoechas contains phytochemicals that can be effective in the treatment/prevention of insulin resistance and inflammation.

Alterations of glucose metabolism imposed by the deletion of the TPI1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied in batch and continuous cultures. The Deltatpi1 null mutant was unable to grow on glucose as the sole carbon source. The addition of ethanol or  in media containing glucose, but also raffinose or galactose, relieved this effect in batch cultivation, suggesting that the Crabtree effect is not the primary cause for the mutant's impaired growth on glucose. The addition of an energy source like formic acid restored glucose utilization, suggesting that a NADH/energy shortage in the Deltatpi1 mutant could be a cause of the impaired growth on glucose. The amount of glycerol production in the Deltatpi1 mutant could represent a good indicator of the fraction of carbon source channelled through glycolysis. Data obtained in continuous cultures on mixed substrates indicated that different contributions of glycolysis and , as well as of the HMP pathway, to glucose utilization by the Deltatpi1 mutant may occur in relation to the fraction of ethanol present in the media.Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9142695>Peroxisomes in adrenal steroidogenesis.</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes, cytoplasmic organelles limited by a single membrane and with a matrix of moderate electron density, are present in a great number of cells, namely in adrenal cortex and other steroid-secreting organs. Presently peroxisomes are considered to be involved in important metabolic processes. They intervene in: (1) the production and degradation of H2O2; (2) biosynthesis of ether-phospholipids, cholesterol, dolichol, and bile acids; (3) oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, purines, polyamines, and prostaglandins; (4) catabolism of pipecolic, phythanic and glyoxylic acids; and (5) . Recent studies demonstrated that the experimental alterations in the normal steroidogenesis, produce significant morphological and biochemical changes in peroxisomes. Besides this, the presence of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (the key enzyme in the de novo cholesterol synthesis from ) and of sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2), which is involved in the cholesterol metabolism and steroid metabolic pathways, are located in peroxisomes of steroid-secreting cells. In addition, patients with peroxisome diseases present deficiency in steroidogenesis, as well as reduced levels of SCP2. These data pointed out the important role of peroxisomes in steroid biosynthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19137713>[C2 metabolism and intensification of the synthesis of surface-active substances in Rhodococcus erythropolis EK-1 grown on ethanol].</a></h2><p>Oxidation of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and  in Rhodococcus erythropolis EK-1, producer of surface-active substances (SAS), is catalyzed by N,N-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline (DMNA)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, NAD+/NADP(+)-dependent dehydrogenases (optimum pH 9.5), and  kinase/acetyl-CoA-synthetase, respectively.

Glucose and 3-OMG were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and separated on a YMC-Triart C18 column, with a gradient mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and 20 mm ammonium  solution containing 0.09% tri-ethylamine at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The eluate were detected using a UV detector at 250 nm. The assay was linear over the range 0.39-25 μm (R(2) = 0.9997, n = 5) and the lower limit of quantitation was 0.39 μm (0.070 mg/mL). Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were <15% and within ±3%, respectively. After validation, the HPLC method was applied to investigate the  in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) cultured HepG2 cells. Glucose concentration was determined to be about 1-2.5 μm in this  assay. In conclusion, this method has been shown to determine small amounts of glucose in DMEM successfully, with lower limit of quantitation and better sensitivity when compared with common commercial glucose assay kits.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713380>Meta-proteomic analysis of protein expression distinctive to electricity-generating biofilm communities in air-cathode microbial fuel cells.</a></h2><p>Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) harness electrons from microbial respiration to generate power or chemical products from a variety of organic feedstocks, including lignocellulosic biomass, fermentation byproducts, and wastewater sludge. In some BESs, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), bacteria living in a biofilm use the anode as an electron acceptor for electrons harvested from organic materials such as lignocellulosic biomass or waste byproducts, generating energy that may be used by humans. Many BES applications use bacterial biofilm communities, but no studies have investigated protein expression by the anode biofilm community as a whole.To discover functional protein expression during current generation that may be useful for MFC optimization, a label-free meta-proteomics approach was used to compare protein expression in -fed anode biofilms before and after the onset of robust electricity generation. Meta-proteomic comparisons were integrated with 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis at four developmental stages. The community composition shifted from dominance by aerobic  (90.9 ± 3.3%) during initial biofilm formation to dominance by , particularly  (68.7 ± 3.6%) in mature, electricity-generating anodes. Community diversity in the intermediate stage, just after robust current generation began, was double that at the early stage and nearly double that of mature anode communities. Maximum current densities at the intermediate stage, however, were relatively similar (~ 83%) to those achieved by mature-stage biofilms. Meta-proteomic analysis, correlated with population changes, revealed significant enrichment of categories specific to membrane and transport functions among proteins from electricity-producing biofilms. Proteins detected only in electricity-producing biofilms were associated with , the glyoxylate cycle, and fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as with denitrification and competitive inhibition.The results demonstrate that it is possible for an MFC microbial community to generate robust current densities while exhibiting high taxonomic diversity. Moreover, these data provide evidence to suggest that startup growth of air-cathode MFCs under conditions that promote the establishment of aerobic-anaerobic syntrophy may decrease startup times. This study represents the first investigation into protein expression of a complex BES anode biofilm community as a whole. The findings contribute to understanding of the molecular mechanisms at work during BES startup and suggest options for improvement of BES generation of bioelectricity from renewable biomass.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18227254>Carnitine acetyltransferases are required for growth on non-fermentable carbon sources but not for pathogenesis in Candida albicans.</a></h2><p>Carbon starvation is a significant stress encountered by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and mutations in several pathways required to assimilate non-fermentable carbon sources attenuate virulence. These pathways -- beta-oxidation, the glyoxylate cycle and  -- are compartmentalized in the fungal cell between the peroxisome, mitochondria and cytosol; thus, the cell must transport key intermediates between these organelles. Transport of acetyl-CoA, a particularly important intermediate of carbon metabolism, is catalysed by membrane-associated carnitine acetyltransferases (CATs). We report here the characterization of the three predicted CAT genes in C. albicans, CTN1, CTN2 and CTN3. Strains lacking CTN1 or CTN2 were unable to grow on ethanol or  as sole carbon source; additionally, citrate was utilized poorly (Deltactn2) or not at all (Deltactn1) and the Deltactn2 mutant failed to grow on fatty acids as well. In contrast, deletion of CTN3 had no observable phenotype. All three genes were upregulated in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources and after macrophage phagocytosis. CTN1 and CTN3 were able to complement the corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae Deltayat1 and Deltayat2 mutants. However, these mutants had no obvious attenuation in virulence in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis, in contrast to other carbon metabolism mutants. These findings extend our understanding of nutrient stress in vivo and in vitro and the contribution of metabolic pathways to virulence in C. albicans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25203112>The short-chain fatty acid uptake fluxes by mice on a guar gum supplemented diet associate with amelioration of major biomarkers of the metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Studies with dietary supplementation of various types of fibers have shown beneficial effects on symptoms of the metabolic syndrome. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main products of intestinal bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber, have been suggested to play a key role. Whether the concentration of SCFAs or their metabolism drives these beneficial effects is not yet clear. In this study we investigated the SCFA concentrations and in vivo host uptake fluxes in the absence or presence of the dietary fiber guar gum. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 0%, 5%, 7.5% or 10% of the fiber guar gum. To determine the effect on SCFA metabolism, 13C-labeled , propionate or butyrate were infused into the cecum of mice for 6 h and the isotopic enrichment of cecal SCFAs was measured. The in vivo production, uptake and bacterial interconversion of , propionate and butyrate were calculated by combining the data from the three infusion experiments in a single steady-state isotope model. Guar gum treatment decreased markers of the metabolic syndrome (body weight, adipose weight, triglycerides, glucose and insulin levels and HOMA-IR) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, hepatic mRNA expression of genes involved in  and fatty acid synthesis decreased dose-dependently by guar gum treatment. Cecal SCFA concentrations were increased compared to the control group, but no differences were observed between the different guar gum doses. Thus, no significant correlation was found between cecal SCFA concentrations and metabolic markers. In contrast, in vivo SCFA uptake fluxes by the host correlated linearly with metabolic markers. We argue that in vivo SCFA fluxes, and not concentrations, govern the protection from the metabolic syndrome by dietary fibers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26762505>Analysis of neuron-astrocyte metabolic cooperation in the brain of db/db mice with cognitive decline using 13C NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes has been linked to cognitive impairment, but its potential metabolic mechanism is still unclear. The present study aimed to explore neuron-astrocyte metabolic cooperation in the brain of diabetic (db/db, BKS.Cg-m Leprdb/J) mice with cognitive decline using C NMR technique in combination with intravenous [2-C]- and [3-C]-lactate infusions. We found that the C-enrichment from [2-C]- into tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, succinate, was significantly decreased in db/db mice with cognitive decline compared with wild-type (WT, C57BLKS/J) mice, while an opposite result was obtained after [3-C]-lactate infusion. Relative to WT mice, db/db mice with cognitive decline had significantly lower C labeling percentages in neurotransmitters including glutamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid after [2-C]- infusion. However, [3-C]-lactate resulted in increased C-enrichments in neurotransmitters in db/db mice with cognitive decline. This may indicate that the disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolism occurred during the development of cognitive decline. In addition, a reduction in C-labeling of lactate and an increase in gluconeogenesis were found from both labeled infusions in db/db mice with cognitive decline. Therefore, our results suggest that the development of cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes may be implicated to an unbalanced metabolism in neuron-astrocyte cooperation and an enhancement of gluconeogenesis.© The Author(s) 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9894915>The succinate/fumarate transporter Acr1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is part of the gluconeogenic pathway and its expression is regulated by Cat8p.</a></h2><p>The product of the ACR1 gene is essential for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on ethanol or  as sole carbon source, and its expression is subject to glucose repression. It was previously shown that Acr1p is a membrane protein which specifically transports succinate and fumarate. Its suggested function is to shuttle cytosolic succinate from the glyoxylate cycle into the mitochondria in exchange for fumarate, an activity that is essential during gluconeogenic growth on C2 compounds. In this study we show that ACR1 is coregulated with the genes coding for the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and : ICL1, MLS1 and PCK1, FBP1 respectively. We demonstrate that derepression of ACR1 is strictly dependent on the Zn2Cys6-type transcriptional activator Cat8p. A detailed deletion analysis of the ACR1 promoter revealed that 69% of the derepression of ACR1 is mediated by three cis-acting elements, located between positions -679 and -569 relative to the translational start, which show a high degree of similarity to the UAS/CSRE elements of PCK1, FBP1, ICL1 and MLS1.

The distribution of  metabolic enzymes among several cellular compartments, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and cytoplasm makes it an intriguing system to study complex metabolic interactions. To investigate the complex process of carbon catabolism and assimilation, mutants unable to grow on  were isolated. One hundred five Acn- (" Nonutilizing") mutants were sorted into 21 complementation groups with an additional 20 single mutants. Five of the groups have defects in TCA cycle enzymes: MDH1, CIT1, ACO1, IDH1, and IDH2. A defect in RTG2, involved in the retrograde communication between the mitochondrion and the nucleus, was also identified. Four genes encode enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and : ICL1, MLS1, MDH2, and PCK1. Five other genes appear to be defective in regulating metabolic activity since elevated levels of enzymes in several metabolic pathways, including the glyoxylate cycle, , and acetyl-CoA metabolism, were detected in these mutants: ACN8, ACN9, ACN17, ACN18, and ACN42. In summary, this analysis has identified at least 22 and as many as 41 different genes involved in  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8482430>Limitations in the use of [2-14C] for measuring  in vivo.</a></h2><p>This study was undertaken to test two assumptions critical for use of [2-14C] to measure  in vivo. For the assumption that incorporation into glucose of products of [14C] metabolism does not affect the distribution of label within the glucose molecule, we infused [2-14C] in 17 healthy subjects and [3-14C]lactate in 10 healthy subjects and compared the ratio of the resultant specific activities of plasma glucose carbons 1, 2, 5, 6, and 3, 4 obtained with each tracer. The ratio obtained with [2-14C] (2.99 +/- 0.07) was significantly different from the ratio obtained with [3-14C]lactate, (3.82 +/- 0.2, P < 0.01). Because the model predicts that these ratios should be identical, these results indicate that either the model is incorrect or that metabolism of [14C] to other compounds affects the distribution of the label within the glucose molecule. To test the assumption that plasma 3-OH-butyrate specific activity approximates the specific activity of hepatic intramitochondrial acetyl CoA, we compared the ratio of specific activities of plasma glucose and 3-OH-butyrate obtained in 7 healthy subjects infused with [2-14C] and [2-14C]octanoate. The ratio obtained with [2-14C] (0.18 +/- 0.03) was significantly different from that obtained with [2-14C]octanoate, (0.10 +/- 0.02), P < 0.001. These results suggest compartmentalization of acetyl CoA within liver mitochondria and indicate that plasma 3-OH-butyrate specific activity may not necessarily approximate intramitochondrial acetyl CoA specific activity during [2-14C] infusion. We conclude that assumptions critical for use of [2-14C] to measure  in vivo are not valid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8135858>Stimulatory effect of ethanol on weak organic acid uptake in rat renal tubules.</a></h2><p>Ethanol at relatively low concentrations (10-40 mM) significantly stimulated the uphill uptake of a weak organic acid, fluorescein, in the superficial proximal tubules of rat renal cortex slices, but it did not affect the rate of glucose production from lactate or pyruvate in rat renal cortex fragment suspension. In a low Na+ medium, ethanol failed to stimulate fluorescein uptake, although under the conditions employed in the present study, the baseline weak organic acid uptake was not dependent on external Na+. The stimulation of fluorescein uptake by ethanol (20 mM) was abolished by an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1), pyrazole (1 mM), or an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3), cyanamide (0.3 mM), suggesting that oxidation of ethanol mediated its effect on the uptake. Among  inhibitors tested, only D-malate (2 mM) abolished the stimulatory effect of ethanol, while the rest either did not affect (quinolinate) or even slightly augmented (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and phenylpyruvate) it.

Innovative culturing approaches, environmental genome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing have provided new opportunities for the biotechnological exploration of extremophiles. The whole genome sequencing of H. orenii has provided valuable insights not only into the survival and adaptation strategies of thermohalophiles but has also led to the identification of genes encoding biotechnologically relevant enzymes. The present review focuses on the purified and characterized enzymes from H. orenii including amylases, β-glucosidase, fructokinase, and ribokinase--along with uncharacterized but industrially important enzymes encoded by the genes identified in the genome such as β-galactosidases, mannosidases, pullulanases, chitinases, α-L-arabinofuranosidases and other glycosyl hydrolases of commercial interest. This review highlights the importance of the enzymes and their applications in different sectors and why future research for exploring the enzymatic machinery of H. orenii should focus on the expression, purification, and characterization of the novel proteins in H. orenii and their feasible application to pertinent industrial sectors.

Ethanol was infused into the hepatic artery in antegrade and retrograde perfusion. Inhibition of glycolysis by ethanol, expressed as micromol min(-1) (ml accessible cell space)(-1), was more pronounced in the retrograde mode; the retrograde/antegrade ratio was equal to 1.63 for an ethanol infusion rate of 37.5 micromol min(-1) g(-1). Stimulation of oxygen uptake by ethanol was more pronounced in the retrograde mode; the retrograde/antegrade ratio was equal to 1.77. Diminution of the citrate cycle caused by ethanol was more pronounced in the retrograde mode; the retrograde/antegrade ratio was equal to 1.46. Transformation of arterially infused ethanol into  was more pronounced in retrograde perfusion; the retrograde/antegrade ratio was equal to 1.63. The increments in glucose release (glycogenolysis) caused by ethanol in the antegrade and retrograde modes were similar. It was assumed that the changes caused by arterially infused ethanol in retrograde and antegrade perfusion closely reflect a significant part of the periportal parenchyma and an average over the whole liver parenchyma, respectively. Under such assumptions it can be concluded that, in the perfused liver from fed rats, four related parameters predominate in the periportal region: ethanol oxidation, glycolysis inhibition, oxygen uptake stimulation and citrate cycle inhibition. One of the main causes for this predominance could be the malate/aspartate shuttle, which operates more rapidly in the periportal area and is essential for NADH oxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21569248>Crystal structures of a halophilic archaeal malate synthase from Haloferax volcanii and comparisons with isoforms A and G.</a></h2><p>Malate synthase, one of the two enzymes unique to the glyoxylate cycle, is found in all three domains of life, and is crucial to the utilization of two-carbon compounds for net biosynthetic pathways such as . In addition to the main isoforms A and G, so named because of their differential expression in E. coli grown on either  or glycolate respectively, a third distinct isoform has been identified. These three isoforms differ considerably in size and sequence conservation. The A isoform (MSA) comprises ~530 residues, the G isoform (MSG) is ~730 residues, and this third isoform (MSH-halophilic) is ~430 residues in length. Both isoforms A and G have been structurally characterized in detail, but no structures have been reported for the H isoform which has been found thus far only in members of the halophilic Archaea.We have solved the structure of a malate synthase H (MSH) isoform member from Haloferax volcanii in complex with glyoxylate at 2.51 Å resolution, and also as a ternary complex with acetyl-coenzyme A and pyruvate at 1.95 Å. Like the A and G isoforms, MSH is based on a β8/α8 (TIM) barrel. Unlike previously solved malate synthase structures which are all monomeric, this enzyme is found in the native state as a trimer/hexamer equilibrium. Compared to isoforms A and G, MSH displays deletion of an N-terminal domain and a smaller deletion at the C-terminus. The MSH active site is closely superimposable with those of MSA and MSG, with the ternary complex indicating a nucleophilic attack on pyruvate by the enolate intermediate of acetyl-coenzyme A.The reported structures of MSH from Haloferax volcanii allow a detailed analysis and comparison with previously solved structures of isoforms A and G. These structural comparisons provide insight into evolutionary relationships among these isoforms, and also indicate that despite the size and sequence variation, and the truncated C-terminal domain of the H isoform, the catalytic mechanism is conserved.

By performing genomic analysis, it was demonstrated that the cause of this difference in sensitivity to the glucose concentration is the result of the differences in the central carbon metabolism activity. We hypothesized that the global transcription regulator Cra (FruR) is constitutively expressed in E. coli B and may be responsible for the different behaviour of the two strains. To investigate this possibility and better understand the function of Cra in the two strains, cra - negative E. coli B (BL21) and E. coli K-12 (JM109) were prepared and their growth behaviour and gene expression at high glucose were evaluated using microarray and real-time PCR.The deletion of the cra gene in E. coli B (BL21) minimally affected the growth and maximal  accumulation, while the deletion of the same gene in E.coli K-12 (JM109) caused the cells to stop growing as soon as  concentration reached 6.6 g/L and the media conductivity reached 21 mS/cm. ppsA ( gene), aceBA (the glyoxylate shunt genes) and poxB (the  producing gene) were down-regulated in both strains, while acs ( uptake gene) was down-regulated only in E.coli B (BL21). These transcriptional differences had little effect on  and pyruvate production. Additionally, it was found that the lower growth of E. coli K-12 (JM109) strain was the result of transcription inhibition of the osmoprotectant producing bet operon (betABT).The transcriptional changes caused by the deletion of cra gene did not affect the activity of the central carbon metabolism, suggesting that Cra does not act alone; rather it interacts with other pleiotropic regulators to create a network of metabolic effects. An unexpected outcome of this work is the finding that cra deletion caused transcription inhibition of the bet operon in E. coli K-12 (JM109) but did not affect this operon transcription in E. coli B (BL21). This property, together with the insensitivity to high glucose concentrations, makes this the E. coli B (BL21) strain more resistant to environmental changes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20620178>RamA and RamB are global transcriptional regulators in Corynebacterium glutamicum and control genes for enzymes of the central metabolism.</a></h2><p>In Corynebacterium glutamicum, the transcriptional regulators of  metabolism RamA (encoded by cg2831) and RamB (encoded by cg0444) play an important role in expression control of genes involved in  and ethanol metabolism.

Recent work suggests that temporal patterns of fuel absorption, mobilization, and metabolism affect feed intake in ruminants by altering meal size and frequency. Research with nonruminants suggests that meals can be terminated by signals carried from the liver to the brain via afferents in the vagus nerve and that these signals are affected by hepatic oxidation of fuels and generation of ATP. We find these results consistent with the effects of diet on feed intake of ruminants. Of fuels metabolized by the ruminant liver, propionate is likely a primary satiety signal because its flux to the liver increases greatly during meals. Propionate is utilized for  or oxidized in the liver and stimulates oxidation of acetyl CoA. Although propionate is extensively metabolized by the ruminant liver, there is little net metabolism of  or glucose, which may explain why these fuels do not consistently induce hypophagia in ruminants. Lactate is metabolized in the liver but has less effect on satiety, probably because of greater latency for reaching the liver within meals and because of less hepatic extraction compared with propionate. Hypophagic effects of fatty acid oxidation in the liver are likely from delaying hunger rather than promoting satiety because beta-oxidation is inhibited during meals by propionate. A shortage of glucose precursors and increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver for early lactation cows lead to a lack of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, resulting in a buildup of the intracellular acetyl-CoA pool and export of ketone bodies. In this situation, hypophagic effects of propionate are likely enhanced because propionate entry into the liver provides TCA cycle intermediates that allow oxidation of acetyl-CoA. Oxidizing the pool of acetyl-CoA rather than exporting it increases ATP production and likely causes satiety despite the use of propionate for glucose synthesis.

Glucose infusion completely suppressed endogeneous glucose production and increased net carbohydrate oxidation from 10.9 +/- 1.6 to 18.9 +/- 1.0 mumol/kg/min. To differentiate between the oxidation of endogenous (i.e. glycogen) and of exogenous carbohydrates, the 13CO2 production was measured and the oxidation of exogenous 13C labelled carbohydrate was calculated. For this purpose, the specific recovery factor in breath of 13CO2 issued from oxidation of uniformly labelled glucose was determined during infusions of equimolar amounts of 13C bicarbonate, 1-13C  and 2-13C . The average recovery was 53.9 +/- 1.5%. The oxidation of exogenous carbohydrate was 20.9 +/- 0.7 mumol/kg/min. This value was slightly higher than net carbohydrate oxidation, indicating that no oxidation of endogenous, unlabelled carbohydrate, and, hence, no utilization of hepatic glycogen took place. These results indicate that (i) estimation of glucose oxidation from indirect calorimetry and tracer technology give concordant results when an appropriate factor of 13CO2 recovery in breath is used, and (ii) utilization of previously formed glycogen is inhibited during hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27474708>Use of a Bacterial Luciferase Monitoring System To Estimate Real-Time Dynamics of Intracellular Metabolism in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Regulation of central carbon metabolism has long been an important research subject in every organism. While the dynamics of metabolic flows during changes in available carbon sources have been estimated based on changes in metabolism-related gene expression, as well as on changes in the metabolome, the flux change itself has scarcely been measured because of technical difficulty, which has made conclusions elusive in many cases. Here, we used a monitoring system employing Vibrio fischeri luciferase to probe the intracellular metabolic condition in Escherichia coli Using a batch culture provided with a limited amount of glucose, we performed a time course analysis, where the predominant carbon source shifts from glucose to , and identified a series of sequential peaks in the luciferase activity (peaks 1 to 4). Two major peaks, peaks 1 and 3, were considered to correspond to the glucose and  consuming phases, respectively, based on the glucose, , and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the medium. The pattern of these peaks was changed by the addition of a different carbon source or by an increasing concentration of glucose, which was consistent with the present model. Genetically, mutations involved in  or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle/gluconeogenesis specifically affected peak 1 or peak 3, respectively, as expected from the corresponding metabolic phase. Intriguingly, mutants for the  excretion pathway showed a phenotype of extended peak 2 and delayed transition to the TCA cycle/gluconeogenesis phase, which suggests that peak 2 represents the metabolic transition phase. These results indicate that the bacterial luciferase monitoring system is useful to understand the real-time dynamics of metabolism in living bacterial cells.Intracellular metabolic flows dynamically change during shifts in available carbon sources.

The rates of VFA production increased over extended incubations (24 h), and hops extract caused an increase in the propionate to  ratio. Hops extract inhibited the growth and metabolism of Streptococcus bovis, but Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii were not affected. Likewise, the propionate production of M. elsdenii/S. bovis co-cultures, but not M. elsdenii/S. ruminantium co-cultures, was decreased in the presence of hops extract.These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hops inhibit Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria (S. bovis), and the rumen microbial community requires a period of adaptation before normal VFA production resumes. Selenomonas bovis and S. ruminantium both produce lactate, which is the substrate for propionate production by M. elsdenii. However, S. ruminantium has an outer membrane, while S. bovis does not.The enhanced production of the  precursor, propionic acid, provides further evidence that plant secondary metabolites from hops could be used to improve rumen fermentation.Journal compilation © 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

Willd flowers. In vitro alpha amylase inhibition study was carried out on 50% ethanol extract of flowers (PAFEE) and its various fractions. The active ethyl  fraction (PAFEF) was subfractionated into three subfractions (PAFE1, PAFE2, and PAFE3) and subjected to acute toxicity studies followed by antidiabetic screening in vivo by streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced type II diabetes. Diabetic animals treated with PAFE2 (30 mg/kg) reduced the levels of fasting blood glucose, significantly (P<0.001) compared to that of diabetic control animals. Histological studies on drug treated groups did not show remarkable positive changes in β-cells. PAFE2 showed 32.6±1.93% glucose uptake over control and, in the presence of PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, declined to 13.7±2.51%.

In such conditions of cultivation of bacteria on the mix of ethanol (0.75% in volume) and molasses (0.75 wt. % as to carbohydrates) the amount of synthesized EPS reached 10 g/l, EPS-synthesizing capacity--5 g of EPS/g of biomass, the EPS yield from substrate--74% that is 1.3-1.5 times more than in cultivation on molasses.

Depletion of the environmental carbon source during sporulation results in modification of only one SPB from each meiosis II spindle and formation of a two-spored ascus, called a nonsister dyad (NSD). We have found that mutants impaired in the glyoxylate pathway, which is required for the conversion of  to glucose, make NSDs when  is the primary carbon source. Wild-type cells make NSDs when the carbon source is glycerol, which is converted to glucose independently of the glyoxylate pathway. During NSD formation in glycerol, only the two SPBs created at the meiosis I/II transition ("daughters") are modified. In these conditions, the SPB components Mpc70p and Spo74p are not recruited to mother SPBs. Moreover, cooverexpression of Mpc70p and Spo74p suppresses NSD formation in glycerol. Our findings indicate that flux through the glyoxylate pathway during sporulation regulates modification of mother SPBs via recruitment of Mpc70p and Spo74p. These results define a cellular response in which the accumulation of an intermediary metabolite serves as a measure of biosynthetic capacity to regulate the number of daughter cells formed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8280805>Effects of xylitol on carbohydrate and protein metabolism after trauma and during sepsis.</a></h2><p>Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) after trauma and during sepsis has two major goals. One is the reduction of increased protein catabolism, the second is to avoid hyperglycemia and enhanced hepatic . Glucose and xylitol differ in their utilization rates after trauma and during sepsis. Whole-body glucose utilization is reduced during such states, while the utilization of xylitol is more than doubled. In order to investigate whether these differences are associated with beneficial effects on hepatic glucose production and protein sparing, we conducted two animal and two clinical studies.For the analysis of glucose and protein turnover radioactive and stable isotope techniques were applied. In burned rats primed constant infusions of 6-[3H]-glucose, 1-[14C]-alanine, 3-[14C]-alanine and U-[14C]- were used to determine whole body glucose turnover,  from C3-precursors and alanine flux. In septic rats nitrogen balance was calculated after determination of 24-hour-urine nitrogen content measured by micro-Kjeldahl digestion. 24-hour urinary 3-methyl-histidine excretion was analysed by amino acid autoanalyser. In human studies hepatic glucose production and urea synthesis rates were measured using primed continuous infusions of [6,6-d2]-glucose and [2-N15]-urea, respectively.In the first trauma model we demonstrated that hypocaloric xylitol in contrast to glucose significantly reduced hepatic glucose production and  from C3-carbons. In the septic rat exchange of glucose calories by xylitol in a proportion of 1:1 was associated with a significantly ameliorated nitrogen retention and lower 3-methyl-histidine excretion. In two studies on surgical intensive care patients we were able to confirm these nitrogen sparing properties of xylitol. Hepatic glucose production and urea synthesis rates were significantly reduced during xylitol infusion after trauma, whereas equicaloric glucose had no effects. In septic patients xylitol led to significant lower lactate concentrations and  rates than isocaloric glucose.In animal as well as in human studies hypocaloric xylitol and the mixture of glucose/xylitol (1:1) were more efficient in preserving body protein than glucose alone. Hepatic  was significantly reduced when compared to isocaloric glucose. During the acute phase after trauma we therefore recommend a carbohydrate supplementation of 3 g/kg BW/d by xylitol. During long-term TPN a glucose/xylitol mixture (1:1) in a dosage of 6 g/kg BW/d is recommended together with amino acids and, if necessary, lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10937824>In vivo 13C NMR study of the bidirectional reactions of the Wood-Werkman cycle and around the pyruvate node in Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii and Propionibacterium acidipropionici.</a></h2><p>This study used in vitro 13C NMR spectroscopy to directly examine bidirectional reactions of the Wood-Werkman cycle involved in central carbon metabolic pathways of dairy propionibacteria during pyruvate catabolism. The flow of [2-13C]pyruvate label was monitored on living cell suspensions of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii and Propionibacterium acidipropionici under acidic conditions. P. shermanii and P. acidipropionici cells consumed pyruvate at apparent initial rates of 161 and 39 micromol min(-1) g(-1) (cell dry weight), respectively. The bidirectionality of reactions in the first part of the Wood-Werkman cycle was evident from the formation of intermediates such as [3-13C]pyruvate and [3-13C]malate and of products like [2-13C] from [2-13C]pyruvate. For the first time alanine labeled on C2 and C3 and aspartate labeled on C2 and C3 were observed during [2-13C]pyruvate metabolism by propionibacteria.

This species is the main ripening flora of the Swiss-type cheeses and is widely used as propionic acid and vitamin B12 industrial producer. The flow of labelled [1-13C]glucose was monitored in living cell suspensions and enrichment was detected in main products like [1-13C]glycogen, [6-13C]lycogen, [1-13C]trehalose, [6-13C]trehalose, [1-13C]propionate, [2-13C]propionate, [3-13C]propionate, [1-13C], [2-13C], [1-13C]succinate, [2-13C]succinate and [1-13C]CO2. alpha and beta glucose consumption could be examined separately and were catabolized at the same rate. Three intermediates were also found out, namely [1-13C]glucose-6-phosphate, [6-13C]glucose-6-phosphate and [1-13C]glucose-1-phosphate. From the formation of intermediates such as [6-3C]glucose-6-phosphate and products like [6-13C]glycogen from [1-13C]glucose we concluded the bidirectionality of reactions in the first part of glycolysis and the isomerization at the triose-phosphate level. Comparison of spectra obtained after addition of [1-13C]glucose or [U-12C]glucose revealed production of [1-13C]CO2 which means that pentose phosphates pathway is active under our experimental conditions. From the isotopic pattern of trehalose, it could be postulated that trehalose biosynthesis occurred either by direct condensation of two glucose molecules or by .

In the present study, the diabetes was induced in male albino - rats using alloxan (140 mg/kg b.w.) and treated with ethyl  extract (100 and 200 mg/kg b.w.) of T. tinctoria (TTEA) orally for 28 days. The effects of TTEA on biochemical paramets were studied. The results of this comprehensive study revealed that the TTEA significantly restored the altered parameters in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The diabetes-induced elevated levels of glycogenolysis and  metabolism were significantly controlled by TTEA. In the same, the decreased glycogenesis, glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolisms were significantly increased by TTEA. The enzymatic and non- enzymatic antioxidant levels were significantly elevated in TTEA treated diabetic rats and also the total non-enzymatic antioxidants capacity of serum and liver homogenate were calculated though DPPH inhibition. To conclude, this study demonstrates the anti-diabetic effect of TTEA possibly mediated through regulating carbohydrate metabolism and antioxidant status.Copyright © 2019.

In the absence of exogenous insulin, patients with type 1 diabetes exhibit a variety of metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia, glycosurea, accelerated ketogenesis, and muscle wasting due to increased proteolysis. We analyzed plasma from type 1 diabetic (T1D) humans during insulin treatment (I+) and acute insulin deprivation (I-) and non-diabetic participants (ND) by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The aim was to determine if this combination of analytical methods could provide information on metabolic pathways known to be altered by insulin deficiency. Multivariate statistics differentiated proton spectra from I- and I+ based on several derived plasma metabolites that were elevated during insulin deprivation (lactate, , allantoin, ketones). Mass spectrometry revealed significant perturbations in levels of plasma amino acids and amino acid metabolites during insulin deprivation. Further analysis of metabolite levels measured by the two analytical techniques indicates several known metabolic pathways that are perturbed in T1D (I-) (protein synthesis and breakdown, , ketogenesis, amino acid oxidation, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and oxidative stress). This work demonstrates the promise of combining multiple analytical methods with advanced statistical methods in quantitative metabolomics research, which we have applied to the clinical situation of acute insulin deprivation in T1D to reflect the numerous metabolic pathways known to be affected by insulin deficiency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115022>Gut microbial degradation of organophosphate insecticides-induces glucose intolerance via .</a></h2><p>Organophosphates are the most frequently and largely applied insecticide in the world due to their biodegradable nature. Gut microbes were shown to degrade organophosphates and cause intestinal dysfunction. The diabetogenic nature of organophosphates was recently reported but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. We aimed to understand the role of gut microbiota in organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia and to unravel the molecular mechanism behind this process.Here we demonstrate a high prevalence of diabetes among people directly exposed to organophosphates in rural India (n = 3080). Correlation and linear regression analysis reveal a strong association between plasma organophosphate residues and HbA1c but no association with acetylcholine esterase was noticed. Chronic treatment of mice with organophosphate for 180 days confirms the induction of glucose intolerance with no significant change in acetylcholine esterase. Further fecal transplantation and culture transplantation experiments confirm the involvement of gut microbiota in organophosphate-induced glucose intolerance. Intestinal metatranscriptomic and host metabolomic analyses reveal that gut microbial organophosphate degradation produces short chain fatty acids like acetic acid, which induces  and thereby accounts for glucose intolerance. Plasma organophosphate residues are positively correlated with fecal esterase activity and  level of human diabetes.Collectively, our results implicate  as the key mechanism behind organophosphate-induced hyperglycemia, mediated by the organophosphate-degrading potential of gut microbiota. This study reveals the gut microbiome-mediated diabetogenic nature of organophosphates and hence that the usage of these insecticides should be reconsidered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17103236>Cadmium response and redoxin targets in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: a proteomic approach.</a></h2><p>A proteomic approach including two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF analysis has been developed to identify the soluble proteins of the unicellular photosynthetic algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We first described the partial 2D-picture of soluble proteome obtained from whole cells grown on . Then we studied the effects of the exposure of these cells to 150 muM cadmium (Cd). The most drastic effect was the decrease in abundance of both large and small subunits of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, in correlation with several other enzymes involved in photosynthesis, Calvin cycle and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Other down-regulated processes were fatty acid biosynthesis, aminoacid and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, proteins involved in glutathione synthesis, ATP metabolism, response to oxidative stress and protein folding were up-regulated in the presence of cadmium.

However, its considerable efficacy against target species is offset by comparable toxicity to other mammals and, to a lesser extent, birds and its use as a general rodenticide was therefore severely curtailed by 1990. Currently, sodium fluoroacetate is licensed in the US for use against coyotes, which prey on sheep and goats, and in Australia and New Zealand to kill unwanted introduced species. The extreme toxicity of fluoroacetate to mammals and insects stems from its similarity to , which has a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. Fluoroacetate combines with coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to form fluoroacetyl CoA, which can substitute for acetyl CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and reacts with citrate synthase to produce fluorocitrate, a metabolite of which then binds very tightly to aconitase, thereby halting the cycle. Many of the features of fluoroacetate poisoning are, therefore, largely direct and indirect consequences of impaired oxidative metabolism. Energy production is reduced and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle subsequent to citrate are depleted. Among these is oxoglutarate, a precursor of glutamate, which is not only an excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS but is also required for efficient removal of ammonia via the urea cycle. Increased ammonia concentrations may contribute to the incidence of seizures. Glutamate is also required for glutamine synthesis and glutamine depletion has been observed in the brain of fluoroacetate-poisoned rodents. Reduced cellular oxidative metabolism contributes to a lactic acidosis. Inability to oxidise fatty acids via the tricarboxylic acid cycle leads to ketone body accumulation and worsening acidosis. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion results in inhibition of high energy-consuming reactions such as . Fluoroacetate poisoning is associated with citrate accumulation in several tissues, including the brain. Fluoride liberated from fluoroacetate, citrate and fluorocitrate are calcium chelators and there are both animal and clinical data to support hypocalcaemia as a mechanism of fluoroacetate toxicity. However, the available evidence suggests the fluoride component does not contribute. Acute poisoning with sodium fluoroacetate is uncommon. Ingestion is the major route by which poisoning occurs. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are common within 1 hour of ingestion. Sweating, apprehension, confusion and agitation follow. Both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported and nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes are common, the QTc may be prolonged and hypotension may develop. Seizures are the main neurological feature. Coma may persist for several days. Although several possible antidotes have been investigated, they are of unproven value in humans. The immediate, and probably only, management of fluoroacetate poisoning is therefore supportive, including the correction of hypocalcaemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429316>C2 metabolism in Euglena.</a></h2><p>Euglenoids are able to assimilate fatty acids and alcohols with various carbon-chain lengths, and ethanol is known to be one of the best carbon sources to support the growth of Euglena gracilis. Ethanol is first oxidized to  by the sequential reactions of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in the mitochondria, and then converted to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Acetyl-CoA is metabolized through the glyoxylate cycle which is a modified tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in which isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS) function to bypass the two decarboxylation steps of the TCA cycle, enabling the net synthesis of carbohydrates from C2 compounds.

To assess the transcriptional correlates of this response, the sta6 strain and the starch-forming cw15 strain were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis during the 2 days prior and 2 days after the boost, and the data were compared with published reports using other strains and growth conditions. During the 2 h after the boost, ∼425 genes are upregulated ≥2-fold and ∼875 genes are downregulated ≥2-fold in each strain. Expression of a small subset of "sensitive" genes, encoding enzymes involved in the glyoxylate and Calvin-Benson cycles, , and the pentose phosphate pathway, is responsive to culture conditions and genetic background as well as to boosting. Four genes-encoding a diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGTT2), a glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (GPD3), and two candidate lipases (Cre03.g155250 and Cre17.g735600)-are selectively upregulated in the sta6 strain. Although the bulk rate of  depletion from the medium is not boost enhanced, three candidate  permease-encoding genes in the GPR1/FUN34/YaaH superfamily are boost upregulated, and 13 of the "sensitive" genes are strongly responsive to the cell's  status.

Here, a recently hypothesized metabolic role for these hormones is tested on European sea bass treated with: (i) teleost PTHrP(1-34), (ii) PTHrP(1-34) and anti-STC1 serum (pro-PTHrP groups), (iii) a PTHrP antagonist PTHrP(7-34) or (iv) PTHrP(7-34) and STC1 (pro-STC1 groups). Livers were analysed using untargeted metabolic profiling based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) spectroscopy. Concentrations of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), alanine, glutamine and glutamate increased in pro-STC1 groups suggesting their mobilization from the muscle to the liver for degradation and  from alanine and glutamine. In addition, only STC1 treatment decreased the concentrations of succinate, fumarate and , indicating slowing of the citric acid cycle. In the pro-PTHrP groups the concentrations of glucose, erythritol and lactate decreased, indicative of  from lactate. Taurine, trimethylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide and carnitine changed in opposite directions in the pro-STC1 versus the pro-PTHrP groups, suggesting opposite effects, with STC1 stimulating lipogenesis and PTHrP activating lipolysis/β-oxidation of fatty acids.

Km values for L-lactate (4.7 mM), D-lactate (27 mM), D,L-2-hydroxybutyrate (3.3 mM), L-3-hydroxybutyrate (12.7 mM), and acetoacetate (6.1 mM) were very similar in both cell types, whereas in hepatocytes the Km values were higher than MCT1 for pyruvate (1.3 mM, cf. 0.72 mM), D-3-hydroxybutyrate (24.7 mM, cf. 10.1 mM), D-2-chloropropionate (1.3 mM, cf. 0.8 mM), 4-hydroxybutyrate (18.1 mM, cf. 7.7 mM), and  (5.4 mM, cf. 3.7 mM). In contrast, the hepatocyte carrier had lower Km values than MCT1 for glycolate, chloroacetate, dichloroacetate, and 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate. Differences in stereoselectivity were also detected; both carriers showed a lower Km for L-lactate than D-lactate, while hepatocyte MCT exhibited a lower Km for D- than L-2-chloropropionate and for L- than D-3-hydroxybutyrate; this is not the case for MCT1. A range of inhibitors of MCT1, including alpha-cyanocinnamate derivatives, phloretin, and niflumic acid, inhibited hepatocyte MCT with K0.5 values significantly higher than for tumor cell MCT1, while stilbene disulfonate derivatives and p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate had similar K0.5 values in both cell types. The branched chain ketoacids alpha-ketoisocaproate and alpha-ketoisovalerate were also potent inhibitors of hepatocyte MCT with K0.5 values of 270 and 340 microM, respectively. The activation energy of L-lactate transport into hepatocytes was 58 kJ mol-1, and measured rates of transport at 37 degrees C were considerably greater than those required for maximal rates of . The properties of the hepatocyte monocarboxylate transporter are consistent with the presence of a distinct isoform of MCT in liver cells as suggested by the cloning and sequencing of MCT2 from hamster liver (Garcia, C.

Metabolism in ruminant tissues.</a></h2><p>The discovery of the dominance of short-chain fatty acids as energy sources in the 1940s and 1950s, as discussed in part I of this review (Annison & Bryden, 1998) led to uncertainties concerning the interrelationships of glucose and  in ruminant metabolism. These were resolved in the following decade largely by use of 14C-labelled substrates. Although only small amounts of glucose are absorbed in most dietary situations, glucose availability to ruminant tissues as measured by isotope dilution was shown to be substantial, indicating that  is a major metabolic activity in both fed and fasted states. Studies with 14C-labelled glucose and  revealed that in contrast to non-ruminants,  and not glucose is the major precursor of long-chain fatty acids in ruminant tissues. Interest in the measurement of energy metabolism in livestock grew rapidly from the 1950s. Most laboratories adopted indirect calorimetry and precise measurements of the energy expenditure of ruminants contributed to the development of new feeding systems. More recently, alternative approaches to the measurement of energy expenditure have included the use of NMR spectroscopy, isotope dilution and the application of the Fick principle to measure O2 consumption in the whole animal and in defined tissues. The refinement of the classical arterio-venous difference procedure in the study of mammary gland metabolism in the 1960s, particularly when combined with isotope dilution, encouraged the use of these methods to generate quantitative data on the metabolism of a range of defined tissues. The recent introduction of new methods for the continuous monitoring of both blood flow and blood O2 content has greatly increased the precision and scope of arterio-venous difference measurements. The impact of data produced by these and other quantitative procedures on current knowledge of the metabolism of glucose, short-chain fatty acids and lipids, and on N metabolism, is outlined. The role of the portal-drained viscera and liver in N metabolism is discussed in relation to data obtained by the use of multi-catheterized animals. Protein turnover, and the impact of stress (physical, social and disease related) on protein metabolism have been reviewed. The growth of knowledge of mammary gland metabolism and milk synthesis since the first quantitative studies in the 1960s has been charted. Recent findings on the regulation of amino acid uptake and utilization by the mammary gland, and on the control of milk secretion, are of particular interest and importance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15539291>A method for the determination of glucose synthesis in isolated bovine hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>A simple method for determining glucose synthesis from radiolabeled precursors in isolated bovine hepatocytes using ion exchange resins is presented. This method allows processing of multiple small volume samples using suspensions of anion and cation exchange resins rather than traditional stacked column separation methods. Hepatocytes were isolated from calf liver by collagenase perfusion of the caudate lobe and were incubated with (14)C-labeled lactate or propionate as gluconeogenic substrates. Glucose synthesis was determined in an aliquot of cell suspension that was vortexed with a slurry of anion exchange ( form) resin, followed by a slurry of cation exchange resin. Newly synthesized, labeled glucose was recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation and quantitated by scintillation counting. Using this procedure, more than 98% of the unused labeled precursor was bound to the ion exchange resin and essentially 100% of a labeled glucose tracer was recovered in the supernatant. Pretreatment of hepatocyte suspensions with glucose oxidase was shown to eliminate the accumulation of radioactivity in the supernatant, thus confirming the specificity of this technique for measurement of newly synthesized glucose. This method was sensitive to changes in the rate of hepatic  that resulted from changes in substrate concentration or the addition of glucagon or fatty acids to the hepatocyte incubations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26523581>Propionate supplementation improves nitrogen use by reducing urea flux in sheep.</a></h2><p>Feeding and postruminal infusion of propionate is known to increase N retention in ruminants. Our aim was to determine the role of rumen propionate on urea N recycling and gluconeogenesis in growing sheep. In Exp. 1, wether sheep ( = 6; 32.5 ± 3.57 kg BW) fitted with a rumen cannula were fed to 1.8 × ME requirement a concentrate-type ration (172 g CP/kg DM and 10.4 MJ ME/kg DM) and continuously infused into the rumen with isoenergetic (10% of dietary ME intake) solutions of either sodium  (control) or sodium propionate for 9-d periods in a crossover design. In Exp. 2, a different group of wether sheep ( = 5; 33.6 ± 3.70 kg BW) fitted with a rumen cannula were fed, on an isonitrogenous basis, either a control (151 g CP/kg DM and 8.4 MJ ME/kg DM) or sodium propionate-supplemented (139 g CP/kg DM and 8.9 MJ ME/kg DM) diet at 2-h intervals. [N] urea was continuously infused intravenously for the last 5 d of each period, and total urine was collected by vacuum and feces were collected by a harness bag. Over the last 12 h, [C]glucose was continuously infused intravenously and hourly blood samples were collected during the last 5 h. Propionate treatments increased ( < 0.001) the proportion of rumen propionate in both experiments. In Exp. 1, N retention was not affected by propionate infusion as compared with isoenergetic . There was no effect on urea entry (synthesis) rate (UER) in Exp. 1; however, sodium propionate infusion tended ( < 0.1) to increase urinary urea elimination (UUE). In Exp. 2, feeding propionate increased ( < 0.01) N retention by 0.8 g N/d. In addition, UER was reduced by approximately 2 g urea N/d, leading to a reduction ( < 0.05) in UUE (7.0 vs. 6.2 g urea N/d). Between the 2 experiments, the proportion of UER recycled to the gut was greater with the forage-type diet in Exp. 2 (approximately 60%) compared with the concentrate-type diet in Exp. 1 (approximately 40%), although urea N fluxes across the gut remained unchanged in both experiments. In Exp. 1, glucose entry and gluconeogenesis were greater ( < 0.05) and plasma glucose tended ( < 0.1) to be greater with sodium propionate infusion than with sodium  infusion, but there was no difference in Cori cycling. In Exp. 2, glucose entry, gluconeogenesis, Cori cycling, and plasma glucose increased ( < 0.05) with dietary propionate. Our studies indicate that propionate inclusion in feed, but not continuous infusion in to the rumen, improves N utilization in growing sheep. The propionate effect is likely mediated by providing additional precursors for gluconeogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25518735>Gut microbiota and energy balance: role in obesity.</a></h2><p>The microbial community populating the human digestive tract has been linked to the development of obesity, diabetes and liver diseases. Proposed mechanisms on how the gut microbiota could contribute to obesity and metabolic diseases include: (1) improved energy extraction from diet by the conversion of dietary fibre to SCFA; (2) increased intestinal permeability for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in response to the consumption of high-fat diets resulting in an elevated systemic LPS level and low-grade inflammation. Animal studies indicate differences in the physiologic effects of fermentable and non-fermentable dietary fibres as well as differences in long- and short-term effects of fermentable dietary fibre. The human intestinal microbiome is enriched in genes involved in the degradation of indigestible polysaccharides. The extent to which dietary fibres are fermented and in which molar ratio SCFA are formed depends on their physicochemical properties and on the individual microbiome.  and propionate play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism.  serves as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis in liver, whereas propionate can be utilised for . The conversion of fermentable dietary fibre to SCFA provides additional energy to the host which could promote obesity. However, epidemiologic studies indicate that diets rich in fibre rather prevent than promote obesity development. This may be due to the fact that SCFA are also ligands of free fatty acid receptors (FFAR). Activation of FFAR leads to an increased expression and secretion of enteroendocrine hormones such as glucagon-like-peptide 1 or peptide YY which cause satiety. In conclusion, the role of SCFA in host energy balance needs to be re-evaluated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26859303>Physiological Role of Gut Microbiota for Maintaining Human Health.</a></h2><p>The human body is colonized by an extremely complex and abundant aggregation of microbes, collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. Recent studies have focused on the link between these microbes and our health.Diet contributes to shaping the gut microbial structure and influences metabolic functions of the host. Alteration of the microbial structure and function (dysbiosis) is associated with the pathogenesis of various disorders. Fermentation is the process by which anaerobic bacteria (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) break down indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; , propionate and butyrate), collaborating with species specialized in oligosaccharide fermentation (e.g. Bifidobacteria). Butyrate and propionate can regulate intestinal physiology and immune function, while  acts as a substrate for lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. The gut microbiota regulates immune homeostasis via the induction of regulatory T cells and Th17 cells. In addition, butyrate has strong anti-inflammatory effects possibly through the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity. Metabolic products generated by the gut microbiota, such as SCFAs, GABA, tryptophan, serotonin and catecholamine, transmit a signal to resident cells in the gut.Advances made in the DNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics have revolutionized our understanding of the microbes in the gut.© 2016 S.

F1,6BPase, expressed predominantly in liver and kidney, is one of the rate-limiting enzymes of hepatic  and has become a target for the development of new drugs for type 2 diabetes. The two sugar phosphates were separated on a Phenomenex Luna NH2 column (150 mm x 2.0 mm id) using the following mobile phase: 5 mM triethylamine  buffer/ACN (80:20) v/v in a linear pH gradient (from pH = 9 to 10 in 15 min) at the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.

Under the optimised final conditions, the method was validated for accuracy, specificity, precision (inter- and intradays RSD comprised between 1.0 and 6.3% over the range of concentrations used), linearity (50-400 microM), LODs (0.44 microM) and LOQs (1.47 microM), and the method was applied to F6P determination in the F1,6BPase catalysed hydrolysis of F1,6BP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935180>Changes in transcript abundance in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii following nitrogen deprivation predict diversion of metabolism.</a></h2><p>Like many microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii forms lipid droplets rich in triacylglycerols when nutrient deprived. To begin studying the mechanisms underlying this process, nitrogen (N) deprivation was used to induce triacylglycerol accumulation and changes in developmental programs such as gametogenesis. Comparative global analysis of transcripts under induced and noninduced conditions was applied as a first approach to studying molecular changes that promote or accompany triacylglycerol accumulation in cells encountering a new nutrient environment. Towards this goal, high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to generate large numbers of expressed sequence tags of eight biologically independent libraries, four for each condition, N replete and N deprived, allowing a statistically sound comparison of expression levels under the two tested conditions. As expected, N deprivation activated a subset of control genes involved in gametogenesis while down-regulating protein biosynthesis. Genes for components of photosynthesis were also down-regulated, with the exception of the PSBS gene. N deprivation led to a marked redirection of metabolism: the primary carbon source, , was no longer converted to cell building blocks by the glyoxylate cycle and  but funneled directly into fatty acid biosynthesis. Additional fatty acids may be produced by membrane remodeling, a process that is suggested by the changes observed in transcript abundance of putative lipase genes. Inferences on metabolism based on transcriptional analysis are indirect, but biochemical experiments supported some of these deductions. The data provided here represent a rich source for the exploration of the mechanism of oil accumulation in microalgae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24277929>Cholesterol sulfate and cholesterol sulfotransferase inhibit  by targeting hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α.</a></h2><p>Sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated sulfation represents a critical mechanism in regulating the chemical and functional homeostasis of endogenous and exogenous molecules. The cholesterol sulfotransferase SULT2B1b catalyzes the sulfoconjugation of cholesterol to synthesize cholesterol sulfate (CS). In this study, we showed that the expression of SULT2B1b in the liver was induced in obese mice and during the transition from the fasted to the fed state, suggesting that the regulation of SULT2B1b is physiologically relevant. CS and SULT2B1b inhibited  by targeting the gluconeogenic factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) in both cell cultures and transgenic mice. Treatment of mice with CS or transgenic overexpression of the CS-generating enzyme SULT2B1b in the liver inhibited hepatic  and alleviated metabolic abnormalities both in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) and in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice. Mechanistically, CS and SULT2B1b inhibited  by suppressing the expression of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthetase (Acss), leading to decreased acetylation and nuclear exclusion of HNF4α. Our results also suggested that leptin is a potential effector of SULT2B1b in improving metabolic function. We conclude that SULT2B1b and its enzymatic by-product CS are important metabolic regulators that control glucose metabolism, suggesting CS as a potential therapeutic agent and SULT2B1b as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23389339>Metabolic fluxes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe grown on glucose and mixtures of glycerol and .</a></h2><p>Growth on glycerol has already been a topic of research for several yeast species, and recent publications deal with the regulatory mechanisms of glycerol assimilation by the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We investigated glycerol metabolism of S. pombe from a physiological point of view, characterizing growth and metabolism on a mixture of glycerol and  and comparing it to growth on glucose under respirative growth conditions in chemostat experiments. On glycerol/ mixtures, the cells grew with a maximum specific growth rate of 0.11 h(-1) where 46 % of the carbon was channeled into biomass and the key fermentation product ethanol was not detectable. (13)C-assisted metabolic flux analysis resolved substrate distributions through central carbon metabolism, proving that glycerol is used as a precursor for glycolysis, , and the pentose phosphate pathway, while  enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle via acetyl-CoA. Considering compartmentalization between cytosol and mitochondria in the metabolic model, we found compartmentalization of biosynthesis for the amino acids aspartate and leucine.

Homologs have been identified in human, mouse, and nematode databases. Two mutant alleles were sequenced. The mutations altered amino acid residues that are conserved among members of the new gene family.

Here, we studied the response to the deletion of the glycolytic and gluconeogenic gene GPM1, encoding for phosphoglycerate mutase. It was previously shown that a S. cerevisiae strain with non-functional copies of GPM1 can only grow when glycerol and ethanol are both present as carbon sources, whilst addition of glucose was shown to strongly inhibit growth. It was suggested that glycerol is needed to feed  whilst ethanol is required for respiration. Here, we studied the physiological response of the GPM1 knock-out mutant through fermentation and transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, we compared the physiological results with those obtained through simulations using a genome-scale metabolic model, showing that glycerol is only needed in small amounts for growth. Our findings strongly suggest a severely impaired growth ability of the knock-out mutant, which presents increased transcript levels of genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway and in the glyoxylate shunt.

To survive, C. elegans dauer larvae and stationary phase S. cerevisiae require elevated amounts of the disaccharide trehalose. We found that dauer larvae and stationary phase yeast switched into a gluconeogenic mode in which metabolism was reoriented toward production of sugars from non-carbohydrate sources. This mode depended on full activity of the glyoxylate shunt (GS), which enables synthesis of trehalose from . The GS was especially critical during preparation of worms for harsh desiccation (preconditioning) and during the entry of yeast into stationary phase. Loss of the GS dramatically decreased desiccation tolerance in both organisms.

On day two after birth, alanine, glycine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate and asparagine were elevated in the blood of the PEPCK-C-/- mice and the blood urea nitrogen concentration was increased by 2-fold. The rate of oxidation of [2-14C]-, and [5-14C]-glutamate to 14CO2 by liver slices from PEPCK-C-/- mice at two days of age was greatly reduced, as was the rate of fatty acid synthesis from  and glucose. As predicted by the lack of PEPCK-C, the concentration of malate in the livers of the PEPCK-C-/- mice was 10 times that of controls.We conclude that PEPCK-C is required not only for  and glyceroneogenesis but also for cataplerosis (i.e. the removal of citric acid cycle anions) and that the failure of this process in the livers of PEPCK-C-/- mice results in a marked reduction in citric acid cycle flux and the shunting of hepatic lipid into triglyceride, resulting in a fatty liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12125824>The genome of Methanosarcina mazei: evidence for lateral gene transfer between bacteria and archaea.</a></h2><p>The Archaeon Methanosarcina mazei and related species are of great ecological importance as they are the only organisms fermenting , methylamines and methanol to methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia (in case of methylamines). Since  is the precursor of 60% of the methane produced on earth these organisms contribute significantly to the production of this greenhouse gas, e.g. in rice paddies. The 4,096,345 base pairs circular chromosome of M. mazei is more than twice as large as the genomes of the methanogenic Archaea currently completely sequenced (Bult et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1997). 3,371 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. Based on currently available sequence data 376 of these ORFs are Methanosarcina-specific and 1,043 ORFs find their closest homologue in the bacterial domain. 544 of these ORFs reach significant similarity values only in the bacterial domain. They include 56 of the 102 transposases, and proteins involved in , proline biosynthesis, transport processes, DNA-repair, environmental sensing, gene regulation, and stress response. Striking examples are the occurrence of the bacterial GroEL/GroES chaperone system and the presence of tetrahydrofolate-dependent enzymes. These findings might indicate that lateral gene transfer has played an important evolutionary role in forging the physiology of this metabolically versatile methanogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12715202>Transcriptional control of nonfermentative metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h2><p>Although sugars are clearly the preferred carbon sources of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nonfermentable substrates such as ethanol, glycerol, lactate,  or oleate can also be used for the generation of energy and cellular biomass. Several regulatory networks of glucose repression (carbon catabolite repression) are involved in the coordinate biosynthesis of enzymes required for the utilization of nonfermentable substrates. Positively and negatively acting complexes of pleiotropic regulatory proteins have been characterized. The Snf1 (Cat1) protein kinase complex, together with its regulatory subunit Snf4 (Cat3) and alternative beta-subunits Sip1, Sip2 or Gal83, plays an outstanding role for the derepression of structural genes which are repressed in the presence of a high glucose concentration. One molecular function of the Snf1 complex is deactivation by phosphorylation of the general glucose repressor Mig1. In addition to regulation of alternative sugar fermentation, Mig1 also influences activators of respiration and , although to a lesser extent. Snf1 is also required for conversion of specific regulatory factors into transcriptional activators. This review summarizes regulatory cis-acting elements of structural genes of the nonfermentative metabolism, together with the corresponding DNA-binding proteins (Hap2-5, Rtg1-3, Cat8, Sip4, Adr1, Oaf1, Pip2), and describes the molecular interactions among general regulators and pathway-specific factors. In addition to the influence of the carbon source at the transcriptional level, mechanisms of post-transcriptional control such as glucose-regulated stability of mRNA are also discussed briefly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000496>The nutritional status of Methanosarcina acetivorans regulates glycogen metabolism and gluconeogenesis and  fluxes.</a></h2><p>Gluconeogenesis is an essential pathway in methanogens because they are unable to use exogenous hexoses as carbon source for cell growth. With the aim of understanding the regulatory mechanisms of central carbon metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the present study investigated gene expression, the activities and metabolic regulation of key enzymes, metabolite contents and fluxes of gluconeogenesis, as well as  and glycogen synthesis/degradation pathways. Cells were grown with methanol as a carbon source. Key enzymes were kinetically characterized at physiological pH/temperature. Active consumption of methanol during exponential cell growth correlated with significant methanogenesis, gluconeogenic flux and steady glycogen synthesis. After methanol exhaustion, cells reached the stationary growth phase, which correlated with the rise in glycogen consumption and glycolytic flux, decreased methanogenesis, negligible  production and an absence of gluconeogenesis. Elevated activities of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthetase complex and pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase suggested the generation of acetyl-CoA and pyruvate for glycogen synthesis. In the early stationary growth phase, the transcript contents and activities of pyruvate phosphate dikinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and glycogen synthase decreased, whereas those of glycogen phosphorylase, ADP-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase increased. Therefore, glycogen and gluconeogenic metabolites were synthesized when an external carbon source was provided. Once such a carbon source became depleted,  and methanogenesis fed by glycogen degradation provided the ATP supply. Weak inhibition of key enzymes by metabolites suggested that the pathways evaluated were mainly transcriptionally regulated. Because glycogen metabolism and /gluconeogenesis are not present in all methanogens, the overall data suggest that glycogen storage might represent an environmental advantage for methanosarcinales when carbon sources are scarce. Also, the understanding of the central carbohydrate metabolism in methanosarcinales may help to optimize methane production.© 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7864084>Subcellular localization of PEPCK and metabolism of gluconeogenic substrains of renal cell lines.</a></h2><p>The two gluconeogenic substrains of renal epithelial cells, LLC-PK1-FBPase+ and OKGNG+, have been shown to differ markedly in their metabolism of lactate and pyruvate. OKGNG+ cells consumed lactate as well as pyruvate at high rates in contrast to LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells, which failed to take up or utilize lactate. (Aminooxy) (AOA), an inhibitor of transamination reactions, was used to further delineate these differences. Lactate consumption of OKGNG+ cells was significantly inhibited by AOA, whereas pyruvate consumption by LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells was slightly stimulated. Growth of OKGNG+ cultures, however, could be achieved on lactate in the presence of AOA. From these results it was concluded that the cell strains might differ in the subcellular distribution of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells may express both mitochondrial and cytosolic PEPCK isoenzymes, whereas OKGNG+ cells express only the mitochondrial isoenzyme. This was tested by directly assaying PEPCK activity in subcellular fractions of the cells. In OKGNG+ cells PEPCK activity fractionated with the mitochondrial marker glutamate dehydrogenase; however, in LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells two-thirds of PEPCK activity was found in the cytosol. In LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells, PEPCK activity increased twofold on incubation in acidic culture medium (pH 6.9) for 18 h, in contrast to the PEPCK activity in OKGNG+ cells. Northern blot analysis using cDNA probes specific for the mitochondrial and cytosolic PEPCK mRNAs confirmed the enzyme activity data. In LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells strong expression of cytosolic PEPCK mRNA was observed, whereas in OKGNG+ cells only very low levels could be detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25499349>Overexpression of JAZF1 protected ApoE-deficient mice from atherosclerosis by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis via CREB-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Genome wide association studies have suggested an association of Juxtaposed with another zinc finger gene 1(JAZF1) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As an inhibitor of the TAK1/TR4 signaling pathway, JAZF1 has been shown to be involved in , lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However, its role in insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in vivo remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate in vivo the impact of JAZF1 on insulin resistance-associated dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Adenovirus-mediated JAZF1 overexpression was used to characterize the role of JAZF1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis in normal chow- or HFD-fed ApoE KO mice. Insulin sensitivity was examined by EHC. Cholesterol de novo synthesis was measured by intraperitoneal [1-(14)C]  injection and atherosclerotic plaques were quantified by histological analysis. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the ability of JAZF1 to regulate HMGCR transcriptional activity. JAZF1 overexpression improved HFD-induced hepatic insulin resistance in C57BL/6J mice. In HFD-fed ApoE KO mice, JAZF1 overexpression decreased serum cholesterol levels and hepatic cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting CREB-dependent HMGCR promoter transcriptional activity. Analysis of atherosclerotic lesion showed that JAZF1 overexpression had significantly reduced aortic and aortic sinus en face and cross-sectional plaque areas in HFD-fed ApoE KO mice. These data provide the first evidence for an important role of JAZF1 in increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity and preventing atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Six multicatheterized lambs (40.2 +/- 1.5 kg) were fed with frozen ryegrass (RG) at 690 kJ of ME intake (MEI) x d(-1) x BW(-0.75) and 20.8 g of N intake (NI)/d successively without and with barley supplementation (RG + B), according to a crossover design. Barley supplementation represented 21% of DM intake and increased the MEI and the NI by 32 and 24% respectively, (P < 0.01). In the ruminal fluid, barley increased  and butyrate concentrations by 21.2 and 49.6%, respectively (P < 0.04), without any effect on the ammonia concentration. Consequently, the net portal appearance (NPA) of ammonia was not modified, but the NPA of total amino acids (TAA; +38%) and nonessential amino acids (NEAA; +45%) was increased (P < 0.05) by barley supplementation. Taken individually, the NPA of the essential amino acids (EAA) was increased for isoleucine (+32%; P < 0.05), threonine (+151%; P < 0.03), and lysine (+26%; P < 0.06), with no effect for the other EAA. In contrast to what was observed at the PDV level, no significant alteration in the net hepatic amino acid flux was observed for TAA, EAA, NEAA, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), urea, and ammonia after barley supplementation, showing a relatively minor role of the liver in the regulation of the supply of amino acids to the peripheral tissues. However, taken individually, the net hepatic uptake of some NEAA involved in  and/or ureagenesis was altered with barley supplementation: the alanine uptake was increased by 44% (P < 0.05), aspartate + asparagine (asx) uptake was decreased by 18% (P < 0.01), and glutamate + glutamine (glx) release tended (P < 0.10) to be increased by 208%. With barley supplementation, NI increased by 5 g of N/d, and net splanchnic release increased by 4.63 g of N/d. Consequently, the additional dietary N supply (together with energy supply) was nearly exclusively available to peripheral tissues as AA-N (N as amino acids), but no strong effect of this additional supply of AA to the hind limb could be demonstrated in terms of net AA hind limb fluxes. Consequently, barley supplementation of a ryegrass-based diet increased the net AA release by the splanchnic tissues, with little effect on the AA net uptake by the peripheral tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26518878>Metabolic Cooperation of Glucose and Glutamine Is Essential for the Lytic Cycle of Obligate Intracellular Parasite Toxoplasma gondii.</a></h2><p>Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite infecting nearly all warm-blooded organisms. Asexual reproduction of the parasite within its host cells is achieved by consecutive lytic cycles, which necessitates biogenesis of significant energy and biomass. Here we show that glucose and glutamine are the two major physiologically important nutrients used for the synthesis of macromolecules (ATP, nucleic acid, proteins, and lipids) in T. gondii, and either of them is sufficient to ensure the parasite survival. The parasite can counteract genetic ablation of its glucose transporter by increasing the flux of glutamine-derived carbon through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and by concurrently activating gluconeogenesis, which guarantee a continued biogenesis of ATP and biomass for host-cell invasion and parasite replication, respectively. In accord, a pharmacological inhibition of glutaminolysis or oxidative phosphorylation arrests the lytic cycle of the -deficient mutant, which is primarily a consequence of impaired invasion due to depletion of ATP. Unexpectedly, however, intracellular parasites continue to proliferate, albeit slower, notwithstanding a simultaneous deprivation of glucose and glutamine. A growth defect in the -impaired mutant is caused by a compromised synthesis of lipids, which cannot be counterbalanced by glutamine but can be restored by . Consistently, supplementation of parasite cultures with exogenous  can amend the lytic cycle of the glucose transport mutant. Such plasticity in the parasite's carbon flux enables a growth-and-survival trade-off in assorted nutrient milieus, which may underlie the promiscuous survival of T. gondii tachyzoites in diverse host cells. Our results also indicate a convergence of parasite metabolism with cancer cells.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597313>iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics reveals insights into metabolic and molecular responses of glucose-grown cells of Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus JA2.</a></h2><p>Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria thrive under diverse habitats utilising an extended range of inorganic/organic compounds under different growth modes. Although they display incredible metabolic flexibility, their responses and adaptations to changing carbon regimes is largely unexplored. In the present study, we employed iTRAQ-based global proteomic profiling and physiological studies to uncover the adaptive strategies of a phototrophic bacterium, Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus JA2 to glucose. Strain JA2 displayed altered growth rates, reduced cell size and progressive loss of pigmentation when grown on glucose compared to malate under photoheterotrophic condition. A ten-fold increase in the saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio of glucose-grown cells indicates a possible membrane adaptation. Proteomic profiling revealed extensive metabolic remodelling in the glucose-grown cells wherein signal-transduction, selective-transcription, DNA-repair, transport and protein quality control processes were up-regulated to cope with the changing milieu. Proteins involved in DNA replication, translation, electron-transport, photosynthetic machinery were down-regulated possibly to conserve the energy. Glycolysis/, TCA cycle and pigment biosynthesis were also down-regulated. The cell has activated alternative energy metabolic pathways viz., fatty acid β-oxidation, glyoxylate, -switch and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. Overall, the present study deciphered the molecular/metabolic events associated with glucose-grown cells of strain JA2 and also unraveled how a carbon source modulates the metabolic phenotypes. SIGNIFICANCE: Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (APB) exhibit incredible metabolic flexibility leading to diverse phenotypes. They thrive under diverse habitat using an array of inorganic/organic compounds as carbon sources, yet their metabolic adaptation to varying carbon regime is mostly unexplored. Present study uncovered the proteomic insights of the cellular responses of strain JA2 to changing carbon sources viz. malate and glucose under photoheterotrophic conditions. Our study suggests that carbon source can also determine the metabolic fate of the cells and reshape the energy dynamics of APB. Here, for the first time study highlighted the plausible carbon source (glucose) mediated regulation of photosynthesis in APB. The study sheds light on the plausible cellular events and adaptive metabolic strategies employed by strain JA2 in presence of non-preferred carbon source. It also revealed new insights into the metabolic plasticity of APB to the changing milieu.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
