Shiya tea (leaves of Adinandra nitida), a traditional Chinese tea, is widely consumed due to its palatable flavor and various curative effects, such as reducing blood pressure and blood lipids, as well as anti-inflammation, etc. However, no relevant research on the antiobesity effects of Shiya tea has been reported. In particular, no health-benefiting compounds, other than flavonoids, in Shiya tea have been reported. Thus, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have been used as a bioactivity-guided identification model to verify the inhibitory effects of Shiya tea on adipogenesis, as well as to identify antiadipogenic compounds. Four triterpenoid saponins (1-4), including one new compound (2α,3α-dihydroxyursolic  28- O-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, compound 1), and a flavonoid (5) have been identified using NMR (1D and 2D NMR) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS techniques. Compound 1, the major antiadipogenic constituent with an IC value of 27.6 μg/mL, has been identified for the first time in Shiya tea. To understand the structure-activity relationship, three hydrolytic compounds (1s, 2s, and 5s) were obtained to provide an inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. The inhibitory effect of the triterpenoid (1s) possessing no sugar group decreased significantly, while the flavonoid (5s) also without a sugar group showed increased activity. In addition, the hydroxyl group position may also play a role in inhibitory efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different Fat-to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro- Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host metabolism, especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause  and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584465>Interleukin-4 Boosts Insulin-Induced Energy Deposits by Enhancing Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis in Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis as the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia, is closely associated with chronic inflammation. We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free   uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the  were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p></html>
