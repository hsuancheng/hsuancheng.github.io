<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004056>Fc-saxatilin suppresses hypoxia-induced vascular leakage by regulating endothelial occludin expression.</a></h1><p>Vascular leakage due to compromised integrity of the endothelial barrier is closely associated with brain damage in several neurological disorders, including ischaemic stroke. Saxatilin, a snake venom disintegrin containing the --Asp (RGD) motif, exerts thrombolytic and antiplatelet effects by interacting with multiple integrins on platelets. Integrin signalling is indispensable for regulation of endothelial permeability. Saxatilin may play a role in vascular leakage after ischaemia because it has high affinity for endothelial integrins. Here, we determined whether Fc-saxatilin, an Fc-fusion protein of saxatilin, could prevent vascular leakage under hypoxic or ischaemic conditions. In mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells, hypoxia increased the permeability to FITC-dextran, and this effect was attenuated by Fc-saxatilin treatment. Fc-saxatilin also blocked vascular leakage of Evans Blue in the ischaemic brain induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Furthermore, the expression of occludin, a   protein, was reduced by hypoxia in endothelial cells. This downregulation of occludin was attenuated by Fc-saxatilin treatment. We also determined the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 because they are implicated in the degradation of occludin and of the microvascular basal lamina. Hypoxia increased MMP-9 activity, and this increase was attenuated by Fc-saxatilin treatment. Fc-saxatilin specifically bound to integrin αβ of the endothelial cells and inhibited hypoxia-induced activation of FAK, a downstream signalling molecule in integrin-dependent signal transduction. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the mechanism via which Fc-saxatilin, as an integrin antagonist, prevents vascular leakage under ischemic conditions by regulating occludin expression in endothelial  junctions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328774>Performance, intestinal permeability, and gene expression of selected   proteins in broiler chickens fed reduced protein diets supplemented with arginine, glutamine, and glycine subjected to a leaky gut model.</a></h1><p>Changing dietary protein and amino acids may impact intestinal barrier function. Experiments were conducted in broiler chickens to evaluate supplementation of L-glutamine, glycine, and L-arginine in a reduced protein (RP) diet. Experiment 1 examined the growth performance of broilers fed 5 dietary treatments: 1) a standard diet; 2) an RP diet (193.9 g/kg CP in grower and 176.9 g/kg CP in finisher); 3) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg L-Gln; 4) RP diet supplemented with 10 g/kg ; 5) RP diet supplemented with 5 g/kg L-. Each experimental diet was replicated 6 times with 10 birds per replicate. In a subset of 96 birds, experiment 2 tested the 4 RP diets with and without dexamethasone (DEX) to induce leaky gut. Each diet was replicated 24 times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) was used to test intestinal permeability (IP). Gene expression of selected   proteins in ileal and jejunal tissues was assayed by quantitative PCR. From day 7 to 35, the RP diet increased feed intake (FI) (P < 0.05) and body weight gain (BWG) compared with the standard diet while Gln reduced FI and BWG (P < 0.05) compared with RP.  had no effect on BWG or FCR. Supplementation of  improved FCR from day 21 to 35 and day 7 to 35. In experiment 2,  tended to lower FITC-d (P = 0.086). DEX increased passage of FITC-d into the serum (P < 0.001). The villi surface area was increased in birds fed higher  (P < 0.05). DEX and diet interacted (P < 0.01) for jejunal claudin-3 mRNA level where DEX upregulated claudin-3 for all diets except the  diet. In summary, with a moderate reduction of protein, satisfactory performance can be obtained. Although Gln and  had no demonstrable positive effect on IP and performance of broilers, increasing the dietary  by approximately 140% improved FCR and showed indications of improved intestinal barrier function of birds fed an RP diet under a stress model.© The Author(s) 2019.

The hypothesis for the study was that progressive basement membrane (BM) modification by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contributes to impairment of EPC reparative function after diabetes-related endothelial injury.EPCs isolated from peripheral blood were characterized by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. EPC interactions on native or AGE-modified fibronectin (AGE-FN) were studied for attachment and spreading, whereas chemotaxis to SDF-1 was assessed with the Dunn chamber assay. In addition, photoreactive agent-treated monolayers of retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) produced circumscribed areas of apoptosis and the ability of EPCs to "endothelialize" these wounds was evaluated.EPC attachment and spreading on AGE-FN was reduced compared with control cells (P < 0.05-0.01) but was significantly restored by pretreatment with --Asp (RGD). Chemotaxis of EPCs was abolished on AGE-FN but was reversed by treatment with exogenous RGD. On wounded RMEC monolayers, EPCs showed clustering at the wound site, compared with untreated regions (P < 0.001); AGE-FN significantly reduced this targeting response (P < 0.05). RGD supplementation enhanced EPC incorporation in the monolayer, as determined by EPC participation in   formation and restoration of transendothelial electric resistance (TEER).AGE-modification of vascular substrates impairs EPC adhesion, spreading, and migration; and alteration of the RGD integrin recognition motif plays a key role in these responses. The presence of AGE adducts on BM compromises repair by EPC with implications for vasodegeneration during diabetic microvasculopathy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428392>Glutamine and arginine improve permeability and   protein expression in methotrexate-treated Caco-2 cells.</a></h1><p>Chemotherapy induces an increase of intestinal permeability that is partially related to an alteration of   proteins, occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Protective effects of glutamine on intestinal barrier function have been previously shown but the effects of other amino acids remained poorly documented. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of nine amino acids on intestinal permeability during methotrexate (MTX) treatment in Caco-2 cells.Caco-2 cells were incubated in culture medium supplemented with glutamine, arginine, glutamate, leucine, taurine, citrulline, glycine, histidine or cysteine during 24 h and then treated with MTX (100 ng/ml). The dose of each amino acid was 16.6 fold the physiological plasma concentrations. Barrier function was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), FITC-dextran paracellular flux, occludin and ZO-1 expression and localization. Signaling pathways were also studied.Only glutamine, glutamate, arginine and leucine reversed the decrease of TEER observed after MTX treatment (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the addition of 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine, an inhibitor of glutaminase, blunted the effect of glutamine on MTX-treated cells (P < 0.05). Glutamine and arginine combination restored TEER and FITC-dextran flux to a similar extent than glutamine alone. In addition, pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with glutamine and arginine, alone or combined, differently limited the decrease of ZO-1 and occludin expression (P < 0.05) and the alteration of their cellular distribution, through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways.Glutamine prevented MTX-induced barrier disruption in Caco-2 cells. Arginine also had protective effects but in a lesser extent. The effect of glutamine and arginine should be evaluated in vivo.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved.</p></html>
