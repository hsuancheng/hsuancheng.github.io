<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29099689>Identification of novel small RNAs in  KC-01 expressed under iron limitation and oxidative stress conditions.</a></h1><p>Small RNA (sRNA)-mediated regulation of gene expression is a major tool to understand bacterial responses to environmental changes. In particular, pathogenic bacteria employ sRNAs to adapt to the host environment and establish infection. Members of the  complex, normally present in soil microbiota, cause nosocomial lung infection especially in hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients. We sequenced the draft genome of  KC-01, isolated from the coastal saline soil, and identified several potential sRNAs . Expression of seven small RNAs (Bc_KC_sr1-7) was subsequently confirmed. Two sRNAs (Bc_KC_sr1 and Bc_KC_sr2) were upregulated in response to iron depletion by 2,2'-bipyridyl and another two (Bc_KC_sr3 and Bc_KC_sr4) responded to the presence of 60 µM HO in the culture media. Bc_Kc_sr5, 6 and 7 remained unchanged under these conditions. Expression of Bc_KC_sr2, 3 and 4 also altered with a change in temperature and incubation time. A search in the Rfam and BSRD databases identified Bc_Kc_sr4 as candidate738 in  D286 and assigned Bc_Kc_sr5 and 6 as tmRNA and  RNA, respectively. The novel sRNAs were conserved in  but did not have any homologue in other genera. Bc_KC_sr1 and 4 were transcribed independently while the rest were part of the 3' UTR of their upstream genes. TargetRNA2 predicted that these sRNAs could target a host of cellular messages with very high stringency. Intriguingly, regions surrounding the translation initiation site for several enzymes involved in Fe-S cluster and siderophore biosynthesis, ROS homeostasis, porins, transcription and translation regulators, were among the suggested putative binding sites for these sRNAs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25332326>Folate is absorbed across the human colon: evidence by using enteric-coated caplets containing 13C-labeled []-5-formyltetrahydrofolate.</a></h1><p>Folate intakes that do not meet or greatly exceed requirements may be associated with negative health outcomes. A better understanding of contributors that influence the input side will help establish dietary guidance that ensures health benefits without associated risks. Colonic microbiota produce large quantities of folate, and [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate infused during colonoscopy is absorbed. However, it is unclear if significant quantities of folate are absorbed in an intact microbiome.We determined whether and how much of a physiologic dose of [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate delivered in a pH-sensitive enteric caplet to an intact colonic microbiome is absorbed.Healthy adults ingested a specially designed pH-sensitive acrylic copolymer-coated barium sulfate caplet that contained 855 nmol (400 μg) [(13)C5]5-formyltetrahydrofolate. After a washout period ≥ 4 wk, subjects received an intravenous injection of the same compound (214 nmol). Serially collected blood samples before and after each test dose were analyzed by using a microbiological assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Caplet disintegration in the colon was observed by fluoroscopic imaging for 6 subjects with a mean (± SD) complete disintegration time of 284 ± 155 min. The mean (± SEM) rate of appearance of [(13)C5]5-methyltetrahydrofolate in plasma was 0.33 ± 0.09 (caplet) and 5.8 ± 1.2 (intravenous) nmol/h. Likely because of the significant time in the colon, the mean apparent absorption across the colon was 46%.Folate is absorbed across the colon in humans with an undisturbed microbiome. This finding and previous observations of the size of the colonic depot of folate and its potential for manipulation by diet (eg, dietary fiber, oligosaccharides, and probiotics) suggest that an individual's dietary folate requirement may differ depending on the consumption of dietary constituents that affect the size and composition of their gastrointestinal microbiota. In addition, a systematic investigation of the role of colonic folate on gastrointestinal development and the prevention of colorectal cancer is warranted.

The benefits of a dietary protein restriction are once again enlightened, either by reducing the urea found to be hyperglycemic, thus improving the peripheric  sensitivity, or by decreasing phosphorus and FGF23 hormone, whose reductions are respectively associated with nephroprotection and diminution of cardiovascular events. The numerous researches conducted on the gut microbiota also open promising avenues to better understand the role of this ecosystem in CKD. Finally, the interest in incremental haemodialysis is revived, results show it may be associated with less loss of proteins and preservation of residual kidney function. The development of a nutritional score, informative of survival prediction, also offers the possibility to ensure a better follow-up of patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present study, the microbial metabolism of  was examined for the first time in in vitro batch fecal fermentation system and in mice. Two major microbial metabolites were detected and identified as 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-ol (M9) and 1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one (M11). Our results indicated that reductions of the double bond and the ketone group are the major metabolic pathways of  by the human gut microbiota. We also observed the interindividual variability in the metabolism of M11 to M9 by human gut microbiota. In addition, we demonstrated that the glucuronidated form of  and its metabolites could be rapidly deconjugated by human gut microbiota and in mice, which can be regarded as a reactive process taking place in the intestinal tract. To our knowledge, this is the first report involving the identification of the microbial metabolites of  in an in vitro fermentation system, and the first demonstration of the critical role of gut microbiota in producing the bioactive free form of  and its metabolites in the intestinal tract in mice.</p></html>
