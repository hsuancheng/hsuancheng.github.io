Hyperglycemia induces several pathological alterations which upregulate this system, accounting for overexpression of its downstream signaling molecules, amongst which angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone hold prime pathological notoriety. Although it is well known that elevated plasma levels of Ang II play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of type-II diabetic mellitus, by inducing and aggravating , it is not quite much known that it equally elevates the possibility/risk of development of diabetic complications. Also, amongst the various diabetic complications, the effects of Ang II upregulation are more widely acknowledged in studies concerning the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, its role in exacerbating diabetic retinopathy has not received much attention. Ang II, indeed, plays a detrimental role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy by augmenting the principal events involved in its pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, angiogenesis and inflammation. The utility of angiotensin receptor blockers has shown positive results in research studies and hence, might potentially provide a novel adjuvant therapy for treating this complication and preventing the associated vision-loss in diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we examined whether oral administration of  (IRB) and trichlormethiazide (TCM) decreases blood pressure (BP) via inhibiting sympathetic activity through anti-oxidant effects in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-cp). IRB/TCM treatment decreased BP more profoundly than IRB monotherapy. Urinary norepinephrine excretion and oxidative stress in the brain were decreased in both IRB and IRB/TCM groups without any adverse effect on the metabolic profile. These findings suggest that IRB/TCM profoundly decreases BP in SHR-cp by inhibiting sympathetic activity via anti-oxidant effects in the brain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27653164>Fixed-dose combination of zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs.  plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients with established metabolic syndrome uncontrolled by previous monotherapy. The ZAMES study (Zofenopril in Advanced MEtabolic Syndrome).</a></h1><p>Whether all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective in patients with metabolic syndrome is still unclear. The goal of the Zofenopril in Advanced MEtabolic Syndrome (ZAMES) study was to investigate whether treatment with the fixed-dose combination of sulphydril-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide is at least as effective as that with the angiotensin receptor blocker  plus hydrochlorothiazide in patients with metabolic syndrome and essential hypertension, uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy.We enrolled 721 patients in a multicenter, international (Italy and Romania), randomized, double-blind, parallel group, phase III study. Following a 1-week screening withdrawal period, 482 patients (mean age 59 ± 10 years, 53% men) bearing a SBP at least 140 mmHg and/or DBP at least 90 mmHg plus metabolic syndrome (ATP-III criteria) were randomly allocated to a fixed-dose combination of zofenopril 30 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or  150 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily for a cumulative period of 24 weeks. After 8 and 16 weeks, zofenopril and  doses were doubled in nonnormalized study participants. The study endpoint was the office DBP reduction at study end. In 20% of patients, an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed.The prevalence of diabetes at baseline was significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide group (82%) than in the  plus hydrochlorothiazide (73%) group. Baseline-adjusted DBP reductions were superimposable (P = 0.370) with zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide [n = 231; 9.8 (95% confidence interval: 11.1, 8.4) mmHg] and  plus hydrochlorothiazide [n = 235; 10.4 (11.8, 9.0) mmHg]. The same was for SBP [17.0 (19.2, 14.8) mmHg zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs. 18.8 (21.0, 16.6) mmHg  plus hydrochlorothiazide, P = 0.113]. Rate of normalized and responder patients (SBP/DBP < 140/90 mmHg or SBP reduction more than 20 mmHg or DBP reduction more than 10 mmHg) did not differ at study end (65.8% and 77.5% zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide vs. 67.7% and 81.5%  plus hydrochlorothiazide; P = 0.695, P = 0.301). These results were confirmed in the 69 study participants undergoing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (35 zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide; 34  plus hydrochlorothiazide), with a comparable 24-h average BP reduction [BP difference between-treatment: SBP: 0.1 (-5.7, 5.9) mmHg, P = 0.975; DBP: -0.9 (-3.8, 2.0) mmHg, P = 0.541]. Both drugs attained similar BP reductions also in the last 6 h of the dosing interval [between-treatment difference SBP: 0.1 (-7.4, 7.5) mmHg P = 0.990; DBP: -0.9 (-4.4, 2.6) mmHg, P = 0.602]. Metabolic and renal indexes were not altered. Few patients were withdrawn for moderate adverse events (5% zofenopril plus hydrochlorothiazide; 5%  plus hydrochlorothiazide).This is the first study supporting the comparable antihypertensive and metabolic response to fixed-dose combinations of sulphydril-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (zofenopril) or angiotensin receptor blockers () with a diuretic in patients with advanced metabolic syndrome and nonresponders to monotherapy. The results of this study can further improve the clinical management of high cardiovascular risk patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome, because these two drug combinations increase the number of available combinations, which may significantly improve patients' adherence in this special clinical condition that is frequently found in everyday practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25918729>Renal kallikrein activation and renoprotection after dual blockade of renin-angiotensin system in diet-induced diabetic nephropathy.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of dual blockage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on renal kallikrein expression and inflammatory response in diabetic nephropathy (DN).Rats were randomly divided into 5 groups with 10 rats in each group: normal control; DN model induced by high fat and high sucrose diets; and DN treated with either benazepril 10 mg/kg/d,  30 mg/kg/d, or both. After 8-week treatment, we examined changes in the kidney histopathology, function and immunohistochemical stain of kallikrein, macrophage marker CD68, and profibrotic markers transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β and α-smooth muscle action (SMA).DN rats showed enlarged kidneys with glomerulosclerosis, interstitial chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and proteinuria. All the pathological damage and functional impairments were improved after the RAS blockades (all P < 0.05). Compared with monotherapy, combined treatment further alleviated the kidney impairments in parallel to increased tubular immunoreactivity for kallikrein and decreased immunopositive cells for CD68, TGF-β, and α-SMA.The renoprotective effects of the dual RAS blockade in diabetic nephropathy may be attributed to improved tubular kallikrein expression and interstitial inflammatory response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118161>AT1R antagonism improves metabolic and vascular changes of obesity-induced gestational diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Obesity can overload glucose homeostasis and physiological  during gestation which increases the risk of complications like diabetes mellitus or preeclampsia. Angiotensin II /AT receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of vascular effects of obesity/ but its role during gestation is not as clear. We sought to determine angiotensin II- ATR participation on a diet-induced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) experimental model. Female Wistar rats were fed with a standard or hypercaloric diet for 7 weeks. Half of the animals were mated and became pregnant from week 4-7. Animals were treated with saline,  (30 mg/kg) or metformin (320 mg/kg) for the last two weeks of the protocol. Weight gain, systolic blood pressure (BP), oral glucose tolerance test and vascular contractility were measured at the last day of the protocol (day 19-20 of pregnancy). Hypercaloric diet increased blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance test, and increased BP in pregnant rats, fulfilling criteria for GDM. Both drugs decreased impaired GTT and relative hyperglycemia. Metformin had no effect on BP but prevented weight increase. In isolated aortas,  and metformin decreased vasoconstriction only of non-pregnant hypercaloric diet fed animals. Results support angiotensin II/ ATR involvement in BP and glucose homeostasis disturbances observed in present GDM model. Also, provide evidence that a hypercaloric diet can mask pregnancy´s physiological hypoglycemia and hypotension without surpassing non-pregnant values. Then, we conclude overweight during pregnancy causes subtle but significant vascular and metabolic damage that might be dismissed in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, stress-related responses play critical roles in glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients. As clinical trials suggest that angiotensin-receptor blocker delays the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients, we investigated the effects of  on stress-induced adipose tissue inflammation and . C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress and orally treated with vehicle, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day . The plasma concentrations of lipid and proinflammatory cytokines [Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6] were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Monocyte/macrophage accumulation in inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) was observed with CD11b-positive cell counts and mRNA expressions of CD68 and F4/80 using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR methods respectively. The mRNA levels of angiotensinogen, proinflammatory cytokines shown above, and adiponectin in WAT were also assessed with RT-PCR method. Glucose metabolism was assessed by glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and  tolerance tests, and mRNA expression of  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in WAT. Restraint stress increased monocyte accumulation, plasma free fatty acids, expression of angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines including MCP-1, and reduced adiponectin.  reduced stress-induced monocyte accumulation in WAT in a dose dependent manner.  treatment also suppressed induction of adipose angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines in WAT and blood, and reversed changes in adiponectin expression. Notably,  suppressed stress-induced reduction in adipose tissue weight and free fatty acid release, and improved  tolerance with restoration of IRS-1 and GLUT4 mRNA expressions in WAT. The results indicate that  improves stress-induced adipose tissue inflammation and . Our results suggests that  treatment exerts additive benefits for glucose metabolism in hypertensive patients with mental stress.</p></html>
