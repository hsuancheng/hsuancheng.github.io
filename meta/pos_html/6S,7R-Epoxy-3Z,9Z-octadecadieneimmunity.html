Some of them are involved in the regulation of virulence in pathogenic bacteria. So far, little is known about sRNAs in Bordetella, and only very few sRNAs have been identified in the genome of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough.An in silico approach was used to predict sRNAs genes in intergenic regions of the B. pertussis genome. The genome sequences of B. pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella avium were compared using a Blast, and significant hits were analyzed using RNAz. Twenty-three candidate regions were obtained, including regions encoding the already documented  RNA, and the GCVT and FMN riboswitches. The existence of sRNAs was verified by Northern blot analyses, and transcripts were detected for 13 out of the 20 additional candidates. These new sRNAs were named Bordetella pertussis RNAs, bpr. The expression of 4 of them differed between the early, exponential and late growth phases, and one of them, bprJ2, was found to be under the control of BvgA/BvgS two-component regulatory system of Bordetella virulence. A phylogenetic study of the bprJ sequence revealed a novel, so far undocumented repeat of ~90 bp, found in numerous copies in the Bordetella genomes and in that of other Betaproteobacteria. This repeat exhibits certain features of mobile elements.We shown here that B. pertussis, like other pathogens, expresses sRNAs, and that the expression of one of them is controlled by the BvgA/BvgS system, similarly to most virulence genes, suggesting that it is involved in virulence of B. pertussis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205241>Why Should We Advocate Maternal Immunization?</a></h1><p>Maternal vaccination provides a method for protecting the pregnant woman, fetus and neonate during a period when there is increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. A dynamic state of immune tolerance during pregnancy and the need to develop adaptive memory to a new foreign antigen-rich environment lead to windows of vulnerability to infection for the mother and neonate, respectively. Passive transfer of humoral  through the placenta and breast milk from the mother can bridge the gap in  for the neonate. Studies on boosting this natural process of antibody transfer have led to the recommendation for administering inactivated influenza, diphtheria, tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccines during pregnancy. Several new maternal vaccine candidates are on the horizon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22038486>Genetic mapping of the Leptosphaeria maculans avirulence gene corresponding to the LepR1 resistance gene of Brassica napus.</a></h1><p>AvrLepR1 of the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans is the avirulence gene that corresponds to Brassica LepR1, a plant gene controlling dominant, race-specific resistance to this pathogen. An in vitro cross between the virulent L. maculans isolate, 87-41, and the avirulent isolate, 99-56, was performed in order to map the AvrLepR1 gene. The disease reactions of the 94 of the resulting F(1) progenies were tested on the canola line ddm-12--1, which carries LepR1. There were 44 avirulent progenies and 50 virulent progenies suggesting a 1:1 segregation ratio and that the avirulence of 99-56 on ddm-12--1 is controlled by a single gene. Tetrad analysis also indicated a 1:1 segregation ratio. The AvrLepR1 gene was positioned on a genetic map of L. maculans relative to 259 sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers, two cloned avirulence genes (AvrLm1 and AvrLm4-7) and the mating type locus (MAT1). The genetic map consisted of 36 linkage groups, ranging in size from 13.1 to 163.7 cM, and spanned a total of 2,076.4 cM. The AvrLepR1 locus was mapped to linkage group 4, in the 13.1 cM interval flanked by the SRAP markers SBG49-110 and FT161-223. The AvrLm4-7 locus was also positioned on linkage group 4, close to but distinct from the AvrLepR1 locus, in the 5.4 cM interval flanked by FT161-223 and P1314-300. This work will make possible the further characterization and map-based cloning of AvrLepR1. A combination of genetic mapping and pathogenicity tests demonstrated that AvrLepR1 is different from each of the L. maculans avirulence genes that have been characterized previously.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061158>A selective prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype 2 (EP2) antagonist increases the macrophage-mediated clearance of amyloid-beta plaques.</a></h1><p>A high-throughput screen resulted in the discovery of benzoxazepine 1, an EP2 antagonist possessing low microsomal stability and potent CYP3A4 inhibition. Modular optimization of lead compound 1 resulted in the discovery of benzoxazepine 52, a molecule with single-digit nM binding affinity for the EP2 receptor and significantly improved microsomal stability. It was devoid of CYP inhibition and was ∼4000-fold selective against the other EP receptors. Compound 52 was shown to have good PK properties in CD-1 mice and high CNS permeability in C57Bl/ mice and Sprague-Dawley rats.

Pneumococcal antibody responses were measured using 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and functional opsonophagocytic activity. Responses to other antigens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adverse events were recorded.One month postprimary vaccination, for each vaccine serotype ≥98% of infants in the < and <6NS groups had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL, except for 6B (≥85%) and 23F (≥89%). Immune responses to PHiD-CV after age-appropriate vaccination in children <2 years did not appear influenced by SCD. All infants were seroprotected/seropositive for diphtheria, tetanus and Bordetella pertussis antigens postprimary and booster vaccination. Safety and reactogenicity profiles were similar in children with or without SCD.PHiD-CV was immunogenic with an acceptable safety profile in children with and without SCD starting vaccination at 8 weeks to 23 months of age.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205250>Group B Streptococcus: Trials and Tribulations.</a></h1><p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is estimated to have caused 319,000 cases of neonatal disease resulting in 90,000 infant deaths globally in 2015. It is also associated with maternal sepsis, preterm births, stillbirths and neonatal encephalopathy. There is a significant burden of neurologic impairment among survivors of infant GBS disease. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis strategies have reduced the incidence of newborn early-onset GBS (occurring days 0-6) in some settings, but they are not feasible in many low and middle-income countries. A maternal vaccine given to pregnant women to stimulate passive transplacental transfer of protective antibodies has the potential to reduce maternal disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and newborn disease. Phase I and II vaccine studies are occurring, but conducting phase III efficacy studies of a GBS vaccine candidate would require very large numbers due to the relatively low incidence of invasive GBS disease. It has therefore been proposed that alternative pathways to vaccine licensure should be explored, for example, through use of a regulatory approved correlate of protection and safety evaluation in mothers, fetuses and infants. These studies would then be followed-up with post-licensure phase IV studies in which vaccine effectiveness is evaluated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29402664>Osteopontin may be a driver of abdominal aortic aneurysm formation.</a></h1><p>Previous in vitro and animal studies have suggested that osteopontin (OPN), an inflammatory extracellular matrix protein, is involved in the formation and growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, the mechanism by which this occurs continues to be nebulous. The relationship between OPN and -suppressing lymphocytes present in the human AAA condition was investigated and presented herein.Serum OPN concentrations were measured in healthy, risk factor-matched non-AAA and AAA patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the source of OPN secretion using aortic tissue collected from multiorgan donors and AAA patients undergoing open surgical repair. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to various inflammatory mediators, and OPN expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. The inflammatory nature of OPN and the aortic wall was determined using a TR1 suppressor cell induction assay as a surrogate and characterized by ELISA and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.OPN was found to be elevated in both the plasma and aortic homogenate of AAA patients compared with controls. On immunohistochemistry, OPN localized to the tunica media of the diseased aorta but was minimally expressed in healthy aorta. In vitro, cigarette smoke extract was the most potent stimulator of OPN secretion by VSMCs and increased both messenger RNA and supernatant concentrations. OPN demonstrated an ability to inhibit the induction of interleukin 10-secreting TR1 lymphocytes, a depleted population in the AAA patient, from naive precursors. Last, neutralizing receptor targets of OPN in the setting of AAA homogenate coincubation abrogated the inhibition of TR1 induction.OPN, secreted by the VSMCs of the tunica media, is elevated in the circulating plasma and aortic wall of patients with AAA. It can inhibit the induction of the TR1 suppressor cell, leading to an overall proinflammatory state contributing to progressive aortic wall breakdown and dilation.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Although the direct-acting antivirals targeting HCV replication have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C, several obstacles persist, including resistance development, potential side-effects, and the prohibitive cost that limits their availability. Furthermore, treatment of HCV re-infection in liver transplantation remains a significant challenge. Developing novel antivirals that target viral entry could help expand the scope of HCV therapeutics and treatment strategies. Herein, we report (4R,)-2-dihydromenisdaurilide (DHMD), a natural butenolide, as an efficient inhibitor of HCV entry. Specifically, DHMD potently inhibited HCV infection at non-cytotoxic concentration. Examination on the viral life cycle demonstrated that DHMD selectively targeted the early steps of infection while leaving viral replication/translation and assembly/release unaffected. Furthermore, DHMD did not induce an antiviral interferon response. Mechanistic dissection of HCV entry revealed that DHMD could inactivate cell-free virus, abrogate viral attachment, and inhibit viral entry/fusion, with the most pronounced effect observed against the viral adsorption phase as validated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. Due to its potency, DHMD may be of value for further development as an entry inhibitor against HCV, particularly for application in transplant setting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3782800>Lipoxin A-induced inhibition of human natural killer cell cytotoxicity: studies on stereospecificity of inhibition and mode of action.</a></h1><p>Human leukocyte-derived lipoxin A (LXA; 5S,-6R,15S-trihydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid) inhibits the cytotoxic activity of human natural killer (NK) cells. LXA and three of its isomers were prepared by total organic synthesis and assayed for activity with human NK cells. Dose-response studies showed that biologically derived LXA and synthetic LXA were equally effective in inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity. -LXA, with its -OH group in an (S) configuration, proved to be approximately half as potent as LXA. In contrast, -11-trans-LXA and 11-trans-LXA displayed virtually no inhibitory activities. The methyl esters of both LXA and -LXA proved to be more potent than their corresponding free acids. Thus, LXA inhibition of NK cells displays clear-cut stereochemistry. In the absence of putative inhibitors, NK cells bind to their targets to form conjugates. This event is followed by polarization of the NK Golgi apparatus, which moves towards the plasma membrane that is in contact with the target cell. However, in the presence of either the methyl ester or free acid of LXA, the Golgi apparati of NK cells bound to their targets were randomly oriented. In contrast, neither -11-trans-LXA nor the potent NK inhibitor prostaglandin E2 affected the polarization. Furthermore, although prostaglandin E2 resulted in a decrease in NK-target cell binding efficiency, LXA and its isomers failed to affect conjugate formation. Together these results indicate that LXA-induced inhibition of NK cytotoxicity does not act on NK cell binding but may block cytotoxicity by disrupting "signals" involved in the specific orientation of the Golgi. Thus, this latter event may appear to be important in cytotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11713830>DNA priming and recombinant pox virus boosters for an AIDS vaccine.</a></h1><p>Eight different protocols for immunization have been compared for the ability to raise protection against immunodeficiency virus challenges in rhesus macaques.

To facilitate the transfer of these genes into wheat, information on their chromosomal location is important. A genetic linkage map of Ae. sharonensis was constructed based on 179 F2 plants derived from a cross between accessions resistant (1644) and susceptible (1193) to wheat leaf rust. The linkage map was based on 389 markers (377 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci) and was comprised of 10 linkage groups, ranging from 2.3 to 124.6 cM. The total genetic length of the map was 818.0 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 3.63 cM. Based on the chromosomal location of 115 markers previously mapped in wheat, the four linkage groups of A, B, C, and E were assigned to Ae. sharonensis (S(sh)) and homoeologous wheat chromosomes 6, 1, 3, and 2. The single dominant gene (designated LrAeSh1644) conferring resistance to leaf rust race THBJ in accession 1644 was positioned on linkage group A (chromosome (sh)) and was flanked by DArT markers wpt-9881 (at 1.9 cM distal from the gene) and wpt-6925 (4.5 cM proximal). This study clearly demonstrates the utility of DArT for genotyping uncharacterized species and tagging resistance genes where pertinent genomic information is lacking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14219073>THE IMMUNOLOGIC BEHAVIOR OF BABY PIGS.

Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is an important disease of wheat that can be controlled by effective stem rust resistance (Sr) genes. The emergence of virulent Pgt races in Africa, namely Ug99 and its variants, has stimulated the search for new Sr genes and genetic characterization of known sources of resistance. Triumph 64 is a winter wheat cultivar that carries gene SrTmp, which confers resistance to Ug99. The goals of this study were to genetically map SrTmp and examine its relationship with other Sr genes occupying a similar chromosome location. A doubled haploid (DH) population from the cross LMPG-/Triumph 64 was inoculated with Ug99 at the seedling stage. A single gene conditioning resistance to Ug99 segregated in the population. Genetic mapping with SSR markers placed SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS in a region similar to SrCad and Sr42. SNP markers developed for SrCad were used to further map SrTmp and were also added to a genetic map of Sr42 using a DH population (LMPG-/Norin 40). Three SNP markers that co-segregated with SrTmp also co-segregated with SrCad and Sr42. The SNP markers showed no difference in the map locations of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42. Multi-race testing with DH lines from the Triumph 64 and Norin 40 populations and a recombinant inbred-line population from the cross LMPG-/AC Cadillac showed that SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42 confer different spectra of resistance. Markers closely linked to SrTmp are suitable for marker-assisted breeding and germplasm development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4181833>The enhancement of bacterial phagocytosis by serum. The role of complement components and two cofactors.</a></h1><p>The role of serum factors in the phagocytosis of pneumococci was studied employing a spectrophotometric assay which measures reduced nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) dye. Dye reduction occurs within the phagocyte shortly after bacterial ingestion as measured by the phagocytic index technique and by the uptake of (125)I-pneumococci. Bacteria prepared with gammaG antibody were not phagocytosed unless a small volume of fresh normal serum was added. Using fresh sera deficient in single complement components, it was demonstrated that the first four components are necessary for optimal bacterial phagocytosis. When highly purified complement components were added to the antibody-coated pneumococci, enhancement of phagocytosis was achieved only with the sequential addition of C1, C4, C2, and C3. Evidence has been presented that human C3 bound to an immune complex exhibits peptidase activity and that this activity is essential for phagocytosis. A heat-labile, dialyzable serum cofactor which enhances C3 peptidase activity enhanced the phagocytosis of pneumococci prepared with purified complement components. A second phagocytosis-promoting cofactor, which is not a complement component, was found to be a heat-labile, 5-, beta pseudoglobulin. This protein may stabilize C3 peptidase activity or inhibit enzymatic inactivation of C3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9449524>Vaccine evaluation studies of replication-defective SIVsmB7.</a></h1><p>Non-infectious virus-like particles of SIVsmB7 that expresses env and gag gene products but are defective in pol and vpx/vpr were assessed for their ability to induce protective  against infection with pathogenic SIVsmE660 in rhesus macaques. Animals were immunized in three groups: group A was primed with cell-associated SIVsmB7 and boosted with cell-free SIVsmB7; group B was primed with cell-free SIVsmB7 and boosted with cell-free SIVsmB7 conjugated to iron oxide microbeads; group C was primed with cell-free SIVsmB7 mixed with Titer Max adjuvant and boosted with cell-free SIVsmB7 mixed with SAF-M adjuvant followed by secondary boosting with cell-free SIVsmB7 conjugated to microbeads. Animals were challenged intravenously with 20 animal infectious doses of SIVsmE660 grown in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 weeks after final boosting. All animals became infected as evidenced by quantitative virus cultivation. Sera from immunized animals contained low-titer antibodies by ELISA and low or undetectable neutralizing antibodies on the day of challenge but strong anamnestic antibody responses were observed following challenge. Interestingly, 2 of 3 animals in group A showed evidence of transient viremia and more stable CD4 counts following challenge as compared to the other immunized animals and to non-immunized controls. Thus, immunization with cell-associated SIVsmB7 did not provide sterilizing  against challenge with a highly pathogenic SIV strain but might have caused virus clearance later in infection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28538291>Subclinical Antibody-Mediated Rejection.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1953918>Immunoregulation of asthma: control of T-lymphocyte activation in the respiratory tract.</a></h1><p>Allergic asthma results ultimately from inappropriate responses to non-pathogenic airborn antigens by the respiratory tract T-cell system. In order to understand how sensitization to inhaled antigens develops, it is necessary to precisely define the tissue microenvironments within which T-cells occur in the respiratory tract, and to analyse the factor(s) which regulate their local activation. This review focuses upon recent data on the distribution of T-cells and antigen presenting cells within the lung and airway tissues of man and experimental animals, and examines the available information on their responses to antigenic stimulation. We argue that in the steady state, respiratory tract T-cells are tightly regulated by a series of inherent and acquired immunosuppressive control mechanisms, which normally limit local T-cell activation to situations where antigenic exposure is accompanied by an inflammatory stimulus, such as the case with incoming pathogenic microorganisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28652742>ATIQCTPC: a nanomedicine capable of targeting tumor and blocking thrombosis in vivo.</a></h1><p>To overcome the harmful side effects, low tolerance, and undesirable outcomes of the anticancer drugs, we used ethane-1,2-diamine to bridge antitumoral ()-3-acetyl-4-oxo-tetrahydroindolo[2,3-a]quinolizine-6-carboxylic acid (ATIQC) and tumor-targeting d-glucuronic acid, thereby providing (6)-3-acetyl-4-oxo--(2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-carboxamido)ethyl)-4,6,7,12-tetrahydroindolo[2,3-a]quinolizine-6-carboxamide (ATIQCTPC). Atomic force microscopy images visualized, that in serum, ATIQCTPC formed particles of height <81 nm. These particles effectively avoided phagocytosis of macrophages and were stable in blood circulation. Distribution analysis indicated that ATIQCTPC accumulated and released ATIQC in the tumor tissue through a targeting manner. Thus, the antitumor and the anti-thrombotic activities of ATIQCTPC were 100-fold higher than those of ATIQC, and ATIQCTPC was able to prevent cancer patients from suffering from thrombosis. Based on the observation that ATIQCTPC decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in S180 mice, we hypothesized that this is the mechanism that ATIQCTPC utilized to slow tumor growth. Additionally, we observed that ATIQCTPC inhibited thrombosis by decreasing serum P-selectin of thrombotic rats. The intermolecular association and the hexamerization manner of ATIQCTPC were experimentally evidenced and correlated with the formation of the nanoparticles.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10438051>Induction of mucosal antibody responses by microsphere-encapsulated formalin-inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus in a male urethral challenge model.</a></h1><p>Male rhesus macaques were immunized mucosally with microsphere-encapsulated formalin-inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) particles in a test of immunogenicity and protection against mucosal SIV challenge. Tracheal boosting of animals that had been primed intramuscularly resulted in strong serum ELISA titers to SIV, and evidence of local IgA responses in broncho-alveolar washes. The bulk of the antibody response was against non-envelope epitopes. No neutralizing antibody was observed, and intraurethral challenge with cell-free rhesus-grown virus showed no evidence of protection against infection.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and their interactions with sirtuins play an important role in regulating intermediary metabolism in this process. However, there is little research into whether PARP inhibition affects alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH/NASH).We investigated the effects of genetic deletion of PARP1 and pharmacological inhibition of PARP in models of early alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as on Kupffer cell activation in vitro using biochemical assays, real-time PCR, and histological analyses. The effects of PARP inhibition were also evaluated in high fat or methionine and choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis models in mice.PARP activity was increased in livers due to excessive alcohol intake, which was associated with decreased NAD content and SIRT1 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP restored the hepatic NAD content, attenuated the decrease in SIRT1 activation and beneficially affected the metabolic-, inflammatory-, and oxidative stress-related alterations due to alcohol feeding in the liver. PARP1 animals were protected against alcoholic steatohepatitis and pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of PARP1 also attenuated Kupffer cell activation in vitro. Furthermore, PARP inhibition decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation, metabolic dysregulation, or  and/or fibrosis in models of NASH.Our results suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in steatohepatitis with high translational potential, considering the availability of PARP inhibitors for clinical treatment of cancer.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are the most abundant nuclear enzymes. The PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza) is a recently FDA-approved therapy for cancer. This study shows that PARP is overactivated in livers of subjects with alcoholic liver disease and that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme with 3 different PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, attenuates high fat or alcohol induced liver injury, abnormal metabolic alteration, fat accumulation,  and/or fibrosis in preclinical models of liver disease. These results suggest that PARP inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374266>Monoclonal and oligoclonal TCR AV and BV gene usage in CD4 T cells from pigs immunised with C-strain CSFV vaccine.</a></h1><p>The classical swine fever virus C-strain vaccine (C-strain vaccine) plays a vital role in preventing and controlling the spread of classical swine fever (CSF). However, the protective mechanisms of C-strain vaccine and cellular immunity conferred by T cell receptors (TCRs) are less well defined. We aimed to analyse the association between the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) spectratype of αβTCR in CD4 T cells and C-strain vaccine; and to find conserved CDR3 amino acid motifs in specific TCR α- and β-chains. We found that the CDR3 spectratype showed dynamic changes correlating with C-strain vaccine immunisation and that TCR AV5S/8-3S/8-4S/14/38 and BV4S//7S/15S/30 gene families showed clonal expansion in immunised pigs. The sequences of CDR3 from these clonally expanded T cells indicated a high frequency of the 'KLX' motif in the TCR α chain and the 'GGX' motif in β chain, and Jα39, Jα43, Jβ2.5 and Jβ2.3 genes were also found in high frequency.

This species has been recorded in summer on the French Atlantic coast, over a number of years. It was never abundant in the plankton and was very often associated with Fragilidium subglobosum, Pyrophacus horologium and also with toxigenic species of the genera Alexandrium and Dinophysis. Phagotrophy of F. duplocampanaeforme on Dinophysis prey is shown, and sexual reproduction is suggested by the observation of gamete-like small forms. The size and the peculiar shape of its cells do not correspond to any known taxon, but the plate arrangement fits the genus Fragilidium. The plate formula is Po, Pc, 4', 8'', 10c, ?, 7''', 2"", 1p. A close examination of the plate morphology reveals an apical closing platelet Pc and significant differences from known Fragilidium species. Plate ornamentation is complex. A longitudinal fold and an unusual optional pore are seen on the antapical plate 2"". Other distinctive morphological features are emphasized which discriminate this new species from others of the genus Fragilidium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205238>Viral Bacterial Interactions in Children: Impact on Clinical Outcomes.</a></h1><p>Respiratory viral infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in children < 5 years of age worldwide. Among all respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the world's leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. There are known populations at risk for severe disease but the majority of children who require hospitalization for RSV infection are previously healthy. Viral and host factors have been associated with the pathogenesis of RSV disease; however, the mechanisms that explain the wide variability in the clinical presentation are not completely understood. Recent studies suggest that the complex interaction between the respiratory microbiome, the host's immune response and the virus may have an impact on the pathogenesis and severity of RSV infection. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding the epidemiologic link, the mechanisms of viral-bacterial interactions, and the associations between the upper respiratory tract microbiome and RSV disease severity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6353818>[Comparative immunomorphological study of the immunogenic activity of dysentery vaccines produced by different methods].</a></h1><p>The morphological study of the ophthalmic mucosa of guinea pigs immunized locally with different dysentery vaccines has demonstrated the advantages of live dysentery vaccine prepared from Shigella sonnei  over heated vaccine and Shigella antigen extracts. The protective properties of dysentery vaccines, their capacity for protecting the mucous membrane from the penetration and intracellular multiplication of shigellae correlates with the degree of the manifestation of vaccine-induced plasmatocellular reaction in the epithelial and subepithelial zones. The importance of the virulence of the strains used for the preparation of vaccines, as well as the method of their preparation, for the immunogenic potency of vaccines is shown.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1705198>Macrophage vitronectin receptor, CD36, and thrombospondin cooperate in recognition of neutrophils undergoing programmed cell death.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/772131>Delayed hypersensitivity to fungal antigens in mice. II. Characterization of the active component in immunogenic RNA extracts.</a></h1><p>In a mouse model, cell-mediated  to Coccidioides immitis, as assayed by the delayed hypersensitivity skin test, was transferred with whole immunogenic RNA extract and its greater than 33S and -13S sedimentation fractions. Both fractions were cleaved by RNase, but the products retained their transfer activity. The greater than 33S fraction of immunogenic RNA extract was inactivated by pronase, whereas the -13S fraction was resistant to the proteolytic enzyme; however, after RNase treatment the latter fraction was sensitive to pronase. This finding suggests a protective role for RNA. Dialysis of immunogenic RNA extract yielded a dialysate with a ratio of absorbance at 260 nm to that at 280 nm (A260:A280) of 1.02. Similarly, the dialysis product of RNase-treated RNA is active and has an A260:A280 ratio of 1.34. The data indicate that at least part of the active moiety of immunogenic RNA extracts is an RNA-associated, pronase-labile peptide or nucleopeptide. Furthermore, it is possible that the dialyzable transfer factor may be the same peptide or nucleopeptide cleaved from immunogenic RNA during preparation of the transfer factor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321605>Tear film inflammatory cytokine upregulation in contact lens discomfort.</a></h1><p>To investigate the ocular inflammatory response, using clinical and immunological techniques, in people experiencing contact lens (CL) discomfort.This study involved 38 adults who were full-time, silicone-hydrogel CL wearers. Participants were categorized into groups based upon a validated CL dry-eye questionnaire (CLDEQ-8) (n = 17 'asymptomatic', CLDEQ-8 score <9; n = 21 'symptomatic', CLDEQ-8 score ≥13). Examinations were performed at two visits (one with, and one without, CL wear), separated by one-week. Testing included: tear osmolarity, ocular redness, tear stability, ocular surface staining, meibography, tear production and tear collection. Tear osmolarity was taken from the inferior-lateral and superior-lateral menisci. The 'Inferior-Superior Osmotic Difference', I-SOD, was the absolute osmolarity difference between these menisci. Concentrations of seven cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were assayed from basal tears using multiplex cytometric bead array.At baseline, there was no significant difference in key clinical signs between asymptomatic and symptomatic CL wearers (p > 0.05). The I-SOD was greater in symptomatic than asymptomatic CL wearers (23.1 ± 2.6 versus 11.3 ± 1.4 mOsmol/L, p = 0.001). People experiencing CL discomfort had higher tear IL-17A (122.6 ± 23.7 versus 44.0 ± 10.0 pg/mL, p = 0.02) and reduced tear stability (6.3 ± 1.1 versus 10.4 ± 1.6 s, p = 0.03) after several hours of CL wear. Tear IL-17A levels correlated with both the I-SOD (r = 0.43, p = 0.01) and CLDEQ-8 score (r = 0.40, p = 0.01).CL discomfort occurs in individuals having no clinical dry eye signs, and is associated with higher tear levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A. These findings support an association between the discomfort response and low-grade, ocular surface .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The primary difficulty in mapping genes is determining which chromosome carries the gene of interest. Several approaches have been developed to address this problem, each with advantages and disadvantages. Here we describe a new approach called multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA). A set of 423 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected based on profile simplicity, frequency of polymorphism, and distribution across the wheat genome. SSR primers were preloaded in 384-well PCR plates with each primer occupying 16 wells. In practice, 14 wells are reserved for "mini-bulks" that are equivalent to four gametes (e.g. two F(2) individuals) comprised of individuals from a segregated population that have a known homozygous genotype for the gene of interest. The remaining two wells are reserved for the parents of the population. Each well containing a mini-bulk can have one of three allele compositions for each SSR: only the allele from one parent, only the allele from the other parent, or both alleles. Simulation experiments were performed to determine the pattern of mini-bulk allele composition that would indicate putative linkage between the SSR in question and the gene of interest. As a test case, MBSA was employed to locate an unidentified stem rust resistance (Sr) gene in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40. A doubled haploid (DH) population (n = 267) was produced from hybrids of the cross LMPG-/Norin 40. The DH population segregated for a single gene (χ (1:1) (2) = 0.093, p = 0.76) for resistance to Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici race LCBN. Four resistant DH lines were included in each of the 14 mini-bulks for screening. The Sr gene was successfully located to the long arm of chromosome 2D using MBSA. Further mapping confirmed the chromosome location and revealed that the Sr gene was located in a linkage block that may represent an alien translocation. The new Sr gene was designated as Sr54.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672507>Apoptosis is associated with an inhibition of aminophospholipid translocase (APTL) in CNS-derived HN2-5 and HOG cells and phosphatidylserine is a recognition molecule in microglial uptake of the apoptotic HN2-5 cells.</a></h1><p>A balance of the activities of multiple enzymes maintains the typical asymmetry of plasma membrane lipids in healthy cells. Such enzyme activities are (a) the aminophopholipid translocase (APTL) (a lipid-selective P-type ATPase that catalyzes inward movement of aminophospholipids), (b) the scramblase (a calcium-dependent and ATP-independent enzyme that catalyzes both inward and outward movement of lipids), (c) the floppase (an ATP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes only outward movement of lipids). Activation or inhibition of any one of these enzymes would lead to a loss in this asymmetry. Apoptosis-associated externalization of phophatidylserine has been reported for many different cell-types, but the exact mechanism involved in this loss of membrane asymmetry has not been identified yet. In this report we demonstrate concurrence of APTL inhibition, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in CNS-derived HN2-5 and HOG cells. Additionally, we provide data to demonstrate that the phagocytosis of apoptotic, CNS-derived HN2-5 cells by the microglial cells requires recognition through phosphatidylserine (PS). Thus the enzyme aminopholipid translocase is inhibited during apoptosis of CNS-derived cells and this alone could account for the loss of plasma membrane lipid-asymmetry observed in these cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4097977>Studies in vivo and in vitro on an abnormality in the metabolism of C3 in a patient with increased susceptibility to infection.</a></h1><p>In a patient with increased susceptibility to infection, lowered serum C3 concentration, and continuously circulating C3b, it was shown that purified (125)I-labeled C3 was converted to labeled C3b shortly after intravenous administration. The fractional catabolic rate of C3 was approximately five times normal at 10% of the plasma pool per hr. The synthesis rate and pool distribution of C3 were normal. Despite this evidence of C3 instability in vivo, no accelerated inactivation of C3 was found in vitro. Similarly, no free proteolytic activity could be detected in the patient's serum, and serum concentrations of known protease inhibitors were normal.Complement-mediated functions, which were markedly deficient in the patient's serum, could be restored partially or completely by the addition of a 5- heat-labile beta pseudoglobulin from normal serum. The C3 proinactivator, which has these physicochemical characteristics, was also shown to be either absent or nonfunctional in the patient's serum. An unidentified  beta pseudoglobulin to which a monospecific antiserum was available was not detectable in the patient's serum. This last protein appeared not to be a complement component, nor was it the C3 inactivator or proinactivator. Finally, the substance or substances necessary for the conversion of C3b to C3c were missing from the patient's serum. The administration of 500 ml of normal plasma to the patient corrected all of his abnormalities partially or completely for as long as 17 days. The changes in C3 were dramatic; serum concentration rose from 8 to 70 mg/100 ml, and C3b could no longer be detected. A second metabolic study during this normalization period showed a decrease in fractional catabolic rate toward normal. The patient's histamine excretion was constantly elevated but increased further after a warm shower and after receiving normal plasma; at both times he had urticaria. These observations were consistent with the endogenous production of C3a and the resulting histamine release from mast cells. The inactivating mechanism for C3a was apparently intact in the patient's serum. The difference in the electrophoretic mobilities of C3b and C3c was shown as well as the electrophoretic heterogeneity of C3c. Suggestive evidence was also presented that the form of C3 with an activated combining site for red cells, previously postulated by others, is a transient C3 conversion product with an electrophoretic mobility slower than that of C3 on agarose electrophoresis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27402897>A computational strategy for the search of regulatory small RNAs in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.</a></h1><p>Bacterial regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles in gene regulation and are frequently connected to the expression of virulence factors in diverse bacteria. Only a few sRNAs have been described for Pasteurellaceae pathogens and no in-depth analysis of sRNAs has been described for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, responsible for considerable losses in the swine industry. To search for sRNAs in A. pleuropneumoniae, we developed a strategy for the computational analysis of the bacterial genome by using four algorithms with different approaches, followed by experimental validation. The coding strand and expression of 17 out of 23 RNA candidates were confirmed by Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. Among them, two are likely riboswitches, three are housekeeping regulatory RNAs, two are the widely studied GcvB and  sRNAs, and 10 are putative novel trans-acting sRNAs, never before described for any bacteria. The latter group has several potential mRNA targets, many of which are involved with virulence, stress resistance, or metabolism, and connect the sRNAs in a complex gene regulatory network. The sRNAs identified are well conserved among the Pasteurellaceae that are evolutionarily closer to A. pleuropneumoniae and/or share the same host. Our results show that the combination of newly developed computational programs can be successfully utilized for the discovery of novel sRNAs and indicate an intricate system of gene regulation through sRNAs in A. pleuropneumoniae and in other Pasteurellaceae, thus providing clues for novel aspects of virulence that will be explored in further studies.© 2016 Rossi et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589238>An expanded taxonomy of hepatitis C virus genotype 6: Characterization of 22 new full-length viral genomes.</a></h1><p>We characterized the full-length genomes of 22 hepatitis C virus genotype 6 (HCV-6) isolates: 10 from Vietnam (classified into subtypes 6e, 6h, 6p, 6r, , and 6u), one from China (confirmed as a new subtype 6xd), and 11 from the Lao PDR (representing a new subtype 6xe plus eight novel variants). With these 22 new genomes, HCV-6 now has a diverse and extended taxonomic structure, comprised of 28 assigned subtypes (denoted 6a-6xe) and 27 unassigned lineages, all of which have been represented by full-length genomes. Our phylogenetic analyses also included many partially-sequenced novel variants of HCV-6 from Lao PDR. This revealed that Lao HCV isolates are genetically very diverse and are phylogenetically distributed in multiple lineages within genotype 6. Our results suggest that HCV-6 has been maintained in Laos, a landlocked country, since the common ancestor of genotype 6 and indicates historical dispersal of HCV-6 across Southeast Asia.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Uncertainties remain about the antigens implicated and their role in inducing rupture. Because antigens from the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been suspected, the aim of this experimental study was to characterize the role of adaptive  directed against antigens from the aortic ECM.In a first step, an experimental model of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture based on adaptive  against the ECM was developed and characterized. Forty 4-week-old male Lewis rats were divided into two groups. In the ECM group (n = 20), rats were presensitized against the guinea pig aortic ECM before implantation of a decellularized aortic xenograft (DAX). In the control group (n = 20), rats were not presensitized before DAX implantation. In each group, half the rats were sacrificed at day 3 to analyze early mechanisms involved after DAX implantation. In a second step, we aimed to assess which ECM component was most efficient in inducing rupture. For this purpose, the nonfibrillar and fibrillar ECM components were sequentially extracted from the guinea pig aortic wall. Forty Lewis rats were then divided into four groups. Each group was presensitized against one ECM component (structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans, collagen, elastin alone, and elastin-associated glycoproteins) before DAX implantation. Apart from those that experienced rupture, rats were sacrificed at day 21. Xenografts were harvested for histologic, immunofluorescence, and conditioned medium analyses.In total, early aortic rupture occurred in 80% of the ECM group vs 0% of the control group (P < .001). In the ECM group, major circumferential immunoglobulin deposits were observed in combination with the C3 complement fraction, without cell infiltration. Conditioned medium analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 and myeloperoxidase levels and elastase activities were significantly increased in this group. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that myeloperoxidase co-localized with tissue-free DNA and histone H4, highlighting local neutrophil activation and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Following differential presensitization, it appeared that rats presensitized against structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans were significantly more susceptible to rupture after DAX implantation.Stimulating adaptive  against the aortic ECM, especially structural glycoproteins and proteoglycans, triggers rupture after DAX implantation. Further studies are needed to assess the precise proteins involved.Copyright © 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
