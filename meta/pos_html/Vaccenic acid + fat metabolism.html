Trans- (TVA) is a naturally occurring TFA found in the  of ruminants and in human dairy products. The present study was conducted to investigate the anticancer activity and underlying mechanisms of TVA on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 5-8F and CNE-2 cells.A CCK8 assay was used to determine the effect of TVA and the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 on the proliferation of NPC cells. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of factors associated with Bcl-2-family protein signaling and Akt signaling.TVA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that TVA significantly decreased p-Akt levels and Bad phosphorylation on Ser-136 and Ser-112. More importantly, we discovered that the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 synergistically sensitized NPC cells to apoptosis induction by TVA.TVA can inhibit NPC cell growth and induced apoptosis through the inhibition of Bad/Akt phosphorylation. The combined use of TVA and Mcl-1 inhibitors offers a potential advantage for nasopharyngeal cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27883264>Mucosa-associated biohydrogenating microbes protect the simulated colon microbiome from stress associated with high concentrations of poly-unsaturated .</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may affect colon microbiome homeostasis by exerting (specific) antimicrobial effects and/or interfering with mucosal biofilm formation at the gut mucosal interface. We used standardized batch incubations and the Mucosal-Simulator of the Human Microbial Intestinal Ecosystem (M-SHIME) to show the in vitro luminal and mucosal effects of the main PUFA in the Western diet, linoleic acid (LA). High concentrations of LA were found to decrease butyrate production and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii numbers dependent on LA biohydrogenation to  (VA) and stearic acid (SA). In faecal batch incubations, LA biohydrogenation and butyrate production were positively correlated and SA did not inhibit butyrate production. In the M-SHIME, addition of a mucosal environment stimulated biohydrogenation to SA and protected F. prausnitzii from inhibition by LA. This was probably due to the preference of two biohydrogenating genera Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio for the mucosal niche. Co-culture batch incubations using Roseburia hominis and F. prausnitzii validated these observations. Correlations networks further uncovered the central role of Roseburia and Pseudobutyrivibrio in protecting luminal and mucosal SHIME microbiota from LA-induced stress. Our results confirm how cross-shielding interactions provide resilience to the microbiome and demonstrate the importance of biohydrogenating, mucosal bacteria for recovery from LA stress.© 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27904041>Fatty Acid β-Oxidation Plays a Key Role in Regulating cis-Palmitoleic Acid Levels in the Liver.</a></h2><p>Different monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) species have distinct pathophysiological activities. cis-Palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) was previously reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal studies. The proportions of hepatic MUFAs are generally considered to reflect changes in the activities of fatty acid modifications (∆9 desaturation and fatty acid elongation). However, hepatic levels of 16:1n-7 are markedly lower than those of oleic acid (18:1n-9). Nevertheless, no convincing explanation has yet been provided for the low level of 16:1n-7. We hypothesized that fatty acid degradation plays a key role in maintaining a low 16:1n-7 proportion in the liver. In order to corroborate the link between β-oxidation and the proportion of 16:1n-7, rats were fed a control diet, fed a -free diet to up-regulate fatty acid modifications, but not β-oxidation, or treated with clofibric acid to up-regulate fatty acid modifications and β-oxidation. The nutritional manipulation markedly increased the proportions of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and cis- (18:1n-7). Although the pharmacological manipulation enhanced fatty acid modifications to largely the same extent as the nutritional manipulation and markedly elevated the proportion of 18:1n-9, those of 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-7 remained largely unchanged. The oxidation rates of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and 18:1n-7 in liver slices were in the following order: 16:1n-7>18:1n-7≑18:1n-9 in control livers, and were increased by the pharmacological manipulation and decreased by the nutritional manipulation. These results strongly suggest that β-oxidation, in concert with fatty acid modifications, plays a key role in regulating the MUFA profile and is crucially involved in maintaining low 16:1n-7 levels in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30594358>The effect of oak tannin (Quercus robur) and hops (Humulus lupulus) on dietary nitrogen efficiency, methane emission, and milk fatty acid composition of dairy cows fed a low-protein diet including linseed.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to test the effects of inclusion of hop pellets (HP) and oak tannin extracts (OT) alone or in combination on N efficiency, methane (CH) emission, and milk production and composition in 2 experiments with dairy cows fed low-N rations supplemented with linseed. In both experiments, 6 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 duplicated Latin square design (21-d periods). Cows were fed a total mixed ration at a restricted level to meet their nutrient requirements. In experiment 1, 169 g dry matter (DM) of OT or 56 g DM of HP was included separately in the control diet (C1). In experiment 2, the additives were included together (OT-HP) in the control diet (C2) similar to C1. Diet C2 was compared with a control without linseed (C0). In experiment 1, the supplementation of the control diet with OT decreased urinary N excretion by 12%. In experiment 2, the combination of OT and HP decreased urinary N by 7%. Oak tannin extracts and HP alone or in combination did not influence the daily enteric CH production of cows. Cows fed diet C0 produced 17% more enteric CH daily than those fed diet C2. Intake of diet C2, which contained 6.7% extruded linseed on a DM basis (experiment 2), decreased the sum of 6:0 to 14:0 fatty acids (-16%) and palmitic acid (-26%) and increased the stearic acid (+50%), oleic acid (+36%),  (trans-11 18:1; +285%), rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11 18:2; +235%), and α-linolenic acid (+100%) in milk . The supplementation of diet C2 with the OT-HP mixture further improved the milk's fatty acid composition. Intake of the OT alone increased α-linolenic acid by 17.7% (experiment 1). The results of this study show that at the economically acceptable dose we tested, hops had no effect on urinary N excretion, CH emission, milk production, and milk composition. By contrast, supplementation of diets with oak tannin extract can be considered for reducing urinary N excretion. The combination of oak tannin and hops had no more effect than oak tannin alone except on the milk fatty acid profile, which was favorably influenced from a nutritional point of view.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

This meta-analysis was carried out using only data from trials including a control diet without  supplementation. The dependent variables were defined by the mean differences between values from EL-supplemented groups and values from control groups. The data were processed by regression testing the dose effect, multivariable regression testing the effect of each potential interfering factor associated with the dose effect, and then stepwise regression with backward elimination procedure with all potential interfering factors retained in previous steps. This entire strategy was also applied to a restricted data set, including only trials conducted inside a practical range of  feeding (only supplemented diets with <60 g of /kg of dry matter and supplemented with <600 g of  from EL). The whole data set consisted of 17 publications, representing 21 control diets and 29 EL-supplemented diets. The daily intake of  from EL supplementation ranged from 87 to 1,194 g/cow per day. The dry matter intake was numerically reduced in high- diets. Extruded linseed supplementation increased milk yield (0.72 kg/d in the restricted data set) and decreased milk protein content by a dilutive effect (-0.58 g/kg in the restricted data set). No effect of dose or diet was identified on dry matter intake, milk yield, or milk protein content. Milk  content decreased when EL was supplemented to diets with high proportion of corn silage in the forage (-2.8 g/kg between low and high corn silage-based diets in the restricted data set) but did not decrease when the diet contained alfalfa hay. Milk trans-10 18:1 proportion increased when EL was supplemented to high corn silage-based diets. A shift in ruminal biohydrogenation pathways, from trans-11 18:1 to trans-10 18:1, probably occurred when supplementing EL with high corn silage-based diets related to a change in the activity or composition of the microbial equilibrium in the rumen. The sum of pairs 4:0 to 14:0 (FA synthesized de novo by the udder), palmitic acid, and the sum of saturated FA decreased linearly, whereas oleic acid, , rumenic acid, α-linolenic acid, and the sums of mono- and polyunsaturated FA increased linearly when the daily intake of  from EL was increased. In experimental conditions, EL supplementation increased linearly proportions of potentially human health-beneficial FA in milk (i.e., oleic acid, , rumenic acid, α-linolenic acid, total polyunsaturated FA), but should be used cautiously in corn silage-based diets.The Authors.

We hypothesized that linseed oil in combination with malate (a key propionate precursor in the rumen) would increase ∆9 unsaturated fatty acids and specific gene expression in somatic cells and mammary glands of lactating goats. Twelve lactating goats were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments included the basal diet (CON), the CON plus 4% linseed oil (LO), and the CON plus 4% linseed oil and 2% -malate (LOM). Relative to CON, the LO and LOM supplements increased the daily intake of palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), oleic (18:1-9), linoleic (18:2-6), α-linolenic (18:3-3), and γ-linolenic acids (18:2-6); α-linolenic acid intake was increased over 9-fold, from 6.77 to over 51 g/d ( < 0.02). The LO and LOM supplements increased daily milk yield, milk  yield, and milk  percentage ( < 0.05). The LOM supplement also increased milk lactose percentage and daily yield ( = 0.03). Both the LO and LOM supplements increased plasma glucose and total cholesterol and decreased plasma β-hydroxbutyrate concentrations ( = 0.03). The LO and LOM supplements increased concentrations of stearic acid; - (TVA; 18:1-11); -9, -11 CLA; -10 -12 CLA; and α-linolenic acid in rumen fluid and increased the concentrations of oleic acid; TVA; -9, -11 CLA; -10, -12 CLA; and α-linolenic acid in plasma lipids and milk  ( < 0.05). Conversely, the LO and LOM supplements decreased short- and medium-chain SFA, including lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0), and palmitic acids, in plasma and milk  ( < 0.05). Relative mRNA levels for and () gene expression were increased in somatic cells and mammary gland tissue by LO and LOM ( < 0.05). We conclude that the higher intake and ruminal production of stearic acid promoted SCD gene expression in somatic cells and mammary tissue. Furthermore, milk somatic cells are a suitable substitute for documenting treatment effects of dietary oils on gene expression in goat mammary tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121959>Lipidomic and proteomic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans  droplets and identification of ACS-4 as a  droplet-associated protein.</a></h2><p> droplets are cytoplasmic organelles that store neutral lipids for membrane synthesis and energy reserves. In this study, we characterized the  and protein composition of purified Caenorhabditis elegans  droplets. These  droplets are composed mainly of triacylglycerols, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer composed primarily of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acid composition of the triacylglycerols is rich in fatty acid species obtained from the dietary Escherichia coli, including cyclopropane fatty acids and cis-. Unlike other organisms, C. elegans  droplets contain very little cholesterol or cholesterol esters. Comparison of the  droplet proteomes of wild type and high- daf-2 mutant strains shows a very similar proteome in both strains, except that the most abundant protein in the C. elegans  droplet proteome, MDT-28, is relatively less abundant in  droplets isolated from daf-2 mutants. Functional analysis of  droplet proteins identified in our proteomic studies indicated an enrichment of proteins required for growth and  homeostasis in C. elegans. Finally, we confirmed the localization of one of the newly identified  droplet proteins, ACS-4. We found that ACS-4 localizes to the surface of  droplets in the C. elegans intestine and skin. This study bolsters C. elegans as a model to study the dynamics and functions of  droplets in a multicellular organism.Copyright © 2015.

A total of twenty-one Boer goats (5 months old; 31.66±1.07 kg body weight) were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments with n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios of 2.27:1 (LR), 5.01:1 (MR) and 10.38:1 (HR), fed at 3.7% of body weight. After 100 days of feeding, all goats were slaughtered and the longissimus dorsi muscle was sampled for analysis of fatty acids and gene expression. The dietary treatments did not affect (P>0.05) the carcass traits, and meat quality of growing goats. The concentrations of cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid, trans , polyunsaturated fatty acids, and unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios linearly increased (P<0.01) with decreasing dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios, especially for LR in the longissimus dorsi muscle of goats. In contrast, the mRNA expression level of the PPARα and PPARγ was down-regulated and stearoyl-CoA desaturase up-regulated in the longissimus dorsi of growing goats with increasing dietary n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios (P<0.01). In conclusion, the results obtained indicate that the optimal n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio of 2.27:1 exerted beneficial effects on meat fatty acid profiles, leading towards an enrichment in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid in goat intramuscular .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600650>Cadmium Alters the Concentration of Fatty Acids in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid composition of human immune cells influences their function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of known toxicant and immunomodulator, cadmium, at low concentrations on levels of selected fatty acids (FAs) in THP-1 macrophages. The differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into macrophages was achieved by administration of phorbol myristate acetate. Macrophages were incubated with various cadmium chloride (CdCl) solutions for 48 h at final concentrations of 5 nM, 20 nM, 200 nM, and 2 μM CdCl. Fatty acids were extracted from samples according to the Folch method. The fatty acid levels were determined using gas chromatography. The following fatty acids were analyzed: long-chain saturated fatty acids (SFAs) palmitic acid and stearic acid, very long-chain saturated fatty acid (VLSFA) arachidic acid, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) palmitoleic acid, oleic acid and , and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. Treatment of macrophages with very low concentrations of cadmium (5-200 nM) resulted in significant reduction in the levels of arachidic, palmitoleic, oleic, vaccenic, and linoleic acids and significant increase in arachidonic acid levels (following exposure to 5 nM Cd), without significant reduction of palmitic and stearic acid levels. Treatment of macrophages with the highest tested cadmium concentration (2 μM) produced significant reduction in the levels of all examined FAs: SFAs, VLSFA, MUFAs, and PUFAs. In conclusion, cadmium at tested concentrations caused significant alterations in THP-1 macrophage fatty acid levels, disrupting their composition, which might dysregulate fatty acid/ thus affecting macrophage behavior and inflammatory state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498854>Assessment of anti-diabetic activity of an ethnopharmacological plant Nerium oleander through alloxan induced diabetes in mice.</a></h2><p>Nerium oleander L. (syn. Nerium indicum Mill. and Nerium odorum Aiton.) is used for its anti-diabetic properties in Pakistan, Algeria, Morocco and is also recognized in Ayurveda. The present study was undertaken to investigate the anti-diabetic capacity of a standardized hydromethanolic extract of Nerium oleander in alloxan induced diabetes in mice.Nerium oleander leaf extract (NOLE) was orally administered at 50 and 200mg/kg body weight (BW) dose to alloxanized mice (blood glucose >200mg/dl). After 20 consecutive days of treatment, various diabetic parameters were studied and compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was employed to reveal the phytochemical composition of the plant extract.NOLE demonstrated antihyperglycaemic activity by reducing 73.79% blood glucose level after 20 days of treatment. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed increase in glucose tolerance as evident by 65.72% decrease in blood glucose in 3h post treatment. Percentage decrease in different liver marker enzymes were significant along with decrease in triglyceride and cholesterol levels, displaying potent antihyperlipidemic activity. Peroxidase and catalase activity in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle were significantly restored besides marked reduction in  peroxidation and normalization of hepatic glycogen level in the NOLE treated alloxanized mice. Different bioactive phytocompounds with potent anti-diabetic activity were identified by GC-MS and HPLC analysis.The present investigation revealed that Nerium oleander possess potent anti-diabetic activity as claimed in different ethnopharmacological practices.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effects of linseed supplementation and feeding duration on the fatty acid profile, cholesterol and bioactive compounds of bovine meat. In total, 54 Friesian steers were randomly allocated during the finishing period into six experimental treatments following a 2×3 factorial design. The six treatments consisted of two diets, the control diet (CO) with no supplemental  and the linseed diet (LS) containing 10% whole linseed, fed 40, 75 or 120 days before slaughter. At the end of each finishing period, steers from the CO and LS groups were slaughtered. After 8 days of ageing chemical analysis, the fatty acid profile, cholesterol content and bioactive compounds were determined from the longissimus thoracis muscle. Including linseed in the diet increased the content of monounsaturated fatty acids, CLA and n-3 PUFA, and reduced the proportion of saturated fatty acids and n-6 PUFA. The percentage of myristic fatty acid increased with the duration of feeding, regardless of diet and a decrease in PUFA and n-6 PUFA was observed in the CO and LS diets, respectively. Furthermore, meat from steers fed linseed showed an increased percentage of n-3 PUFA, linolenic acid, and EPA from 40 to 75 days of feeding, whereas , CLA 9c,11t, and total CLA increased from 40 and 75 days but declined at 120 days. Beef from the linseed group had a higher content of bioactive substances such as creatine, carnosine and anserine than beef from the control group. The duration of feeding significantly affected the creatine concentrations, with an increase in the LS group from 40 to 75 days of feeding. Feeding linseed did not modify the cholesterol content, on average and the lowest cholesterol content was found in meat after 75 days of linseed administration. This study demonstrates that a short-term diet manipulation is sufficient to improve the nutritional properties of meat, including n-3 PUFA and bioactive compounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255942>The Growth-Inhibiting Effects of Beef Fatty Acids on MCF-7 Cells Are Influenced Mostly by the Depot Location and Inconsistently by the Biohydrogenation Intermediate Content.</a></h2><p>Biohydrogenation intermediates (BHI) including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers are formed during ruminal biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in ruminants. Although many studies have examined the anticarcinogenic effects of CLA, few studies have reported the anticarcinogenic properties of BHI in their natural form found in dairy and beef fats. The present study compared the growth-inhibitory effects of fatty acids from beef perirenal  (PRF) or subcutaneous  (SCF) with low or high levels of BHI in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Cells were exposed for 72 h to media containing increasing doses (50 to 400 μM) of different beef  treatments. Fatty-acid analysis showed that BHI were readily incorporated into cell phospholipids (PL) in a treatment-dependent manner, but higher BHI in PL did not consistently inhibit growth. Culturing with low-BHI PRF or high-BHI PRF did not lead to growth inhibition, but low-BHI SCF inhibited growth, and inhibition was further increased by high-BHI SCF. Other classes of fatty acids may, therefore, be interacting with BHI resulting in differential effects on growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells.© 2018 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Lipids © 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26628894>Hepatocytes respond differently to major dietary trans fatty acid isomers, elaidic acid and trans-.</a></h2><p>It has been discussed if the adverse health effect associated with the ingestion of trans fatty acids correlates with the food source, as the composition of the isomers varies in different foods. We have investigated the hepatocellular responses to the predominant trans fatty acid isomers in industrially produced partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (elaidic acid) and products of ruminant origin (trans-).The responses of HepG2-SF cells exposed to 100 μM fatty acids during 7 days were examined. Elaidic acid decreased the cellular proliferation rate while trans- had no effect. Analysis of cellular triacylglycerol fractions showed, that both trans fatty acids were metabolized by HepG2-SF cells, although elaidic acid, to a higher degree than trans-vaccenic, accumulated in the triacylglycerol fraction. Proteome analysis revealed that the overlap of differentially regulated proteins only contained four proteins, suggesting that the two trans fatty acid isomers affect the cells in different ways. The data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000760.Our investigations revealed that the hepatocellular response to the two most abundant dietary positional C18:1 trans fatty acid isomers differ substantially.

Extensive use of leaf discs (mechanical wounding) in studies regarding the effect on the biochemical response of the grapevine to different types of biotic stress makes it necessary to understand metabolic perturbation after injury. In this study, we investigate how mechanical wounding can affect the  of grapevine leaf tissue using Bianca variety as case study. Two sizes of leaf discs (1.1 and 2.8 cm in diameter) were excised from leaves, and phenol,  and carotenoid perturbation were investigated 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 120 h post cutting. In our study, we found an accumulation of molecules belonging to stilbenoid and stilbene classes such as trans-resveratrol, trans-piceide, Z-miyabenol C, E-cis-miyabenol C and ampelopsin D + quadrangularin A after abiotic stress. The increase in fatty acids such as linoleic acid, linolenic acid and oleic + cis- during the first 12 h after injury, followed by a return to basal level, allowed us to surmise their role in response to abiotic stress, in particular to mechanical wounding in grapevine leaves. Different-sized discs caused a different response to the tissue, with a higher accumulation in 1.1-cm-diameter discs, especially of phenol compounds. The results of this work can be used to better understand metabolic changes due to biotic stress, having previous knowledge about the perturbation caused by abiotic stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25534067>Butter naturally enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA prevents hyperinsulinemia and increases both serum HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in rats.</a></h2><p>Evidence from in vitro and animal studies indicates that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) possesses anti-diabetic properties, which appear to be attributed to cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the major CLA isomer in ruminant . However, there is a shortage of studies addressing CLA from natural source. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of butter naturally enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA on parameters related to glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia in rats.Forty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the following dietary treatments (n=10/group), for 60 days: 1) Normal -Soybean oil (NF-So): diet containing 4.0% soybean oil (SO); 2) High -Control Butter (HF-Cb): diet containing 21.7% control butter and 2.3% SO; 3) High -CLA enriched Butter (HF-CLAb): diet containing 21.7% cis-9, trans-11 CLA-enriched butter and 2.3% SO; and 4) High -Soybean oil (HF-So): diet containing 24.0% SO. HF-Cb and HF-CLAb diets contained 0.075% and 0.235% of cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively.HF-CLAb-fed rats had lower serum insulin levels at fasting than those fed with the HF-Cb diet, while the PPARγ protein levels in adipose tissue was increased in HF-CLAb-fed rats compared to HF-Cb-fed rats. Furthermore, R-QUICK was lower in HF-Cb than in NF-So group, while no differences in R-QUICK were observed among NF-So, HF-CLAb and HF-So groups. Serum HDL cholesterol levels were higher in HF-CLAb-fed rats than in those fed NF-So, HF-Cb and HF-So diets, as well as higher in NF-So-fed rats than in HF-Cb and HF-So-fed rats. HF-CLAb, HF-Cb and HF-So diets reduced serum LDL cholesterol levels when compared to NF-So, whereas serum triacylglycerol levels were increased in HF-CLAb.Feeding rats on a high- diet containing butter naturally enriched in cis-9, trans-11 CLA prevented hyperinsulinemia and increased HDL cholesterol, which could be associated with higher levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA, , oleic acid and lower levels of short and medium-chain saturated fatty acids from butter naturally modified compared to control butter. On the other hand CLA-enriched butter also increased serum triacylglycerol levels, which could be associated with concomitant increases in the content of trans-9 and trans-10 C18:1 isomers in the CLA-enriched butter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179851>Effectiveness of rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil to enhance the α-linolenic acid content in milk from dairy cows.</a></h2><p>This experiment was conducted to investigate effect of rubber seed oil compared with flaxseed oil when fed alone or in combination on milk yield, milk composition, and α-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration in milk of dairy cows. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments according to a completely randomized design. Cows were fed a basal diet (control; CON) or a basal diet supplemented with 4% rubber seed oil (RO), 4% flaxseed oil (FO), or 2% rubber seed oil plus 2% flaxseed oil (RFO) on a dry matter basis for 9 wk. Feed intake, milk protein percentage, and milk  levels did not differ between the treatments. Cows fed the RO, FO, or RFO treatments had a higher milk yield than the CON group (up to 10.5% more), whereas milk  percentages decreased. Compared with the CON, milk concentration of ALA was substantially higher in cows receiving RO or RFO, and was doubled in cows receiving FO. The ALA yield (g/d) increased by 31.0, 70.3, and 33.4% in milk from cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. Both C18:1 trans-11 () and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 (conjugated linoleic acid; CLA) levels were higher in cows fed added flaxseed or rubber seed oil. The CLA yield (g/d) increased by 336, 492, and 484% in cows fed RO, FO, or RFO, respectively, compared with the CON. The increase in , ALA, and CLA was greater in cows fed RFO than in cows fed RO alone. Compared with the CON, the milk  from cows fed any of the dietary supplements had a higher concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids; conversely, the saturated fatty acids levels in milk  were 30.5% lower. Insulin and growth hormones were not affected by dietary treatments; however, we noted an increase in both cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids levels in the RO, FO, or RFO treatments. These results indicate that rubber seed oil and flaxseed oil will increase milk production and the concentration of functional fatty acids (ALA, , and CLA) in milk  while decreasing the content of saturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Considering that  accumulation in the cell is important in promoting tissue inflammation, the purpose of this study is to analyze the fatty acid profile in red blood cell membranes of patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), in order to identify and validate membrane profiles possibly associated with the degree of hepatic damage.This work presents data obtained at baseline from 101 subjects that participated to a nutritional trial (registration number: ) enrolling consecutive subjects with NAFLD. Diagnosis of liver steatosis was performed by using vibration-controlled elastography implemented on FibroScan. Fatty acids, extracted from phospholipids of erythrocyte membranes, were quantified by gas chromatography method.The subjects with severe NAFLD showed a significant decrease of the ratio of stearic acid to oleic acid (saturation index, SI) compared to controls, 1.281 ± 0.31 vs 1.5 ± 0.29, respectively. Low levels of SI in red blood cell membranes, inversely associated with degree of liver damage, suggest that an impairment of circulating cell membrane structure can reflect modifications that take place in the liver. Subjects with severe NAFLDalso showed higher levels of elongase 5 enzymatic activity, evaluated as  to palmitoleic acid ratio.Starting from these evidences, our findings show the importance of lipidomic approach in the diagnosis and the staging of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433780>Nutritional enhancement of sheep meat fatty acid profile for human health and wellbeing.</a></h2><p>Dietary fatty acids (FA) consumed by sheep, like other ruminants, can undergo biohydrogenation resulting in high proportions of saturated FA (SFA) in meat. Biohydrogenation is typically less extensive in sheep than cattle, and consequently, sheep meat can contain higher proportions of omega (n)-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), and PUFA biohydrogenation intermediates (PUFA-BHI) including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and trans-monounsaturated FAs (t-MUFA). Sheep meat is also noted for having characteristically higher contents of branched chain FA (BCFA). From a human health and wellness perspective, some SFA and trans-MUFA have been found to negatively affect blood  profiles, and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). On the other hand, n-3 PUFA, BCFA and some PUFA-BHI may have many potential beneficial effects on human health and wellbeing. In particular,  (VA), rumenic acid (RA) and BCFA may have potential for protecting against cancer and inflammatory disorders among other human health benefits. Several innovative strategies have been evaluated for their potential to enrich sheep meat with FA which may have human health benefits. To this end, dietary manipulation has been found to be the most effective strategy of improving the FA profile of sheep meat. However, there is a missing link between the FA profile of sheep meat, human consumption patterns of sheep FA and chronic diseases. The current review provides an overview of the nutritional strategies used to enhance the FA profile of sheep meat for human consumption.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the capacity for the tissues of the body, and specifically the heart, to take up trans-fats is unknown. It is also unknown if different trans-fats have different uptake capacities in the heart and other tissues of the body. Diets of low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice were supplemented for 14weeks with foods that contained 1.5% of the trans- elaidic acid or . Tissues were extracted and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then lipids were analyzed by gas chromatography for fatty acid content. Isolated cardiomyocytes were also exposed to elaidic or  in cell culture media for 24h. Dietary supplementation with vaccenic or elaidic acid resulted in a 20-fold higher accumulation of these TFAs in  deposits in the body in comparison to liver. Liver tissue accumulated about twice as much per gram tissue as heart. Similar quantities of both elaidic acid and  were taken up by the tissues. Isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited an unusually large uptake of trans-, and this was dependent upon both the concentration and duration of exposure to the trans-fats but not upon the type of trans-. Expression levels of CD36 and FATP4 were not significantly changed during dietary interventions or exposure of cells to trans-fats. We conclude that , liver and heart (including cardiomyocytes) are all capable of accumulating trans- in response to dietary supplementation without changes in fatty acid transport protein expression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The inclusion criteria were: duration of HPN ≥ 3 mo, current HPN admixtures ≥ 2 mo and HPN infusions ≥ 2/wk. Blood samples were drawn 4-6 h after the discontinuation of the overnight HPN infusion. The functional lipidomics panel included: the red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) profile, molecular biomarkers [membrane fluidity: saturated/monounsaturated FA ratio = saturated fatty acid (SFA)/monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) index; inflammatory risk: n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio = n-6/n-3 index; cardiovascular risk: sum of n-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) = n-3 index; free radical stress: sum of FA trans isomers = %trans index] and FA pathway enzyme activity estimate (delta-9-desaturase = D9D; delta-6-desaturase = D6D; delta-5-desaturase = D5D; elongase = ELO). Statistics were carried out using nonparametric tests. The amount of each FA was calculated as a percentage of the total FA content (relative%).In the OO-IVLE group, the percentage of oleic acid in the RBCs was positively correlated with the weekly load of OO-IVLE ( = 0.540,  = 0.043). In the SMOF-IVLE cohort, the RBC membrane EPA and DHA were positively correlated with the daily amount of SMOF-IVLE ( = 0.751,  = 0.044) and the number of HPN infusions per week ( = 0.753;  = 0.046), respectively. The SMOF-IVLE group showed the highest EPA and DHA and the lowest arachidonic acid percentages ( < 0.001). The RBC membrane linoleic acid content was lower, and oleic and vaccenic acids were higher in all the HPN groups in comparison to the HCs.  was positively correlated with the weekly HPN load of glucose in both the OO-IVLE ( = 0.716;  = 0.007) and the SMOF-IVLE ( = 0.732;  = 0.053) groups. The estimated activity of D9D was higher in all the HPN groups than in the HCs ( < 0.001). The estimated activity of D5D was lower in the SMOF-IVLE group than in the HCs ( = 0.013). The SFA/MUFA ratio was lower in all the HPN groups than in the HCs ( < 0.001). The n-6/n-3 index was lower and the n-3 index was higher in the SMOF-IVLE group in comparison to the HCs and to the other HPN groups ( < 0.001). The %trans index did not differ among the four groups.The FA profile of IVLEs significantly influenced the cell membrane functional lipidomics. The amount of glucose in the HPN may play a relevant role, mediated by the insulin regulation of the FA pathway enzyme activities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666892>Using Liprotides to Deliver Cholesterol to the Plasma Membrane.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol (chol) is important in all mammalian cells as a modulator of membrane fluidity. However, its low solubility is a challenge for controlled delivery to membranes. Here we introduce a new tool to deliver chol to membranes, namely, liprotides, i.e., protein- complexes composed of a fatty acid core decorated with partially denatured protein. We focus on liprotides prepared by incubating Ca-depleted α-lactalbumin with oleic acid (OA) for 1 h at 20 °C (lip20) or 80 °C (lip80). The binding and membrane delivery properties of liprotides is compared to the widely chol transporter methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mBCD). Both lip20 and lip80 increase the solubility of chol ~ 50% more than mBCD and deliver chol to membranes with comparable efficiency. Although OA is cytotoxic at high concentrations, its effects are counterbalanced by chol. Further, cytotoxicity is strongly reduced when OA is replaced by cis-palmitoleic acid or cis-. This makes liprotides good tools to deliver chol to membranes and cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25466095>Influence of deficit irrigation strategies on fatty acid and tocopherol concentration of almond (Prunus dulcis).</a></h2><p>The effects of deficit irrigation on almond fatty acid and tocopherol levels were studied in a field trial. Mature almond trees were subjected to three levels of deficit irrigation (85%, 70% and 55% of potential crop evapotranspiration (ETo), as well as control (100% ETo) and over-irrigation (120% ETo) treatments. Two deficit irrigation strategies were employed: regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and sustained deficit irrigation (SDI). Moderate deficit irrigation (85% RDI and 85% SDI) had no detrimental impact on almond kernel  content, but severe and extreme deficiencies (70% and 55%) influenced  content. Unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) and saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents fluctuated under these treatments, the oleic/linoleic ratio increased under moderate water deficiency, but decreased under severe and extreme water deficiency. Almond tocopherols concentration was relatively stable under deficit irrigation. The variation between years indicated climate has an effect on almond fruit development. In conclusion it is feasible to irrigate almond trees using less water than the normal requirement, without significant loss of kernel quality.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While oil accumulation pathways are intensively researched, the possible existence of a microalgal pathways converting fatty acids into alka(e)nes has received little attention. Here, we provide evidence that such a pathway occurs in several microalgal species from the green and the red lineages. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlorophyceae), a C17 alkene, n-heptadecene, was detected in the cell pellet and the headspace of liquid cultures. The Chlamydomonas alkene was identified as 7-heptadecene, an isomer likely formed by decarboxylation of cis-. Accordingly, incubation of intact Chlamydomonas cells with per-deuterated D31-16:0 (palmitic) acid yielded D31-18:0 (stearic) acid, D29-18:1 (oleic and cis-vaccenic) acids, and D29-heptadecene. These findings showed that loss of the carboxyl group of a C18 monounsaturated fatty acid lead to heptadecene formation. Amount of 7-heptadecene varied with growth phase and temperature and was strictly dependent on light but was not affected by an inhibitor of photosystem II. Cell fractionation showed that approximately 80% of the alkene is localized in the chloroplast. Heptadecane, pentadecane, as well as 7- and 8-heptadecene were detected in Chlorella variabilis NC64A (Trebouxiophyceae) and several Nannochloropsis species (Eustigmatophyceae). In contrast, Ostreococcus tauri (Mamiellophyceae) and the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum produced C21 hexaene, without detectable C15-C19 hydrocarbons. Interestingly, no homologs of known hydrocarbon biosynthesis genes were found in the Nannochloropsis, Chlorella, or Chlamydomonas genomes. This work thus demonstrates that microalgae have the ability to convert C16 and C18 fatty acids into alka(e)nes by a new, light-dependent pathway.© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Eight castrated Nellore steers were fitted with a ruminal and duodenal silicone cannula, and distributed in a double, simultaneous, Latin square 4 × 4 design with four diets and four experimental periods. Concentrates contained ground maize, urea, mineral salts, CG (100 g/kg DM) and soybean products with different availability of soybean oil: (1) no additional  (CO), (2) WS, (3) SO or (4) CS.  supplementation was fixed to obtain 50 g ether extract/kg DM. Experimental treatments had no effect on DM intake, DM duodenal flow or ruminal turnover rate of C:16 FA. However,  addition increased C:18 and turnover rates of total FA rumen (p < 0.05). CS resulted in lower C:18 turnover rates and lower ruminal BH of monounsaturated and unsaturated FA (UFA) than WS (p < 0.05). SO resulted in a greater duodenal flow of C18:0 (stearic acid), C18:1t-11 () and saturated FA than the WS and CS diets (p < 0.05). CS resulted in a higher duodenal flow of C18:3n-3 (linolenic acid) than WS (p < 0.05). The association of CG and calcium salts in Nellore steers was the best nutritional strategy to increase duodenal flow of healthier UFA, which may increase the deposition of these FA in meat. However, SO associated with CG association increased the duodenal flow of , which is main precursor of endogenous synthesis of conjugated linoleic acids in tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26617388>Foetal cord blood contains higher portions of n-3 and n-6 long-chain PUFA but lower portions of trans C18:1 isomers than maternal blood.</a></h2><p>An adequate supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC PUFA) promotes foetal health and development, whereas generally, trans fatty acids (tFA) are considered to negatively interfere with LC PUFA . Nevertheless, to date, limited data concerning separate trans C18:1, such as t9 and t11, are available for maternal and foetal blood. Therefore, in this study the portions of individual trans C18:1, LC n-6, and n-3 PUFA in lipids of maternal and foetal plasma and erythrocyte membranes of German mother and child pairs (n=40) were analysed.Portions of linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid as LC precursors were lower (~0.4-fold); whereas the metabolites arachidonic acid (AA, n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, n-3) were significantly higher (~2-fold) in foetal than in maternal plasma and erythrocytes. The main tFA in maternal and foetal blood were elaidic acid (C18:1t9; t9) and  (C18:1t11; t11). Portions of t9, t10, t11, and t12 in foetal blood lipids were lower (~0.5-fold) compared with maternal blood. In foetal lipids, t9 was higher than t11. The t9 correlated negatively with eicosapentaenoic acid (n-3) and AA in maternal and foetal lipids; whereas t11 correlated negatively only with foetal total LC n-6 (plasma and erythrocytes) and n-3 PUFA (erythrocytes). No correlation between maternal tFA and foetal PUFA was observed.'Biomagnification' of LC n-6 and n-3 PUFA AA and DHA in foetal blood was confirmed, whereas single trans isomers were lower compared with maternal blood. Nevertheless, tFA intake, especially from industrial sources, should be as low as possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26086219>Feeding a High Concentrate Diet Down-Regulates Expression of ACACA, LPL and SCD and Modifies Milk Composition in Lactating Goats.</a></h2><p>High concentrate diets are fed to early and mid-lactation stages dairy ruminants to meet the energy demands for high milk production in modern milk industry. The present study evaluated the effects of a high concentrate diet on milk  and milk composition, especially, cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk and gene expression of lactating goats. Eight mid-lactating goats with rumen fistula were randomly assigned into a high concentrate diet (HCD) group and low concentrate diet (LCD) group. High concentrate diet feeding significantly increased lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in plasma and decreased milk  content,  (VA) and cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk of the lactating goats. The mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein B 1c (SREBP1c), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthetase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACACA, ACCα) involving in  were analyzed, and ACACA and LPL all decreased in their expression level in the mammary glands of goats fed a high concentrate diet. DNA methylation rate of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was elevated and decreased, and SCD mRNA and protein expression was reduced significantly in the mammary glands of goats fed a high concentrate diet. In conclusion, feeding a high concentrate diet to lactating goats decreases milk  and reduced expression of SCD in the mammary gland, which finally induced cis-9, trans-11 CLA content in milk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28990226>Milk fatty acid profile from cows fed with mixed rations and different access time to pastureland during early lactation.</a></h2><p>Milk fatty acid (FA) profiles were determined in Holstein cows (n = 27) fed total mixed rations (TMR) ad libitum (G0) or diet composed by TMR (50% dry matter [DM] offered) plus grazing of pasture with 6 hr of access time to paddock in one session (G1) or 9 hr in two sessions (G2) at 45 days in milk (DIM). Moreover, milk FA was determined at 65 DIM when G0 cows turned out to G1 diet without adaptation period (Post-G0), G1 remained as controls. Milk FA was quantified using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Preformed FA at 45 DIM was greater (+27%) for G2 than G0 cows (p < .05). Stearic acid (C18:0) was 30% greater for G2 cows (p < .05). De novo FA was lowest for G2 cows (p < .05). Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) did not differ (p < .12), while  (C18:1trans) was twofold greater for grazing treatments (p < .01). Linolenic acid [C18:3(n-3)] was greatest for G2 and lowest for G0 cows (p < .01). Omega 6 FA was greater for G0 than grazing cows, mainly due to linoleic acid [18:2cis(n-6); p < .05]. These results determined that n-6/n-3 ratio was almost threefold greater for G0 than grazing cows (p < .001). When diet of G0 cows changed to include pasture (Post-G0), preformed FA increased (p < .05), explained mainly by the increase (p < .05) of stearic (C18:0) and C18:1trans, while de novo FA tended to decrease (p < .1). Moreover, the amount of CLA and C18:3(n-3) tended to increase (p < .1) in Post-G0 cows. Offering 50% of dietary DM from pasture modified milk FA profile in early lactation potentially beneficial for human health. When TMR-fed cows were turned out to 50% pasture, milk FA profile reflected dietary change without need of an adaptation period.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359441>Proteomic analysis of Lactobacillus casei GCRL163 cell-free extracts reveals a SecB homolog and other biomarkers of prolonged heat stress.</a></h2><p>Prolonged heat stress is one of the harsh conditions Lactobacillus casei strains encounter as non-starter lactic acid bacteria in dairy product manufacture. To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms through which Lb. casei GCRL163 adapts to persistent elevated temperature, label-free quantitative proteomics of cell-free extracts was used to characterize the global responses of the strain cultured anaerobically in bioreactors at 30 to 45°C, pH 6.5, together with GC-MS for fatty acid methyl ester analysis at different growth phases. At higher growth temperatures, repression of energy-consuming metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, was observed, while PTS- and ABC-type transporter systems associated with uptake of nitrogen and carbon sources were up-regulated. Alkaline shock protein Asp23_2 was only detected at 45°C, expressed at high abundance, and presumptive α-L-fucosidase only at 40 and 45°C, with highly increased abundance (log2-fold change of 7) at 45°C. We identified a novel SecB homolog as a protein export chaperone putatively involved in posttranslational translocation systems, which was down-regulated as growth temperature increased and where the modelled 3D-structure shared architectural similarities with the Escherichia coli SecB protein. Membrane  analyses revealed temporal changes in fatty acid composition, cyclization of oleic acid to cyclopropane and novel cyclopentenyl moieties, and reduced synthesis of , at higher temperatures. An 18kDa α-crystallin domain, Hsp20 family heat shock protein was more highly up-regulated in response to heat stress compared to other molecular chaperones, suggesting this protein could be a useful biomarker of prolonged heat stress in Lb. casei GCRL163.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28843691>Dietary supplementation with dried olive pomace in dairy cows modifies the composition of fatty acids and the aromatic profile in milk and related cheese.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary integration of dried olive pomace (DOP), a by-product of olive oil separation, on nutritional and aromatic properties of milk and cheese. Twenty dairy cows were divided into 2 groups that were balanced for milk yield, parity, and days in milk. The control group was fed a conventional diet (20 kg of dry matter/head per day), whereas the experimental group (EG) received the conventional diet supplemented with DOP as 10% of dry matter. During the trial, milk yield was recorded and the samples of milk, cheese, total mixed rations, and DOP were collected and analyzed to determine the chemical-nutritional composition and aromatic profile. Atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were calculated on the basis of the fatty acid (FA) profile of milk and cheese. Data were analyzed according to the mixed model for milk yield and chemical composition, including cows nested within treatment as a random effect, whereas the general linear model was used for the analysis of cheese parameters. Differences were assessed by Tukey's test. The EG diet had a lower content of palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids and a higher level of oleic acid compared with the control. Dietary DOP integration did not affect milk yield and composition with the exception of protein content, which was greater in EG and significantly affected by diet and period. Instead, period was found to be significant for  and casein in both groups. Dietary supplementation with DOP modified the FA profile of milk and cheese. There was a decrease in short- and medium-chain FA, but significance was achieved only for palmitic acid. The stearic, isomer trans of oleic (in particular ), oleic, and isomer trans of linoleic acids significantly increased. Monounsaturated FA increased in EG milk and cheese and saturated FA were significantly lower, whereas no difference was marked between the groups regarding level of polyunsaturated FA. Supplementation with DOP reduced atherogenic and thrombogenic indices and increased conjugated linoleic acid in both milk and cheese. The free fatty acids, ketones, lactones, esters, and phenylalanine catabolites were increased in raw milk, whereas only leucine  was affected by diet in pasteurized milk cheese at both 1 and 30 d of ripening. The present results pointed out that DOP supplementation may improve the nutritional and nutraceutical properties and modify the aroma of milk and derived cheese.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic  accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid  signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827558>Productive performance and digestive response of dairy cows fed different diets combining a total mixed ration and fresh forage.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of feeding increasing levels of fresh forage (FF) as a proportion of total dry matter intake (DMI) on nutrient intake, rumen digestion, nutrient utilization, and productive performance of total mixed ration (TMR)-fed cows. Twelve dairy cows (90 ± 22 d in milk, 523 ± 88 kg of body weight, 7,908 ± 719 kg of milk production in the previous lactation) were housed in individual tiestalls and assigned to treatments according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design replicated 4 times. Treatments were 100% TMR (T100), 75% TMR plus 25% FF (T75), and 50% TMR plus 50% FF (T50). The experiment lasted 60 d, divided into 3 periods of 20 d each; the first 12 d of each period were used for diet adaptation and the last 8 d for data collection. The TMR (18.1% crude protein, 24.6% acid detergent fiber) and FF (Lolium multiflorum; 15.1% crude protein, 24.1% acid detergent fiber) were prepared and cut daily and offered to each cow individually. The highest DMI was reached in T100 and T75, which was reflected in greater intake of the different nutrients than T50. No differences were detected in the apparent total digestibility of the nutrients, mean ruminal pH, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations among treatments. Cows in T50 resulted in the lowest ruminal N-NH concentration and the lowest microbial N flow to the duodenum. Milk yield was 8.5% higher from cows in T100 and T75 compared with T50, but we observed no differences for milk  or milk protein yield among treatments. Milk  of cows fed T50 had 8% more unsaturated fatty acids (FA) than that of cows fed T100, mostly because of a higher content of monounsaturated FA. Additionally, cows in T50 had a higher concentration of linoleic acid, , and rumenic acid than T100. Meanwhile, the concentration of linoleic acid and  in cows fed T75 was higher than T100. The milk  of the cows fed T50 and T75 had a lower n-6:n-3 ratio than T100. We concluded that including up to 29% of FF in the total DMI in combination with a TMR did not affect the intake or digestion of nutrients or the productive response in dairy cows and resulted in a higher concentration of desirable FA from a consumer's perspective.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study, we investigated the effect of VA on insulin secretion in vivo in rats and in vitro in human and rat islets after diabetogenic insult.Hyperglycemic clamp showed that VA dietary supplementation for 8 weeks significantly increased glucose turnover in rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D), accompanied by an elevated plasma C-peptide concentration, indicating improved insulin secretion. The β-cell area and proliferation rate were higher in T2D+VA than T2D group. Isolated islets from T2D+VA rats had higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) than T2D group. In vitro, VA treatment for 24 and 48 h significantly enhanced GSIS in rat and human islets after diabetogenic challenges. The mRNA expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and regenerating islet-derived 1α (REG-1α) were consistently increased by VA in both rat and human islets.These results indicate that VA may improve insulin secretion and growth of islets in T2D, at least partly by altering GPR40 and REG-1α mRNA expression.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To test this hypothesis, 26 Comisana lambs were divided into 3 groups and for 56 d were fed a barley-based concentrate diet (CON; 8 lambs) or 2 diets in which barley was replaced with 24% (CIT24; 9 lambs) or 35% (CIT35; 9 lambs) dried citrus pulp. An overall improvement of the fatty acid composition of LM from lambs fed citrus pulp-containing diets was found. The PUFA/SFA ratio was lower (P < 0.05) in the LM from lambs in the CON group compared with both the CIT24 and CIT35 groups. The thrombogenic index was lower (P < 0.05) in meat from lambs fed the CIT35 diet compared with those fed the CON diet. The CIT35 diet increased the proportion of C20:5 n-3 in the LM (P < 0.05), whereas the CIT24 diet enhanced that of C22:6 -3 (P < 0.05) compared with the CON diet. Some of these results might be explained considering that feeding the CIT24 and CIT35 diets increased the intake of total fatty acids (P < 0.05) and of C18:3 n-3 (P < 0.01) compared with feeding the CON treatment. On the other hand, phenolic compounds present in citrus pulp could have inhibited the ruminal biohydrogenation of PUFA. This is supported by the fact that regardless of the level of inclusion in the diet, citrus pulp increased the proportion of rumenic acid (P < 0.001) in LM compared with the CON diet. The plasma from lambs fed both CIT24 and CIT35 diets had a greater percentage of  (VA; < 0.001) compared with that from lambs fed the CON diet, and the CIT35 diet increased the proportion of rumenic acid in plasma compared with the CON treatment (P < 0.05). In the ruminal fluid, stearic acid (SA) tended to decrease, and the sum of CLA tended to increase (P = 0.09) with increasing level of citrus pulp in the diets. Furthermore, the SA/(SA + VA) ratio tended to be lower (P = 0.10) in the ruminal fluid from lambs fed the CIT35 diet compared with that of the CON group. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that replacing barley with citrus pulp in the diet of growing lambs improves intramuscular fatty acid composition and underline the need for specific studies to clarify the mechanisms by which feeding citrus pulp affects the fatty acid  in ruminants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28448837>Genetic analysis of meat quality traits in maternal lines of rabbit and their diallel cross.</a></h2><p>Young rabbits, the dams of which came from a full diallel cross among four maternal lines (A, V, H and LP) and the sires from a single paternal line (R), that produce sixteen genetic groups, was carried out to evaluate the genetic groups and to estimate the crossbreeding genetic parameters of meat quality. The meat quality traits were recorded by NIRS from a sample of 285 longissimus lumborum muscles. Crossbreeding parameters were estimated according to Dickerson model. No differences in protein were found. The line A had significant differences with V line for intramuscular , and fatty acids groups. Significant differences for these traits appeared between the crossbred AH and VV (in favor of AH). As conclusion, the significant contrasts between genetic types for chemical composition of the meat are mainly consequence of direct-maternal genetic effects, having grandmaternal and maternal heterosis effects a less relevant role.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, milk  is formed as the product of fatty acid  in cow bodies before being secreted into milk. However, how grazing influences milk fatty acid profile through the  has not been completely characterized. When fatty acid concentrations in Holstein milk were compared between grazing and non-grazing periods, α-linolenic acid was significantly higher in the grazing period than in the non-grazing period. This could be explained with an increase in α-linolenic acid feeding with grazing. α-linolenic acid had a linear positive correlation with conjugated linoleic acid (9c,11t-18:2) (CLA) and  (VA) during the grazing period, whereas CLA had higher correlation with linoleic acid rather than with α-linolenic acid during the non-grazing period.

Fifty Holstein cows yielding 33.2 ± 8.2 kg/d of milk were divided into 2 groups. The cows were fed a basal diet with a forage-concentrate ratio of 66:34 on a dry matter (DM) basis. Diets tested were control (CON, basal diet without QTE) and basal diet plus 15 or 30 g of QTE/kg of DM (QTE and QTE, respectively). Two treatments could be tested simultaneously and were arranged along 6 periods. The milk FA profile was characterized by increments in the proportion of linoleic (LA) and α-linolenic acid (α-LNA) (QTE = 10 and 6.1%; QTE = 28 and 25%, respectively) compared to CON, which might indicate reduced ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) of both dietary LA and α-LNA.  (VA) in the milk  was reduced (QTE 8.9% and QTE 12%) compared to CON, which may be linked to inhibited BH of LA and α-LNA. Rumenic acid (RA), a conjugated LA (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) and an important human health promoter, was unfortunately decreased (QTE 8.3% and QTE 16%) in the milk compared with CON, probably because of inhibited ruminal BH of LA. However, reduced RA in the milk was probably due to reduced availability of VA produced in the rumen and the consequently low VA available to be desaturated to RA in the mammary gland by Δ-desaturase. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased with QTE and QTE by 4.7 and 15% compared to CON, respectively, and the long-chain FA proportions were also increased (QTE 2.0% and QTE 8.2%). Moreover, myristic and palmitic acid were reduced by QTE (9.6 and 3.3%, respectively) compared to CON, which also contributed to increasing the nutritional quality of milk because they are recognized to increase high-density lipoprotein in humans. Branched-chain FA in milk was reduced with QTE treatments, which indicates inhibited ruminal BH and microbial activity. In general, our findings suggest that dietary QTE have the potential to modulate FA profile of milk , and this effect is dosage dependent. Because QTE influenced the FA profile of milk  both positively and negatively, further research is needed before concluding that QTE may improve the nutritional quality of cow milk  in human diets.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty acid profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic acid significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the oleic acid and  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic acid levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis- concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty acid profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315997>Trans Fatty Acids Suppress TNF-α-Induced Inflammatory Gene Expression in Endothelial (HUVEC) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HepG2) Cells.</a></h2><p>Trans fatty acids (TFA) intake has been linked to cardiovascular diseases and liver diseases; yet the effect of TFA on inflammation remains controversial. Accordingly, the objective of this paper was to determine the in vitro effects of TFA on inflammatory gene expression. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated for 24 h with either trans- (tVA), trans-palmitoleic acid (tPA) or elaidic acid (EA) at concentrations of 5-150 µM, or with a mixture of tVA and tPA (150/50 µM). All TFA were highly incorporated into cell membranes, as determined by gas chromatography, representing 15-20% of total fatty acids in HUVEC and 3-8% in HepG2 cells. Incorporation of EA, a common industrial TFA, increased the ratio of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1), a key enzyme involved in fatty acid . Ruminant TFA, including tVA, tPA and the mixture of tVA and tPA, significantly reduced the TNF-α-induced gene expression of TNF, VCAM-1 and SOD2 in HUVEC, as well as TNF and IL-8 in HepG2 cells. EA also decreased inflammatory gene expression in HUVEC, but not in HepG2 cells. The inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ did not influence the effects of TFA on gene expression. Overall, physiological and supraphysiological concentrations of TFA, especially tVA and tPA, prevented inflammatory gene expression in vitro. This effect is independent of PPAR-γ activation and may be due to an alteration of fatty acid  in cell membranes caused by the high incorporation of TFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28838557>Fads3 modulates docosahexaenoic acid in liver and brain.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) is the third member of the FADS gene cluster. FADS1 and FADS2 code for enzymes required for highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) biosynthesis, but FADS3 function remains elusive. We generated the first Fads3 knockout (KO) mouse with an aim to characterize its metabolic phenotype and clues to in vivo function. All mice (wild type (WT) and KO) were fed facility rodent chow devoid of HUFA. No differences in overt phenotypes (survival, fertility, growth rate) were observed. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) levels in the brain of postnatal day 1 (P1) KO mice were lower than the WT (P < 0.05). The ratio of docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-3) to DHA in P1 KO liver was higher than in WT suggesting lower desaturase activity. Concomitantly, 20:4n-6 was lower but its elongation product 22:4n-6 was greater in the liver of P1 KO mice. P1 KO liver Fads1 and Fads2 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated whereas expression levels of elongation of very long chain 2 (Elovl2) and Elovl5 genes were upregulated compared to age-matched WT. No Δ13-desaturation of  was observed in liver or heart in WT mice expressing FADS3 as was reported in vitro. Taken together, the fatty acid compositional results suggest that Fads3 enhances liver-mediated 22:6n-3 synthesis to support brain 22:6n-3 accretion before and during the brain growth spurt.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Few prospective studies have used fatty acid biomarkers to assess associations with type 2 diabetes.We investigated associations of major circulating SFAs [palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0)] and MUFA [oleic acid (18:1n-9)] in the DNL pathway with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes in community-based older U.S. adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. We secondarily assessed other DNL fatty acid biomarkers [myristic acid (14:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), 7-hexadecenoic acid (16:1n-9), and  (18:1n-7)] and estimated dietary SFAs and MUFAs.In 3004 participants free of diabetes, plasma phospholipid fatty acids were measured in 1992, and incident diabetes was identified by medication use and blood glucose. Usual diets were assessed by using repeated food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable linear and Cox regression were used to assess associations with metabolic risk factors and incident diabetes, respectively.At baseline, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were positively associated with adiposity, triglycerides, inflammation biomarkers, and insulin resistance (P-trend < 0.01 each), whereas oleic acid showed generally beneficial associations (P-trend < 0.001 each). During 30,763 person-years, 297 incident diabetes cases occurred. With adjustment for demographics and lifestyle, palmitic acid (extreme-quintile HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.83; P-trend = 0.001) and stearic acid (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.41; P-trend = 0.006) were associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas oleic acid was not significantly associated. In secondary analyses,  was inversely associated with diabetes (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83; P-trend = 0.005). Other fatty acid biomarkers and estimated dietary SFAs or MUFAs were not significantly associated with incident diabetes.In this large prospective cohort, circulating palmitic acid and stearic acid were associated with higher diabetes risk, and  was associated with lower diabetes risk. These results indicate a need for additional investigation of biological mechanisms linking specific fatty acids in the DNL pathway to the pathogenesis of diabetes.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572061>Cellular toxicity of dietary trans fatty acids and its correlation with ceramide and diglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>High fatty acid (FA) levels are deleterious to pancreatic β-cells, largely due to the accumulation of biosynthetic  intermediates, such as ceramides and diglycerides, which induce ER stress and apoptosis. Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of  intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important metabolic characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

Considering the effect of interactions between food and age on , here we depict the  framework of 12 tissues isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats fed standard rodent chow over 1 year, an age below which animals are commonly studied. The aim is to define relevant markers of  influenced by age in performing a fatty acid (FA) and dimethylacetal profile from total lipids. First, our results confirm impregnation of adipose and muscular tissues with medium-chain FA derived from maternal milk during early infancy. Secondly, when animals were switched to standard croquettes, tissues were remarkably enriched in n-6 FA and especially 18:2n-6. This impregnation over time was coupled with a decrease of the desaturation index and correlated with lower activities of hepatic Δ5- and Δ6-desaturases. In parallel, we emphasize the singular status of testis, where 22:5n-6, 24:4n-6, and 24:5n-6 were exceptionally accumulated with growth. Thirdly, 18:1n-7, usually found as a discrete FA, greatly accrued over the course of time, mostly in liver and coupled with Δ9-desaturase expression. Fourthly, skeletal muscle was characterized by a surprising enrichment of 22:6n-3 in adults, which tended to decline in older rats. Finally, plasmalogen-derived dimethylacetals were specifically abundant in brain, erythrocytes, lung, and heart. Most notably, a shift in the fatty aldehyde moiety was observed, especially in brain and erythrocytes, implying that red blood cell analysis could be a good indicator of brain plasmalogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778483>Effect of replacing maize silage with red clover silage in the diet on milk fatty acid composition in cows.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing maize silage plus soybean meal with red clover silage (RCS) plus wheat on the fatty acid (FA) profile in the milk  of cows. Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of 13 d of adaptation to diets followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with target proportions of RCS to maize silage of 15:60 (RCS), 30:45 (RCS), 45:30 (RCS), and 60:15 (RCS) on a dry matter basis. Increasing the level of RCS in the diet was accompanied by a reduction of linoleic acid content in the diet and decreased linearly the proportions of linoleic acid in the milk up to 4%. Proportions of α-linolenic acid in milk increased 2-fold with RCS compared with RCS, which resulted from the linear increase in α-linolenic acid intake with incremental levels of RCS.  in the milk  was reduced by 24%. Rumenic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) considered to be a human health promoter, was also decreased by 22%. Reduced rumenic acid in the milk  was probably due to a reduced amount of  produced in the rumen and, consequently, to the low amount of  to be desaturated to rumenic acid in the mammary gland by Δ-desaturase. Oleic acid was enriched in the milk , although the dietary concentration of oleic acid decreased. Stearic acid proportions remained constant with increasing levels of RCS. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased by 12%, and the long-chain FA proportions increased linearly with increasing levels of RCS. Myristic acid was reduced linearly, but palmitic acid remained constant. Saturated FA was reduced linearly by 2%. Branched-chain FA, which are presumed to possess anticarcinogenic properties, were reduced to a small extent only (quadratic effect). We conclude that replacing maize silage with RCS appears to alter milk FA composition by reducing linoleic acid intake and ruminal biohydrogenation. Feeding RCS represents a strategy to increase intake of α-linolenic acid in dairy cows. However, because changes in the FA profile show positive as well as negative effects, no distinct conclusions can be drawn with regard to human health benefits.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that plasma and erythrocyte MUFA levels are associated with cardiometabolic disorders, including CVD, T2D, and metabolic syndrome (MS). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified seven loci for plasma and erythrocyte palmitoleic and oleic acid levels in populations of European origin.

Therefore, the formation of fermentation end-products which might exert chemopreventive effects regarding colon cancer was investigated after an in vitro simulated digestion and fermentation of nuts using human fecal microbiota.Fermentation supernatants (FS) and pellets (FP) were obtained after an in vitro fermentation of hazelnuts, almonds, macadamia, pistachios and walnuts. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids (BA) in FS as well as fatty acids in FP were analyzed via gas chromatography. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in FS were determined photometrically.Fermentation of nuts resulted in 1.9- to 2.8-fold higher concentrations of SCFA compared to the control and a shift of molar ratios toward butyrate production. In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty acid methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA deoxycholic-/iso-deoxycholic acid (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal microbiota to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and  peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding colon cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127010>Nutritional strategies to improve the  composition of meat, with emphasis on Thailand and Asia.</a></h2><p>This article reviews opportunities for enriching the lipids of meat with n-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs), both considered beneficial to human health. Special focus is put on feeds available and research carried out in Thailand. A differentiated consideration concerning the value of different n-3 fatty acids and isomers of CLAs is necessary. In ruminants, it is difficult to enrich the meat with n-3 fatty acids due to the extensive ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids, but several possibilities to enhance the proportion of the most desired CLA isomer, rumenic acid, exist. By contrast, pork and poultry meat can be easily enriched with n-3 fatty acids. With purified CLA sources, CLAs also can be enhanced, but it is difficult to achieve this exclusively for rumenic acid. An interesting approach might consist in supplementing the CLA precursor  instead. Possible constraints for meat quality and in the fatty acid levels achieved are outlined.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Oilseed rape () is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of  accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to . We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major  species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different  compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the  composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed  accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of  molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds.

FADS3 may therefore be the first methyl-end trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase functionally characterized in mammals, but the proof of this concept is so far lacking in vivo. The present study therefore aimed at investigating further the putative in vivo synthesis of trans11,cis13-CLA from dietary trans- in rodents. During one week of pregnancy and two weeks post-partum, Sprague-Dawley female rats were fed two diets either high (10.0% of fatty acids and 3.8% of energy intake) or low (0.4% of fatty acids and 0.2% of energy intake) in trans-. The trans11,cis13-CLA was specifically detected, formally identified and reproducibly quantified (0.06% of total fatty acids) in the mammary gland phospholipids of lactating female rats fed the high trans--enriched diet. This result was consistent with FADS3 mRNA expression being significantly higher in the lactating mammary gland than in the liver. Although the apparent metabolic conversion is low, this physiological evidence demonstrates the existence of this new pathway described in the lactating mammary gland and establishes the FADS3 enzyme as a reliable mammalian trans-vaccenate Δ13-desaturase in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Enzymes constituting the pathway catalyze sequential reactions of free fatty acids without CoA or acyl carrier protein. Among these enzymes, CLA-ER was identified as an enone reductase that can saturate the C=C bond in the 10-oxo-trans- (KetoB) to produce 10-oxo-octadecanoic acid (KetoC). This enzyme is the sole member of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase family that has been identified to exert an enone reduction activity. Here, we report both the structure of holo CLA-ER with cofactor FMN and the KetoC-bound structure, which elucidate the structural basis of enone group recognition of free fatty acids and provide the unique catalytic mechanism as an enone reductase in the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase family. A 'cap' structure of CLA-ER underwent a large conformational change upon KetoC binding. The resulting binding site adopts a sandglass shape and is positively charged at one side, which is suitable to recognize a fatty acid molecule with enone group. Based on the crystal structures and enzymatic activities of several mutants, we identified C51, F126 and Y101 as the critical residues for the reaction and proposed an alternative electron transfer pathway of CLA-ER. These findings expand our understanding of the complexity of fatty acid .The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), www.pdb.org (PDB ID 4QLX, 4QLY).© 2015 FEBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865506>Synthesis of the suspected trans-11,cis-13 conjugated linoleic acid isomer in ruminant mammary tissue by FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of .</a></h2><p>The octadecadienoic conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer with trans-11 and cis-13 double bonds (trans-11,cis-13 CLA) has been described in ruminant milk. For now, this specific CLA is suspected to derive exclusively from ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary α-linolenic acid. However, in rodents, the fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene was recently shown to code for an enzyme able to catalyze the unexpected Δ13-desaturation of , producing a Δ11,13-CLA with all the structural characteristics of the trans-11,cis-13 isomer, although no commercial standard exists for complete conclusive identification. Because the FADS3 gene has already been reported in bovine animals, we hypothesized in the present study that an alternative direct FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of  in mammary tissue may therefore co-exist with α-linolenic acid biohydrogenation to explain the final ruminant milk trans-11,cis-13 CLA presence. Here, we first confirm that the FADS3 gene is present in ruminant mammal genomic sequence databases. Second, we demonstrate that the Δ11,13-CLA found in milk  and the highly probable trans-11,cis-13 CLA isomer produced by rodent FADS3 possess exactly the same structural characteristics. Then, we show that bovine mammary MAC-T and BME-UV epithelial cells express both FADS3 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) mRNA and are able to synthesize both the suspected trans-11,cis-13 CLA and cis-9,trans-11CLA (rumenic acid) isomers when incubated with . Finally, the concomitant presence of the suspected trans-11,cis-13 CLA isomer with FADS3 mRNA was shown in goat mammary tissue, whereas both were conversely very low or even absent in goat liver. Therefore, this study provides several lines of evidence that, by analogy with rumenic acid, trans-11,cis-13 CLA may originate both from ruminal biohydrogenation and from direct FADS3-catalyzed Δ13-desaturation of  in mammary tissue.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Eighteen Baluchi lambs, 196 ± 14 days of age and 39.8 ± 1.7 kg body weight, were randomly assigned to three experimental diets: (i) diet without GSO (control), (ii) diet containing 2% of GSO (GSO2) and (iii) diet containing 4% of GSO (GSO4) for 42 days. Results showed that the experimental diets had no significant effect on dry matter intake and performance (p > 0.05). The supplemented diets with GSO had no effect on pH and NH -N of rumen fluid (p > 0.05), but GSO4 increased (p = 0.003) the concentration of propionic acid and reduced (p = 0.002) the concentration of acetate acid compared to the control. Inclusion 4% of GSO to the diet increased total antioxidant activity and decreased malondialdehyde in serum and muscle (p < 0.001). The level of blood glutathione peroxidase in diets containing GSO was higher than control diet (p = 0.02), but diets had no effect on superoxide dismutase in blood and muscle tissues (p > 0.05). The concentration of , rumenic acid and linoleic acid and thus polyunsaturated fatty acid in subcutaneous  was affected by experimental diets (p < 0.001), as control had the lowest amount of these FAs and GSO4 had the highest amount of them. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of GSO up to 4% improves the antioxidant status and adipose fatty acid profile in lambs without effects on performance.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281760>Deletion of ELOVL6 blocks the synthesis of oleic acid but does not prevent the development of fatty liver or insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Elongation of very long chain fatty acid-like family member 6 (ELOVL6) is a fatty acyl elongase that performs the initial and rate-limiting condensing reaction required for microsomal elongation of long-chain fatty acids. Our previous in vitro studies suggested that ELOVL6 elongated long-chain saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 to 16 carbons. Here, we describe the generation and phenotypic characterization of Elovl6(-/-) mice. As predicted from the in vitro studies, livers from Elovl6(-/-) mice accumulated palmitic (C16:0) and palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) fatty acids and contained significantly less stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1, n-9) acids, confirming that ELOVL6 is the only enzyme capable of elongating palmitate (C16:0). Unexpectedly, Elovl6(-/-) mice produced  (C18:1, n-7), the elongated product of palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7), suggesting that palmitoleate (C16:1, n-7) to vaccenate (C18:1, n-7) elongation was not specific to ELOVL6. The only detected consequence of deleting Elovl6(-/-) in mice was that their livers accumulated significantly more triglycerides than wild-type mice when fed a -free/high-carbohydrate diet. When mice were fed a high- diet or ELOVL6 was deleted in ob/ob mice, the absence of ELOVL6 did not alter the development of obesity, fatty liver, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia. Combined, these results suggest that palmitoleic (C16:1, n-7) and vaccenic (C18:1, n-7) acids can largely replace the roles of oleic acid (C18:1, n-9) in vivo and that the deletion of ELOVL6 does not protect mice from the development of hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28704429>Effects of coconut oil on glycemia, inflammation, and urogenital microbial parameters in female Ossabaw mini-pigs.</a></h2><p>Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether obesity induced by an excess calorie, high  diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a 'thrifty' metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of . Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid . This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of obesity and high  diets may affect , immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732887>Fatty acid levels alterations in THP-1 macrophages cultured with lead (Pb).</a></h2><p>As cardiovascular events are one of the main causes of death in developed countries, each factor potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease deserves special attention. One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), lauric acid (C12:0), tridecanoic acid (C13:0), myristic acid (C14:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), and behenic acid (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (18:1w9), trans- (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (linoleic acid (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6), arachidonic acid (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk , to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their  to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for energy supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty acid (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis- (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic acid (C18:4n-3). The changes in milk composition related to additional heat loss in horned cows indicate a competition in C3  for glucose synthesis and de novo FA synthesis under cold stress.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.
