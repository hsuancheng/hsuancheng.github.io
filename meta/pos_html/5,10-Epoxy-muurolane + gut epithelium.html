In a subsequent study, we found that entinostat, an aroylated phenylenediamine compound, has similar therapeutic potential against shigellosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate entinostat as a potential candidate for host-directed therapy against cholera in an experimental model. -infected rabbits were treated with two different dose regimens of entinostat: either 0. mg twice daily for 2 days or 1 mg once daily for 2 days. The effects of treatment on clinical outcomes and  shedding (CFU count in stool) were observed. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to assess CAP-18 expression in ileal and jejunal mucosae. The serum zonulin level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate  permeability. Infection of rabbits with  downregulated CAP-18 expression in the ileal ; the expression was replenished by oral treatment with entinostat at either dose regimen. The level of zonulin, a marker of  permeability, in serum was upregulated after infection, and this upregulation was counteracted after treatment with entinostat. Entinostat treatment also led to recovery from cholera and a decline in the  count in stool. In conclusion, the improved clinical outcome of cholera for rabbits treated with entinostat is associated with the induction of CAP-18 and the reduction of  epithelial permeability.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28800925>Resveratrol increases phagocytosis and lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1β production, but decreases surface expression of Toll-like receptor 2 in THP-1 monocytes.</a></h2><p>THP-1 monocytes were used to evaluate the effects of physiological levels of resveratrol aglycone, resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4'-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-sulfate on phagocytosis, IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-18 production, viability, and TLR2 and TLR4 expression.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a unique family of effector immune cells that functionally resemble T cells but lack clonal distributed antigen receptors. Group 2 ILCs, ILC2s, are known for their capability to secrete proallergic cytokines, including IL- and IL-13. ILC2s are enriched at mucosal barriers in lung, , and skin, and their activation has been associated with a variety of allergic disorders.  To study the role of ILC2 in different allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.  A MEDLINE search was performed for articles that reported on ILC2 in allergic disorders, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergies.  A review of the literature revealed an important role of ILC2 in various allergic disorders.  Identification of ILC2s in patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis indicates that these cells may represent a new therapeutic target.

Here, we investigated the thermo-acidophilic archaeal virus SMV1 as a candidate therapeutic nano-vector for the distal mammalian GI tract microbiome. We investigated the anatomical distribution, vector stability and immunogenicity of this virus following oral ingestion in mice and compared these traits to the more classically used Inovirus vector M13KE. We found that SMV1 particles were highly stable under both simulated GI tract conditions (in vitro) and in mice (in vivo). Moreover, SMV1 could not be detected in tissues outside the GI tract and it elicited a nearly undetectable inflammatory response. Finally, we used human intestinal organoids (HIOs) to show that labelled SMV1 did not invade or otherwise perturb the human GI tract .Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1 appeared stable and safe during passage though the mammalian GI tract.This is the first study evaluating an archaeal virus as a potential therapeutic nanoparticle delivery system and it opens new possibilities for future development of novel nanoplatforms.© 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27561293>Selenium Source Impacts Protection of Porcine Jejunal Epithelial Cells from Cadmium-Induced DNA Damage, with Maximum Protection Exhibited with Yeast-Derived Selenium Compounds.</a></h2><p>Selenium (Se) is found in inorganic and organic forms, both of which are commonly used in animal feed supplements. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the chemical form of Se on its associated ameliorative effects on cadmium (Cd)-induced DNA damage in a porcine model. At a cellular level, Cd mediates free oxygen radical production leading in particular to DNA damage, with consequential mutagenesis and inhibition of DNA replication. In this study, porcine jejunal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) were pre-incubated for 48 h with one of Se-yeast (Sel-Plex), selenomethionine (Se-M), sodium selenite (Se-Ni) or sodium selenate (Se-Na). The effects of this supplementation on cell viability and DNA damage following cadmium chloride (CdCl) exposure were subsequently evaluated. IPEC-J2 cells were cultivated throughout in medium supplemented with porcine serum to generate a superior model that recapitulated the porcine  . The results illustrated that Se antioxidant effects were both composition- and dose-dependent as evident from cell viability (Alamar Blue and -carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester) and DNA damage assays (Comet and TUNEL). Both the Se-yeast and Se-M organic species, when used at the European Food Safety Authority guideline levels, had a protective effect against Cd-induced DNA damage in the IPEC-J2 model system whereas for inorganic Se-Ni and Se-Na sources no protective effects were observed and in fact these were shown to enhance the negative effects of Cd-induced DNA damage. It can be concluded that nutritional supplementation with organoselenium may protect porcine  integrity from damage induced by Cd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27597263>Compartmentalization of microbial communities that inhabit the hindguts of millipedes.</a></h2><p>The  lumen of the arthropod detritivore provides hospitable and multifaceted environments for diverse assemblages of microbes. Many microbes, including trichomycetes fungi, bacteria, and archaea establish stable, adherent communities on the cuticular surface secreted by the hindgut . Regional differences in the surface topography within the hindgut of a given millipede are reflected in differing and diverse microbial assemblages. The spirostreptid millipede Cambala speobia is a detritivore found on the floors of Texas caves. This millipede species has a very circumscribed distribution in North America and a diet confined to the limited litter that accumulates on floors of these caves while the common julid millipede Cylindroiulus caeruleocinctus, an introduced European species, feeds on the diverse litter found in organic soils throughout North America. In both millipedes, the  lumina are inhabited along their entire lengths by microbes, with the highest microbial densities in the hindguts. The anterior third of the hindgut with its distinctive six-fold symmetry is lined by cuticle having fine polarized scales, and the posterior-most third is lined by smooth cuticle. Trichomycetes only inhabit the anterior third of the hindgut, and scattered patches of filamentous bacteria along with their smaller adherent microbes occupy the posterior third. The densest populations of microbes inhabit the central region of the hindgut. Over the cuticular surface of this hindgut region, uniformly distributed indentations mark possible channels for nutrient and water exchange between the hindgut lumen and host hemolymph.

Costus root is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that exhibits antibacterial properties and serves an inhibitory role in the regeneration of  bacteria. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Costus root-mediated improvements in ulcerative colitis remain unclear. A complex formula of Costus root granules was created and investigated in the present study for its therapeutic effects in a rat model of ulcerative colitis. Ingredient dissolution into a traditional water decoction was used as a control. The potential mechanism mediated by Costus root granules was also analyzed in colonic epithelial cells isolated from the experimental rats. The results of the present study demonstrated that Costus root granule treatment inhibited inflammation in colonic tissue. Costus root granule treatment also suppressed the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells isolated from the rat model of ulcerative colitis. Analyses of the underlying mechanisms of these effects indicated that the administration of Costus root granules increased transforming growth factor β expression, which activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase signaling pathway in colonic epithelial cells. Notably, the administration of Costus root granules improved stomachache, diarrhea and hematochezia in and increased the body weight of, the ulcerative colitis rats. In conclusion, these results indicate that Costus root granules markedly ameliorate inflammation of the colonic , decrease the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells and improve colonic function, which suggests that Costus root granules are an efficient agent for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29083773>Anatomy, Abdomen and Pelvis, Small Intestine.</a></h2><p>The small intestine is a crucial component of the digestive system that allows for the breakdown and absorption of important nutrients that permits the body to function at its peak performance. To do this, the small intestine is made up of a complex network of blood vessels, nerves, and muscles that work together to achieve this task. It is a massive organ that has an average length of 3 to  meters. It is divided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.[1][2][3]: The duodenum is the shortest section, on average measuring from 20 cm to 25 cm in length. Its proximal end is connected to the antrum of the stomach, separated by the pylorus. The distal end is at the ligament of Treitz, in which the jejunum begins. The duodenum surrounds the pancreases, in the shape of a "C." It receives chyme from the stomach, pancreatic enzymes, and bile from the liver. The jejunum is roughly 2. meters in length, contains plicae circulares (muscular flaps) and villi to absorb the products of digestion. The ileum comes next, measuring around 3 m, and ends at the cecum. It absorbs any nutrients that got past the jejunum, with major absorptive products being vitamin B12 and bile acids. : Serosa: The serosa is the outside layer of the small intestine and consists mesothelium and , which encircles the jejunum and ileum, and the anterior surface of the duodenum since the posterior side is retroperitoneal. The epithelial cells in the small intestine have a rapid renewal rate, with cells lasting for only 3 to  days. Muscularis: The muscularis consists of two smooth muscle layers, a thin outer longitudinal layer that shortens and elongates the , and a thicker inner circular layer of smooth muscle which causes constriction. Nerves lie between these two layers and allow these to muscle layers to work together to propagate food in a proximal to distal direction. Submucosa: The submucosa consists of a layer of connective tissue that contains the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics.   Mucosa: The mucosa is the innermost layer and is designed for maximal absorption by being covered with villi protruding into the lumen that increases the surface area. The crypt layer of the small bowel that is the area of continual cell renewal and proliferation. Cells move from the crypts to the villi and change into either enterocytes; goblet cells; Paneth cells; or enteroendocrine cells. Of importance is the mesentery, which is a double fold of the peritoneum that not only anchors the small intestines to the back of the abdominal wall, but also contains the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels that supply the small intestine.[4][]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560287>Mend Your Fences: The Epithelial Barrier and its Relationship With Mucosal Immunity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>The intestinal  can be easily disrupted during  inflammation as seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. For a long time, research into the pathophysiology of IBD has been focused on immune cell-mediated mechanisms. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the intestinal  might play a major role in the development and perpetuation of IBD. It is now clear that IBD can be triggered by disturbances in epithelial barrier integrity via dysfunctions in intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic molecular circuits that control the homeostasis, renewal, and repair of intestinal epithelial cells. The intestinal  in the healthy individual represents a semi-permeable physical barrier shielding the interior of the body from invasions of pathogens on the one hand and allowing selective passage of nutrients on the other hand. However, the intestinal  must be considered much more than a simple physical barrier. Instead, the  is a highly dynamic tissue that responds to a plenitude of signals including the intestinal microbiota and signals from the immune system. This epithelial response to these signals regulates barrier function, the composition of the microbiota, and mucosal immune homeostasis within the lamina propria. The  can thus be regarded as a translator between the microbiota and the immune system and aberrant signal transduction between the  and adjacent immune cells might promote immune dysregulation in IBD. This review summarizes the important cellular and molecular barrier components of the intestinal  and emphasizes the mechanisms leading to barrier dysfunction during intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30205381>Berberine Exerts a Protective Effect on -Vascular Barrier via the Modulation of the Wnt/Beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway During Sepsis.</a></h2><p>The -vascular barrier (GVB) has recently been depicted to dampen the bacterial invasion of the bloodstream. The intestinal mucosa is a tissue rich in small vessels including capillaries. In this study, the protective effect of berberine on GVB in small bowel mucosa was investigated.The rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model was employed to evaluate the effect of berberine on serum endotoxin level and intestinal vascular permeability to Evans blue in vivo. The rat intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (RIMECs) treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to assess the effect of berberine on endothelial permeability to FITC-labeled dextran, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), and tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) expression in vitro.After 24-hr CLP operation the serum endotoxin concentration and  vascular permeability were significantly increased, while berberine markedly reduced endotoxin level and vascular leakage. In vitro, LPS not only dramatically increased endothelial permeability of RIMECs to FITC-dextran, but also decreased TEER and inhibited claudin-12, beta-catenin and VE-cadherin expression. These effects of LPS were antagonized by berberine. In addition, our in vivo and vitro studies also confirmed that the effect of berberine on GVB could be partially abolished by ICG001.Berberine exerted a protective effect on GVB function in sepsis, which was strictly related to the modulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

Modulation of the microbiome and immune stimulation of the intestinal  were suggested as therapeutic approaches. In this study, live attenuated and dead bacterial cells of Salmonella Typhimurium SL7207 - a widely used bacterial vector for gene therapy were administered in DSS-induced colitis in mice. C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups. The first group received pure water (CTRL). The other three groups received 2% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis. Two DSS groups were treated with live attenuated (DSS live) or inactivated (DSS dead) Salmonella by gastric gavage. Intake of 2% DSS caused weight loss in all DSS groups compared to control mice with some improvement in DSS live group on the last day of the experiment. Significantly longer colon and improved stool consistency were reported in DSS live group, but not DSS dead group, when compared with DSS. Significant enlargement of spleens was observed only in DSS and DSS dead groups compared to control. Significant differences in stool consistency, colon length and spleen enlargement were observed between DSS live and DSS dead groups with beneficial effects of live bacteria. Interestingly, significant decrease in myeloperoxidase activity was detected in both, DSS live and DSS dead groups compared to the DSS group. On the basis of these results, progression of colitis seems to be beneficially influenced not only by live attenuated but to some extent also by inactivated Salmonella Typhimurium SL7207. Our results provide evidence that Salmonella-based gene therapy vectors are able to positively alter  homeostasis during DSS-induced colitis.Restoration of  homeostasis has a great importance in IBD. Here, we tested the nonspecific effect of the strain Salmonella Typhimurium SL7207 on the course of colitis to find out whether the potential effect would be mediated by activity of live bacterial cells or by bacterial structures that are also present in dead bacteria. Live bacterial therapy of colitis showed a beneficial effect on clinical signs as well as on macroscopic and inflammatory markers of colitis. On the other hand, therapy with dead bacteria showed inconsistent effects, negative in most clinical outcomes, positive especially in myeloperoxidase activity. Our data indicate that the beneficial effect of bacterial gene therapy vectors carrying therapeutic genes might be, at least partially, caused by the bacterial vector instead of the therapeutic gene.© 2016 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173933>Defensive Mutualism Rescues NADPH Oxidase Inactivation in  Infection.</a></h2><p>NOX/DUOX family of NADPH oxidases are expressed in diverse tissues and are the primary enzymes for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The enterovirus genus includes poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, enterovirus 71, and enterovirus D68. Enteroviruses primarily infect by the fecal-oral route and target the gastrointestinal epithelium early during their life cycles. In addition, spread via the respiratory tract is possible and some enteroviruses such as enterovirus D68 are preferentially spread via this route. Once internalized, enteroviruses are detected by intracellular proteins that recognize common viral features and trigger antiviral innate immune signaling.

They play an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by limiting microbial  interactions and preventing unnecessary microbe-driven inflammation. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) belongs to Regenerating islet-derived III proteins family and is a C-type (Ca dependent) lectin. PAP protein plays a protective effect presenting anti-inflammatory properties able to reduce the severity of colitis, preserving  barrier and epithelial inflammation. Here, we sought to determine whether PAP delivered at intestinal lumen by recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain (LL-PAP) before and after chemically induced colitis is able to reduce the severity in two models of colitis. After construction and characterization of our recombinant strains, we tested their effects in dinitro-benzenesulfonic-acid (DNBS) and Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. After the DNBS challenge, mice treated with LL-PAP presented less severe colitis compared with PBS and LL-empty-treated mice groups. After the DSS challenge, no protective effects of LL-PAP could be detected. We determined that after  days administration, LL-PAP increase butyrate producer's bacteria, especially Eubacterium plexicaudatum. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that a treatment with LL-PAP shifts the microbiota preventing the severity of colon inflammation in DNBS colitis model. These protective roles of LL-PAP in DNBS colitis model might be through intestinal microbiota modulation.© 2019 The Authors.

While each has been implicated in mediating sepsis mortality, the relationship between these two processes is unclear. We hypothesized that preventing intestinal apoptosis would prevent  barrier dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice that overexpress the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in the   (Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to sham laparotomy or cecal ligation and puncture and orally gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated-dextran (FD-4) five hours before sacrifice. Serum FD-4 concentration was assayed to measure intestinal permeability, and jejunal tight junctions were assayed for mRNA and protein expression. Baseline FD-4 concentration was similar between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. Intestinal permeability increased 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following sepsis in WT mice; however, FD-4 concentration was significantly lower at each timepoint in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes in permeability between septic and sham transgenic mice. Intestinal mRNA expression of claudin 3, claudin  and occludin were lower in septic Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice while claudin 4 mRNA levels were higher in Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice. In contrast, no differences were detected in claudins 2, 7, 15, JAM-A or ZO-1. Protein levels followed the same trend for all tight junction mediators different between WT and Fabpl-Bcl-2 mice except occludin was significantly higher in transgenic mice. Together these results demonstrate that decreasing intestinal epithelial apoptosis prevents hyperpermeability following sepsis via tight junction alterations which may be at least partially responsible for improved survival conferred by Bcl-2 overexpression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27250564>Death in the intestinal -basic biology and implications for inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Every 4- days, intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) are terminated as they reach the end of their life. This process ensures that the  is comprised of the fittest cells that maintain an impermeable barrier to luminal contents and the  microbiota, as well as the most metabolically able cells that conduct functions in nutrient absorption, digestion, and secretion of antimicrobial peptides. IEC are terminated by apical extrusion-or shedding-from the intestinal epithelial monolayer into the  lumen. Whether death by apoptosis signals extrusion or death follows expulsion by younger IEC has been a matter of debate. Seemingly a minor detail, IEC death before or after apical extrusion bears weight on the potential contribution of apoptotic IEC to intestinal homeostasis as a consequence of their recognition by intestinal lamina propria phagocytes. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), excessive death is observed in the ileal and colonic . The precise mode of IEC death in IBD is not defined. A highly inflammatory milieu within the intestinal lamina propria, rich in the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, increases IEC shedding and compromises barrier integrity fueling more inflammation. A milestone in the treatment of IBD, anti-TNF-α therapy, may promote mucosal healing by reversing increased and inflammation-associated IEC death.

Previously, we have reported that some 6-amino-2,4,-trimethylpyridin-3-ols have significant levels of antiangiogenic activity via PI3K inhibition. Based on the reports that angiogenesis is involved in the aggravation of IBD and that PI3K is a potential target for IBD therapy, we investigated whether the scaffold has inhibitory activity against in vitro and in vivo models of colitis. Many analogues showed >80% inhibition against TNF-α-induced monocyte adhesion to colon epithelial cells at 1μM. Compound 8m showed IC50=0.19μM, which is about five orders of magnitude better than that of -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA, IC50=18.1mM), a positive control. In a rat model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, orally administered 8m dramatically ameliorated TNBS-induced colon inflammation. It was demonstrated by a high level of suppression in myeloperoxidase (MPO), a surrogate marker of colitis, as well as almost perfect recovery of colon and body weights in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to sulfasalazine, a prodrug of -ASA, compound 8m showed >300-fold better efficacy in those parameters.

However, whether -HT plays a functional role in bacteria from the  microbiota remains unknown. We demonstrate that elevating levels of intestinal lumenal -HT by oral supplementation or genetic deficiency in the host -HT transporter (SERT) increases the relative abundance of spore-forming members of the  microbiota, which were previously reported to promote host -HT biosynthesis. Within this microbial community, we identify Turicibacter sanguinis as a  bacterium that expresses a neurotransmitter sodium symporter-related protein with sequence and structural homology to mammalian SERT. T. sanguinis imports -HT through a mechanism that is inhibited by the selective -HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. -HT reduces the expression of sporulation factors and membrane transporters in T. sanguinis, which is reversed by fluoxetine exposure. Treating T. sanguinis with -HT or fluoxetine modulates its competitive colonization in the gastrointestinal tract of antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, fluoxetine reduces the membership of T. sanguinis in the  microbiota of conventionally colonized mice. Host association with T. sanguinis alters intestinal expression of multiple gene pathways, including those important for lipid and steroid metabolism, with corresponding reductions in host systemic triglyceride levels and inguinal adipocyte size.

Serum from 10 CD patients collected during first three consecutive infliximab treatments with matched pretreatment and follow-up samples one week after each treatment and corresponding HBI data were analyzed. I-FABP reference interval was established from 31 healthy subjects with normal  permeability. I-FABP and TNF were measured by ELISA; CRP was measured by nephelometry. Healthy tissue was used for I-FABP immunohistochemistry. Pretreatment CD patient TNF was 1.6-fold higher than in-house reference interval, while I-FABP was 2.-fold higher, which lowered at follow-ups. Combining all 30 infusion/follow-up pairs also revealed changes in I-FABP. HBI followed this pattern; CRP declined gradually. I-FABP was expressed in  of stomach, jejunum, ileum, and colon, with the highest expression in jejunum and ileum. I-FABP is elevated in active CD with a magnitude comparable to TNF. Parallel infliximab effects on TNF, HBI, and I-FABP were found. I-FABP may be useful as an intestine selective prognostic marker in CD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28369951>Ginger Extract Suppresses Inflammatory Response and Maintains Barrier Function in Human Colonic Epithelial Caco-2 Cells Exposed to Inflammatory Mediators.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of ginger in the management of gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported. In this study, the anti-inflammatory potential of ginger extract was assessed in a cellular model of  inflammation. In addition, the effects of ginger extract and its major active compounds on intestinal barrier function were evaluated. The response of Caco-2 cells following exposure to a mixture of inflammatory mediators [interleukin [IL]-1β, 25 ng/mL; lipopolysaccharides [LPS], 10 ng/mL; tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, 50 ng/mL; and interferon [INF]-γ, 50 ng/mL] were assessed by measuring the levels of secreted IL-6 and IL-8. In addition, the mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were measured. Moreover, the degree of nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibition was examined, and the intestinal barrier function was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran transfer. It was observed that ginger extract and its constituents improved inflammatory responses by decreasing the levels of nitrite, PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8 via NF-κB inhibition. The ginger extract also increased the TEER and decreased the transfer of FITC-dextran from the apical side of the  to the basolateral side. Taken together, these results show that ginger extract may be developed as a functional food for the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.© 2017 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30391532>Screening of intestinal probiotics and the effects of feeding probiotics on the growth, immune, digestive enzyme activity and intestinal flora of Litopenaeus vannamei.</a></h2><p>In this experiment, 426 strains were isolated from the intestinal tract of Litopenaeus vannamei, and 11 strains showed strong digestive enzyme production activity and antagonistic effect against common bacterial pathogens of shrimp. After hemolysis activity test and drug sensitivity test, 2 candidate probiotics with good bacteriostatic activity, strong enzyme production ability and relatively sensitive to antibiotics were screened out, and were identified by 16s rDNA molecular identification and Biolog-System as Enterobacter hominis (E3) and lactobacillus (L3). First, the biological characteristics of 2 candidate probiotics were studied. The optimum growth conditions of E3: temperature, 30 °C; pH, 8.0; NaCl, 2.%; bovine bile salt, 0.15%; and the optimum growth conditions of L3: temperature, 40 °C; pH, 6.0; NaCl, 0.%; bovine bile salt, 0.0015%. Secondly, a 28-day feeding experiment was conducted using probiotic concentration of 10 CFU g to determine the changes of the activities of blood related immune enzymes (SOD, PPO, ACP, POD, CAT, LZM) and intestinal digestive enzymes (NP, AL, LPS) during the feeding process of shrimp, the results showed that during the course of feeding, the activities of immune enzyme and digestive enzyme of shrimp fed with probiotics showed an increasing trend, and the growth rate of body weight of shrimp was higher than that of control group. After feeding, the cumulative mortality of probiotics groups were significantly lower than that of the control group after WSSV infection. And the mid- of L. vannamei was observed by electron microscope, the results showed that the intestinal mucosa was tight and the  cells showed an active secretory state in probiotics group. Finally, the intestinal microbial communities of shrimp were compared and analyzed by using Biolog-ECO method in the later period of feeding, the results showed: compared with the control group, the average color change rate of the experimental group fed with probiotics increased significantly, indicating that probiotics enhanced the intestinal microorganism activity; The ability of intestinal microorganism to utilize carbon source was significantly enhanced in the experimental group, which indicated that the digestive enzyme secreted by probiotics could improve the digestion and absorption rate of prawn feed, thus promoting the rapid growth of shrimp; The Shannon index, Simpson index and McIntosh index of probiotics groups showed significant difference in 1st and 5th days, but tended to be the same in the 10th day, the results showed that probiotics could maintain in L. vannamei intestines at least  days.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Whether, like animals, amoebae also use tissue-level barriers to reduce direct contact with bacteria has remained unclear. We have explored this question in the social amoeba , which forms plaques on lawns of bacteria that expand as amoebae divide and bacteria are consumed. We show that CadA, a cell adhesion protein that functions in  development, is also a bacterial agglutinin that forms a protective interface at the plaque edge that limits exposure of vegetative amoebae to bacteria. This interface is important for amoebal survival when bacteria-to-amoebae ratios are high, optimizing amoebal feeding behavior, and protecting amoebae from oxidative stress. Lectins also control bacterial access to the   of mammals to limit inflammatory processes; thus, this strategy of antibacterial defense is shared across a broad spectrum of eukaryotic taxa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309318>Distribution and co-expression patterns of specific cell markers of enteroendocrine cells in pig gastric .</a></h2><p>Although the pig is an accepted model species for human digestive physiology, no previous study of the pig gastric mucosa and gastric enteroendocrine cells has investigated the parallels between pig and human. In this study, we have investigated markers for each of the classes of gastric endocrine cells, gastrin, ghrelin, somatostatin, -hydroxytryptamine, histidine decarboxylase, and PYY cells in pig stomach. The lining of the proximal stomach consisted of a collar of stratified squamous  surrounded by gastric cardiac glands in the fundus. This differs considerably from human that has only a narrow band of cardiac glands at its entrance, surrounded by a fundic mucosa consisting of oxyntic glands. However, the linings of the corpus and antrum are similar in pig and human. Likewise, the endocrine cell types are similar and similarly distributed in the two species. As in human, gastrin cells were almost exclusively in the antrum, ghrelin cells were most abundant in the oxyntic mucosa and PYY cells were rare. In the pig, 70% of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the antrum and 95% in the fundus contained -hydroxytryptamine (-HT), higher proportions than in human. Unlike the enteroendocrine of the small intestine, most gastric enteroendocrine cells (EEC) did not contain colocalised hormones. This is similar to human and other species. We conclude that the pig stomach has substantial similarity to human, except that the pig has a protective lining at its entrance that may reflect the difference between a pig diet with hard abrasive components and the soft foods consumed by humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474815>Probiotic supplementation promotes a reduction in T-cell activation, an increase in Th17 frequencies, and a recovery of intestinal  integrity and mitochondrial morphology in ART-treated HIV-1-positive patients.</a></h2><p>HIV infection is characterized by a persistent immune activation associated to a compromised  barrier immunity and alterations in the profile of the fecal flora linked with the progression of inflammatory symptoms. The effects of high concentration multistrain probiotic (Vivomixx®, Viale del Policlinico 155, Rome, Italy in EU; Visbiome®, Dupont, Madison, Wisconsin in USA) on several aspects of intestinal immunity in ART-experienced HIV-1 patients was evaluated.A sub-study of a longitudinal pilot study was performed in HIV-1 patients who received the probiotic supplement twice a day for 6 months (T6). T-cell activation and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets expressing IFNγ (Th1, Tc1) or IL-17A (Th17, Tc17) were stained by cytoflorimetric analysis. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on intestinal biopsies while enterocytes apoptosis index was determined by TUNEL assay.A reduction in the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets, expressing CD38 , HLA-DR , or both, and an increase in the percentage of Th17 cell subsets, especially those with central or effector memory phenotype, was recorded in the peripheral blood and in -associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) after probiotic intervention. Conversely, Tc1 and Tc17 levels remained substantially unchanged at T6, while Th1 cell subsets increase in the GALT. Probiotic supplementation was also associated to a recovery of the integrity of the  epithelial barrier, a reduction of both intraepithelial lymphocytes density and enterocyte apoptosis and, an improvement of mitochondrial morphology sustained in part by a modulation of heat shock protein 60.These findings highlight the potential beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation for the reconstitution of physical and immunological integrity of the mucosal intestinal barrier in ART-treated HIV-1-positive patients.© 2017 The Authors.

Dysbiosis of the microbiota has been correlated to a large and still increasing number of diseases. Recent studies have mostly focused on analyzing the associations between disease and an aberrant microbiota composition. Functional studies using (in vitro)  models are required to investigate the precise interactions that occur between specific bacteria (or bacterial mixtures) and  epithelial cells. As most  bacteria are obligate or facultative anaerobes, studying their effect on oxygen-requiring human  epithelial cells is technically challenging. Still, several (anaerobic) bacterial-epithelial co-culture systems have recently been developed that mimic host-microbe interactions occurring in the human , including 1) the Transwell "apical anaerobic model of the intestinal epithelial barrier", 2) the Host-Microbiota Interaction (HMI) module, 3) the "Human oxygen-Bacteria anaerobic" (HoxBan) system, 4) the human -on-a-chip and ) the HuMiX model.

Of these, sweet, bitter, and umami tastes are detected by lingual G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recently, these receptors were also localized to the  mucosa. In this review, we will emphasize recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of foregut luminal chemosensing, with special emphasis on cell surface GPCRs such as the sweet and proteinaceous taste receptors (TASRs), short- and long-chain fatty acid (FA) receptors, and bile acid receptors. The majority of these luminal chemosensors are expressed on enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are specialized endocrine cells in the intestine and pancreas that release  hormones with ligand activation. These  hormones are responsible for a wide variety of physiologic and homeostatic mechanisms, including glycemic control, appetite stimulation and suppression, regulation of gastric emptying, and trophic effects on the intestinal . Released from the EECs, the  peptides have paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine effects. Additionally, EECs have unique direct connections to the enteric nervous system enabling precise transmission of sensory data to and communication with the central nervous system. We will also describe how  sensors are implicated in  hormone release, followed by examples of how altered  chemosensing has been implicated in pathological conditions such as metabolic diseases including diabetes and obesity, functional dyspepsia, helminthic infections, colitis, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric inflammation and cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391236>Bidirectional Cross-Talk between Biliary  and Th17 Cells Promotes Local Th17 Expansion and Bile Duct Proliferation in Biliary Liver Diseases.</a></h2><p>There is no effective treatment for autoimmune biliary diseases. Therefore, understanding their immunopathology is crucial. The biliary epithelial cells (BEC), expressing TLR-4, are constantly exposed to  microbes and bacterial wall LPS, and in settings of inflammation, the immune infiltrate is dense within the peribiliary region of human liver. By dual immunohistochemistry, we affirm human intrahepatic T cell infiltrate includes CCR6CD4 and AhRCD4 T cells with potential for plasticity to Th17 phenotype. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Th1 and Th17 inflammatory cytokines and LPS enhance human primary BEC release of the CCR6 ligand CCL20 and BEC secretion of Th17-polarizing cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β. Cell culture assays with human BEC secretome showed that secretome polarizes CD4 T cells toward a Th17 phenotype and supports the survival of Th17 cells. BEC secretome did not promote Th1 cell generation. Additionally, we give evidence for a mutually beneficial feedback of the type 17 cell infiltrate on BEC, showing that treatment with type 17 cytokines increases BEC proliferation, as monitored by Ki67 and activation of JAK2-STAT3 signaling. This study identifies human BEC as active players in determining the nature of the intrahepatic immune microenvironment. In settings of inflammation and/or infection, biliary  establishes a prominent peribiliary type 17 infiltrate via recruitment and retention and enhances polarization of intrahepatic CD4 cells toward Th17 cells via type 17 cytokines, and, reciprocally, Th17 cells promote BEC proliferation for biliary regeneration. Altogether, we provide new insight into cross-talk between Th17 lymphocytes and human primary biliary  in biliary regenerative pathologies.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231546>Increased Oral Bioavailability of Resveratrol by Its Encapsulation in Casein Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that provides several health benefits including cardioprotection and cancer prevention. However, its biological activity is limited by a poor bioavailability when taken orally. The aim of this work was to evaluate the capability of casein nanoparticles as oral carriers for resveratrol. Nanoparticles were prepared by a coacervation process, purified and dried by spray-drying. The mean size of nanoparticles was around 200 nm with a resveratrol payload close to 30 μg/mg nanoparticle. In vitro studies demonstrated that the resveratrol release from casein nanoparticles was not affected by the pH conditions and followed a zero-order kinetic. When nanoparticles were administered orally to rats, they remained within the , displaying an important capability to reach the intestinal . No evidence of nanoparticle "translocation" were observed. The resveratrol plasma levels were high and sustained for at least 8 h with a similar profile to that observed for the presence of the major metabolite in plasma. The oral bioavailability of resveratrol when loaded in casein nanoparticles was calculated to be 26.%, 10 times higher than when the polyphenol was administered as oral solution.

Autophagy is an important catabolic recycling pathway that degrades long-lived proteins and some organelles by lysosome to maintain cellular homeostasis. Although impaired autophagy is thought to be closely correlated with Crohn's disease (CD), the functional role of autophagy in the maintenance of  microbiota is poorly understood. As autophagy-related  () is a key gene associated with the extension of the phagophoric membrane in autophagic vesicles, we established a -specific  knockout mouse model, and we found that the disruption of autophagic flux in the intenstinal  cells dramatically altered the composition of the  microbiota and reduced alpha diversity. Microbial function prediction indicated that the pathway allocated for infectious diseases was enriched in  mice. " Arthromitus" and the  family were increased in  mice, whereas  and the  family were reduced. Transcriptome analysis revealed that two key inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related transcription factors, RORC and TBX21, of host cells were upregulated in  mice, thus elevating the Muc2-related immunological response. The findings suggest that intestinal autophagy plays a vital role in modulating the diversity and composition of  microbiota. The homeostasis of host-microbiota interactions is of great importance to host health. Previous studies demonstrated that disruption of autophagy was linked to inflammatory bowel disease. However, the interaction mechanism of  microbiota regulated by autophagy was obscure. In an intestinal -specific autophagy-related  () knockout mouse model, we observed a significant alteration and decreased diversity in the  microbiota of -deficient mice compared with that of wild-type mice. Although the numbers of some organisms (e.g.,  and members of the  family) associated with the control of inflammation decreased, those of proinflammationory bacteria (e.g., " Arthromitus") and potential pathogens (the  family) increased in  mice. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that two key genes,  and , involved in inflammatory bowel disease were upregulated in  mice. Our study suggests that  deficiency results in an imbalance of the host-microbe interaction and deterioration of the  microenvironment.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164991>Morphogenesis and development of midgut symbiotic organ of the stinkbug  (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae).</a></h2><p>Diverse insects are intimately associated with microbial symbionts, which play a variety of biological roles in their adaptation to and survival in the natural environment. Such insects often possess specialized organs for hosting the microbial symbionts. What developmental processes and mechanisms underlie the formation of the host organs for microbial symbiosis is of fundamental biological interest but poorly understood. Here we investigate the morphogenesis of the midgut symbiotic organ and the process of symbiont colonization therein during the developmental course of the stinkbug . Upon hatching, the midgut is a simple and smooth tube. Subsequently, symbiont colonization to the posterior midgut occurs, and thickening and folding of the midgut  proceed during the first instar period. By the second instar, rudimentary crypts have formed, and their inner cavities are colonized by the symbiotic bacteria. From the second instar to the fourth instar, while the alimentary tract grows and the posterior midgut is established as the symbiotic organ with numerous crypts, the anterior midgut and the posterior midgut are structurally and functionally isolated by a strong constriction in the middle. By the early fifth instar, the midgut symbiotic organ attains the maximal length, but toward the mid fifth instar, the basal region of each crypt starts to constrict and narrow, which deforms the midgut symbiotic organ as a whole into a shorter, thicker and twisted shape. By the late fifth instar to adulthood, the crypts are constricted off, by which the symbiotic bacteria are confined in the crypt cavities and isolated from the midgut main tract, and concurrently, the strong midgut constriction in the middle becomes loose and open, by which the food flow from the anterior midgut to the posterior midgut recovers. This study provides the most detailed and comprehensive descriptions ever reported on the morphogenesis of the symbiotic organ and the process of symbiont colonization in an obligatory insect-bacterium  symbiotic system. Considering that  is recently emerging as a useful model system for experimentally studying the intimate insect-microbe  symbiosis, the knowledge obtained in this study establishes the foundation for the further development of this research field.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29388261>SALMFamide2 and serotonin immunoreactivity in the nervous system of some acoels (Xenacoelomorpha).</a></h2><p>Acoel worms are simple, often microscopic animals with direct development, a multiciliated epidermis, a statocyst, and a digestive parenchyma instead of a  . Morphological characters of acoels have been notoriously difficult to interpret due to their relative scarcity. The nervous system is one of the most accessible and widely used comparative features in acoels, which have a so-called commissural brain without capsule and several major longitudinal neurite bundles. Here, we use the selective binding properties of a neuropeptide antibody raised in echinoderms (SALMFamide2, or S2), and a commercial antibody against serotonin (-HT) to provide additional characters of the acoel nervous system. We have prepared whole-mount immunofluorescent stainings of three acoel species: Symsagittifera psammophila (Convolutidae), Aphanostoma pisae, and the model acoel Isodiametra pulchra (both Isodiametridae). The commissural brain of all three acoels is delimited anteriorly by the ventral anterior commissure, and posteriorly by the dorsal posterior commissure. The dorsal anterior commissure is situated between the ventral anterior commissure and the dorsal posterior commissure, while the statocyst lies between dorsal anterior and dorsal posterior commissure. S2 and serotonin do not co-localise, and they follow similar patterns to each other within an animal. In particular, S2, but not -HT, stains a prominent commissure posterior to the main (dorsal) posterior commissure. We have for the first time observed a closed posterior loop of the main neurite bundles in S. psammophila for both the amidergic and the serotonergic nervous system. In I. pulchra, the lateral neurite bundles also form a posterior loop in our serotonergic nervous system stainings.© 2018 The Authors Journal of Morphology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552621>Intestinal Epithelial Sirtuin 1 Regulates Intestinal Inflammation During Aging in Mice by Altering the Intestinal Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial homeostasis is maintained by complex interactions among epithelial cells, commensal  microorganisms, and immune cells. Disruption of this homeostasis is associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms of this process are not clear. We investigated how Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a conserved mammalian NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, senses environmental stress to alter intestinal integrity.We performed studies of mice with disruption of Sirt1 specifically in the intestinal  (SIRT1 iKO, villin-Cre+, Sirt1 mice) and control mice (villin-Cre-, Sirt1) on a C57BL/6 background. Acute colitis was induced in some mice by addition of 2.% dextran sodium sulfate to drinking water for -9 consecutive days. Some mice were given antibiotics via their drinking water for 4 weeks to deplete their microbiota. Some mice were fed with a cholestyramine-containing diet for 7 days to sequester their bile acids. Feces were collected and proportions of microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. Intestines were collected from mice and gene expression profiles were compared by microarray and quantitative PCR analyses. We compared levels of specific mRNAs between colon tissues from age-matched patients with ulcerative colitis (n=10) vs without IBD (n=8, controls).Mice with intestinal deletion of SIRT1 (SIRT1 iKO) had abnormal activation of Paneth cells starting at the age of -8 months, with increased activation of NF-κB, stress pathways, and spontaneous inflammation at 22-24 months of age, compared with control mice. SIRT1 iKO mice also had altered fecal microbiota starting at 4-6 months of age compared with control mice, in part because of altered bile acid metabolism. Moreover, SIRT1 iKO mice with defective  microbiota developed more severe colitis than control mice. Intestinal tissues from patients with ulcerative colitis expressed significantly lower levels of SIRT1 mRNA than controls. Intestinal tissues from SIRT1 iKO mice given antibiotics, however, did not have signs of inflammation at 22-24 months of age, and did not develop more severe colitis than control mice at 4-6 months.In analyses of intestinal tissues, colitis induction, and  microbiota in mice with intestinal epithelial disruption of SIRT1, we found this protein to prevent intestinal inflammation by regulating the  microbiota. SIRT1 might therefore be an important mediator of host-microbiome interactions. Agents designed to activate SIRT1 might be developed as treatments for IBDs.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

Then, in an experimental study of the free-living predatory soil mite Pergamasus longicornis (Berlese), quantitative micro-anatomical changes in the   are critically assessed from a temporal series of histological sections during and after feeding on larval dipteran prey. An argued functional synthesis based upon comparative kinetics is offered for verification in other mesostigmatids. Mid- and hind- epithelia cell types interconvert in a rational way dependent upon the physical consequences of ingestion, absorption and egestion. The fasted transitional pseudo-stratified  rapidly becomes first squamous on prey ingestion (by stretching), then columnar during digestion before confirmed partial disintegration ( 'lumenation') during egestion back to a pseudo-stratified state. Exponential processes within the mid- and endodermic hind- exhibit 'stiff' dynamics. Cells expand rapidly ([Formula: see text] 22.9-49. min) and vacuolate quickly ([Formula: see text] 1.1 h). Cells shrink very slowly ([Formula: see text] 4.9 days) and devacuolate gently ([Formula: see text] 1.0-1.7 days). Egestive cellular degeneration has an initial [Formula: see text] 7.7 h. Digestion appears to be triggered by maximum  expansion-estimated at 10 min post start of feeding. Synchrony with changes in  lumen contents suggests common changes in physiological function over time for the cells as a whole tightly-coupled . Distinct in architecture as a tissue over time the various constituent cell types appear functionally the same. Functional phases are: early fluid transportation (0-1 h) and extracellular activity (10-90 min); through rising food absorption (10 min to [Formula: see text] day); to slow intracellular meal processing and degenerative egestive waste material production (1 to [Formula: see text] days) much as in ticks. The same  is both absorptive and degenerative in role. The switch in predominant physiology begins 4 h after the start of feeding. Two separate pulses of clavate cells appear to be a mechanism to facilitate transport by increasing epithelial surface area in contact with the lumen. Free-floating cells may augment early extracellular lumenal digestion. Possible evidence for salivary enzyme alkaline-related extra-corporeal digestion was found. Giant mycetome-like cells were found embedded in the mid- wall. Anteriorly, the mid- behaves like a temporally expendable food processing tissue and minor long-term resistive store. Posteriorly the mid- behaves like a major assimilative/catabolic tissue and 'last-out' food depot (i.e., a 'hepatopancreas' function) allowing the mite to resist starvation for up to 3. weeks after a single meal. A 'conveyor-belt' wave of physiology (i.e., feeding and digestion, then egestion and excretion) sweeps posteriorly but not necessarily pygidially over time. Assimilation efficiency is estimated at 82%. The total feeding cycle time histologically from a single meal allowing for the bulk of intracellular digestion and egestive release is not 52. h but of the order of 6 days ([Formula: see text] total  emptyings per day), plus typically a further 3 days for subsequent excretion to occur. Final complete  system clearance in this cryptozooid may take much longer ([Formula: see text] days). A common physiology across the anactinotrichid acarines is proposed. A look to the future of this field is included.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27577581> Microbiota Promote Angiotensin II-Induced Arterial Hypertension and Vascular Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The  microbiome is essential for physiological host responses and development of immune functions. The impact of  microbiota on blood pressure and systemic vascular function, processes that are determined by immune cell function, is unknown.Unchallenged germ-free mice (GF) had a dampened systemic T helper cell type 1 skewing compared to conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice. Colonization of GF mice with regular  microbiota induced lymphoid mRNA transcription of T-box expression in T cells and resulted in mild endothelial dysfunction. Compared to CONV-R mice, angiotensin II (AngII; 1 mg/kg per day for 7 days) infused GF mice showed reduced reactive oxygen species formation in the vasculature, attenuated vascular mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NADPH oxidase subunit Nox2, as well as a reduced upregulation of retinoic-acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (Rorγt), the signature transcription factor for interleukin (IL)-17 synthesis. This resulted in an attenuated vascular leukocyte adhesion, less infiltration of Ly6G(+) neutrophils and Ly6C(+) monocytes into the aortic vessel wall, protection from kidney inflammation, as well as endothelial dysfunction and attenuation of blood pressure increase in response to AngII. Importantly, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis and systolic dysfunction were attenuated in GF mice, indicating systemic protection from cardiovascular inflammatory stress induced by AngII. microbiota facilitate AngII-induced vascular dysfunction and hypertension, at least in part, by supporting an MCP-1/IL-17 driven vascular immune cell infiltration and inflammation.© 2016 The Authors.

INM is suggested to be at least partially cytoskeleton-dependent and to regulate not only the proliferation/differentiation of stem/progenitor cells but also the localized/overall size and shape of organs/tissues. INM occurs in all three of the germ-layer derived epithelia, including the endoderm-derived . However, INM has not been documented in the esophagus and respiratory tube arising from the anterior foregut. Esophageal atresia with or without trachea-esophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is a relatively common developmental defect. Transcription factors and signaling molecules have been implicated in EA/TEF, but the etiology of EA/TEF-which has been suggested to involve cell polarity-related mechanisms-remains highly controversial. In the present study, we first examined whether INM exists in the trachea and esophagus of mouse embryos at embryonic day 11. (E11.), just after separation of the two tubes from the anterior foregut. By labeling the DNA-synthesizing stem cell nuclei with -ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, a nucleotide analogue, and statistically analyzing chronological changes in the distribution pattern of the labeled nuclei by using multidimensional scaling, we showed the existence of INM in both the esophagus and trachea, with differences in the INM magnitude and cycle pattern. We further showed morphological changes from the INM-based pseudostratified single layer to the stratified multilayer in the esophageal  in association with a temporal loss/perturbation of AB polarity, suggesting a possible relation with the pathogenesis of EA/TEF.© 2017 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245885>Olive oil bioactive compounds increase body weight, and improve  health and integrity in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata).</a></h2><p>An olive oil bioactive extract (OBE) rich in bioactive compounds like polyphenols, triterpenic acids, long-chain fatty alcohols, unsaturated hydrocarbons, tocopherols and sterols was tested (0, 0·08, 0·17, 0·42 and 0·73 % OBE) in diets fed to sea bream (Sparus aurata) (initial weight: ·4 (sd 1·2) g) during a 90-d trial (four replicates).

There were no differences in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities in the intestine and liver, although there was a tendency of lower intestinal and hepatic LPO levels in fish fed OBE diets. No differences in villus size were found among treatments, whereas goblet cell density in the control group was on average14·3 % lower than in fish fed OBE diets. The transcriptomic profiling of intestinal markers, covering different biological functions like (i) cell differentiation and proliferation, (ii) intestinal permeability, (iii) enterocyte mass and epithelial damage, (iv) IL and cytokines, (v) pathogen recognition receptors and (vi) mitochondria function, indicated that among the eighty-eight evaluated genes, twenty-nine were differentially expressed (0·17 % OBE diet), suggesting that the additive has the potential of improving the condition and defensive role of the intestine by enhancing the maturation of enterocytes, reducing oxidative stress, improving the integrity of the intestinal  and enhancing the intestinal innate immune function, as gene expression data indicated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035616>Protection of the Ovine Fetal  against -Induced Chorioamnionitis: A Potential Role for Plant Sterols.</a></h2><p>Chorioamnionitis, clinically most frequently associated with , is linked to intestinal inflammation and subsequent  injury. No treatment is available to prevent chorioamnionitis-driven adverse intestinal outcomes. Evidence is increasing that plant sterols possess immune-modulatory properties. Therefore, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of plant sterols in lambs intra-amniotically (IA) exposed to . Fetal lambs were IA exposed to  (, UP) for six days from 127 d-133 d of gestational age (GA). The plant sterols β-sitosterol and campesterol, dissolved with β-cyclodextrin (carrier), were given IA every two days from 122 d-131 d GA. Fetal circulatory cytokine levels,  inflammation, intestinal injury, enterocyte maturation, and mucosal phospholipid and bile acid profiles were measured at 133 d GA (term 150 d). IA plant sterol administration blocked a fetal inflammatory response syndrome. Plant sterols reduced intestinal accumulation of proinflammatory phospholipids and tended to prevent mucosal myeloperoxidase-positive (MPO) cell influx, indicating an inhibition of  inflammation. IA administration of plant sterols and carrier diminished intestinal mucosal damage, stimulated maturation of the immature , and partially prevented -driven reduction of mucosal bile acids. In conclusion, we show that β-sitosterol and campesterol administration protected the fetus against adverse  outcomes following UP-driven chorioamnionitis by preventing intestinal and systemic inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483294>Type IV Pili Promote Clostridium difficile Adherence and Persistence in a Mouse Model of Infection.</a></h2><p>Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a second messenger that regulates the transition from motile to sessile lifestyles in numerous bacteria and controls virulence factor production in a variety of pathogens.

Here we show that c-di-GMP promotes adherence to epithelial cells , which can be partly attributed to the loss of flagella. Using TFP-null mutants, we demonstrate that adherence to epithelial cells is partially mediated by TFP and that this TFP-mediated adherence requires c-di-GMP regulation. In a mouse model of colonization, the TFP-null mutants initially colonized the intestine as well as the parental strain but were cleared more quickly. Moreover, compared to the parent strain,  strains lacking TFP were particularly deficient in association with the cecal mucosa. Together these data indicate that TFP and their positive regulation by c-di-GMP promote attachment of  to the intestinal  and contribute to persistence of  in the host intestine.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29523750>Altered microbiome in chronic kidney disease: systemic effects of -derived uremic toxins.</a></h2><p>In chronic kidney disease (CKD), influx of urea and other retained toxins exerts a change in the  microbiome. There is decreased number of beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, an essential nutrient for the colonic , concurrent with an increase in bacteria that produce uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulphate, -cresyl sulphate, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Due to intestinal wall inflammation and degradation of intercellular tight junctions, -derived uremic toxins translocate into the bloodstream and exert systemic effects. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for -derived uremic toxins in promoting multiorgan dysfunction via inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptosis pathways. End-organ effects include vascular calcification, kidney fibrosis, anemia, impaired immune system, adipocyte dysfunction with insulin resistance, and low turnover bone disease. Higher blood levels of -derived uremic toxins are associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality in the CKD population. Clinical trials that have examined interventions to trap toxic products or reverse  microbial dysbiosis via oral activated charcoal AST-120, prebiotics and probiotics have not shown impact on cardiovascular or survival outcomes but were limited by sample size and short trials. In summary, the  microbiome is a major contributor to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and progression of CKD.© 2018 The Author(s).

In addition to direct deposition, PM can be indirectly deposited in oropharynx via mucociliary clearance and upon swallowing of saliva and mucus. Within the GI tract, PM may alter the GI  and  microbiome. Our goal was to determine the effect of PM on  microbiota in a murine model of PM exposure via inhalation. C57BL/6 mice were exposed via inhalation to either concentrated ambient particles or filtered air for 8-h per day, -days a week, for a total of 3-weeks. At exposure's end, GI tract tissues and feces were harvested, and  microbiota was analyzed. Alpha-diversity was modestly altered with increased richness in PM-exposed mice compared to air-exposed mice in some parts of the GI tract. Most importantly, PM-induced alterations in the microbiota were very apparent in beta-diversity comparisons throughout the GI tract and appeared to increase from the proximal to distal parts. Changes in some genera suggest that distinct bacteria may have the capacity to bloom with PM exposure. Exposure to PM alters the microbiota throughout the GI tract which maybe a potential mechanism that explains PM induced inflammation in the GI tract.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

While breast milk yields important developmental benefits, there are situations where it is unavailable resulting in a need for formula feeding. Most formulas do not contain MFGM, but derive their lipids from vegetable sources, which differ greatly in size and composition. Here we tested the effects of MFGM supplementation on intestinal development and the microbiome as well as its potential to protect against Clostridium difficile induced colitis. The pup-in-a-cup model was used to deliver either control or MFGM supplemented formula to rats from  to 15 days of age; with mother's milk (MM) reared animals used as controls. While CTL formula yielded significant deficits in intestinal development as compared to MM littermates, addition of MFGM to formula restored intestinal growth, Paneth and goblet cell numbers, and tight junction protein patterns to that of MM pups. Moreover, the  microbiota of MFGM and MM pups displayed greater similarities than CTL, and proved protective against C. difficile toxin induced inflammation. Our study thus demonstrates that addition of MFGM to formula promotes development of the intestinal  and microbiome and protects against inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28648659>Enterochromaffin Cells Are  Chemosensors that Couple to Sensory Neural Pathways.</a></h2><p>Dietary, microbial, and inflammatory factors modulate the -brain axis and influence physiological processes ranging from metabolism to cognition.

Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are proposed to fulfill this role by acting as chemosensors, but understanding how these rare and unique cell types transduce chemosensory information to the nervous system has been hampered by their paucity and inaccessibility to single-cell measurements. Here, we circumvent this limitation by exploiting cultured intestinal organoids together with single-cell measurements to elucidate intrinsic biophysical, pharmacological, and genetic properties of EC cells. We show that EC cells express specific chemosensory receptors, are electrically excitable, and modulate serotonin-sensitive primary afferent nerve fibers via synaptic connections, enabling them to detect and transduce environmental, metabolic, and homeostatic information from the  directly to the nervous system.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Limited access to human samples and relevant experimental models have hampered progress in NEC pathogenesis. Earlier evidence has suggested that bacterial colonization of an immature and developing intestine can lead to an abnormally high inflammatory response to bacterial bioproducts. The aim of our study was to use human fetal organoids to gain insights into NEC pathogenesis.RNA sequencing analysis was performed to compare patterns of gene expression in human fetal-derived enterospheres (FEnS) and adult-derived enterospheres (AEnS). Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using computational techniques for dimensional reduction, clustering, and gene set enrichment. Unsupervised cluster analysis, Gene Ontology, and gene pathway analysis were used to predict differences between gene expression of samples. Cell monolayers derived from FEnS and AEnS were evaluated for  function and responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide and commensal bacteria.Based on gene expression patterns, FEnS clustered according to their developmental age in 2 distinct groups: early and late FEnS, with the latter more closely resembling AEnS. Genes involved in maturation,  barrier function, and innate immunity were responsible for these differences. FEnS-derived monolayers exposed to either lipopolysaccharide or commensal  showed that late FEnS activated gene expression of key inflammatory cytokines, whereas early FEnS monolayers did not, owing to decreased expression of nuclear factor-κB-associated machinery.Our results provide insights into processes underlying human intestinal development and support the use of FEnS as a relevant human preclinical model for NEC.

Our previous study has shown that diphenyldihaloketone drugs 4-[3,-bis[(2-chlorophenyl)methylene]-4-oxo-1-piperidinyl]-4-oxo-2-butenoic acid (CLEFMA) and 3,-bis[(2-fluorophenyl)methylene]-4-piperidinone (EF24) restore  barrier dysfunction and reduce systemic inflammatory response in hemorrhagic shock. We investigated the effect of hemorrhagic shock on proteasome activity of intestinal  and how CLEFMA and EF24 treatments modulate proteasome function in hemorrhagic shock. CLEFMA or EF24 (0.4 mg/kg) were given 1 h after withdrawing 50% of blood from Sprague-Dawley rats; no other resuscitation was provided. After another  h of compensation, small  was collected to process tissue for proteasome activity, immunoblotting, and mRNA levels of genes responsible for unfolded-protein response (XBP1, ATF4, glucose-regulated protein of 78/95 kDa, and growth arrest and DNA damage inducible genes 153/34), polyubiquitin B and C, and immunoproteasome subunits β type-8 and -10 and proteasome activator subunit 1. We found that hemorrhagic shock induced proteasome activity in  tissue and reduced the amounts of ubiquitinated proteins displayed on antiubiquitin immunoblots. However, simultaneous induction of unfolded-protein response or immunoproteasome genes was not observed. CLEFMA and EF24 treatments abolished the hemorrhagic shock-induced increase in proteasome activity. Further investigations revealed that the induction of proteasome in hemorrhagic shock is associated with disassembly of 26S proteasome; CLEFMA and EF24 prevented this disassembly. Consistent with these data, CLEFMA and EF24 reduced hemorrhagic shock-induced degradation of 20S substrate ornithine decarboxylase in  tissue. These results suggest that activated proteasome plays an important role in ischemic  pathophysiology, and it can be a druggable target in shock-induced  dysfunction.

One important factor in this process is the serine protease HtrA, which is secreted into the extracellular space, and helps the bacteria to transmigrate across the   by cleaving various cell-cell adhesion proteins. The aim of the present study is to quantify the amount of HtrA molecules secreted per bacterial cell in liquid culture and during infection.HtrA protein purification and quantitative Western blotting were used to determine the number of HtrA molecules secreted by two  model strains, 11168 and 81-176, in liquid culture during an 8-h time course. On average, the two strains yielded similar HtrA secretion rates, with strain 11168 secreting 4314 ± 949 molecules and 81-176 secreting 5483 ± 1246 per bacterium after 2 h. After 8 h, both strains showed a decrease in the average amount of HtrA secreted per bacterial cell over time. Secretion of HtrA by strain 11168 reduced to about 1772 ± 520 molecules and only 2151 ± 562 HtrA molecules were secreted by strain 81-176 at this time point. During infection of  epithelial cells, the secretion of HtrA is slightly higher with a similar secretion pattern over time compared to culturing in vitro.We determined the number of HtrA molecules secreted by single  cells over time. The results suggest that HtrA secretion is regulated in a time-dependent fashion, leading to increasing accumulative HtrA concentrations in the extracellular medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31030221>Feeding of deoxynivalenol increases the intestinal paracellular permeability of broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>In recent years, the deleterious effects attributed to mycotoxins, in particular on the intestine, faced increased attention and it was shown that deoxynivalenol (DON) causes adverse effects on  health. In this context, it has been repeatedly reported that DON can alter the intestinal morphology, disrupt the intestinal barrier and reduce nutrient absorption. The underlying mechanism of a compromised intestinal barrier caused by DON in chickens has yet to be illustrated. Although, DON is rapidly absorbed from the upper parts of the small intestine, the effects on the large intestine cannot be excluded. Additionally, a damaging effect of DON on the   might decrease the resistance of the  against infectious agents. Consequently, the objectives of the present studies were: (1) to investigate the impact of DON on the epithelial paracellular permeability by demonstrating the mucosal to serosal flux of C-mannitol in the small and large intestine applying Ussing chambers and (2) to delineate the effects of DON on the colonization and translocation of Escherichia coli. Both parameters are well suited as potential indicators for  barrier failure. For this, a total of 75 one-day-old Ross 308 broiler chickens were housed in floor pens on wood shavings with feed and water provided ad libitum. Birds were randomly allocated to three different groups (n = 25 with  replicates/group) and were fed for  weeks with either contaminated diets ( or 10 mg DON/kg feed) or basal diets (control). Body weight (BW) and BW gain of birds in the group fed with 10 mg/kg DON were significantly lower than in group with  mg/kg DON and the control group. Moreover, the mannitol flux in jejunum and cecum was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in DON-fed groups compared to control birds. Consistent with this, DON enhanced the translocation of E. coli with a higher number of bacteria encountered in the spleen and liver. Altogether, the actual results verified that DON can alter the intestinal paracellular permeability in broiler chickens and facilitates the translocation of enteric microorganisms such as E. coli to extra-intestinal organs. Considering that moderate levels of DON are present in feed, the consumption of DON-contaminated feed can induce an intestinal breakdown with negative consequences on broiler health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30661054>Genome-wide association analysis of diverticular disease points towards neuromuscular, connective tissue and epithelial pathomechanisms.</a></h2><p>Diverticular disease is a common complex disorder characterised by mucosal outpouchings of the colonic wall that manifests through complications such as diverticulitis, perforation and bleeding.

The localisation of expressed protein at selected loci was investigated by immunohistochemistry.We discovered 48 risk loci, of which 12 are novel, with genome-wide significance and consistent OR in the replication sample. Nominal replication (p<0.05) was observed for 27 loci, and additional 8 in meta-analysis with a population-based cohort. The most significant novel risk variant rs9960286 is located near  with a p value of 2.3×10 and 0.002 (OR=1.14 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.24)) in the replication analysis.

We investigated whether intestinal epithelial cell-derived CCL20 is negatively regulated by TGF-β1 and whether Smad7 knock-down reduces CCL20 in CD.CCL20 was evaluated in NCM460, a normal colonic epithelial cell line, stimulated with TGF-β1 and TNF-α, and in Smad7 over-expressing NCM460 cells. CCL20 and Smad7 expression were assessed in sections of CD intestinal specimens by immunochemistry, and in CD colonic explants treated with mongersen, a Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide. CCL20 was examined in serum samples taken from 95 of 166 active CD patients receiving mongersen or placebo for 2 weeks and participating in a phase II, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.CCL20 expression was increased by TNF-α, and this effect was inhibited by TGF-β1 in NCM460 cells, but not in Smad7 over-expressing NCM460 cells. In CD,  CCL20 and Smad7 co-localised, and treatment of CD explants with mongersen reduced CCL20 production.

This study aimed to examine the use of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) in mitigating damages caused by UC on the colon . Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC mice were treated with vehicle control, TRF, alpha-tocopherol (αTP) and -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA). Observable clinical signs, quality of stool, histopathological scoring, inflammatory and oxidative markers were assessed. Vitamin E levels of colons and plasma were quantified. Oral supplementation of TRF significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced UC by lowering the disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological inflammatory scoring. TRF also attenuated the DSS-induced enlargement of spleen and shortening of the colon. TRF has demonstrated marked anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties indicated by the attenuation of DSS-induced upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and pNF-κB. These improvements were similar to that of -aminosalicylic acid (-ASA) treatment. In contrast, αTP did not demonstrate evident clinical and histopathological improvements. The superior protective effect of TRF may be ascribed to the preferential absorption of TRF by the  mucosa. TRF alleviated the signs and symptoms of acute UC in murine model via the reduction of local inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress.

This process underlies the utility of exogenous GC-C agonists such as linaclotide for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Because GC-C agonists have limited use in pediatric patients, there is a need for alternative cGMP-elevating agents that are effective in the intestine. The present study aimed to determine whether the PDE- inhibitor sildenafil has similar effects as linaclotide on preclinical models of constipation. Oral administration of sildenafil caused increased cGMP levels in mouse intestinal  demonstrating that blocking cGMP-breakdown is an alternative approach to increase cGMP in the . Both linaclotide and sildenafil reduced proliferation and increased differentiation in colon mucosa, indicating common target pathways. The homeostatic effects of cGMP required  turnover since maximal effects were observed after 3 days of treatment. Neither linaclotide nor sildenafil treatment affected intestinal transit or water content of fecal pellets in healthy mice. To test the effectiveness of cGMP elevation in a functional motility disorder model, mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis and were allowed to recover for several weeks. The recovered animals exhibited slower transit, but increased fecal water content. An acute dose of sildenafil was able to normalize transit and fecal water content in the DSS-recovery animal model, and also in loperamide-induced constipation. The higher fecal water content in the recovered animals was due to a compromised epithelial barrier, which was normalized by sildenafil treatment. Taken together our results show that sildenafil can have similar effects as linaclotide on the intestine, and may have therapeutic benefit to patients with CIC, IBS-C, and post-infectious IBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30107202>Serotonin, hematopoiesis and stem cells.</a></h2><p>A large number of studies have focused on the role of serotonin as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, although only a small percentage of the body's serotonin (∼%) can be found in the mature brain of mammals. In the , the enterochromaffin cells are scattered in the enteric  from the stomach through the colon and produce over 95% of the body's serotonin. Since the generation of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph1 and Tph2) knockout mice, unsuspected roles have been identified for serotonin synthesized outside the brain. Moreover, the murine model deficient in peripheral serotonin (Tph1) is a unique experimental tool for exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms involving serotonin's local effects through microserotonergic systems. In this review, we focus on peripheral serotonin and its role on progenitor or stem cells as well as on hematopoietic progenitors. We discuss the possible role of serotonin in hematopoietic diseases, and whether targeting the serotonergic system could be of therapeutic value for the regulation of normal and pathological hematopoiesis.Copyright © 2018.

To preserve the  integrity under constant exposure of intense physiological and environmental stressors, this surface is continuously and rapidly renewed by pluripotent intestinal epithelial stem cells that reside in the base of crypts. A recent study by Kaiko . shows that structural design of intestinal crypts protects the colonic epithelial stem/progenitor cells from proliferation-suppressing metabolites derived from the  microbiota. Among these metabolites, butyrate is identified as the most potent inhibitor of colonic epithelial stem/progenitor cells proliferation. By rapidly metabolizing the butyrate, the colonocytes at the crypt further institute a metabolic barrier to protect the crypt-resident stem cells that fuel its renewal and repair.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063247>Replacing corn with sorghum in the diet alters intestinal microbiota without altering chicken performance.</a></h2><p>Sorghum grain can be used to replace corn in broiler diets. However, the effects related to an abrupt change between these grains are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance and intestinal health of broilers fed diets containing corn and/or sorghum during different periods of rearing. To accomplish this aim, 2100 male chicks were fed the following experimental diets: C100% (corn-based diet); S100% (sorghum-based diet); C:S50% (diet based on corn and sorghum 1:1); PC-S (corn-based diet in the pre-starter phase and sorghum-based diet in subsequent phases); and PS-C (sorghum-based diet in the pre-starter phase and corn-based diet in subsequent phases). The study was conducted with two simultaneous trials in a randomized block design as follows: a performance trial up to 40 days occurred in floor pens (n = 8), and the metabolism trial occurred in cages (n = 10). Performance, jejunal morphometry, number of goblet cells, apparent metabolizable energy (AME), apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) and the coefficient of apparent metabolizability of dry matter (CMDM) of the diets, and the intestinal microbiota of small intestine and caeca at 10 and 21 days of age (16S gene sequencing) were evaluated. The different experimental diets did not affect performance, jejunal , AME, AMEn or CMDM. However, the experimental diets altered the percentages of the genera Clostridium, Weissella, Bacillus and Alkaliphilus in the small intestine. In addition, the genera Lactobacillus and Desulfotomaculum in the caeca were altered. The age also affected the microbiota of the intestinal segments. In conclusion, feeding sorghum in place of corn as well as the grain change after the pre-starter phase does not alter broiler performance. However, sorghum alters the intestinal microbiota, resulting in a lower percentage of Clostridium and a higher percentage of Lactobacillus in the small intestine and caeca, respectively.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28146004>Epithelial-specific Toll-like Receptor (TLR) Activation Mediates Barrier Dysfunction in Experimental Ileitis.</a></h2><p>A large body of evidence supports a central role of TLR5 and its natural ligand, flagellin, in Crohn's disease (CD), with the precise mechanism(s) still unresolved.We investigated the role of flagellin/TLR5 in SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) mice, a spontaneous model of Crohn's disease-like ileitis.Ileal Tlr5 and serum antiflagellin IgG antibodies were increased in SAMP before the onset of inflammation and during established disease; these trends were abrogated in the absence of colonizing commensal bacteria. Irradiated SAMP receiving either wild-type (AKR) or SAMP bone marrow (BM) developed severe ileitis and displayed increased ileal Tlr5 compared with AKR recipients of either SAMP or AKR bone marrow, neither of which conferred ileitis, suggesting that elevated TLR5 in native SAMP is derived primarily from a nonhematopoietic (e.g., epithelial) source. Indeed, ileal epithelial TLR5 in preinflamed SAMP was increased compared with age-matched AKR and germ-free SAMP. TLR5-specific ex vivo activation of SAMP ileal tissues decreased epithelial barrier resistance, indicative of increased permeability, and was accompanied by altered expression of the tight junction proteins, claudin-3, occludin, and zonula occludens-1.Our results provide evidence that aberrant, elevated TLR5 expression is present in the ileal  of SAMP mice, is augmented in the presence of the  microbiome, and that TLR5 activation in response to bacterial flagellin results in a deficiency to maintain appropriate epithelial barrier integrity. Together, these findings represent a potential mechanistic pathway leading to the exacerbation and perpetuation of chronic  inflammation in experimental ileitis and possibly, in patients with Crohn's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29897487>Dietary Red Raspberry Reduces Colorectal Inflammation and Carcinogenic Risk in Mice with Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation, increasing the likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry (RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known to have anti-inflammatory activity; however, the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis has not been examined.This study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation,  repair, and oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis in mice.Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB (% of dry feed weight; n = 12/group) diet for 10 wk. Starting from the fourth week, mice were administered 2 repeated cycles of 1% DSS (7-d DSS treatment plus 14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index (DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the end of the study for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of inflammation, differentiation and proliferation markers.RB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage (by 38.9%; P ≤ 0.01), expression of inflammatory mediators (by 20-70%; P ≤ 0.01), infiltration of CD4 T cells (by 50%; P ≤ 0.05), and α4β7 integrin and related adhesion molecules (by 33.3%; P ≤ 0.01). Furthermore, RB supplementation facilitated  repair, as evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density, expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), terminal differentiation markers, mucin 2 (Muc2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (by 20-200%; P ≤ 0.01). Conversely, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (by 70%; P ≤ 0.01), β-catenin, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling (by 19-33%; P ≤ 0.05) were reduced by RB supplementation. In addition, RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability (by 53%) and reduced oncogenic gene expression (by 50-60%).RB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis in mice, suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis and related  inflammatory diseases.© 2018 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529258>Nutraceutical Improvement Increases the Protective Activity of Broccoli Sprout Juice in a Human Intestinal Cell Model of  Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Benefits to health from a high consumption of fruits and vegetables are well established and have been attributed to bioactive secondary metabolites present in edible plants. However, the effects of specific health-related phytochemicals within a complex food matrix are difficult to assess. In an attempt to address this problem, we have used elicitation to improve the nutraceutical content of seedlings of Brassica oleracea grown under controlled conditions. Analysis, by LC-MS, of the glucosinolate, isothiocyanate and phenolic compound content of juices obtained from sprouts indicated that elicitation induces an enrichment of several phenolics, particularly of the anthocyanin fraction. To test the biological activity of basal and enriched juices we took advantage of a recently developed in vitro model of inflamed human intestinal . Both sprouts' juices protected intestinal barrier integrity in Caco-2 cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor α under marginal zinc deprivation, with the enriched juice showing higher protection. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the extent of rescue from stress-induced epithelial dysfunction correlated with the composition in bioactive molecules of the juices and, in particular, with a group of phenolic compounds, including several anthocyanins, quercetin-3-Glc, cryptochlorogenic, neochlorogenic and cinnamic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30449598>IFN-γ, IL-17A, or zonulin rapidly increase the permeability of the blood-brain and small intestinal epithelial barriers: Relevance for neuro-inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) precedes lesion formation in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Since recent data implicate disruption of the small intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) in the pathogenesis of MS, we hypothesized that the increased permeability of the BBB and IEB are mechanistically linked. Zonulin, a protein produced by small intestine , can rapidly increase small intestinal permeability. Zonulin blood levels are elevated in MS, but it is unknown whether zonulin can also disrupt the BBB. Increased production of IL-17A and IFN-γ has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS, epilepsy, and stroke, and these cytokines impact BBB integrity after 24 h. We here report that primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells expressed the EGFR and PAR2 receptors necessary to respond to zonulin, and that zonulin increased BBB permeability to a 40 kDa dextran tracer within 1 h. Moreover, both IL-17A and IFN-γ also rapidly increased BBB and IEB permeability. By using confocal microscopy, we found that exposure of the IEB to zonulin, IFN-γ, or IL-17A in vitro rapidly modified the localization of the TJ proteins, ZO-1, claudin-, and occludin. TJ disassembly was accompanied by marked depolymerization of the peri-junctional F-actin cytoskeleton. Our data indicate that IFN-γ, IL-17A, or zonulin can increase the permeability of the IEB and BBB rapidly in vitro, by modifying TJs and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. These observations may help clarify how the -brain axis mediates the pathogenesis of neuro-inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous  transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. Here we describe a transitional columnar  with distinct basal progenitor cells (p63KRT5KRT7) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional . On ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate into intestinal-like  (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar  is present at the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human . Acid reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered  (believed to be a precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified transitional zone in the  of the upper gastrointestinal tract and provide evidence that the p63KRT5KRT7 basal cells in this zone are the cells of origin for multi-layered  and Barrett's oesophagus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28452683>Mechanisms and pathways of Toxoplasma gondii transepithelial migration.</a></h2><p>Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite and a prevalent food-borne parasitic pathogen. Infection of the host occurs principally through oral consumption of contaminated food and water with the gastrointestinal tract being the primary route for entry into the host. To promote infection, T. gondii has evolved highly specialized strategies for rapid traversal of the single cell thick intestinal epithelial barrier. Parasite transmigration via the paracellular pathway between adjacent cells enables parasite dissemination to secondary sites of infection where chronic infection of muscle and brain tissue is established. It has recently been proposed that parasite interactions with the integral tight junction (TJ) protein occludin influences parasite transmigration of the intestinal . We review here the emerging mechanisms of T. gondii transmigration of the small intestinal  alongside the developing role played in modulating the wider TJ-associated proteome to rewire host cell regulatory systems for the benefit of the parasite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30128227>Oral Nonviral Gene Delivery for Chronic Protein Replacement Therapy.</a></h2><p>Efficient nonviral oral gene delivery offers an attractive modality for chronic protein replacement therapy. Herein, the oral delivery of insulin gene is reported by a nonviral vector comprising a copolymer with a high degree of substitution of branched polyethylenimine on chitosan (CS-g-bPEI). Protecting the plasmid from gastric acidic degradation and facilitating transport across the  , the CS-g-bPEI/insulin plasmid DNA nanoparticles (NPs) can achieve systemic transgene expression for days. A single dose of orally administered NPs (600 µg plasmid insulin (pINS)) to diabetic mice can protect the animals from hyperglycemia for more than 10 d. Three repeated administrations spaced over a 10 d interval produce similar glucose-lowering results with no hepatotoxicity detected. Positron-emission-tomography and computed-tomography images also confirm the glucose utilization by muscle cells. While this work suggests the feasibility of basal therapy for diabetes mellitus, its significance lies in the demonstration of a nonviral oral gene delivery system that can impact chronic protein replacement therapy and DNA vaccination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27616575>Endothelium-independent vasorelaxant effect of 20(S)-protopanaxadiol on isolated rat thoracic aorta.</a></h2><p>Ginsenosides are considered to be the major pharmacologically active ginseng constituents, whereas 20(S)-protopanaxadiol [20(S)-PPD] is the active metabolite of ginsenosides in . In this study we investigated the effect of 20(S)-PPD on isolated rat thoracic aortas as well as its vasorelaxant mechanisms.Aortic rings with or without endothelium were prepared from Wistar rats and suspended in organ-chambers. The changes in tension of the preparations were recorded through isometric transducers connected to a data acquisition system. The aortic rings were precontracted with phenylephrine (PE, 1 μmol/L) or high-K (80 mmol/L).Application of 20(S)-PPD (21.-108. μmol/L) caused concentration-dependent vasodilation of endothelium-intact aortic rings precontracted with PE or high-K, which resulted in the EC values of 90.4 or 46. μmol/L, respectively. The removal of endothelium had no effect on 20(S)-PPD-induced relaxation. The vasorelaxant effect of 20(S)-PPD was also not influenced by the preincubation with β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, or with ATP-sensitive K channel blocker glibenclamide, voltage-dependent K channel blocker 4-AP and inward rectifier K channel blocker BaCl, whereas it was significantly attenuated by the preincubation with Ca-activated K (BK) channel blocker TEA (1 mmol/L). Furthermore, the inhibition of NO synthesis, cGMP and prostacyclin pathways did not affect the vasorelaxant effect of 20(S)-PPD. In Ca-free solution, 20(S)-PPD (108. μmol/L) markedly decreased the extracellular Ca-induced contraction in aortic rings precontracted with PE or high-K and reduced PE-induced transient contraction. Voltage-dependent Ca channel antagonist nifedipine inhibited PE-induced contraction; further inhibition was observed after the application of receptor-operated Ca channel inhibitor SK&F 96365 or 20(S)-PPD.20(S)-PPD induces vasorelaxation via an endothelium-independent pathway. The inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca channels and receptor-operated Ca channels and the activation of Ca-activated K channels are probably involved in the relaxation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28343662>Epithelial IGF1R is dispensable for IGF2 mediated enhanced intestinal adaptation in retinoblastoma-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Previously, we demonstrated enhanced adaptation after small bowel resection (SBR) in intestinal-specific retinoblastoma (Rb)-deficient mice along with elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression within the villi. The purpose of this study was to verify that the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) plays a role in this phenomenon.Inducible and intestinal specific Rb and IGF1R double knockout mice (iRb/IGF1R-IKO) (n=4) and Rb single knockout mice (iRb-IKO) (n=) underwent 50% mid SBR. On post-operative day 28, mice were harvested, and structural adaptation was measured as changes in crypt depth and villus height. Rates of enterocyte proliferation were recorded. IGF2 expression within the remnant villi was measured via RT-PCR.Both iRb-IKO and iRb/IGF1R-IKO mice demonstrated enhanced adaptation with at least a 45% increase in both crypt depth and villus height in the proximal and distal remnant bowel. Both groups showed elevation of IGF2 expression in the remnant villi, but there were no differences between the two groups.Epithelial IGF1R is dispensable for IGF2-mediated enhanced intestinal adaptation in retinoblastoma-deficient mice.

Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), normally present in neural tissue, exists in close apposition to the mucosal immune system and intestinal , and a bi-directional communication is known to occur at these interfaces. Somatostatin has been shown to suppress the inflammatory reaction, and has been used in several clinical trials to treat inflammatory disorders, such rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, somatostatin receptor type 2A, that regulates neurotransmission, proliferation, and apoptosis, has been recognized in IBD. Although prominent abnormalities in the morphology of the enteric nervous system have been observed in idiopathic IBD, they are more marked in Crohn disease.A 55-year-old woman with recurrent Crohn disease, just surgically treated for ileal resection, have a stenotic complication.At surgery  cm of preterminal ileum with stenosis and anastomotic ileocolic block was removed.The histopathology showed a recurrent Crohn in fistulo-stenotic phase; the stenosis was mainly sustained by mass-forming, ganglioneuromatous hyperplasia. Normally very rare, fine nerve twigs extend up into mucosa but we found a new-formed fibrillary network, extending into the inflammation area at the subepithelial luminal site of the mucosa, that was positive to PD-L1 and somatostatin receptor type 2A (SSTR2A) immunostaining but not visualized in routinary stained slides.After surgery the patient was semestrally followed with clinical endoscopic evaluation that results uneventfully.Our case shows that before surgery neuromatous abnormalities can be predicted by immunostained new-formed twigs in the mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875401>Supplementation of p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived protein, in early life promotes epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent intestinal development and long-term health outcomes.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects of the  microbiota on growth in early life are well known. However, knowledge about the mechanisms underlying regulating intestinal development by the microbiota is limited. p40, a Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-derived protein, transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in intestinal epithelial cells for protecting the intestinal  against injury and inflammation. Here, we developed p40-containing pectin/zein hydrogels for targeted delivery of p40 to the small intestine and the colon. Treatment with p40-containing hydrogels from postnatal day 2 to 21 significantly enhanced bodyweight gain prior to weaning and functional maturation of the intestine, including intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and tight junction formation, and IgA production in early life in wild-type mice. These p40-induced effects were abolished in mice with specific deletion of EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that transactivation of EGFR in intestinal epithelial cells may mediate p40-regulated intestinal development. Furthermore, neonatal p40 treatment reduced the susceptibility to intestinal injury and colitis and promoted protective immune responses, including IgA production and differentiation of regulatory T cells, in adult mice. These findings reveal novel roles of neonatal supplementation of probiotic-derived factors in promoting EGFR-mediated maturation of intestinal functions and innate immunity, which likely promote long-term beneficial outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27510419>Quantitative analysis of mucosal oxygenation using ex vivo imaging of healthy and inflamed mammalian colon tissue.</a></h2><p>Colonic inflammation is associated with decreased tissue oxygenation, significantly affecting  homeostasis. However, the crosstalk between O consumption and supply in the inflamed tissue are not fully understood. Using a murine model of colitis, we analysed O in freshly prepared samples of healthy and inflamed colon tissue. We developed protocols for efficient ex vivo staining of mouse distal colon mucosa with a cell-penetrating O sensitive probe Pt-Glc and high-resolution imaging of O concentration in live tissue by confocal phosphorescence lifetime-imaging microscopy (PLIM). Microscopy analysis revealed that Pt-Glc stained mostly the top 50-60 μm layer of the mucosa, with high phosphorescence intensity in epithelial cells. Measured O values in normal mouse tissue ranged between  and 35 μM (4-28 Torr), tending to decrease in the deeper tissue areas. Four-day treatment with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) triggered colon inflammation, as evidenced by an increase in local IL6 and mKC mRNA levels, but did not affect the gross architecture of colonic . We further observed an increase in oxygenation, partial activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1 signalling, and negative trends in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and O consumption rate in the colitis mucosa, suggesting a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, which is known to be regulated via HIF-1 signalling and pyruvate oxidation rate.

Therefore, impact of NiO-NPs exposure (0, , 50, 200, 500 and 1000 mg kg soil) on the earthworm (Eisenia fetida) survival (at 28th day), reproduction (at 56th day), histopathology, ultrastructures, antioxidant enzymes and oxidative DNA damage was appraised in full life cycle study. Lower concentrations of NiO-NPs (, 50 and 200) did not influence the survival, reproduction and growth rate of adult worms significantly. However, reproduction reduced by 40-50% with 500 and 1000 mg kg exposure, which also induced oxidative stress leading to DNA damage in earthworms. Ultrastructural observation and histology of earthworms exposed to higher NiO-NPs concentrations revealed abnormalities in  layer, microvilli and mitochondria with underlying pathologies of epidermis and muscles, as well as adverse effects on the  barrier. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study unveiling the adverse effects of NiO-NPs on a soil invertebrate (Eisenia fetida).

In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, barrier is provided by multiple components of the mucosa, including mucus production, epithelial junctional complexes, and the production of antimicrobial molecules. In recent years, it is better appreciated that tissue oxygen metabolism is key to homeostasis in the mucosa. The intestine, for example, maintains a low baseline Po level due to high rates of metabolism, countercurrent blood flow, and the presence of a steep oxygen gradient across the luminal aspect of tissue surface. As a result, hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent signaling exists even in the healthy, unperturbed intestinal mucosa. In a number of examples, HIF has been demonstrated both to promote barrier function during homeostasis and to promote resolution of active inflammation. Hypoxia-elicited factors that contribute to innate responses in the mucosa include the transcriptional regulation of mucin genes, junction proteins, and autophagic flux. Here, we review current literature related to hypoxia and innate immunity in health and during mucosal inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27355242>Insulin-Like Peptide  Interacts with Sex Hormones and Metabolic Parameters in a Gender and Adiposity Dependent Manner in Humans.</a></h2><p>Insulin-like peptide  (INSL5) is a  hormone produced by L-cells in the colorectal  and may play a role in the regulation of metabolic processes. The biological role of INSL5 is poorly investigated and nothing is known about the role of this hormone in obese and lean humans. Two cohorts were analyzed in the study. In the first cohort (n=76) the relationship between serum levels of INSL5 and different metabolic and hormonal parameters in obese and lean men and women were investigated. In the second cohort 14 male subjects underwent bariatric surgery. Circulating levels of INSL5 were then measured before and after interventions.We report for the first time that circulating INSL5 interacts with multiple metabolic and hormonal variables in lean and obese men and women and is affected by bariatric surgery. Serum levels of INSL5 negatively correlated with testosterone and blood lipids but positively with cortisol in obese men. In contrast to males, obese women had a strong negative correlation of plasma levels of INSL5 with C-reactive protein (CRP). We observed that adipose tissue loss after bariatric surgery significantly reduced serum levels of INSL5 in obese men with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) that was associated with the restoration of circulating levels of testosterone.

We investigated MUC expression in cholesterol-associated gallbladder disease and evaluated the relationship between mucin and bacterial infection.The present study involved 20 patients with cholesterol stones with cholecystitis, five with cholesterol stones with cholesterolosis, six with cholesterol polyps, two with gallbladder cancer, and six controls. Canine GBECs treated with lipopolysaccharide were also studied. MUC3, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6 antibodies were used for dot/slot immunoblotting and immunohistochemical studies of the gallbladder epithelial tissues, canine GBECs, and bile.

Greatly increased levels of MUC3 and MUC5B expression were observed in the cholesterol stone group, and slightly increased levels were observed in the cholesterol polyp group; MUC3 and MUC5B mRNA was also upregulated in those groups. Canine GBECs treated with lipopolysaccharide also showed upregulation of MUC3 and MUC5B.The mucin genes with the highest expression levels in gallbladder tissue in cholesterol-associated diseases were MUC3 and MUC5B. Cholesterol stones and gallbladder infections were associated with increased MUC3 and MUC5B expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483523>A comparative approach to decipher intestinal animal-microbe associations.</a></h2><p>Mammalian guts harbor indigenous microbes that are integral to host health. Microbiome research using sophisticated model organisms has provided insights into intricate interactions between microbiota and host animals. However, it remains unclear how these animal-microbe associations developed. We have recently addressed this question via comparative analyses of chordates, given that complex biological systems can be resolved into ancestral and derived elements when examined in an evolutionary framework (Nat Commun 9: 3402). Results support the view that microbial colonization of the mucus layer that overlies mammalian gastrointestinal  was established upon loss of ancestral chitin-based barrier immunity. Comparative approaches enable us to arrange ongoing biological processes into host natural history for better understanding of intestinal animal-microbe associations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27591271>The mRNA expression of amino acid and sugar transporters, aminopeptidase, as well as the di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1 in the intestines of Eimeria infected broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Coccidiosis in chickens is caused by infection of  epithelial cells with protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria This disease causes losses to the poultry industry since infected birds fail to gain weight as rapidly as non-infected birds and efficiency of feed conversion is compromised. For the present study the effect of Eimeria on expression of components of amino acid and sugar uptake mechanisms was determined. Broiler chicks were infected with Eimeria maxima, which infects the jejunum; Eimeria acervulina, which infects the duodenum; or Eimeria tenella, which infects the ceca. Sections of the jejunum, duodenum, and ceca (depending on species of Eimeria) were taken at several time points between d zero and 14 post infection (PI) for mRNA expression analysis. Genes examined included one digestive enzyme, 7 peptide and amino acid transporters located on the brush border, 8 transporters located at the basolateral surface of the  , and  sugar transporters. All 3 Eimeria species examined caused decrease in expression of brush border transporters particularly at d  to 7 PI, which corresponds to the time when pathology is greatest. The same pattern was seen in expression of sugar transporters. However, the expression of basolateral transporters differed among species. Eimeria tenella infection resulted in decreased expression of all basolateral transporters, while E. maxima infection caused increased expression of 2 genes and slight decrease in expression of the remaining  genes. Infection with E. acervulina resulted in increased expression at the height of infection of all but one basolateral transporter. In conclusion, Eimeria infection causes a general decrease in gene expression of sugar transporter and brush border AATs at the height of infection. However the expression of basolateral transporters is increased in E. maxima and E. acervulina infected birds. It is possible that decreased expression of brush border transporters in combination with increased expression of basolateral transporters leads to decrease of nutrients available for the parasite, thus limiting parasite reproduction.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Poultry Science Association 2016.

However, the exact biological effects of these nanoparticles have not been studied in detail, particularly in the . In the present study we observed that colloidal Pt was not cytotoxic towards three different epithelial colon cancer cell lines. Co-treatment of the colon cancer cell line Caco-2 with the oxidative stress inducing agent hydrogen peroxide (HO) and colloidal Pt resulted in a significant decrease in HO induced oxidative stress. Colloidal Pt by itself did not induce any oxidative stress. Additionally, both overnight pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with colloidal Pt followed by 1 h treatment with HO, or co-treatment of cells for 1 h with colloidal Pt and HO resulted in a significant recovery of cell death. Of note, the same protective effects of colloidal Pt were not observed when the oxidative stress was induced in the presence of 2, 2-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, indicating that the source of free radicals may define the outcome of anti-oxidant activity of colloidal Pt. Colloidal Pt was also able to cross a model intestinal barrier formed  with differentiated Caco-2 cells easily. Overall, our data indicate that colloidal Pt was not toxic towards intestinal epithelial cells, reduced HO induced oxidative stress, protected from oxidative stress related death of intestinal epithelial cells and could pass a model  barrier easily. Colloidal Pt can therefore be consumed orally for its anti-oxidant and other health promoting benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28545061>Microbiota-induced peritrophic matrix regulates midgut homeostasis and prevents systemic infection of malaria vector mosquitoes.</a></h2><p>Manipulation of the mosquito  microbiota can lay the foundations for novel methods for disease transmission control.

Probiotics exert beneficial health effects, mainly by reinforcing the intestinal  and modulating the  microbiota. However, the mechanisms of action, and especially, the specific regulatory effects of modulated microbiota by probiotics on the intestinal  have not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to decipher the protective effects of the probiotic  strain ZLP001 on the intestinal  and microbiota as well as the effects of modulated microbiota on epithelial function. Paracellular permeability was measured with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4). Gene and protein expression levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and host defense peptides were determined by RT-qPCR, ELISA, and western blot analysis. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations were measured by ion chromatography. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that pretreatment with 10 colony forming units (CFU) mL of  ZLP001 significantly counteracted the increase in  permeability to FD-4 induced by 10 CFU mL enterotoxigenic  (ETEC). In addition,  ZLP001 pretreatment alleviated the reduction in TJ proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1) and downregulated proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and TNFα expression and secretion caused by ETEC.  ZLP001 also significantly increased the expression of the host defense peptides  and  and pBD2 secretion relative to the control. Furthermore,  ZLP001 treatment affected piglet fecal microbiota. The abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria  and  was significantly increased in  ZLP001-treated piglets, and showed a positive correlation with fecal butyric and acetic acid concentrations. In addition, the cell density of  1, which may cause epithelial inflammation, was decreased after  ZLP001 administration, while the beneficial  was significantly increased. Our findings suggest that  ZLP001 fortifies the intestinal barrier by strengthening epithelial defense functions and modulating  microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802989>Do polyethylene microplastic beads alter the intestinal uptake of Ag in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)? Analysis of the MP vector effect using in vitro  sacs.</a></h2><p>Microplastic (MP) vector effects have been well described in the literature but surprisingly little is in known about the impact of MPs on the intestinal uptake of contaminants. The present study aimed to determine whether the intestinal fate of Ag was affected by the presence of polyethylene MP beads. Ag (added as Ag) was introduced into the lumen of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) anterior/mid-intestine  sac preparations as Ag only, Ag and MPs (co-exposure) and Ag-incubated MPs (where Ag was adsorbed to the MP). Results show that after 3 h exposure the distribution of accumulated Ag between the four intestinal compartments (mucus layer, mucosal , muscle layer and serosal saline) was not affected by either MP condition when compared to Ag alone (p > 0.05, One way ANOVA). Across all treatment groups mucus layer binding dominated (54.2-72.6%) whereas relatively little Ag was transported to the blood compartment (i.e. combined muscle layer and serosal saline compartments, 8.-15.0%). Accompanying adsorption/desorption studies were performed in relevant media. Over 24 h, 60.6± 2.9% of the available Ag in artificial freshwater adhered to the surface of the PE MPs. In pH adjusted luminal fluids (pH 2.2, 4.1, 7.4 and 9.8) that span the range of conditions encountered within the rainbow trout digestive tract, there was almost complete dissociation at acidic pHs within 3 h (<2% remaining on MPs at both pH 2.2 and pH 4.1). Such pHs are typical of piscine stomach. Based on our finding we suggest that following the ingestion of MPs with adsorbed pollutants, desorption would occur prior to entering the site of uptake. The MPs themselves have no impact on the trans-epithelial transport of the contaminant, but the net result of the MP vector effect is to potentially introduce labile contaminant forms into the intestine.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about  barrier dysfunction after hemodynamically instable polytrauma (PT). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of PT and HS on remote intestinal damage and barrier dysfunction, especially regarding the role of zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) as an important tight junction protein.Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either PT (thorax trauma, closed head injury, soft tissue injury, and distal femoral fracture), 60 min of pressure-controlled HS (30 ±  mmHg), or PT+HS, or sham procedures.Animals of all trauma groups showed an increase in abdominal girth and dilation of the intestine during the experimental period, which was largest in the PT+HS group. Increased blood-tissue permeability to albumin (assessed by Evans blue dye) was found in the HS group. Experimental groups showed a slight increase in plasma concentration of intestinal fatty acid binding protein and some intestinal damage was histologically detectable. Of note, PT+HS animals revealed significantly reduced expression of ZO-1 in intestinal epithelial cells. In an in-vitro model, stimulation of human colon epithelial cells with peptidoglycan, but not with lipopolysaccharide, resulted in elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reflecting inflammatory activity of the intestinal .Taken together, PT and HS lead to increased permeability of the -blood barrier.

Such allergies are triggered by increased antibody production initiated in Peyer's patches (PP). Usually, the presentation of antigens in the lumen of the  to the immune cells of the PP is strongly regulated by the follicle-associated  (FAE) that covers the PP. As the food component caprate has been shown to impede barrier properties in villous , we hypothesized that caprate also affects the barrier function of the PP FAE, thereby possibly contributing a risk factor for the development of food allergies.In this study, we have focused on the effects of caprate on the barrier function of PP, employing in vitro and ex vivo experimental setups to investigate functional and molecular barrier properties. Incubation with caprate induced an increase of transepithelial resistance, and a marked increase of permeability for the paracellular marker fluorescein in porcine PP to 180% of control values. These effects are in accordance with changes in the expression levels of the barrier-forming tight junction proteins tricellulin and claudin-.This barrier-affecting mechanism could be involved in the initial steps of a food allergy, since it might trigger unregulated contact of the  lumen with antigens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27459363>Intestinal bacteria are necessary for doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage but not for doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Doxorubicin (DOXO) induces significant, but transient, increases in apoptosis in the stem cell zone of the jejunum, followed by mucosal damage involving a decrease in crypt proliferation, crypt number, and villus height. The gastrointestinal tract is home to a vast population of commensal bacteria and numerous studies have demonstrated a symbiotic relationship between intestinal bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestine. However, whether enteric bacteria play a role in DOXO-induced damage is not well understood. We hypothesized that enteric bacteria are necessary for induction of apoptosis and damage associated with DOXO treatment. Conventionally raised (CONV) and germ free (GF) mice were given a single injection of DOXO, and intestinal tissue was collected at 6, 72, and 120 h after treatment and from no treatment (0 h) controls. Histology and morphometric analyses quantified apoptosis, mitosis, crypt depth, villus height, and crypt density. Immunostaining for muc2 and lysozyme evaluated Paneth cells, goblet cells or dual stained intermediate cells. DOXO administration induced significant increases in apoptosis in jejunal  regardless of the presence of enteric bacteria; however, the resulting injury, as demonstrated by statistically significant changes in crypt depth, crypt number, and proliferative cell number, was dependent upon the presence of enteric bacteria. Furthermore, we observed expansion of Paneth and goblet cells and presence of intermediate cells only in CONV and not GF mice. These findings provide evidence that manipulation and/or depletion of the enteric microbiota may have clinical significance in limiting chemotherapy-induced mucositis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023380>The  Microbiome Feelings of the Brain: A Perspective for Non-Microbiologists.</a></h2><p> To comprehensively review the scientific knowledge on the -brain axis.

Relevant articles were selected and reviewed.  Tremendous progress has been made in exploring the interactions between nutrients, the microbiome, and the intestinal, -enteric nervous, endocrine and immune systems and the brain. The basis of the -brain axis comprises of an array of multichannel sensing and trafficking pathways that are suggested to convey the enteric signals to the brain. These are mediated by neuroanatomy (represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons), the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (represented by the  hormones), immune routes (represented by multiple cytokines), microbially-derived neurotransmitters, and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain barriers. Their mutual and harmonious but intricate interaction is essential for human life and brain performance. However, a failure in the interaction leads to a number of inflammatory-, autoimmune-, neurodegenerative-, metabolic-, mood-, behavioral-, cognitive-, autism-spectrum-, stress- and pain-related disorders. The limited availability of information on the mechanisms, pathways and cause-and-effect relationships hinders us from translating and implementing the knowledge from the bench to the clinic.  Further understanding of this intricate field might potentially shed light on novel preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat these disorders.

OMVs produced by commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals are dispersed within the  lumen with their cargo and enzymes being distributed across and throughout the GI tract. Their ultimate destination and fate is unclear although they can interact with and cross the intestinal  using different entry pathways and access underlying immune cells in the lamina propria. OMVs have also been found in the bloodstream from which they can access various tissues and possibly the brain. The nanosize and non-replicative status of OMVs together with their resistance to enzyme degradation and low pH, alongside their ability to interact with the host, make them ideal candidates for delivering biologics to mucosal sites, such as the GI and the respiratory tract. In this mini-review, we discuss the fate of OMVs produced in the GI tract of animals with a focus on vesicles released by  species and the use of OMVs as vaccine delivery vehicles and other potential applications.© 2018 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27596739>Susceptibility of primary chicken intestinal epithelial cells for low pathogenic avian influenza virus and velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus.</a></h2><p>Avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) share a high tropism for the avian respiratory  and may cause severe clinical disease associated with high mortality. Both viruses have different pathotypes, which may lead to differences in the severity of the disease. Respiratory epithelial cells were shown to be the primary target cells for infection and replication. Nevertheless, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were also suggested as target cells for both viruses in avian species. Most studies on AIV and NDV focused on the respiratory tract, while information regarding the virus-host interaction at the intestinal epithelial cell interface is lacking. We established a primary chicken IEC culture model. Primary chicken embryo fibroblast cultures (CEFs) were used for comparison. IECs and CEFs were infected with a low infectious dose (LID; multiplicity of infection, MOI, of 0.01) or high infectious dose (HID, MOI of 1), of low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) H9N2 or velogenic viscerotropic NDV (vvNDV) Herts 33/56. Virus replication, mRNA expression pattern of the type I and type III interferon (IFN) and related genes IFIT5 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats ) and ISG12 (interferon stimulated gene 12) were investigated at four, 16, and 24h post infection (hpi). The results suggest high susceptibility of primary chicken IECs for these AIV and NDV strains. Replication rates and expression pattern of IFNs as well as related genes differed between the infecting viruses as well as cell culture systems. Both viruses induced an IFN λ-increase of more than 30-fold in IECs, while IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA expression was either downregulated or only slightly increased with up to 10fold changes for the latter at 24h post LPAIV-infection. These results suggest a possible role of IFN λ in the control of viruses at the  epithelial surface. LPAIV induced upregulation of IFIT5 as well as ISG12 expression in a dose and time dependent manner, while vvNDV infection only led to slight upregulation of IFIT5 and downregulation of ISG12, indicating differences in the down-stream regulation of the antiviral immune response between investigated viruses. Overall, our data demonstrate that IECs are a suitable model to investigate selected parameters of virus-host interaction for AIV and NDV and may be used to study other strains as well as other host species.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A two-factorial experiment was conducted on 72 pigs (initial BW 12. kg) using as factors: Thr level (.1, .7, 6.3 and 6.9 g standardized ileal digestible [SID] Thr/kg) and wheat gluten (WG) level used as a source of NEAA (20.4, 40.4 and 60.4 g WG protein in WG20, WG40 and WG60 diets respectively). All diets covered the requirement for essential AA, except for Thr, and they were fed to six pigs for 20 days. Thr level affected only the count of GC containing acidic mucins in the proximal colon, which was higher in pigs fed a diet with .1 g SID Thr/kg in comparison with diet containing 6.3 g SID Thr/kg. In the villi, WG40 and/or WG60 increased the GC number containing acidic mucins and lowered that with neutral mucins in the middle jejunum. In the crypts, higher WG levels decreased the GC number with acidic mucins in the duodenum, ileum and proximal colon and increased that with neutral and mixed mucins in the duodenum and ileum. The mucus layer was thicker in the proximal and middle jejunum in WG20 pigs, whereas in the proximal colon it was thicker in WG60 pigs. The lowest GC count was found in the middle jejunum and the highest in the duodenum and proximal colon. The mucus layer was the thinnest in the proximal and middle jejunum and the thickest in the ileum.

In particular, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) functions not only as a site for digestion and absorption of nutrients but also acts as a metabolic and immunological organ. This serves as a barrier against abnormal presentation of luminal constituents, caused by dysfunctional intestinal epithelial barrier, to the mucosal immune system. Invasion by pathogens in the case of disease or stress or a massive influx of commensal bacteria overcomes the defensive mechanisms, resulting in the full activation of local dendritic cells and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. A growing body of literature demonstrates the immune benefits of increasing the intake of specific nutrients. This strategy involves formulating diets that encompass the bioavailability and utilization of nutrients from various food sources and understanding the dynamics of the macro and micronutrients to support all physiological functions as well as maintaining the function of the immune cells. The nature and type of feed ingredients may also play some roles on the integrity of the GIT of birds. Because dietary intake or nutritional status as well as nutrient requirements may be altered as a result of disease or stress, this may eventually alter the  microflora and intestinal mucosal integrity, resulting in a compromised barrier of the intestinal . The weakening of the intestinal integrity could result in an increase in bacterial adherence to the mucosa, bacterial translocation, susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infection, and mis-appropriation of nutrients. In this chapter, we will discuss the role of dietary energy and nutrients as substrates that have the potential to influence GIT's health and integrity and their roles, directly or indirectly, in modulating bird's ability to be resilient or resist infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28240164>Effects of Dietary Mycotoxins on  Microbiome.</a></h2><p>The harmful effects of mycotoxins on intestinal health have received worldwide attention. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi, and include aflatoxins, ochratoxins, patulin, fumonisins, zearalenone, trichothecenes, and ergot alkaloids. Insuring the absence or low levels of mycotoxins is critical for food and feed safety. Currently, the studies in this field have illuminated the adverse effects of mycotoxins on  health including intestinal integrity and the -associated immune system. By affecting the proteins and peptides that serve vital functions in the immune system and host metabolism, mycotoxins are able to attack intestinal , which leads to poor intestinal health and integrity. This review focuses on the effects of exposure to mycotoxins on the intestinal barrier, especially the  microbiome, intestinal local immune system, and tight junction proteins, which in return influence digestion, absorption, metabolism and transport of the nutrients in intestinal lumen. The crucial role of mycotoxins on microbial metabolism and antimicrobial properties is also assessed, which elucidates the relationship between exposure to mycotoxins and the intestinal microbiome. We hypothesize that the key small peptides and proteins regulate the causal relationship between mycotoxins and  microbiome.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27677386>Human innate lymphoid cells.</a></h2><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are increasingly acknowledged as important mediators of immune homeostasis and pathology.

As such, ILCs make up interesting therapeutic targets for several diseases. In patients with allergy and asthma, group 2 innate lymphoid cells produce high amounts of IL- and IL-13, thereby contributing to type 2-mediated inflammation.

Iodine reduced and ML:8 virtually abolished viable bacteria. Basal electrophysiological parameters were not different between treatments. Transepithelial electrical resistance values did not differ between groups. All tissues responded to carbachol, although this was attenuated in iodine treated tissue. Papp values were slightly elevated in all treated tissues but this did not reach significance.

In other  regions, enteroendocrine cells (EECs) exhibit extensive patterns of colocalisation of hormones. In the current study, we characterise EECs in the human gastric fundus and corpus. We utilise immunohistochemistry to investigate EECs with antibodies to ghrelin, serotonin (-HT), somatostatin, peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1, calbindin, gastrin and pancreastatin, the latter as a marker of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. EECs were mainly located in regions of the gastric glands populated by parietal cells. Gastrin cells were absent and PYY cells were very rare. Except for about 25% of -HT cells being a subpopulation of ECL cells marked by pancreastatin, colocalisation of hormones in gastric EECs was infrequent. Ghrelin cells were distributed throughout the fundus and corpus; most were basally located in the glands, often very close to parietal cells and were closed cells i.e., not in contact with the lumen. A small proportion had long processes located close to the base of the mucosal . The -HT cells were of at least three types: small, round, closed cells; cells with multiple, often very long, processes; and a subgroup of ECL cells. Processes were in contact with their surrounding cells, including parietal cells. Mast cells had very weak or no -HT immunoreactivity. Somatostatin cells were a closed type with long processes. In conclusion, four major chemically defined EEC types occurred in the human oxyntic mucosa.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of FMO5 in glucose homeostasis and the impact of diet and  flora on the phenotype of mice in which the  gene has been disrupted ( mice). In comparison with wild-type (WT) counterparts,  mice are resistant to age-related changes in glucose homeostasis and maintain the higher glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity characteristic of young animals. When fed a high-fat diet, they are protected against weight gain and reduction of insulin sensitivity. The phenotype of  mice is independent of diet and the  microbiome and is determined solely by the host genotype.  mice have metabolic characteristics similar to those of germ-free mice, indicating that FMO5 plays a role in sensing or responding to  bacteria. In WT mice, FMO5 is present in the mucosal  of the gastrointestinal tract where it is induced in response to a high-fat diet. In comparison with WT mice,  mice have fewer colonic goblet cells, and they differ in the production of the colonic hormone resistin-like molecule  mice have lower concentrations of tumor necrosis factor  in plasma and of complement component 3 in epididymal white adipose tissue, indicative of improved inflammatory tone. Our results implicate FMO5 as a regulator of body weight and of glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity and, thus, identify FMO5 as a potential novel therapeutic target for obesity and insulin resistance.Copyright © 2017 by The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672156>Ursodeoxycholic acid protects against intestinal barrier breakdown by promoting enterocyte migration via EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The intestinal barrier is often disrupted in disease states, and intestinal barrier failure leads to sepsis.

Furthermore, UDCA stimulated both COX-2 induction and EGFR phosphorylation. In vivo UDCA protected the intestinal barrier from LPS-induced injury as measured by FITC dextran leakage into the serum. Using -bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and -ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine injections, we found that UDCA stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration in these animals. These effects were blocked with either administration of Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, or in EGFR-dominant negative Velvet mice, wherein UDCA had no effect on LPS-induced injury. Finally, we found increased COX-2 and phosphorylated ERK levels in LPS animals also treated with UDCA. Taken together, these data suggest that UDCA can stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration and protect against acute intestinal injury via an EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanism. UDCA may be an effective treatment to prevent the early onset of -origin sepsis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration after cellular injury and also protects the intestinal barrier in an acute rodent injury model, neither of which has been previously reported. These effects are dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream cyclooxygenase 2 upregulation in the small intestine. This provides a potential treatment for acute, -origin sepsis as seen in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290442>Effects of heat stress and dietary zinc source on performance and mammary epithelial integrity of lactating dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Dietary Zn and heat stress alter  integrity in monogastric animals. However, effects of Zn on mammary epithelial integrity in heat-stressed lactating dairy cows have not been studied. Multiparous lactating Holstein cows (n = 72) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement to study the effects of environment and Zn source on performance and mammary epithelial integrity. Treatments included 2 environments [cooled (CL) or not cooled (NC)] and 2 Zn sources [75 mg/kg of supplemental Zn as Zn hydroxychloride (IOZ) or 35 mg/kg of Zn hydroxychloride + 40 mg/kg of Zn-Met complex (ZMC)]. The experiment was divided into baseline and environmental challenge phases of 84 d each. All cows were cooled during the baseline phase (temperature-humidity index = 72.), whereas NC cows were not cooled during environmental challenge (temperature-humidity index = 77.7). Mammary biopsies were collected on d 7 and 56 relative to the onset of environmental challenge to analyze gene expression of claudin 1, 4, and 8, zonula occludens 1, 2, and 3, occludin, and E-cadherin and protein expression of occludin and E-cadherin. Deprivation of cooling increased respiration rate (64.8 vs. 73.9 breaths/min) and vaginal temperature (39.03 vs. 39.94°C) and decreased dry matter intake (26.7 vs. 21.6 kg/d). Energy-corrected milk yield decreased for NC cows relative to CL cows (24. vs. 34.1 kg/d). An interaction between environment and Zn source occurred for milk fat content as CL cows fed ZMC had lower milk fat percentage than other groups. Relative to CL cows, NC cows had lower concentrations of lactose (4.69 vs. 4.56%) and solids-not-fat (8.46 vs. 8.32%) but a higher concentration of milk urea nitrogen (9.07 vs. 11.02 mg/mL). Compared with IOZ, cows fed ZMC had lower plasma lactose concentration during baseline and tended to have lower plasma lactose concentration during environmental challenge. Plasma lactose concentration tended to increase at 3, , and 41 d after the onset of environmental challenge in NC cows relative to CL cows. Treatment had no effect on milk BSA concentration. Cows fed ZMC tended to have higher gene expression of E-cadherin relative to IOZ. Compared with CL, NC cows had increased gene expression of occludin and E-cadherin and tended to have increased claudin 1 and zonula occludens 1 and 2 gene expression in the mammary gland. Protein expression of occludin and E-cadherin was unchanged. In conclusion, removing active cooling impairs lactation performance and affects gene expression of proteins involved in the mammary epithelial barrier, and feeding a portion of dietary zinc as ZMC improves the integrity of the mammary .Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

HS is a signaling molecule that modulates various physiological effects. It is also a respiratory toxin that inhibits complex IV in the electron transfer chain (ETC). Colon epithelial cells are adapted to high environmental HS exposure as they harbor an efficient mitochondrial HS oxidation pathway, which is dedicated to its disposal. Herein, we report that the sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes are apically localized in human colonic crypts at the host-microbiome interface, but that the normal apical-to-crypt gradient is lost in colorectal cancer . We found that sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), which catalyzes the committing step in the mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway and couples to complex III, is a critical respiratory shield against HS poisoning. HS at concentrations ≤20 μm stimulated the oxygen consumption rate in colon epithelial cells, but, when SQR expression was ablated, HS concentrations as low as  μm poisoned cells. Mitochondrial HS oxidation altered cellular bioenergetics, inducing a reductive shift in the NAD/NADH redox couple. The consequent electron acceptor insufficiency caused uridine and aspartate deficiency and enhanced glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation. The metabolomic signature of this HS-induced stress response mapped, in part, to redox-sensitive nodes in central carbon metabolism. Colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines appeared to counter the growth-restricting effects of HS by overexpressing sulfide oxidation pathway enzymes. Our findings reveal an alternative mechanism for HS signaling, arising from alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics that drive metabolic reprogramming.© 2019 Libiad et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583216>The role of rare innate immune cells in Type 2 immune activation against parasitic helminths.</a></h2><p>The complexity of helminth macroparasites is reflected in the intricate network of host cell types that participate in the Type 2 immune response needed to battle these organisms. In this context, adaptive T helper 2 cells and the Type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-, IL-9 and IL-13 have been the focus of research for years, but recent work has demonstrated that the innate immune system plays an essential role. Some innate immune cells that promote Type 2 immunity are relatively abundant, such as macrophages and eosinophils. However, we now appreciate that more rare cell types including group 2 innate lymphoid cells, basophils, mast cells and dendritic cells make significant contributions to these responses. These cells are found at low frequency but they are specialized to their roles - located at sites such as the skin, lung and , where the host combats helminth parasites. These cells respond rapidly and robustly to worm antigens and worm-induced damage to produce essential cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids and histamine to activate damaged  and to recruit other effectors. Thus, a greater understanding of how these cells operate is essential to understand how the host protects itself during helminth infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27614742>Uptake route and resulting toxicity of silver nanoparticles in Eisenia fetida earthworm exposed through Standard OECD Tests.</a></h2><p>Despite the increasing interest in silver nanoparticles toxicity still few works dealt with the hazards of nanosized Ag in soils (either dissolved in pore water or coupled to colloids) although disposal of biosolids in landfills has been reported as the major source of silver nanoparticles in terrestrial environments. Presently, Eisenia fetida was used to assess the toxicity of  nm sized PVP-PEI coated silver nanoparticles in soil through the implementation of different exposure media Standard Toxicity Tests (Paper Contact and Artificial Soil -OECD-207- and Reproduction -OECD-222- Tests) together with cellular biomarkers measured in extruded coelomocytes. In order to decipher the mode of action of silver nanoparticles in soil and the uptake routes in earthworms, special attention was given to the Ag accumulation and distribution in tissues. High Ag accumulation rates, weight loss, and mortality due to the disruption of the tegument could be the result of a dermal absorption of Ag ions released from silver nanoparticles (Paper Contact Test). However, autometallography showed metals mainly localized in the digestive tract after Artificial Soil Test, suggesting that Ag uptake occurred mostly through soil ingestion. That is, silver nanoparticles attached to soil colloids seemed to be internalized in earthworms after ingestion of soil and transferred to the digestive   where at high doses they have triggered severe effects at different levels of biological complexity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31103967>Detection of Paracetamol as substrate of the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiome, a new organ; represent targets to alter pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs. Recently, in vitro trials endorsed the idea that orally administered drugs interact and some of their quantity may be taken up by normal microbiome during transit through gut. Such transport mechanisms in microbiome may compete for drug with the host itself. Currently, no data confirms specific transport system for paracetamol uptake by gut microbiome. In vivo trial was conducted in normal healthy male rats (n=36). Paracetamol was administered orally in a single dose of 75mg/kg to isolate microbial mass after transit of 2, 3, 4,  and 6 hours post drug administration. Paracetamol absorbance by microbiome was pursued by injecting extracted microbial lysate in RP-HPLC-UV with C18 column under isocratic conditions at 207nm using acetonitrile and water (25:75 v/v) pH 2.50 as mobile phase. Paracetamol absorbance (14.10±0.75μg/mg of microbial mass) and percent dose recovery (13.16±0.55%) seen at transit of 4 hours was significantly higher (P<0.05) compared to other groups. Study confirms the hypothesis of homology between membrane transporters of the gut microbiome and intestinal epithelium.

Eight ruminally cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated 4 by 4 Latin square design with four dietary treatments containing HQH, with either 0% concentrate/100% HQH (100HQH), 25% concentrate/75% HQH (75HQH), or 40% concentrate/60% HQH (60HQH). The fourth group (control [CON]) was fed 60% normal fiber-rich hay and 40% concentrate. The data showed that measures of diversity for the rumen epimural population, specifically the Shannon ( = 0.004) and Simpson ( = 0.003) indices, decreased with increasing levels of HQH in the diet. The feeding of HQH shifted the epimural population from predominantly  to  Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HQH feeding markedly shifted the abundance of  spp. from 7.8 up to 33.% ( < 0.001), with greater ingestion of protein ( = 0.63) and sugars ( = 0.65) in HQH diet being responsible for this shift. The expression of genes targeting intracellular pH regulation, barrier function, and nutrient uptake of rumen  remained stable regardless of the carbohydrate source. In conclusion, the data suggest strong alterations of the ruminal epimural microbiota in response to changes in the nutritive patterns of the diet. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of these significant microbial changes on rumen health and food safety aspects in cattle at a transcriptional level. Feeding of forages versus starchy concentrates is a highly debated topic. Hay is believed to be healthier and more ecological sustainable for cattle than are concentrates, although the effects of feeding hay with enhanced sugar and protein content on epimural microbiota and host gene expression have not yet been evaluated. This research provides a report of the role of feeding hay with increased sugar and protein content in place of starchy concentrates in altering epimural microbiota and in generating a host response. Our research shows that the addition of high-quality hay to dairy rations shifted nutrient intake, resulting in strong alterations in the epimural microbiota in cattle.

In contrast to the multiple combinatorial JAK/STAT pathways in mammals, only one canonical JAK/STAT pathway exists in Drosophila. It is activated by three secreted proteins of the Unpaired family (Upd): Upd1, Upd2 and Upd3. Although many studies have established a link between JAK/STAT activation and tissue damage, the mode of activation and the precise function of this pathway in the Drosophila systemic immune response remain unclear. In this study, we used mutations in upd2 and upd3 to investigate the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in the systemic immune response. Our study shows that haemocytes express the three upd genes and that injury markedly induces the expression of upd3 by the JNK pathway in haemocytes, which in turn activates the JAK/STAT pathway in the fat body and the . Surprisingly, release of Upd3 from haemocytes upon injury can remotely stimulate stem cell proliferation and the expression of Drosomycin-like genes in the intestine. Our results also suggest that a certain level of intestinal  renewal is required for optimal survival to septic injury. While haemocyte-derived Upd promotes intestinal stem cell activation and survival upon septic injury, haemocytes are dispensable for  renewal upon oral bacterial infection. Our study also indicates that intestinal  renewal is sensitive to insults from both the lumen and the haemocoel. It also reveals that release of Upds by haemocytes coordinates the wound-healing program in multiple tissues, including the , an organ whose integrity is critical to fly survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181250>Disentangling Host-Microbiota Regulation of Lipid Secretion by Enterocytes: Insights from Commensals  and .</a></h2><p>The  microbiota contributes to nutrients absorption and metabolism by enterocytes, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood, and most conclusions are inferred from studies comparing germfree and conventional animals colonized with diverse bacterial species.

AQP3 expression was assessed by real-time PCR and radiolabeled glycerol uptake, with select inhibitors and a luciferase reporter construct used to further elucidate intracellular signaling. AQP3 expression was downregulated in HT-29 cells treated with TNF Luciferase reporter construct experiments revealed that TNF downregulated constitutive transcriptional activity of the AQP3 promoter, and inhibition of MEK/ERK and nuclear factor B (NF-B) signaling prevented the decrease in AQP3 mRNA expression. Constitutive AQP3 expression was suppressed by specificity protein (Sp) 3, and knockdown of this transcription factor bound to the AQP3 promoter was able to partially prevent the TNF-induced downregulation of AQP3.

Shrimp were divided into six groups administrated with either feed only (negative control) or SH6 spores at  × 106 CFU/g pellet (high dose, SH6 spore-H group), 1 × 106 CFU/g pellet (medium dose, SH6 spore-M group), 2 × 105 CFU/g pellet (low dose, SH6 spore-L group), astaxanthin at 0. mg/g pellet (Carophyll group), or carotenoids from SH6 vegetative cells at  μg/g pellet (SH6 carotenoid group). The growth rate was highest in SH6 spore-H (3.38%/day), followed by SH6 spore-M (2.84%/day) and SH6 spore-L (2.25%/day), which was significantly higher than the control (1.45%/day), Carophyll (1.53%/day) or SH6 carotenoid (1.57%/day) groups.

Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 ± 21 days in milk and 51 ± 3 kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21 days, with 17 days allowed for diet adaptation and 4 days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (34. mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), (2) 1.64 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO (56. mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55 g Zn/day provided as ZnSO plus 1.13 g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58.2 mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM). Treatments were administered once daily as an oral bolus containing all supplemental trace minerals. Rumen-bypass methionine was also included in the 30-ZS and 60-ZS boluses to provide metabolizable methionine equivalent to that provided in 60-ZM rations. Milk samples were assessed for electrolytes, somatic cell transcript abundance of genes related to zinc metabolism, and heat coagulation time. Whole blood samples were analyzed for Na and K concentrations, and plasma samples were analyzed for lactose concentration. Cows fed 60-ZS or 60-ZM had greater zinc intake compared to 30-ZS. Dry matter intake and milk fat content tended to be greater in 60-ZS and 60-ZM cows compared to 30-ZS. Somatic cell linear score was similar among treatments. Treatments neither affected markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood nor in milk of cows, including plasma concentration of lactose, milk concentrations of Na and K, and SLC30A2 and CLU transcript abundance.

Moreover, L. lactis was able to prevent histological damage, reduce neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration and secretory Immunoglobulin-A in mice injected with -FU. Recombinant lactococci carrying antimicrobial PAP did not improve those markers of inflammation, although its expression was associated with villous architecture preservation and increased secretory granules density inside Paneth cells in response to -FU inflammation.We have demonstrated for the first time that L. lactis NZ9000 by itself, is able to prevent -FU-induced intestinal inflammation in BALB/c mice. Moreover, PAP delivered by recombinant L. lactis strain showed additional protective effects in mice , revealing to be a promising strategy to treat intestinal mucositis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29086539>Generation of Insulin-Expressing Cells in Mouse Small Intestine by Pdx1, MafA, and BETA2/NeuroD.</a></h2><p>To develop surrogate insulin-producing cells for diabetes therapy, adult stem cells have been identified in various tissues and studied for their conversion into β-cells. Pancreatic progenitor cells are derived from the endodermal  and formed in a manner similar to  progenitor cells. Here, we generated insulin-producing cells from the intestinal epithelial cells that induced many of the specific pancreatic transcription factors using adenoviral vectors carrying three genes: PMB (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 [Pdx1], V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A [MafA], and BETA2/NeuroD).By direct injection into the intestine through the cranial mesenteric artery, adenoviruses (Ad) were successfully delivered to the entire intestine. After virus injection, we could confirm that the small intestine of the mouse was appropriately infected with the Ad-Pdx1 and triple Ad-PMB.Four weeks after the injection, insulin mRNA was expressed in the small intestine, and the insulin gene expression was induced in Ad-Pdx1 and Ad-PMB compared to control Ad-green fluorescent protein. In addition, the conversion of intestinal cells into insulin-expressing cells was detected in parts of the crypts and villi located in the small intestine.These data indicated that PMB facilitate the differentiation of mouse intestinal cells into insulin-expressing cells. In conclusion, the small intestine is an accessible and abundant source of surrogate insulin-producing cells.Copyright © 2017 Korean Diabetes Association</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635408>Timeline and location of recurrence following successful ablation in Barrett's oesophagus: an international multicentre study.</a></h2><p>Surveillance interval protocols after complete remission of intestinal metaplasia (CRIM) post radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in Barrett's oesophagus (BE) are currently empiric and not based on substantial evidence. We aimed to assess the timeline, location and patterns of recurrence following CRIM to inform these guidelines.Data on patients undergoing RFA for BE were obtained from prospectively maintained databases of five (three USA and two UK) tertiary referral centres. RFA was performed until CRIM was confirmed on two consecutive endoscopies.594 patients achieved CRIM as of 1 May 2017. 151 subjects developed recurrent BE over a median (IQR) follow-up of 2.8 (1.4-4.4) years. There was 19% cumulative recurrence risk of any BE within 2 years and an additional 49% risk over the next 8.6 years. There was no evidence of a clinically meaningful change in the recurrence hazard rate of any BE, dysplastic BE or high-grade dysplasia/cancer over the duration of follow-up, with an estimated 2% (95% CI -7% to 12%) change in recurrence rate of any BE in a doubling of follow-up time. 74% of BE recurrences developed at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) (24.1% were dysplastic) and 26% in the tubular oesophagus. The yield of random biopsies from the tubular oesophagus, in the absence of visible lesions, was 1% (BE) and 0.2% (dysplasia).BE recurrence risk following CRIM remained constant over time, suggesting that lengthening of follow-up intervals, at least in the first  years after CRIM, may not be advisable. Sampling the GOJ is critical to detecting recurrence. The requirement for random biopsies of the neosquamous  in the absence of visible lesions may need to be re-evaluated.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Although fetal LGR5-expressing cells can give rise to adult intestinal stem cells, it remains unclear whether this population in the patterned  represents unique intestinal stem-cell precursors. Here we show, using unbiased quantitative lineage-tracing approaches, biophysical modelling and intestinal transplantation, that all cells of the mouse intestinal -irrespective of their location and pattern of LGR5 expression in the fetal  tube-contribute actively to the adult intestinal stem cell pool. Using 3D imaging, we find that during fetal development the villus undergoes gross remodelling and fission. This brings epithelial cells from the non-proliferative villus into the proliferative intervillus region, which enables them to contribute to the adult stem-cell niche. Our results demonstrate that large-scale remodelling of the intestinal wall and cell-fate specification are closely linked. Moreover, these findings provide a direct link between the observed plasticity and cellular reprogramming of differentiating cells in adult tissues following damage, revealing that stem-cell identity is an induced rather than a hardwired property.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29083253>Brood pouch-mediated polystyrene nanoparticle uptake during Daphnia magna embryogenesis.</a></h2><p>Nanoplastic debris is currently expected to be ubiquitously distributed in aquatic environments and an emerging environmental issue affecting organisms across trophic levels. While ingestion of particles receives most attention, other routes of uptake and cellular accumulation remain unexplored. Here, the planktonic filter feeder Daphnia magna was used to track routes of uptake and target tissues of polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs). A sublethal concentration of  mg L fluorescent PSNPs (25 nm) was used to monitor accumulation in adult animals as well as their embryos in the open brood pouch. A time series throughout embryonic development within the brood pouch revealed accumulation of PSNP in or on lipophilic cells in the early stages of embryonic development while the embryo is still surrounded by a chorion and before the beginning of organogenesis. In contrast, PSNP particles were neither detected in the   nor in lipid droplets in adults. An ex vivo exposure of embryos to PSNP demonstrated a similar accumulation of PSNP in or on lipophilic cells, illustrating the likelihood of brood pouch-mediated PSNP uptake by embryos. By demonstrating embryo PSNP uptake via the brood pouch, data presented here give novel insights in bioaccumulation of nanoparticles and likely other lipophilic contaminants. Since this uptake route can occur within a diverse array of aquatic organisms, this study warrants consideration of brood pouch-mediated accumulation in efforts studying the hazards and risks of nanoparticle contamination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263169>Bioaccumulation of metals in calanoid copepods by oral intake.</a></h2><p>We demonstrated that oral intake of water by two calanoid copepods, Pseudodiaptomus annandalei and Eurytemora affinis takes place and has implications for their ecotoxicology. In the first experiment, copepods were exposed to a dyed medium, which allowed us to visually examine the possibility of water uptake by the copepod. We observed that both copepod species were taking in water orally and evacuated dye at different speeds. This exposure left concentrated dye in the guts of the copepods indicating adsorption into the  . This was further demonstrated by exposing both copepod species independently to dissolved metals (Cd,17 µg/L; Cu,13.8 µg/L; Ni, 29.3 µg/L) and to dietary metals (Cd,18.8 µg/g; Cu, 35.3 µg/g; Ni, 32. µg/g). The results showed that although the concentration of dissolved metals they were exposed to were lower than those of the dietary metals, nevertheless, uptake of metals by both copepod species from the dissolved phase alone was substantially higher than from dietary exposure. This provides clear evidence to support our hypothesis that higher metal body burden observed in copepods exposed to dissolved metals than in those exposed to dietary metals is an implication of oral intake of water. P. annandalei showed higher excretion rate of metals when exposed to dissolved metals than E. affinis. However, the excretion rate of metals from both copepod species exposed to dietary metal was similar. We conclude here that both copepod species take in water orally. Our study further showed that metal uptake depends on the exposure routes and the uptake and excretion rates are dependent on the type of metals, amounts and the species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662430>The Regulation of Peripheral Metabolism by -Derived Hormones.</a></h2><p>Enteroendocrine cells lining the   constitute the largest endocrine organ in the body and secrete over 20 different hormones in response to cues from ingested foods and changes in nutritional status.

This paper aims to review the relevant published materials on the influence of NFCs on the 's microbial population and composition in monogastrics, and points out the areas of the required research. Total bacteria count and Lactobacillus sp. were decreased with an increase in composition of dietary NFC intake, as well as accompanied by a decrease in the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels. Consequently, some metabolites were affected by the accumulation of the bile acids, including molecules which control different gene expression levels, as regulators involved in glucose (FXR and TGR5) and fat metabolism (cholesterol). Cell proliferation rate of both gastrointestinal  and microbiome cells was negatively correlated with the dietary NFC levels in many species of monogastric animals. Low levels of NFC diet are negatively associated with digestibility, total  weight, and gastrointestinal secretions. High levels of dietary NFC have negative effects on the digestion and absorption of macronutrients, with an increase of the contact time of the carcinogens in the intestinal lumen. The data obtained from different animals' studies did not give the same results. In conclusion, dietary NFC should be adjusted to the optimal consumption levels as the human and the monogastric animals are anatomically and physiologically different. Digestion, metabolism, host wellbeing, and host behavior were negatively affected by the administration of high NFC levels. The relations between sulphate-reducing bacteria and some metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and obesity need further exploration.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27514476>Soluble bioactive microbial mediators regulate proteasomal degradation and autophagy to protect against inflammation-induced stress.</a></h2><p>Bifidobacterium breve and other Gram-positive  commensal microbes protect the gastrointestinal  against inflammation-induced stress. However, the mechanisms whereby these bacteria accomplish this protection are poorly understood. In this study, we examined soluble factors derived from Bifidobacterium breve and their impact on the two major protein degradation systems within intestinal epithelial cells, proteasomes and autophagy. Conditioned media from gastrointestinal Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria activated autophagy and increased expression of the autophagy proteins Atg5 and Atg7 along with the stress response protein heat shock protein 27. Specific examination of media conditioned by the Gram-positive bacterium Bifidobacterium breve (Bb-CM) showed that this microbe produces small molecules (<3 kDa) that increase expression of the autophagy proteins Atg5 and Atg7, activate autophagy, and inhibit proteasomal enzyme activity. Upregulation of autophagy by Bb-CM was mediated through MAP kinase signaling. In vitro studies using C2BBe1 cells silenced for Atg7 and in vivo studies using mice conditionally deficient in intestinal epithelial cell Atg7 showed that Bb-CM-induced cytoprotection is dependent on autophagy. Therefore, this work demonstrates that Gram-positive bacteria modify protein degradation programs within intestinal epithelial cells to promote their survival during stress. It also reveals the therapeutic potential of soluble molecules produced by these microbes for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disease.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647994>Palmitic acid damages   integrity and initiates inflammatory cytokine production.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms leading to the low-grade inflammation observed during obesity are not fully understood. Seeking the initiating events, we tested the hypothesis that the intestine could be damaged by repeated lipid supply and therefore participate in inflammation. In mice, 1- palm oil gavages increased intestinal permeability via decreased expression and mislocalization of junctional proteins at the cell-cell contacts; altered the intestinal bacterial species by decreasing the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, segmented filamentous bacteria, and Clostridium leptum; and increased inflammatory cytokine expression. This was further studied in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2/TC7 cells using the two main components of palm oil, i.e., palmitic and oleic acid. Saturated palmitic acid impaired paracellular permeability and junctional protein localization, and induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the cells, but unsaturated oleic acid did not. Inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis prevented part of these effects. Altogether, our data show that short exposure to palm oil or palmitic acid induces intestinal dysfunctions targeting barrier integrity and inflammation. Excessive palm oil consumption could be an early player in the  alterations observed in metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2019.

There is emerging evidence that crosstalks between  epithelial cells and immune cells contribute to chronic infectious diseases. HIV-infected (HIV+) older adults show age-related co-morbidities at a younger age than their uninfected counterparts. Persistent inflammation related to the chronic viral infection and its sequelae is thought to contribute to this disparity.

Tryptamine increases both ionic flux across the colonic  and fluid secretion in colonoids from germ-free (GF) and humanized (ex-GF colonized with human stool) mice, consistent with increased intestinal secretion.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ileal bacteria in modulating local and systemic immune responses in AS.Ileal biopsies were obtained from 50 HLA-B27 patients with AS and 20 normal subjects. Silver stain was used to visualise bacteria. Ileal expression of tight and adherens junction proteins was investigated by TaqMan real-time (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LPS-BP), intestinal fatty acid-BP (iFABP) and zonulin were assayed by ELISA. Monocyte immunological functions were studied in in vitro experiments. In addition the effects of antibiotics on tight junctions in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 transgenic (TG) rats were assessed.Adherent and invasive bacteria were observed in the  of patients with AS with the bacterial scores significantly correlated with  inflammation. Impairment of the  vascular barrier (GVB) was also present in AS, accompanied by significant upregulation of zonulin, and associated with high serum levels of LPS, LPS-BP, iFABP and zonulin. In in vitro studies zonulin altered endothelial tight junctions while its epithelial release was modulated by isolated AS ileal bacteria. AS circulating monocytes displayed an anergic phenotype partially restored by ex vivo stimulation with LPS+sCD14 and their stimulation with recombinant zonulin induced a clear M2 phenotype. Antibiotics restored tight junction function in HLA-B27 TG rats.Bacterial ileitis, increased zonulin expression and damaged intestinal mucosal barrier and GVB, characterises the  of patients with AS and are associated with increased blood levels of zonulin, and bacterial products. Bacterial products and zonulin influence monocyte behaviour.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The neurotransmitter serotonin (-HT) regulates central nervous system and enteric nervous system (ENS) development and long-term functions, including gastrointestinal (GI) motility and mood. Therefore, defects in neuron production of -HT might result in brain and intestinal dysfunction. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in -HT biosynthesis. A variant of TPH2 that encodes the R441H substitution (TPH2-R441H) was identified in individuals with severe depression. We studied mice with an analogous mutation (TPH2-R439H), which results in a 60%-80% decrease in levels of -HT in the central nervous system and behaviors associated with depression in humans. Feeding chow that contains -HTP slow release (-HTP SR) to TPH2-R439H mice restores levels of -HT in the central nervous system and reduces depressive-like behaviors.We compared the effects of feeding chow, with or without -HTP SR, to mice with the TPH2-R439H mutation and without this mutation (control mice). Myenteric and submucosal plexuses were isolated from all 4 groups of mice, and immunocytochemistry was used to quantify total enteric neurons, serotonergic neurons, and -HT-dependent subsets of neurons. We performed calcium imaging experiments to evaluate responses of enteric neurons to tryptamine-evoked release of endogenous -HT. In live mice, we measured total GI transit, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, and propulsive colorectal motility. To measure colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs), we isolated colons and constructed spatiotemporal maps along the proximodistal length to quantify the frequency, velocity, and length of CMMCs. We measured villus height, crypt perimeter, and relative densities of enterochromaffin and enteroendocrine cells in small intestinal tissue.Levels of -HT were significantly lower in enteric neurons from TPH2-R439H mice than from control mice. TPH2-R439H mice had abnormalities in ENS development and ENS-mediated GI functions, including reduced motility and intestinal epithelial growth. Total GI transit and propulsive colorectal motility were slower in TPH2-R439H mice than controls, and CMMCs were slower and less frequent. Villus height and crypt perimeter were significantly decreased in colon tissues from TPH2-R439H mice compared with controls. Administration of -HTP SR to adult TPH2-R439H mice restored -HT to enteric neurons and reversed these abnormalities. Adult TPH2-R439H mice given oral -HTP SR had normalized numbers of enteric neurons, total GI transit, and colonic motility. Intestinal tissue from these mice had normal measures of CMMCs and enteric epithelial growth CONCLUSIONS: In studies of TPH2-R439H mice, we found evidence for reduced release of -HT from enteric neurons that results in defects in ENS development and GI motility. Our findings indicate that neuron production of -HT links constipation with mood dysfunction. Administration of -HTP SR to mice restored -HT to the ENS and normalized GI motility and growth of the enteric . -HTP SR might be used to treat patients with intestinal dysfunction associated with low levels of -HT.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

A. muciniphila has been correlated with human health in previous studies, but a mechanistic explanation is lacking. In this study, the main site of colonisation was characterised alongside additional conditions, such as differences in colon pH, prebiotic supplementation and variable mucin supply. To overcome the limitations of in vivo studies concerning variations in mucin availability and difficult access to proximal regions of the colon, a dynamic in vitro  model (SHIME) was used. In this model, A. muciniphila was found to colonise the distal colon compartment more abundantly than the proximal colon ((±8 log copies/ml compared to ±4 log copies/ml) and the preference for the distal compartment was found to be pH-dependent. The addition of mucin caused a specific increase of A. muciniphila (±4. log increase over two days), far exceeding the response of other bacteria present, together with an increase in propionate. These findings suggest that colonisation and mucin degradation by A. muciniphila is dependent on pH and the concentration of mucin.

Impaired endothelial function, a key initiating step in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, has been reported in patients with CKD, but the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction in CKD remain elusive. Emerging evidence reveals that trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a  microbiota-generated metabolite, is involved in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases. Circulating TMAO is elevated in CKD. Here we tested the hypothesis that elevated TMAO plays a contributory role in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in CKD. Rats underwent /6 nephrectomy to induce CKD or sham operation, and were treated with 1.0% 3,3-Dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB, an inhibitor of trimethylamine formation) or vehicle. Eight weeks after nephrectomy and DMB treatment, circulating TMAO levels were markedly elevated in CKD-vehicle rats compared with sham-vehicle rats, but were reduced in CKD-DMB rats. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation was impaired in CKD-vehicle rats compared with sham-vehicle rats as indicated by reduced maximal relaxation (E) and decreased area under the curve (AUC). E and AUC were both normalized in CKD-DMB rats. No difference in sodium nitroprusside-induced endothelial-independent vasodilation was observed across groups. Molecular studies revealed that endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity was decreased, while superoxide production and proinflammatory cytokine expression were increased in the aorta of CKD-vehicle rats compared with sham-vehicle rats. Of note, the abnormalities in above molecular parameters were completely restored in CKD-DMB rats. These results suggest that CKD elevates circulating TMAO levels, which may reduce eNOS-derived NO production by increasing vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to CKD-associated endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, these cultures lack the cellular diversity encountered in the intestinal , and the physiological relevance of monocultures of transformed cell lines is uncertain. Little is also known of the factors that influence cell differentiation and homeostasis in the bovine intestinal , and few cell-specific markers that can distinguish the different intestinal epithelial cell lineages have been reported. Here we describe a simple and reliable procedure to establish in vitro 3D enteroid, or "mini ", cultures from bovine small intestinal (ileal) crypts.

Histological and transcriptional analyses suggested that the enteroids comprised a mixed population of intestinal epithelial cell lineages including intestinal stem cells, enterocytes, Paneth cells, goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells. We show that bovine enteroids can be successfully maintained long-term through multiple serial passages without observable changes to their growth characteristics, morphology or transcriptome. Furthermore, the bovine enteroids can be cryopreserved and viable cultures recovered from frozen stocks.

Here, we show that Nubbin (Nub)/Pdm1, homologous to mammalian OCT1/POU2F1 and related to OCT4/POU5F1, is expressed in   progenitor cells. We demonstrate that the nub-encoded protein isoforms, Nub-PB and Nub-PD, play opposite roles in the regulation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance and differentiation. Depletion of Nub-PB in progenitor cells increased ISC proliferation by derepression of escargot expression. Conversely, loss of Nub-PD reduced ISC proliferation, suggesting that this isoform is necessary for ISC maintenance, analogous to mammalian OCT4/POU5F1 functions. Furthermore, Nub-PB is required in enteroblasts to promote differentiation, and it acts as a tumor suppressor of Notch RNAi-driven hyperplasia. We suggest that a dynamic and well-tuned expression of Nub isoforms in progenitor cells is required for maintaining   homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

A melatonin production independent of the photoperiod is typical of the . However, the local physiological role of melatonin at the intestinal tract is poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of melatonin in an in vitro model of inflamed intestinal . To this purpose, we assessed different parameters usually associated with intestinal inflammation using IL-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Differentiated monolayers of Caco-2 cells were preincubated with melatonin (1 nmol/L-50 μmol/L) and then exposed to IL-1β. After each treatment, different inflammatory mediators, DNA-breakage, and global DNA methylation status were assayed. To evaluate the involvement of melatonin membrane receptors, we also exposed differentiated monolayers to melatonin in the presence of luzindole, a MT1 and MT2 antagonist. Our results showed that melatonin, at concentrations similar to those obtained in the lumen  after ingestion of dietary supplements for the treatment of sleep disorders, was able to attenuate the inflammatory response induced by IL-1β. Anti-inflammatory effects were expressed as both a decrease of the levels of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and NO, and a reduced increase in paracellular permeability. Moreover, the protection was associated with a reduced NF-κB activation and a prevention of DNA demethylation. Conversely, luzindole did not reverse the melatonin inhibition of stimulated-IL-6 release. In conclusion, our findings suggest that melatonin, through a local action, can modulate inflammatory processes at the intestinal level, offering new opportunities for a multimodal management of IBD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Various microscopy techniques were used to investigate internalization of 10-nm gold nanoparticles in Daphnia magna  lumen and  epithelial cells following 24-h exposure and outline potential artifacts (i.e., high-contrast precipitates from sample preparation related to these techniques). Light sheet microscopy confirmed accumulation of gold nanoparticles in the  lumen. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis revealed gold nanoparticles attached to the microvilli of  cells. Interestingly, the peritrophic membrane appeared to act as a semipermeable barrier between the lumen and the  , permitting only single particles through. Structures resembling nanoparticles were also observed inside  cells. Elemental analysis could not verify these to be gold, and they were likely artifacts from the preparation, such as osmium and iron. Importantly, gold nanoparticles were found inside holocrine cells with disrupted membranes. Thus, false-positive observations of nanoparticle internalization may result from either preparation artifacts or mistaking disrupted cells for intact cells. These findings emphasize the importance of cell integrity and combining elemental analysis with the localization of internalized nanoparticles using transmission electron microscopy.

In this respect, the gastro-intestinal motility and hypersecretion essays were evaluated using a simple test meal (10% charcoal in % gum arabic) and castor oil induced diarrhea. However, the effect of GOAE on glucose absorption and homeostasis was assessed by the Ussing chamber system and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures.Various doses of the Quercus ilex aqueous extract (125, 250 and 500mgkg) administered orally produced a significantly dose-related inhibition of  meal travel distance in normal rat. The highest intestinal transit reduction of 49.34% was obtained with 500mgkg compared to 58.33% caused by reference drug (clonidine, 1mgkg). In castor oil induced diarrhea in rat, Q. ilex extract reduced the frequency of defecation, fluid accumulation and electrolyte transport. These effects were associated with decreased histopathological damage and regulation of intracellular mediators disturbance in the intestinal mucosa. In addition, GOAE treatment improved glucose tolerance and significantly and dose-dependently reduced (>50%) the glucose absorption via intestinal . Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of many bioactive natural compounds.These results suggest that the extract was effective towards reducing diarrhea, fluid accumulation, electrolyte transport and glucose absorption, and no toxic effects of the GOAE presented on this study.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

During subsequent sampling in November 2008 and January 2009, chronic proliferative gill inflammation and peritonitis was observed. Cumulative mortalities of .6-12.8% and severe growth retardation were observed. Routine diagnostic analysis revealed no diseases known to salmon at the time, but microsporidian infection of tissues was observed.To characterize the disease outbreak, a combination of histopathology, in situ hybridization (ISH), chitin, calcofluor-white (CFW) staining, and real-time PCR were used to describe the disease progression with visualization of the D. lepeophtherii stages in situ.The presence of the microsporidian Desmozoon lepeophtherii was confirmed with real-time PCR, DNA sequencing and ISH, and the parasite was detected in association with acute lesions in the gills and peritoneum. ISH using a probe specific to small subunit 16S rRNA gene provided an effective tool for demonstrating the distribution of D. lepeophtherii in the tissue. Infection in the peritoneum seemed localized in and around pre-existing vaccine granulomas, and in the gastrointestinal walls. In the heart, kidney and spleen, the infection was most often associated with mononuclear leucocytes and macrophages, including melanomacrophages. Desmozoon lepeophtherii exospores were found in the nuclei of the gastrointestinal  for the first time, suggesting a role of the gastrointestinal tract in the spread of spores to the environment.This study describes the progression of D. lepeophtherii disease outbreak in an Atlantic salmon farm without any other known diseases present. Using different methods to examine the disease outbreak, new insight into the pathology of D. lepeophtherii was obtained.

These cells classified into several subtypes based on the hormones they produce in both mammals and insects. In the fruit fly Drosophila, it has been suggested that nearly equal numbers of two subtypes of EEs (Allatostatin A: AstA and Diuretic hormone 31 : Dh31) are alternately produced from the intestinal stem cells in the posterior midgut. However, we found that these two subtypes are not always present in this manner, but are rather distributed in a complementary frequency gradient along the posterior midgut. We show that midgut-preferential RNA knockdown of the peptide hormones AstA or Dh31 respectively results in decreased or increased adult lifespan. This effect on longevity is apparently correlated with the midgut senescence phenotypes as a result of direct hormone action through both hormone receptors expressed in the enteroblasts or other midgut cell types. However,  senescence does not appear to be the direct cause for longevity regulation, as knockdown of both hormone receptors did not affect adult lifespan. Furthermore, these senescence phenotypes appear to be independent of insulin signaling and manifest in an organ-specific manner. These results indicate that the two intestinal secretory peptides antagonistically regulate adult lifespan and intestinal senescence through multiple pathways, irrespective of insulin, which implicates a complementary gradient distribution of each of the hormone-producing EEs, consistent with local requirements for cell activity along the posterior midgut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28246211>Apoptosis restores cellular density by eliminating a physiologically or genetically induced excess of enterocytes in the  midgut.</a></h2><p>Using pathogens or high levels of opportunistic bacteria to damage the , studies in  have identified many signaling pathways involved in  regeneration.

The postnatal period is particularly critical for the development of microbiota composition, host-microbe interactions and immune homeostasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this neonatal priming period have not been defined. Here we report the identification of a host-mediated regulatory circuit of bacterial colonization that acts solely during the early neonatal period but influences life-long microbiota composition. We demonstrate age-dependent expression of the flagellin receptor Toll-like receptor  (TLR5) in the   of neonate mice. Using competitive colonization experiments, we demonstrate that epithelial TLR5-mediated REG3γ production is critical for the counter-selection of colonizing flagellated bacteria. Comparative microbiota transfer experiments in neonate and adult wild-type and Tlr5-deficient germ-free mice reveal that neonatal TLR5 expression strongly influences the composition of the microbiota throughout life. Thus, the beneficial microbiota in the adult host is shaped during early infancy. This might explain why environmental factors that disturb the establishment of the microbiota during early life can affect immune homeostasis and health in adulthood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27196584>Integrative microRNA profiling in alcoholic hepatitis reveals a role for microRNA-182 in liver injury and inflammation.</a></h2><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well-known regulators of disease pathogenesis and have great potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We aimed at profiling miRNAs in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and identifying miRNAs potentially involved in liver injury.MiRNA profiling was performed in liver samples from patients with AH, alcohol liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, HCV disease and normal liver tissue. Expression of miRNAs was assessed in liver and serum from patients with AH and animal models. Mimic and decoy miR-182 were used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate miR-182's biological functions.MiRNA expression profile in liver was highly altered in AH and distinctive from alcohol-induced cirrhotic livers. Moreover, we identified a set of 18 miRNAs predominantly expressed in AH as compared with other chronic liver conditions. Integrative miRNA-mRNA functional analysis revealed the association of AH-altered miRNAs with nuclear receptors, IGF-1 signalling and cholestasis. Interestingly, miR-182 was the most highly expressed miRNA in AH, which correlated with degree of ductular reaction, disease severity and short-term mortality. MiR-182 mimic induced an upregulation of inflammatory mediators in biliary cells. At experimental level, miR-182 was increased in biliary cells in mice fed with 3,-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet but not upregulated by alcohol intake or fibrosis. Inhibition of miR-182 in DDC-fed mice reduced liver damage, bile acid accumulation and inflammatory response.AH is characterised by a deregulated miRNA profile, including miR-182, which is associated with disease severity and liver injury. These results highlight the potential of miRNAs as therapeutic targets and biomarkers in AH.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The emergence of hypervirulent strains has contributed to increased mortality and morbidity of CDI. The C. difficile toxins contribute directly to CDI-associated lesions of the , but other bacterial factors are needed for the bacteria to adhere and colonize the intestinal . The C. difficile flagella, which confer motility and chemotaxis for successful intestinal colonization, could play an additional role in bacterial pathogenesis by contributing to the inflammatory response of the host and mucosal injury. Indeed, by activating the TLR5, flagella can elicit activation of the MAPK and NF-κB cascades of cell signaling, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrate, by using an animal model of CDI, a synergic effect of flagella and toxins in eliciting an inflammatory mucosal response. In this model, the absence of flagella dramatically decreases the degree of mucosal inflammation in mice and the sole presence of toxins without flagella was not enough to elicit epithelial lesions.

Antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) are widely accepted as the "gold standard" of performance-enhancing feed additives, which had become integral and valuable components of modern, efficient animal production, but are now being phased out in many parts of the world. This review, therefore, examines the reported effects of AGP on the key components of  barrier function, particularly where corresponding (positive) growth performance data were provided to indicate that any changes were beneficial, and some important trends do emerge. Certain bacterial families (e.g., Lachnospiraceae), genera (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Propionibacterium, and Ruminococcus), or species (e.g., F. prausnitzii, B. fragilis, and some Lactobacillus spp.) have been reported to increase with AGP use, are associated with improved growth performance, and show benefit across species, which may be related to their production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Various studies have investigated the effects of AGP on mucus-related parameters (e.g., goblet cell size, density, and mucin mRNA expression) but these do not always seem to correlate well with the actual physical characteristics of the mucus layer(s). Surprisingly, there are little data relating to HDP or IgA, even though they have recognized benefits. There are clear AGP benefits on epithelial structure and function (e.g., nutrient digestibility), and these may (currently) provide the most reliable indicators of the efficacy of growth promoters. Data investigating effects on  immune parameters (e.g., cell populations, cytokines, and chemokines), with corresponding growth performance, are limited and require further detailed interrogation. This review highlights both important observations related to the effects of AGP on key  barrier components, with associated growth performance, and areas that require further investigation, thus providing an informative basis for assessing the potential of AGP alternatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29197519>Intestinal exposure to PCB 153 induces inflammation via the ATM/NEMO pathway.</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants that adversely affect human health.

Despite dietary exposure being one of the main routes of exposure to PCBs, the  has been widely ignored when studying the effects of PCBs.We investigated the effects of PCB 153 on the intestine and addressed whether PCB 153 affected intestinal permeability or inflammation and the mechanism by which this occurred.Mice were orally exposed to PCB 153 and  permeability was assessed. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were collected and evaluated for evidence of genotoxicity and inflammation. A human IEC line (SW480) was used to examine the direct effects of PCB 153 on epithelial function. NF-кB activation was measured using a reporter assay, DNA damage was assessed, and cytokine expression was ascertained with real-time PCR.Mice orally exposed to PCB 153 had an increase in intestinal permeability and inflammatory cytokine expression in their IECs; inhibition of NF-кB ameliorated both these effects. This inflammation was associated with genotoxic damage and NF-кB activation. Exposure of SW480 cells to PCB 153 led to similar effects as seen in vivo. We found that activation of the ATM/NEMO pathway by genotoxic stress was upstream of NF-kB activation.These results demonstrate that oral exposure to PCB 153 is genotoxic to IECs and induces downstream inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the intestinal .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore we examined the digestive tract features of Pachypterus khavalchor using morphological, osteological, histological and histochemical techniques to comprehend and relate structural organization of digestive tract with scale eating habit. Morphologically, the alimentary canal is defined by a short and muscular esophagus, well-developed stomach and comparatively short intestine.  content analysis and intestinal coefficient value (0.53 ± 0.01) revealed that P. khavalchor exhibit both carnivory and lepidophagy. However, P. khavalchor primarily feeds on the scales (67.47%) and other chitin-rich material like aquatic insects (17.62%), aquatic larvae (8.66%) which affirms its solid association with chitinase producing endosymbionts in the . Lepidophagy is further supported by the osteological observations. The perfect segregation of the functions such as food capture, ingestion and processing amongst the different types of teeth located in the oral cavity and pharyngeal region thus could be taken as evolutionary adaptations in scale eaters to support lepidophagy. Specialized arrangement of the esophageal and stomach epithelial folds could be altogether taken as an adaptation with the end goal to frame the scale stacks and accordingly facilitate the handling and processing of chitin-rich bolus. The esophageal mucosa is simple squamous  instead of stratified  with numerous goblet cells to withstand the mechanical harm by hard-food stuff like scales. The cardiac and fundic regions exhibited large number tubular gastric glands with simple columnar . Surface cells of all three stomach regions stained positive for PAS staining. The intestine is without pyloric caeca and is divided into anterior and posterior region. Histologically it is characterized by simple columnar  with brush border and numerous goblet cells throughout its length.

Although several defensive strategies are present in this organ, its organization and function may be disturbed by some insecticidal agents, including bioactive proteins like lectins and protease inhibitors (PIs) from plants. PIs interfere with digestion, leading to poor nutrient absorption and decreasing amino acid bioavailability. Intake of PIs can delay development, cause deformities and reduce fertility. Ingestion of PIs may lead to changes in the set of proteases secreted in the insect , but this response is often insufficient and results in aggravation of the malnutrition status. Lectins are proteins that are able to interact with glycoconjugates, including those linked to cell surfaces. Their effects on the midgut include disruption of the peritrophic matrix, brush border and secretory cell layer; induction of apoptosis and oxidative stress; interference with nutrient absorption and transport proteins; and damaging effects on symbionts. In addition, lectins can cross the intestinal barrier and reach the hemolymph. The establishment of resistant insect populations due to selective pressure resulting from massive use of a bioactive protein is an actual possibility, but this can be minimized by the multiple mode-of-action of these proteins, mainly the lectins.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330806>A fish model for the study of the relationship between neuroendocrine and immune cells in the intestinal : Silurus glanis infected with a tapeworm.</a></h2><p>Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and ultrastructural studies were conducted on a sub-population of 20 wels catfish Silurus glanis from a tributary of the River Po (Northern Italy).

This study investigated the effect of a gradual adaptation and continuously induced long-term SARA challenge diet on the epimural bacterial community structure in the rumen of cows. Eight rumen-cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were transitioned over 1 wk from a forage-based baseline feeding diet (grass silage-hay mix) to a SARA challenge diet, which they were fed for 4 wk. The SARA challenge diet consisted of 60% concentrates (dry matter basis) and 40% grass silage-hay mix. Rumen papillae biopsies were taken at the baseline, on the last day of the 1-wk adaptation, and on the last day of the 4-wk SARA challenge period; ruminal pH was measured using wireless sensors. We isolated DNA from papillae samples for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing results of most abundant key phylotypes were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Although they were fed similar amounts of concentrate, cows responded differently in terms of ruminal pH during the SARA feeding challenge. Cows were therefore classified as responders (n = 4) and nonresponders (n = 4): only responders met the SARA criterion of a ruminal pH drop below .8 for longer than 330 min/d. Data showed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla, and at genus level, Campylobacter and Kingella showed highest relative abundance, at 15. and 7.8%, respectively. Diversity analyses revealed a significant increase of diversity after the 1-wk adaptation but a decrease of diversity and species richness after the 4-wk SARA feeding challenge, although without distinction between responders and nonresponders. At the level of the operational taxonomic unit, we detected diet-specific shifts in epimural community structure, but in the overall epimural bacterial community structure, we found no differences between responders and nonresponders. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between grain intake and operational taxonomic unit abundance. The study revealed major shifts in the 3 dominating phyla and, most importantly, a loss of diversity in the epimural bacterial communities during a long-term SARA diet challenge, in which 60% concentrate supply for 4 wk was instrumental rather than the magnitude of the drop of ruminal pH below .8.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

After 48 h, IR rats demonstrated a significant increase in Dhh, Ihh, Gil and PTCH2 mRNA in jejunum as well as in Dhh, Ihh, SMO, GIL, PTCH2 mRNA in ileum compared to IR-24 animals that was coincided with increased number of SHH-positive cells in jejunum (2.6-fold increase) and ileum (1.4-fold increase).24 h following intestinal IR, inhibited cell turnover was associated with inhibited SHh signaling pathway.

We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of "toxic lymph" following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29276749>HIF-1α Deletion in the Endothelium, but Not in the , Protects From Radiation-Induced Enteritis.</a></h2><p>Radiation therapy in the pelvic area is associated with side effects that impact the quality of life of cancer survivors. Interestingly, the gastrointestinal tract is able to adapt to significant changes in oxygen availability, suggesting that mechanisms related to hypoxia sensing help preserve tissue integrity in this organ. However, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent responses to radiation-induced  toxicity are unknown. Radiation-induced intestinal toxicity is a complex process involving multiple cellular compartments. Here, we investigated whether epithelial or endothelial tissue-specific HIF-1α deletion could affect acute intestinal response to radiation.Using constitutive and inducible epithelial or endothelial tissue-specific HIF-1α deletion, we evaluated the consequences of epithelial or endothelial HIF-1α deletion on radiation-induced enteritis after localized irradiation. Survival, radiation-induced tissue injury, molecular inflammatory profile, tissue hypoxia, and vascular injury were monitored.Surprisingly, -specific HIF-1α deletion does not alter radiation-induced intestinal injury. However, irradiated VECad-CreHIF-1α mice present with lower radiation-induced damage, showed a preserved vasculature, reduced hypoxia, and reduced proinflammatory response compared with irradiated HIF-1α mice.We demonstrate  that HIF-1α impacts radiation-induced enteritis and that this role differs according to the targeted cell type. Our work provides a new role for HIF-1α and endothelium-dependent mechanisms driving inflammatory processes in  mucosae. Results presented show that effects on normal tissues have to be taken into account in approaches aiming to modulate hypoxia or hypoxia-related molecular mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28795875>Animal models for studying epithelial barriers in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelial cells line the luminal surface of the entire gastrointestinal tract which is crucial for the absorption of nutrients and prevention of pathogens entering from the external environment. The epithelial barrier plays an important role in organ development, disease pathogenesis, and aging. The major component of an epithelial barrier is the single columnar  and tight junctions. Tight junctions are located at the most apical region of the junctional complex and contain many integral membrane proteins, such as occludin, the claudin family, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). The disruption of intestinal epithelial barriers may lead to several pathophysiological conditions causing malabsorption of nutrition and chronic inflammation. In this review, we provide an update on the alterations of epithelial barriers associated with  diseases using experimental animal models; we appraise the role of tight junctions in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer; we also compare some common features as well as differences and similarities in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation in neonatal (NEC) and adult (IBD) .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208693>Dysregulation of junctional adhesion molecule-A contributes to ethanol-induced barrier disruption in intestinal epithelial cell monolayers.</a></h2><p>Alcohol consumption promotes loss of intestinal barrier function. However, mechanisms by which ethanol affects the tight junction (TJ), the cellular structure responsible for maintaining the  epithelial barrier, are not well understood. Three classes of transmembrane proteins comprise TJs: occludin, claudins, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). It has recently been postulated that JAM-A (F11R), the most abundant JAM expressed in intestinal , regulates "leak" pathway flux, a paracellular route for the nonselective permeation of large solutes. Since transluminal flux of many -derived antigens occurs through this pathway, we investigated the role of JAM-A in ethanol-induced disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Using Caco-2 and SK-CO15 monolayers, we found that ethanol induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in JAM-A protein expression to about 70% of baseline levels. Alcohol also reduced Ras-related protein 2 (Rap2) activity, and enhanced myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activity, changes consistent with impaired JAM-A signaling. Stable overexpression and shRNA-mediated knockdown of JAM-A were employed to investigate the role of JAM-A in paracellular-mediated flux following alcohol exposure. The paracellular flux of 40-kDa fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-dextran following ethanol treatment was decreased by the overexpression of JAM-A; conversely, flux was enhanced by JAM-A knockdown. Thus, we conclude that ethanol-mediated control of JAM-A expression and function contributes to mechanisms by which this chemical induces intestinal epithelial leakiness.© 2017 The Authors.

Seven pairs of newborn twin lambs were used. Within each pair, lambs were assigned to receive an oral infusion of SB at 0.36 g/kg body weight (BW) (SB, n = 7) or the same volume of saline (Con, n = 7). Treatments were administered from 10 to 49 d of age, when all lambs were slaughtered. Results showed that the average daily feed intake (ADFI) of starter, average daily gain (ADG), BW of lambs at ages of  and 6 wk in SB group were greater (P < 0.05) than those in Con group. Infusion of SB increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and total VFA in the rumen fluid and elevated (P < 0.05) the levels of β-hydroxybutyrate acid (BHBA), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin in plasma. Infusion of SB promoted rumen papillae growth, depicted by higher emptied rumen weight, larger rumen papillae length, width, and surface area, and greater thickness of stratum corneum and total . Sodium butyrate infusion upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of cyclin A2, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinases 6 (CDK6), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of caspase-3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in the rumen epithelia. Moreover, SB infusion also upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein  (IGFBP-), and downregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in the rumen epithelia. Sodium butyrate infusion also enhanced (P < 0.05) gene expressions of monocarboxylate transporter isoform 1 (MCT1), downregulated in adenoma (DRA), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase isoform 2 (HMGCS2), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL), while depressed (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of sodium/proton exchanger isoform 2 (NHE2) in the rumen epithelia. Our results suggest that the SB infusion can improve animal performance, promote the ruminal papillae growth, and enhance expression of genes related to ruminal epithelial VFA uptake and metabolism in preweaning twin lambs. These findings provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of SB promoting rumen epithelial development and function in preweaning lambs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115552>Xenin Augments Duodenal Anion Secretion via Activation of Afferent Neural Pathways.</a></h2><p>Xenin-25, a neurotensin (NT)-related anorexigenic  hormone generated mostly in the duodenal mucosa, is believed to increase the rate of duodenal ion secretion, because xenin-induced diarrhea is not present after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Because the local effects of xenin on duodenal ion secretion have remained uninvestigated, we thus examined the neural pathways underlying xenin-induced duodenal anion secretion. Intravenous infusion of xenin-8, a bioactive C-terminal fragment of xenin-25, dose dependently increased the rate of duodenal HCO secretion in perfused duodenal loops of anesthetized rats. Xenin was immunolocalized to a subset of enteroendocrine cells in the rat duodenum. The mRNA of the xenin/NT receptor 1 (NTS1) was predominantly expressed in the enteric plexus, nodose and dorsal root ganglia, and in the lamina propria rather than in the . The serosal application of xenin-8 or xenin-25 rapidly and transiently increased short-circuit current in Ussing-chambered mucosa-submucosa preparations in a concentration-dependent manner in the duodenum and jejunum, but less so in the ileum and colon. The selective antagonist for NTS1, substance P (SP) receptor (NK1), or -hydroxytryptamine (-HT), but not NTS2, inhibited the responses to xenin. Xenin-evoked Cl secretion was reduced by tetrodotoxin (TTX) or capsaicin-pretreatment, and abolished by the inhibitor of TTX-resistant sodium channel Nav1.8 in combination with TTX, suggesting that peripheral xenin augments duodenal HCO and Cl secretion through NTS1 activation on intrinsic and extrinsic afferent nerves, followed by release of SP and -HT. Afferent nerve activation by postprandial, peripherally released xenin may account for its secretory effects in the duodenum.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28099756>Levofloxacin effect on erlotinib absorption. Evaluation of the interaction in undernutrition situations through population pharmacokinetic analysis in rats.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic model in order to describe the intestinal absorption of erlotinib in rat and to quantify the interaction of levofloxacin on this process in well- and under-nourished rats. Absorption studies were performed in male Wistar rats. Concentration-time profiles in proximal and distal intestine were analysed through non-linear mixed effect modelling using the NONMEM software version 7.3. Simulations were performed in order to explore the influence of covariates on the apparent absorption rate constant. A passive absorption and an active secretion process best-described erlotinib absorption from lumen to enterocyte. The developed model indicates that levofloxacin exerts an inhibition on erlotinib efflux transporters of the  . Undernourishment proved to significantly decrease the maximum capacity of the secretion process. Simulations evidenced that erlotinib absorption only takes place at high enough drug concentrations to overcome the effect of efflux transporters. On the other hand, when levofloxacin is present in the intestinal lumen of undernourished rats, erlotinib drug absorption takes place even at low erlotinib concentrations. In the clinical setting, this interaction may result in increased exposure to erlotinib, especially in undernourished cancer patients.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238731>Avian coronavirus infection induces mannose-binding lectin production in dendritic cell precursors of chicken lymphoid organs.</a></h2><p>The aim of this immunocytochemical study was to compare mannose-binding lectin (MBL) production induced by avian coronavirus in the spleen and caecal tonsil (CT). One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were experimentally infected with six QX field isolates and the H120 vaccine strain. In the negative control birds, the spleen was MBL negative, while the CT showed scattered MBL-positive cells in close proximity and within the surface  and germinal centre (GC)-like cell clusters. MBL was detectable in the ellipsoid-associated cells (EACs) and cell clusters in the periarterial lymphoid sheath (PALS) by 7 days post infection (dpi). In both organs, the MBL-positive cells occupy antigen-exposed areas, indicating that GC formation depends on resident precursors of dendritic cells. The majority of MBL-positive EACs express the CD83 antigen, providing evidence that coronavirus infection facilitated the maturation of dendritic cell precursors. Surprisingly, co-localisation of MBL and CD83 was not detectable in the CT. In the spleen (associated with circulation), the EACs producing MBL and expressing CD83 are a common precursor of both follicular (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cells (IDC). In the CT (-associated lymphoid tissue, GALT) the precursors of FDC and IDC are MBL-producing cells and CD83-positive cells, respectively. In the CT the two separate precursors of lymphoid dendritic cells provide some 'autonomy' for the GALT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635334>Atoh1 secretory progenitors possess renewal capacity independent of Lgr5 cells during colonic regeneration.</a></h2><p>During homeostasis, the colonic  is replenished every 3- days by rapidly cycling   stem cells. However, various insults can lead to depletion of   stem cells, and colonic  can be regenerated from negative cells. While studies in the small intestine have addressed the lineage identity of the negative regenerative cell population, in the colon this question has remained unanswered. Here, we set out to identify which cell(s) contribute to colonic regeneration by performing genetic fate-mapping studies of progenitor populations in mice. First, using -19 () to mark a heterogeneous population of cells, we found that negative cells can regenerate colonic crypts and give rise to   stem cells.   absorptive progenitor cells did not contribute to epithelial repair after injury, whereas   secretory progenitors did contribute to this process. Additionally, while colonic   cells contributed minimally to other lineages during homeostasis, they displayed plasticity and contributed to epithelial repair during injury, independent of   cells. Our findings suggest that promotion of secretory progenitor plasticity could enable  healing in colitis.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28290735>Quantitative biokinetics of titanium dioxide nanoparticles after intratracheal instillation in rats: Part 3.</a></h2><p>The biokinetics of a size-selected fraction (70 nm median size) of commercially available and V-radiolabeled [V]TiO nanoparticles has been investigated in healthy adult female Wistar-Kyoto rats at retention time-points of 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 7 d and 28 d after intratracheal instillation of a single dose of an aqueous [V]TiO-nanoparticle suspension. A completely balanced quantitative biodistribution in all organs and tissues was obtained by applying typical [V]TiO-nanoparticle doses in the range of 40-240 μg·kg bodyweight and making use of the high sensitivity of the radiotracer technique. The [V]TiO-nanoparticle content was corrected for residual blood retained in organs and tissues after exsanguination and for V-ions not bound to TiO-nanoparticles. About 4% of the initial peripheral lung dose passed through the air-blood-barrier after 1 h and were retained mainly in the carcass (4%); 0.3% after 28 d. Highest organ fractions of [V]TiO-nanoparticles present in liver and kidneys remained constant (0.03%). [V]TiO-nanoparticles which entered across the   following fast and long-term clearance from the lungs via larynx increased from  to 20% of all translocated/absorbed [V]TiO-nanoparticles. This contribution may account for 1/ of the nanoparticle retention in some organs. After normalizing the fractions of retained [V]TiO-nanoparticles to the fraction that reached systemic circulation, the biodistribution was compared with the biodistributions determined after IV-injection (Part 1) and gavage (GAV) (Part 2). The biokinetics patterns after IT-instillation and GAV were similar but both were distinctly different from the pattern after intravenous injection disproving the latter to be a suitable surrogate of the former applications. Considering that chronic occupational inhalation of relatively biopersistent TiO-particles (including nanoparticles) and accumulation in secondary organs may pose long-term health risks, this issue should be scrutinized more comprehensively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29928179>Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Two Siblings and an Unrelated Infant with Overlapping Chromosome 6q25 Deletions.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains poorly understood but is thought to be multifactorial.

This study investigated the ileal epithelial microbiota and its relationship with host epithelial function in goats fed a HG diet (concentrate/hay, 90:10) and a control diet (concentrate/hay, 55:45), aiming to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ileal adaptation to subacute acidosis. The HG challenge increased the ileal volatile fatty acid concentration ( p = 0.030) and altered the ileal epithelial microbiota by increasing (FDR < 0.05) relative abundances of active carbohydrate and protein degraders Synergistetes, Prevotella, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, Treponema, and unclassified Ruminococcaceae by 20.1-, 6.3-, 16.8-, 8.-, 19.9-, and 7.1-fold, respectively. However, the HG diet tended to reduce (FDR < 0.10) the relative abundance of Candidatus Arthromitus (38.8 ± 36.1 versus 2.1 ± 3.1). Microbial functional potentials inferred using PICRUSt indicated that the HG challenge elevated abundances of pathways associated with metabolism of amino acid, glycan, cofactors, and vitamins, whereras it decreased pathways associated with signal transduction, xenobiotic biodegradation, and metabolism. Additionally, in the ileal  of HG goats, transcriptome analysis identified the increment (FDR < 0.10) of candidate genes involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, and the proinflammatory cytokine pathway, while downregulating genes encoding antimicrobials and complements (FDR < 0.05). Collectively, the HG challenge shifted the structure and functional potentials of the ileal microbial community and affected the host responses in the ileum of goats toward increased metabolic activities of macro- and micronutrients, together with an increased risk of  inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31140746>Modulation of Intestinal Epithelial Glycocalyx Development by Human Milk Oligosaccharides and Non-Digestible Carbohydrates.</a></h2><p>The epithelial glycocalyx development is of great importance for microbial colonization. Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) may modulate glycocalyx development.The effects of hMOs and NDCs on human gut epithelial cells (Caco2) are investigated by quantifying thickness and area coverage of adsorbed albumin, heparan sulfate (HS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) in the glycocalyx. Effects of hMOs (2'-FL and 3-FL) and NDCs [inulins with degrees of polymerization (DP) (DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60, DP30-DP60) and pectins with degrees of methylation (DM) (DM7, DM55, DM69)] are tested using immunofluorescence staining at 1 and  days stimulation. HMOs show a significant enhancing effect on glycocalyx development but effects are structure-dependent. 3-FL induces a stronger albumin adsorption and increases HS and HA stronger than 2'-FL. The DP3-DP10, DP30-60 inulins also increase glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent manner as DP3-DP10 selectively increases HS, while DP30-DP60 specifically increases HA. Pectins have less effects, and only increase albumin adsorption.Here, it is shown that 2'-FL and 3-FL and inulins stimulate glycocalyx development in a structure-dependent fashion. This may contribute to formulation of effective hMO and NDC formulations in infant formulas to support microbial colonization and gut barrier function.© 2019 The Authors.

The integrity of the   and competence of adaptive immune responses are notoriously compromised during sepsis, and the prevalent assumption in the scientific and medical community is that intestinal commensals have a detrimental role in the systemic inflammation and susceptibility to nosocomial infections seen in critically ill, septic patients. However, breakthroughs in the last decade provide strong credence to the idea that our mucosal microbiome plays an essential role in adaptive immunity, where a human host and its prokaryotic colonists seem to exist in a carefully negotiated armistice with compromises and benefits that go both ways. In this review, we re-examine the notion that intestinal contents are the driving force of critical illness. An overview of the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system is provided, with a special focus on the impact of commensals in priming and the careful balance between normal intestinal flora and pathogenic organisms residing in the  microbiome. Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the , along with compromises in epithelial integrity. As a result, normal antigen sampling becomes impaired, and proliferative cues are intermixed with inhibitory signals. This situates the microbiome, the , and its complex immune network of cells and bacteria, at the center of aberrant immune responses during and after sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800568>Cell adhesion properties of human defensins.</a></h2><p>Effector peptides of innate immunity play an important role in host defense. They act directly by inactivating microbes but also link innate to adaptive immunity. A variety of innate immune functions has been described for these peptides, including chemoattraction and cytokine release. In this study, we describe the effect on cell morphology and cell adhesion of human defensins. We find that Human Defensin , the major product of specialized  epithelial cells, causes changes in cell morphology. HD- induces cell adhesion, binds to fibronectin and facilitates binding of T cells to intestinal epithelial cells. These effects were found also for a second prominent defensing, termed Human Neutrophil peptide-1, but not for other human defensins.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29740541>Anti-biofilm Properties of the Fecal Probiotic Lactobacilli Against  spp.</a></h2><p>Diarrheal disease caused by  is endemic in developing countries including India and is associated with high rate of mortality especially in children.  is known to form biofilms on the  , and the biofilms once formed are resistant to the action of antibiotics. Therefore agents that prevent the biofilm formation and disperse the preformed biofilms are associated with therapeutic benefits. The use of antibiotics for the treatment of cholera is associated with side effects such as  dysbiosis due to depletion of  microflora, and the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Thus search for safe alternative therapeutic agents is warranted. Herein, we screened the lactobacilli spp. isolated from the fecal samples of healthy children for their abilities to prevent biofilm formation and to disperse the preformed biofilms of  and  by using an  assay. The results showed that the culture supernatant (CS) of all the seven isolates of  spp. used in the study inhibited the biofilm formation of  by more than 90%. Neutralization of pH of CS completely abrogated their antimicrobial activities against , but had negligible effects on their biofilm inhibitory potential. Further, CS of all the lactobacilli isolates caused the dispersion of preformed  biofilms in the range 62-85%; however, pH neutralization of CS reduced the biofilm dispersal potential of the 4 out of 7 isolates by 19-57%. Furthermore, the studies showed that CS of none of the lactobacilii isolates had antimicrobial activity against , but  out of 7 isolates inhibited the formation of its biofilm in the range 62-82%. However, none of the CS dispersed the preformed biofilms of . The ability of CS to inhibit the adherence of  spp. to the epithelial cell line was also determined. Thus, we conclude that the biofilm dispersive action of CS of lactobacilli is strain-specific and pH-dependent. As  is known to form biofilms in the intestinal niche having physiological pH in the range 6-7, the probiotic strains that have dispersive action at high pH may have better therapeutic potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027252>Susceptibility of  to the Infection with Shrimp Hemocyte Iridescent Virus (SHIV 20141215), a Strain of Decapod Iridescent Virus 1 (DIV1).</a></h2><p>In this study, ridgetail white prawns--were infected per os (PO) with debris of  infected with shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV 20141215), a strain of decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1), and via intramuscular injection (IM with raw extracts of SHIV 20141215.

However, the barrier of the follicle-associated  (FAE) covering porcine Peyer's patches (PP) has not yet been characterized in detail. This study aimed to perform this characterization in order to pave the way toward an understanding of the functional contribution of epithelial barrier properties in  immunology. Porcine tissue specimens were taken from the distal small intestine in order to obtain electrophysiological data of PP FAE and neighboring villous  (VE), employing the Ussing chamber technique. Transepithelial resistance (TER) and paracellular fluorescein flux were measured, and tissues were morphometrically compared. In selfsame tissues, expression and localization of major tight junction (TJ) proteins (claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, -, and -8) were analyzed. PP FAE specimens showed a higher TER and a lower apparent permeability for sodium fluorescein than VE. Immunoblotting revealed an expression of all claudins within both epithelia, with markedly stronger expression of the sealing TJ protein claudin-4 in PP FAE compared with the neighboring VE. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression and localization of all claudins in both PP FAE and VE, with stronger claudin-4 abundance in PP FAE. The results are in accordance with the physiological function of the FAE, which strongly regulates and limits antigen uptake determining a mandatory transcellular route for antigen presentation, highlighting the importance of this structure for the first steps of the intestinal immune response.

Indeed, autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with the modulation of host response to diets. One crucial mechanism by which the microbiota affects the host is signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed metabolite-sensing GPCRs. In the , both immune and nonimmune cells express GPCRs and their activation generally provide anti-inflammatory signals through regulation of both the immune system functions and the epithelial integrity. Members of GPCR family serve as a link between microbiota, immune system and intestinal  by which all these components crucially participate to maintain the  homeostasis. Conversely, impaired GPCR signaling is associated with IBD and other diseases, including hepatic steatosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and asthma. In this review, we first outline the signaling, function, expression and the physiological role of several groups of metabolite-sensing GPCRs. We then discuss recent findings on their role in the regulation of the inflammation, their existing endogenous and synthetic ligands and innovative approaches to therapeutically target inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462370>The effect of Eimeria maxima infection on the expression of amino acid and sugar transporters aminopeptidase, as well as the di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1, is not solely due to decreased feed intake.</a></h2><p>Coccidiosis caused by Eimeria in poultry is endemic to poultry operations and results in decreased feed intake, diarrhea, and decreased weight gain. The goal was to determine the effect of Eimeria maxima infection on the expression of genes that encode peptide and amino acid transporters (AATs), and also to determine whether decreased feed intake contributes to the change in gene expression by including a pair-fed group of broilers. Three groups of male Ross broilers: 1) not infected, 2) infected, and 3) not infected pair-fed groups were used. Chicks were infected with 1,000 oocysts of E. maxima at 21 d of age. Feed consumption was obtained daily, and at d 0, 3, , 7, 10, and 14 post-infection (PI), 6 birds were euthanized, and a portion of the jejunum was removed for qRT-PCR. Infected birds had significantly decreased feed consumption between d 6 to 9 PI. At d 7 PI infected birds had a 45% reduction in weight gain, and pair-fed birds had a 32% reduction in weight gain. The feed conversion ratio at d 7 PI of infected birds was 2.2 while that of pair-fed birds was 1.7, compared to 1. in uninfected birds. Growth parameters were more affected in infected birds than in pair-fed birds. By measuring expression levels of nutrient uptake and processing genes via qRT-PCR, it was determined that genes encoding proteins located at the brush border of the   were affected by infection as well as change in feed intake. The expression of AATs B°AT, b°,+AT, EAAT3, and PepT1 in infected birds decreased sharply at the height of infection; however, in birds that were pair fed, an increase in expression of b°,+AT, and PepT1 was observed, and little change was seen in expression of B°AT and EAAT3. In summary, the changes in expression of digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters are distinct between coccidia-infected birds compared to healthy pair-fed birds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29365122>Rapid immunosurveillance by recirculating lymphocytes in the rat intestine: critical role of unsulfated sialyl-Lewis X on high endothelial venules of the Peyer's patches.</a></h2><p>Naive lymphocytes systemically recirculate for immunosurveillance inspecting foreign antigens and pathogens in the body. Trafficking behavior such as the migration pathway and transit time within the gastrointestinal tract, however, remains to be elucidated. Rat thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDLs) were transferred to a congeneic host that had undergone mesenteric lymphadenectomy. The migration pathway was investigated using newly developed four-color immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Donor TDLs showed rapid transition in  tissues from which they emerged in mesenteric lymph around 4 h after intravenous injection. Immunohistochemistry showed that donor TDLs predominantly transmigrated across high endothelial venules (HEVs) at the interfollicular area of the Peyer's patches (PPs), then exited into the LYVE-1+ efferent lymphatics, that were close to the venules. The rapid recirculation depended largely on the local expression of unsulfated sialyl-Lewis X on these venules where putative dendritic cells (DCs) were associated underneath. Recruited naive T cells briefly made contact with resident DCs before exiting to the lymphatics in the steady state. In some transplant settings, however, the T cells retained contact with DCs and were sensitized and differentiated into activated T cells. In conclusion, we directly demonstrated that lymphocyte recirculation within the  is a very rapid process. The interfollicular area of PPs functions as a strategically central site for rapid immunosurveillance where HEVs, efferent lymphatics and resident DCs converge. PPs can, however, generate alloreactive T cells, leading to exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease or  allograft rejection.© The Author(s) 2018.

Information about the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying campylobacteriosis, however, are scarce. In the present study we investigated whether cytokines including IL-23, IL-22 and IL-18 sharing pivotal functions in host immunity were involved in mediating immunopathological responses upon C. jejuni infection.To address this, conventionally colonized IL-23p19(-/-), IL-22(-/-) and IL-18(-/-) mice were perorally infected with C. jejuni strain ATCC 43431. Respective gene-deficient, but not wildtype mice were susceptible to C. jejuni infection and could be readily colonized with highest pathogenic loads in the terminal ileum and colon at day 14 postinfection (p.i.). In IL-23p19(-/-), IL-22(-/-) and IL-18(-/-) mice viable C. jejuni were detected in MLNs, but did not translocate to spleen, liver, kidney and blood in the majority of cases. Susceptible IL-22(-/-), but neither IL-23p19(-/-), nor IL-18(-/-) mice harbored higher intestinal commensal E. coli loads when compared to resistant wildtype mice. Alike C. jejuni, commensal E. coli did not translocate from the intestinal to extra-intestinal tissue sites. Despite C. jejuni infection, mice lacking IL-23p19, IL-22 or IL-18 exhibited less apoptotic cells, but higher numbers of proliferating cells in their colonic  as compared to wildtype mice at day 14 p.i. Less pronounced apoptosis was parallelled by lower abundance of neutrophils within the colonic mucosa and lamina propria of infected IL-23p19(-/-) and IL-22(-/-) as compared to wildtype control mice, whereas less distinct colonic TNF secretion could be measured in IL-22(-/-) and IL-18(-/-) than in wildtype mice at day 14 p.i. Notably, in infected IL-22(-/-) mice, colonic IL-23p19 mRNA levels were lower, whereas the other way round, colonic IL-22 expression rates were lower in IL-23p19(-/-) mice as compared to wildtype controls. Moreover, IL-18 mRNA was less distinctly expressed in large intestines of naive and infected IL-22(-/-) mice, but not vice versa, given that IL-22 mRNA levels did not differ between in IL-18(-/-) and wildtype mice.Cytokines belonging to the IL-23/IL-22/IL-18 axis mediate immunopathological responses upon murine C. jejuni infection in a differentially orchestrated manner.

To investigate the differences in factors that play a role in nutrient processing and uptake between modern fast growing (Ross) and slow growing broilers not selected for growth (ACRBC), a study was carried comparing the expression of 13 genes that encode amino acid transporters (ASCT1, ATBo,+, BoAT, bo, +AT, CAT1, CAT2, EAAT3, γ+LAT1, and LAT1) and sugar transporters (GLUT2 and GLUT5), as well as aminopeptidase (APN) and the di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1. The growth rate of Ross birds was approximately 4 times greater than that of ACRBCs, and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was greater in ACRBCs at all-time points measured. Gene expression in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was measured at 1, 3, , 10, and 14 d post hatch (PH). The expression of genes that encode proteins (particularly ASCT1, ATBo, +, and BoAT) located at the brush border of the   was generally higher in ACRBCs especially at earlier time points. The expression of genes that encode proteins located at the basolateral surface of the   was less affected. The expression of GLUT2 and GLUT5 was significantly decreased in ACRBCs at most time points and  segments. Based on the present data we conclude that expression of brush border and sugar transporters in the small intestine can be correlated with growth. Presented increases the identification of the factors that influence growth and will assist future studies of the function of these molecules.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Poultry Science Association 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204053>Induction of precocious intestinal maturation in T-cell deficient athymic neonatal rats.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether  maturation could be induced precociously in an athymic T-cell deficient neonatal rat model.Fourteen day-old athymic (nude) rats (NIH-1) were gavaged with either phytohaemagglutinin - a lectin from red kidney beans (PHA); trypsin - a protease (Prot); or water - vehicle (control) as a single dose on one day or once a day for 3-day. The nude rats were either nurtured by their mothers or cross-fostered by conventional foster dams of the Sprague-Dawley strain from days 3- after birth. At 17 d of age, 72 h after administration of the first treatment, intestinal macromolecular permeability was tested , prior to euthanasia, after which blood and  organs were sampled.Provocation with both, PHA and protease, resulted in increased  growth and maturation in nude rat pups independent of nursing. Foetal-type enterocytes were replaced by non-vacuolated adult-type enterocytes in the distal small intestine . Decreased intestinal macromolecular permeability ( closure) was observed, with reduced permeability markers (BIgG and BSA,  < 0.001) in circulation. Increased pancreatic function, with an increased trypsin to protein ratio in pancreas homogenates, was observed independent of nursing in the nude pups. Immunostaining showed the presence of a few CD3-cells in the intestinal mucosa of the nude pups. The number of CD3-cells remained unaltered by provocation and no differences were observed between the nursing sets. Growth and vitality of the nude pups were dependent on nurturing, since cross-fostering by conventional dams increased their macromolecular absorptive capacity (BSA,  < 0.05), as well as their passive immunity (RIgG,  < 0.05).Precocious  maturation can be induced by enteral provocation in athymic rat pups, similarly to in euthymic pups, thus showing an independence from thymus-derived T-cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237767>Comparison between virulence characteristics of dominant and non-dominant Escherichia coli strains of the  and their interaction with Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli strains are normal inhabitants of the  and are normally found in the faeces of the host at different population sizes.

However, when and how ISCs are established during embryogenesis remains unknown. We show here that the transcription regulator Id2 controls the specification of embryonic Lgr5 progenitors in the developing murine small intestine. Cell fate mapping analysis revealed that Lgr5 progenitors emerge at E13. in wild-type embryos and differ from the rest on the intestinal  by a characteristic ISC signature. In the absence of Id2, the intestinal  differentiates into Lgr5 cells already at E9.. Furthermore, the size of the Lgr5 cell pool is significantly increased. We show that Id2 restricts the activity of the Wnt signalling pathway at early stages and prevents precocious differentiation of the embryonic intestinal . Id2-deficient embryonic epithelial cells cultured  strongly activate Wnt target genes as well as markers of neoplastic transformation and form fast growing undifferentiated spheroids. Furthermore, adult ISCs from Id2-deficient mice display a distinct transcriptional signature, supporting an essential role for Id2 in the correct specification of ISCs.© 2017 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29565634>Prebiotic Potential of Herbal Medicines Used in Digestive Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>The prebiotic potential of herbal medicines has been scarcely studied.The authors therefore used anaerobic human fecal cultivation to investigate whether three herbal medicines commonly used in gastrointestinal health and disease in Ayurveda alter the growth and abundance of specific bacterial species.Profiling of cultures supplemented with Glycyrrhiza glabra, Ulmus rubra, or triphala formulation by 16S rDNA sequencing revealed profound changes in diverse taxa in human  microbiota. Principal coordinate analysis highlights that each herbal medicine drives the formation of unique microbial communities. The relative abundance of approximately one-third of the 299 species profiled was altered by all 3 medicines, whereas additional species displayed herb-specific alterations. Herb supplementation increased the abundance of many bacteria known to promote human health, including Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Bacteroides spp. Herb supplementation resulted in the reduced relative abundance of many species, including potential pathogens such as Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Herbal medicines induced blooms of butyrate- and propionate-producing species. U. rubra and triphala significantly increased the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, whereas G. glabra induced the largest increase in propionate-producing species. To achieve greater insight into the mechanisms through which herbal medicines alter microbial communities, the authors assessed the shifts in abundance of glycosyl hydrolase families induced by each herbal medicine. Herb supplementation, particularly G. glabra, significantly increased the representation and potential expression of several glycosyl hydrolase families.These studies are novel in highlighting the significant prebiotic potential of medicinal herbs and suggest that the health benefits of these herbs are due, at least in part, to their ability to modulate the  microbiota in a manner predicted to improve colonic  function, reduce inflammation, and protect from opportunistic infection.

This revealed varying levels of interference with gastric digestive proteolysis and a significant decrease in pepsin activity. Further, a Caco-2 cell model was used to explore various effects of physiologically digested CGN (pdCGN) on various epithelial cell functions and characteristics. Samples of pdCGN (0.005-0. mg/mL) affected the epithelial barrier function, including redistribution of the tight-junction protein Zonula Occludens (Zo)-1, changes in cellular F-actin architecture and increased monolayer permeability to the transfer of macromolecules. Moreover, pdCGN induced elevation in the levels of the pro-inflammatory IL-8 receptor CXCR1.This work raises the possibility that CGN may reduce protein and peptide bioaccessibility, disrupt normal epithelial function, promote intestinal inflammation, and consequently compromise consumer health.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Depending on dietary ME and CP level down regulation and the inclusion or not of PFA at 125 mg/kg diet, 450 one-day-old male broilers were allocated in the following 6 treatments for 42 D according to a 3 × 2 factorial design: A: diet formulated optimally to meet broiler nutrient requirements; APh: A+PFA; B: suboptimal in ME and CP levels by 3%; BPh: B+PFA; C: suboptimal in ME and CP levels by 6%; CPh: C+PFA. Diet type and PFA supplementation were shown to affect mostly the mucosa-associated microbiota compared to the luminal ones. Ileal mucosa-associated total bacteria (PD= 0.005), Lactobacillus spp. (PD= 0.003), and Clostridium cluster XIVa (PD= 0.009) were affected by diet type with broilers fed diet B having lower levels compared to broilers fed diets A or C. Moreover, diet type affected cecal mucosa-associated Lactobacillus spp. (PD= 0.002) with broilers fed diet C having lower levels compared to broilers fed diets A or B. Supplementation with PFA resulted in higher levels of cecal mucosa-associated Bacteroides (PP= 0.031), Clostridium cluster IV (PP= 0.007), and Clostridium cluster XIVa (PP= 0.039). Diet type affected TLR2 (PD= 0.046) and claudin  (PD= 0.027) in cecal . Lower TLR2 (PP= 0.021) and higher zonula occludens 2 (PP= 0.031) relative gene expressions were seen in ileal  following PFA supplementation. Moreover, in cecal , PFA supplementation resulted in lower TLR2 (PP < 0.001) and higher zonula occludens 2 (PP= 0.009), claudin  (PP= 0.005) and occludin (PP= 0.039) relative gene expressions. There were no significant diet type and PFA effects on cytokines in secondary lymphoid organs, except for a dietary effect on transforming growth factor beta 4 (PD= 0.023) in cecal tonsils.

Widely available dietary phenolics, curcumin and piperine are purported to have antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities through yet-to-be-delineated multitarget mechanisms. Piperine is also known to increase the bioavailability of dietary components, including curcumin. The objective of the study was to determine whether curcumin and piperine have individual and combined effects in the setting of  inflammation by regulating mTORC1 in human intestinal epithelial cells. Results show that curcumin repressed (a) mTORC1 activity (measured as changes in the phosphorylation state of p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 and 40S ribosomal protein S6) in a dose-dependent manner (2.-20 μM, P<.007) and (b) synthesis of nascent proteins. Piperine inhibited mTORC1 activity albeit at comparatively higher concentrations than curcumin. The combination of curcumin + piperine further repressed mTORC1 signaling (P<.02). Mechanistically, curcumin may repress mTORC1 by preventing TSC2 degradation, the conserved inhibitor of mTORC1. Results also show that a functional mTORC1 was required for the transcription of TNFα as Raptor knockdown abrogated TNFα gene expression. Curcumin, piperine and their combination inhibited TNFα gene expression at baseline but failed to do so under conditions of mTORC1 hyperactivation. TNF∝-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression was repressed by curcumin or curcumin + piperine at baseline and high mTORC1 levels. We conclude that curcumin and piperine, either alone or in combination, have the potential to down-regulate mTORC1 signaling in the intestinal  with implications for tumorigenesis and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The osmolarity within the lumen is subjected to high variations meaning that water transport often has to take place against osmotic gradients. It has been hypothesized that LI-cadherin is important in this process by keeping the intercellular cleft narrow facilitating the buildup of an osmotic gradient allowing water reabsorption. LI-cadherin is exceptional among the cadherin superfamily with respect to its localization along the lateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells being excluded from adherens junction. Furthermore it has 7 but not  extracellular cadherin repeats (EC1-EC7) and a small cytosolic domain. In this study we identified the peptide VAALD as an inhibitor of LI-cadherin trans-interaction by modeling the structure of LI-cadherin and comparison with the known adhesive interfaces of E-cadherin. This inhibitory peptide was used to measure LI-cadherin dependency of water transport through a monolayer of epithelial CACO2 cells under various osmotic conditions. If LI-cadherin trans-interaction was inhibited by use of the peptide, water transport from the luminal to the basolateral side was impaired and even reversed in the case of hypertonic conditions whereas no effect could be observed at isotonic conditions. These data are in line with a recently published model predicting LI-cadherin to keep the width of the lateral intercellular cleft small. In this narrow cleft a high osmolarity can be achieved due to ion pumps yielding a standing osmotic gradient allowing water absorption from the  even if the faeces is highly hypertonic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589112>Description of epithelial granular cell in catshark spiral intestine: Immunohistochemistry and ultrastructure.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the histology of the spiral intestine of the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus), a small shark distributed in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea basin.

In contrast to the well-described role for WNT/β-CATENIN signaling as a regulator of stem/progenitor cells in the late fetal and adult , conditional epithelial deletion of β-catenin or the Frizzled co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6 had no effect on epithelial progenitor cell proliferation in the pseudostratified . Mutant embryos displayed obvious developmental defects, including loss of proliferation and disruptions in villus formation starting only at E15..

Prior to acute colitis onset, C57Bl/6 mice were prefed isocaloric 20% cooked navy bean (NB) or black bean (BB) diets for 3 weeks and switched to control basal diet (BD) 24 h prior to colitis induction via -day exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (2% w/v in drinking water)+3 days of fresh water. The severity of the acute colitis phenotype was attenuated by bean prefeeding, evidenced by reduced colon tissue inflammatory transcription factor activation (NFκB, STAT3) and inflammatory mediator levels in the colon (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and MCP-1) and serum (TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1) versus BD (P≤.05). Additionally, biomarkers of enhanced wound repair responses were increased by bean prefeeding including colon tissue protein levels of IL-22, IL-27 and activated (i.e., GTP-bound) Cdc42 and Rac1 versus BD (P≤.05). mRNA expressions of genes involved in normal colonic epithelial function and the promotion of epithelial barrier integrity, defense and/or restitution and wound closure including MUC1, RELMβ, IgA and REG3γ were all increased in NB and BB prefed mice versus BD (P≤.05). Collectively, bean supplementation prior to colitis induction (i.e., mimicking disease relapse) primes the colonic microenvironment to attenuate the severity of the colitis inflammatory phenotype and maintain aspects of epithelial barrier function.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The annual DH incidence rate, currently 2.7 per 100,000 in Finland and 0.8 per 100,000 in the U.K., is decreasing, whereas the reverse is true for coeliac disease. The long-term prognosis of DH patients on a gluten-free diet is excellent, with the mortality rate being even lower than for the general population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27624395>Molecular pathways driving disease-specific alterations of intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Due to the fact that chronic inflammation as well as tumorigenesis in the  is crucially impacted by the fate of intestinal epithelial cells, our article provides a comprehensive overview of the composition, function, regulation and homeostasis of the  .

However, the effects of CHO supplementation on  and systemic immunity are not well understood.Mice (n = 60) were randomized to 1 of the following  groups: control (ad lib feeding), 12-hour fasting without CHO administration (fasting), and 12 hours of fasting with CHO administration at 2, 4, and 8 hours before sacrifice. Then, lymphocytes were isolated from -associated lymphoid tissue, that is, Peyer's patches, the intraepithelial space, and the lamina propria of the small intestine. These lymphocyte numbers and phenotypes were evaluated. IgA levels in respiratory and small-intestinal washings were determined by ELISA. Morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis of the intestinal  were also evaluated histologically.Although there were no significant differences in IgA levels among the  groups, fasting decreased intraepithelial and lamina propria, but not Peyer's patches lymphocyte numbers. CHO at 2 hours prevented lymphocyte loss in intraepithelial, whereas CHO at 4 hours reversed lamina propria lymphocytes numbers. Percentages of lymphocyte phenotypes were similar in each site among the  groups. Fasting caused villous atrophy; however, CHO at 2 hours restored villous structure along with maintenance of epithelial cell proliferation rate.Only 12 hours of fasting causes marked -associated lymphoid tissue cell loss along with  atrophy. However, CHO at 2 hours preserves  immunity and morphology not completely but moderately.© 2018 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316967>The Role of Mucosal Immunity in the Pathogenesis of Necrotizing Enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most devastating gastrointestinal disease of prematurity. Although the precise cause is not well understood, the main risk factors thought to contribute to NEC include prematurity, formula feeding, and bacterial colonization. Recent evidence suggests that NEC develops as a consequence of intestinal hyper-responsiveness to microbial ligands upon bacterial colonization in the preterm infant, initiating a cascade of aberrant signaling events, and a robust pro-inflammatory mucosal immune response. We now have a greater understanding of important mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, such as the role of cytokines, immunoglobulins, and immune cells in NEC. In this review, we will provide an overview of the mucosal immunity of the intestine and the relationship between components of the mucosal immune system involved in the pathogenesis of NEC, while highlighting recent advances in the field that have promise as potential therapeutic targets. First, we will describe the cellular components of the intestinal  and mucosal immune system and their relationship to NEC. We will then discuss the relationship between the  microbiota and cell signaling that underpins disease pathogenesis. We will conclude our discussion by highlighting notable therapeutic advancements in NEC that target the intestinal mucosal immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27657187>The synthesis of OspD3 (ShET2) in Shigella flexneri is independent of OspC1.</a></h2><p>Shigella flexneri is a Gram-negative pathogen that invades the colonic  and causes millions of cases of watery diarrhea or bacillary dysentery predominately in children under the age of  years in developing countries. The effector Shigella enterotoxin 2 (ShET2), or OspD3, is encoded by the sen or ospD3 gene on the virulence plasmid. Previous literature has suggested that ospD3 is in an operon downstream of the ospC1 gene, and expression of both genes is controlled by a promoter upstream of ospC1. Since the intergenic region is 328 bases in length and contains several putative promoter regions, we hypothesized the genes are independently expressed. Here we provide data that ospD3 and ospC1 are not co-transcribed and that OspC1 is not required for OspD3/ShET2 function. Most importantly, we identified strong promoter activity in the intergenic region and demonstrate that OspD3/ShET2 can be expressed and secreted independently of OspC1. This work increases our understanding of the synthesis of a unique virulence factor and provides further insights into Shigella pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096305>Epithelial expression and function of trypsin-3 in irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Proteases are key mediators of pain and altered enteric neuronal signalling, although the types and sources of these important intestinal mediators are unknown. We hypothesised that intestinal  is a major source of trypsin-like activity in patients with IBS and this activity signals to primary afferent and enteric nerves and induces visceral hypersensitivity.Trypsin-like activity was determined in tissues from patients with IBS and in supernatants of Caco-2 cells stimulated or not. These supernatants were also applied to cultures of primary afferents. mRNA isoforms of trypsin (,  and ) were detected by reverse transcription-PCR, and trypsin-3 protein expression was studied by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Electrophysiological recordings and Ca imaging in response to trypsin-3 were performed in mouse primary afferent and in human submucosal neurons, respectively. Visceromotor response to colorectal distension was recorded in mice administered intracolonically with trypsin-3.We showed that stimulated intestinal epithelial cells released trypsin-like activity specifically from the basolateral side. This activity was able to activate sensory neurons. In colons of patients with IBS, increased trypsin-like activity was associated with the . We identified that trypsin-3 was the only form of trypsin upregulated in stimulated intestinal epithelial cells and in tissues from patients with IBS. Trypsin-3 was able to signal to human submucosal enteric neurons and mouse sensory neurons, and to induce visceral hypersensitivity in vivo, all by a protease-activated receptor-2-dependent mechanism.In IBS, the intestinal  produces and releases the active protease trypsin-3, which is able to signal to enteric neurons and to induce visceral hypersensitivity.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Interactions between the  microbiota and mucosal immunity are considered to be a crucial etiology. Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), prebiotics have been reported as activators of the  microbiota.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kestose, the smallest FOS and FOS on atopic dermatitis in mice.An AD mouse model was developed by (ovalbumin) epidermal sensitization using BALB/c mice. Kestose (1%, %, and 10%) or FOS (%, positive control) was orally administered throughout the study.In comparison with the values observed for the control AD mice, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), clinical score, and skin inflammation on histopathology were significantly decreased by the oral administration of kestose. Total IgE, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in skin, and IL-4 were also suppressed by this administration. In addition, the population of CD4Foxp3 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and acetate concentrations in feces were significantly increased by kestose treatment.These findings suggest that kestose activates the  immune system to induce the tolerance against allergic skin inflammations in AD.Copyright © 2017 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

One of the best characterized is  (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor ) and evidence suggests that + cells in the  are the origin of gastrointestinal cancers. Reserve or facultative stem or progenitor cells with the ability to convert to + cells following injury have also been identified. Unlike the intestine, where + cells at the crypt base act as active stem cells, the stomach may contain unique stem cell populations, since gastric + cells seem to behave as a reserve rather than active stem cells, both in the corpus and in the antral glands. Gastrointestinal stem cells are supported by a specific microenvironment, the stem cell niche, which also promotes tumorigenesis. This review focuses on stem cell markers in the  and their supporting niche factors. It also discusses the molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell function and tumorigenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28217700>The multiple antibacterial activities of the bladder .</a></h2><p>The urinary tract is subject to frequent challenges from the  microflora. Indeed, up to 40% of women will experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime. Uropathogenic  (UPEC) contribute to an overwhelming majority of these cases and they typically initiate UTIs by invading the superficial  that lines the bladder lumen. In addition to serving as an effective barrier to noxious agents found in urine, bladder epithelial cells (BECs) play a key physiological role in regulating bladder volume to accommodate urine flow. UPEC appear to coopt this latter property to circumvent this normally impregnable epithelial barrier. However, in spite of this shortcoming, recent studies suggest that BECs possess several immune mechanisms to combat bacterial invasion including expulsion of invading bacteria back into the bladder lumen following infection. These antibacterial activities of BECs are triggered and coordinated by sensory molecules located on the epithelial cell membrane and within the cells. Although, they are the primary targets of microbial attack, BECs appear to be equipped with a diverse repertoire of defense schemes to fend off many of these microbial challenges.</p></html>
