However, its etiology remains incompletely understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal plasticity is involved in neonatal maternal separation (NMS)-induced visceral hypersensitivity in adult rats, and whether NGF antagonist can attenuate or block such development. In our experiments, animals subjected to NMS were developed with visceral hyperalgesia at age of 8 weeks. The threshold for visceral pain among these NMS rats was remarkably lowered than that of the normal handling (NH) rats; however, the expression levels of NGF, c-fos, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), Substance P, and  kinases A (TrkA) were notably elevated in lumbosacral spinal cord and/or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) when comparing to those of the NH rats. Further, as intra-peritoneal administration of NGF (10 μl at 1 μg/kg/day) was given to NH rats during neonatal period, effects that comparable to NMS induction were observed in the adulthood. In contrast, when NMS rats were treated with NGF antagonist K252a (10 μl/day from postnatal days 2-14), which acts against  kinases, the neonatal stress-induced down-shifted visceral pain threshold was restored and neuronal activation, specifically NGF and neuropeptide production, was attenuated. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that NGF triggers neuronal plasticity and plays a crucial role in NMS-induced visceral hypersensitivity in which NGF antagonism provides positive inhibition via blocking the  phosphorylation of TrkA.© 2011 European Federation of International Association for the Study of Pain Chapters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30016408>Plasma Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Metabolomics Discriminates Between High and Low Endoscopic Activity and Predicts Progression in a Prospective Cohort of Patients With Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>Endoscopic assessment of ulcerative colitis [UC] is one of the most accurate measures of  activity, but frequent endoscopic investigations are disliked by patients and expensive for the healthcare system. A minimally invasive test that provides a surrogate measure of endoscopic activity is required.Plasma nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectra from 40 patients with UC followed prospectively over 6 months were analysed with multivariate statistics. NMR metabolite profiles were compared with endoscopic [Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity: UCEIS], histological [Nancy Index] and clinical [Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index: SCCAI] severity indices, along with routine blood measurements.A blinded principal component analysis spontaneously separated metabolite profiles of patients with low [≤3] and high [>3] UCEIS. Orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis identified low and high UCEIS metabolite profiles with an accuracy of 77 ± 5%. Plasma metabolites driving discrimination included decreases in lipoproteins and increases in isoleucine, valine, glucose and myo-inositol in high compared to low UCEIS. This same metabolite profile distinguished between low [Nancy 0-1] and high histological activity [Nancy 3-4] with a modest although significant accuracy [65 ± 6%] but was independent of SCCAI and all blood parameters measured. A different metabolite profile, dominated by changes in lysine, histidine, phenylalanine and , distinguished between improvement in UCEIS [decrease ≥1] and worsening [increase ≥1] over 6 months with an accuracy of 74 ± 4%.Plasma NMR metabolite analysis has the potential to provide a low-cost, minimally invasive technique that may be a surrogate for endoscopic assessment, with predictive capacity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22198550>Comparative proteomics analysis of serum proteins in ulcerative colitis patients.</a></h1><p>In the present study, we investigated the differentially expressed proteins associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) using proteomic methods. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technology was performed to separate the total proteins of ulcerative tissues from those of the normal tissues of UC patients. PDQuest software was applied to analyze the obtained 2-DE images. Candidate protein spots between the two groups were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis. The well resolution and reproducible 2-DE patterns of UC and normal tissues were established. Of the 12 differentially expressed proteins, 9 were successfully identified, of which 6 proteins were up-regulated including apolipoprotein C-III, haptoglobin, receptor  kinase, aldehyde reductase, pericentriolar material 1, and heat shock factor protein 2, and 3 were down-regulated including keratin, filamin A-interacting protein 1, and tropomyosin 3. These identified proteins were related to hormonal modulation, immune response, oxidative stress, and signal conduction. The 2-DE protein expression profile of the UC tissues displays an obvious difference from that of the normal controls. Various proteins may be involved in the occurrence of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29272492>Genetic and Pharmacological Dissection of the Role of Spleen  Kinase (Syk) in Intestinal Inflammation and Immune Dysfunction in .</a></h1><p>The DNAX adaptor protein 12 (DAP12) is a transmembrane adaptor molecule that signals through the activation of Syk (Spleen  Kinase) in myeloid cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of DAP12 and Syk pathways in  (IBDs).DAP12 deficient and DAP12 transgenic, overexpressing an increased amount of DAP12, mice and Syk deficient mice in the C57/BL6 background were used for these studies. Colitis was induced by administering mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), in drinking water, or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), by intrarectal enema.Abundant expression of DAP12 and Syk was detected in colon samples obtained from Crohn's  patients with expression restricted to immune cells infiltrating the colonic wall. In rodents development of DSS colitis as measured by assessing severity of wasting , global colitis score,and macroscopic and histology scores was robustly attenuated in DAP12-/- and Syk-/- mice. In contrast, DAP12 overexpression resulted in a striking exacerbation of colon damage caused by DSS. Induction of colon expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to DSS administration was attenuated in DAP12-/- and Syk-/- mice, whereas opposite results were observed in DAP12 transgenic mice. Treating wild-type mice with a DAP-12 inhibitor or a Syk inhibitor caused a robust attenuation of colitis induced by DSS and TNBS.DAP12 and Syk are essential mediators in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction in murine colitides. Because DAP12 and Syk expression is upregulated in patients with active , present findings suggest a beneficial role for DAP12 and Syk inhibitors in IBD.© 2017 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America.

The anti- role of PTPN2 is highlighted by the fact that PTPN2-deficient mice die a few weeks after birth because of systemic inflammation and severe colitis. However, the tissues, cells, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to this phenotype remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that myeloid cell-specific deletion of PTPN2 in mice (PTPN2-LysMCre) promotes intestinal inflammation but protects from colitis-associated tumor formation in an IL-1β-dependent manner. Elevated levels of mature IL-1β production in PTPN2-LysMCre mice are a consequence of increased inflammasome assembly due to elevated phosphorylation of the inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Thus, we have identified a dual role for myeloid PTPN2 in directly regulating inflammasome activation and IL-1β production to suppress pro- responses during colitis but promote intestinal tumor development.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Preliminary studies have shown higher levels of antibodies in sera from CD patients against secreted protein from MAP within human macrophages when compared to healthy controls. The immunogenicity of this protein in CD patients under different treatment regimes was evaluated.Sera of 110 CD patients, 82 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 150 healthy controls were collected and the presence of antibodies against the mycobacterial protein  phosphatase PtpA was assayed using ELISA.A statistically significant difference in the level of antibodies against PtpA was measured in untreated CD patients versus healthy controls, but variation in the antibody levels was observed when patients were subjected to different treatment regimens. UC patients showed no differences in the levels of antibodies against PtpA when compared to healthy controls.CD patients under different drug treatments show a clear difference in the levels of antibodies against a protein secreted by MAP, suggesting that if MAP is active in the progress of CD, some treatments can be detrimental to its survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704524>A CD3-specific antibody reduces cytokine production and alters phosphoprotein profiles in intestinal tissues from patients with .</a></h1><p>T cells mediate the development of inflammation in  (IBD). We investigated the effects of an antibody against CD3 called otelixizumab, which induces immune tolerance, in intestinal mucosa samples from patients.Intestinal tissues were isolated from patients undergoing routine endoscopy or from patients undergoing intestinal surgery for colon cancer or IBD; healthy surrounding tissues were collected as controls. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) and mucosal tissue explants were incubated with otelixizumab for 24 or 48 hours. Production of  cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of 36 cytokines and chemokines and phosphorylation of 39 receptor  kinases and signaling molecules were measured using protein arrays. Immunoblot analysis was used to analyze T-cell transcription factors.Incubation of intestinal tissues or LPMCs with otelixizumab reduced production of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-17A, and other  cytokines and chemokines, simultaneously increasing production of IL-10. Mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with IBD retained inflammation-associated  phosphoprotein profiles ex vivo. Incubation of the inflamed tissue with otelixizumab reduced phosphorylation of these proteins to levels observed in control tissues. Otelixizumab also markedly reduced phosphorylation of proteins associated with T-cell receptor activation. Neutralization of IL-10 blocked the anti- effects of otelixizumab.We observed anti- effects of anti-CD3 in inflamed intestinal tissues from patients with IBD.

(Fabaceae) has been traditionally used to treat various   such as pain in the eyes. However, the antiinflammatory mechanism of A. clypearia has not been fully elucidated. This study examined the anti- mechanism of a 95% methanol extract (Ac-ME) of A. clypearia in vitro and in vivo.The effect of Ac-ME on the production of  mediators in RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages and on symptoms of colitis in mouse induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) was investigated. Molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects were elucidated by analyzing the activation of transcription factors and their upstream signaling as well as by evaluating the kinase activity of target enzymes in vitro and in vivo.Ac-ME dose-dependently suppressed the secretion of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG)E₂ from RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Ac-ME clearly reduced mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by the blockade of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation and its upstream signaling events containing protein  kinase such as Syk and Src. In agreement with this, Ac-ME directly reduced the kinase activities of Src and Syk as well as the formation of molecular signaling complex including p85. DSS-induced colitis was also remarkably inhibited by this extract through the suppression of Src and IκBα phosphorylation.Ac-ME displays strong anti- activity in vivo by suppressing Src/Syk-mediated NF-κB activation which is linked to its ethno-pharmacological uses as an anti-gastritis remedy. Through preclinical studies, the potential therapeutic application will be tested further.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have previously shown that loss of PTPN22 results in decreased NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) activation and that this effect is mediated via enhanced NLRP3 phosphorylation. However, it is unclear how phosphorylation of NLRP3 mediates its inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that loss of macroautophagy/autophagy abrogates the inhibitory effect on NLRP3 activation observed upon loss of PTPN22. Phosphorylated, but not nonphosphorylated NLRP3 is found in autophagosomes, indicating that NLRP3 phosphorylation mediates its inactivation via promoting sequestration into phagophores, the precursors to autophagosomes. This finding shows that autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are connected, and that PTPN22 plays a key role in the regulation of those 2 pathways. Given its role in  disorders, PTPN22 might be an attractive therapeutic target, and understanding the cellular mechanisms modulated by PTPN22 is of crucial importance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26195794>Protein  phosphatase SAP-1 protects against colitis through regulation of CEACAM20 in the intestinal epithelium.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial cells contribute to regulation of intestinal immunity in mammals, but the detailed molecular mechanisms of such regulation have remained largely unknown. Stomach-cancer-associated protein  phosphatase 1 (SAP-1, also known as PTPRH) is a receptor-type protein  phosphatase that is localized specifically at microvilli of the brush border in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Here we show that SAP-1 ablation in interleukin (IL)-10-deficient mice, a model of , resulted in a marked increase in the severity of colitis in association with up-regulation of mRNAs for various cytokines and chemokines in the colon.  phosphorylation of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 20, an intestinal microvillus-specific transmembrane protein of the Ig superfamily, was greatly increased in the intestinal epithelium of the SAP-1-deficient animals, suggesting that this protein is a substrate for SAP-1.  phosphorylation of CEACAM20 by the protein  kinase c-Src and the consequent association of CEACAM20 with spleen  kinase (Syk) promoted the production of IL-8 in cultured cells through the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In addition, SAP-1 and CEACAM20 were found to form a complex through interaction of their ectodomains. SAP-1 and CEACAM20 thus constitute a regulatory system through which the intestinal epithelium contributes to intestinal immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26640333>Mucosal healing effect of nilotinib in indomethacin-induced enterocolitis: A rat model.</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of nilotinib in a rat model of indomethacin-induced enterocolitis.Twenty-one Wistar albino female rats obtained from Dokuz Eylul University Department of Laboratory Animal Science were divided into the following three groups: control (n = 7), indomethacin (n = 7) and nilotinib (n = 7). A volume of 0.25 mL of physiological serum placebo was administered to the control and indomethacin groups through an orogastric tube for 13 d. To induce enterocolitis, the indomethacin and nilotinib groups received 7.5 mL/kg indomethacin dissolved in 5% sodium bicarbonate and administered subcutaneously in a volume of 0.5 mL twice daily for three days. Nilotinib was administered 20 mg/kg/d in two divided doses to the nilotinib group of rats for 13 d through an orogastric tube, beginning on the same day as indomethacin administration. For 13 d, the rats were fed a standard diet, and their weights were monitored daily. After the rats were sacrificed, the intestinal and colonic tissue samples were examined. The macroscopic and microscopic pathology scores were evaluated. The pathologist stained all tissue samples using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling method. Mucosal crypts and apoptotic cells were quantified. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β scores assessed by immunohistochemical staining method and tissue and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Between days 1 and 13, the rats in the nilotinib and indomethacin groups lost significantly more weight than the controls (-11 g vs +14.14 g, P = 0.013; -30 g vs +14.14 g, P = 0.003). In the small intestinal and colonic tissues, the macroscopic scores were significantly lower in the nilotinib group than in the indomethacin group (1.14 ± 0.38 and 7.29 ± 2.98, P = 0.005; 1.14 ± 0.38 and 7.43 ± 2.64, P = 0.001, respectively), but the values of the nilotinib and indomethacin groups were similar to the control group. In the small intestinal and colonic tissues, the microscopic scores were significantly lower in the nilotinib group than in the indomethacin group (3.43 ± 2.99 and 7.67 ± 3.67, P = 0.043; 2.29 ± 0.76 and 8.80 ± 2.68, P = 0.003, respectively), but the values were similar to the control group. The PDGFR β scores in the small intestine and colon were significantly lower in the nilotinib group than in the indomethacin group (1.43 ± 0.79 and 2.43 ± 0.54, P = 0.021; 1.57 ± 0.54 and 3 ± 0, P =0.001), and the values were similar to controls. The colonic PDGFR α scores were significantly lower in the nilotinib group than in the indomethacin group (1.71 ± 0.49 and 3 ± 0, P = 0.001). The colonic apoptosis scores were significantly lower in the controls than in the nilotinib group (1.57 ± 1.13 and 4 ± 1.29, P = 0.007). Furthermore, the serum and tissue TNF-α levels were similar between the nilotinib and indomethacin groups.In the indomethacin-induced enterocolitis rat model, nilotinib has a positive effect on the macroscopic and microscopic pathologic scores, ensuring considerable mucosal healing. Nilotinib decreases PDGFR α and β levels and increases the colonic apoptotic scores, but it has no significant effects on weight loss and the TNF-α levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31227590>JAK selectivity for  treatment: does it clinically matter?</a></h1><p>The two major forms of  (IBD), encompassing Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune-mediated conditions characterised by an increased production of pro- cytokines that act as critical drivers of intestinal inflammation. Anti-cytokine therapy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in IBD. Janus kinases (JAKs) are  kinases that bind different intracellular cytokine receptors, leading to phosphorylation of signal transducer and activation of transcription molecules implicated on targeted gene transcription. Four isoforms of JAKs have been described: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Oral JAK inhibitors (JAKi) have been developed as synergic anti-cytokine therapy in IBD, showing different selectivity towards JAK isoforms. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC. With the aim of improving the benefit: risk ratio of this drug class, several second-generation subtype-selective JAKi are under development. However, whether selective inhibition of JAK isoforms is associated with an increased clinical efficacy and/or a better safety profile remains debatable. The aim of this review is to critically review the preclinical and clinical data for the differential selectivity of JAK inhibitors and to summarise the potential clinical implications of the selective JAK inhibitors under development for UC and CD.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the association of five polymorphisms of PTPN22 gene with susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) in Iran.A total of 67 patients diagnosed with UC (35 female and 32 male all under 18 years) and 93 healthy subjects were selected.

Using the CD4C/HIV-1(Nef) transgenic (Tg) mice as a model, we report that HIV-1 Nef causes depletion of total CD4(+) T cells, but preserves and relatively enriches CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). We found that Nef-mediated CD4(+) Treg enrichment is the direct result of Nef expression in CD4(+) T cells, occurs independently of Nef-induced lymphopenia, and most likely results from multiple mechanisms: lower apoptosis, enhanced cell division, and increased generation from precursors. Interestingly, Tg Treg relative enrichment could be reversed by enhancing Lck activity. Most importantly, we show that, in contrast to Tg helper CD4(+) T cells that have lost their function, Nef-expressing CD4(+) Treg retain their regulatory function in vitro and also in vivo, under some settings. In particular, we found that Treg prevent expansion of Tg B and non-Treg T cells in vivo. Our study reveals that Nef affects distinct CD4(+) T cell subsets differently and uncovers the high proliferative potential of B and non-Treg T cells in this mouse model.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27115526>Deficiency of Protein  Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 2 in Intestinal Epithelial Cells Has No Appreciable Impact on Dextran Sulphate Sodium Colitis Severity But Promotes Wound Healing.</a></h1><p>The protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) is known to mediate susceptibility to . Cell culture experiments suggest that PTPN2 influences barrier function, autophagy and secretion of pro- cytokines. PTPN2 knockout mice die a few weeks after birth due to systemic inflammation, emphasizing the importance of this phosphatase in  processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PTPN2 in colon epithelial cells by performing dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in PTPN2xVilCre mice.Acute colitis was induced by administering 2.5 or 2% DSS for 7 days and chronic colitis by 4 cycles of treatment using 1% DSS. Body weight of mice was measured regularly and colonoscopy was done at the end of the experiments. Mice were sacrificed afterwards and colon specimens were obtained for H&amp;E staining. For analysis of wound healing, mechanical wounds were introduced during endoscopy and wound closure assessed by daily colonoscopy.Although colonoscopy and weight development suggested changes in colitis severity, the lack of any influence of PTPN2 deficiency on histological scoring for inflammation severity after acute or chronic DSS colitis indicates that colitis severity is not influenced by epithelial-specific loss of PTPN2. Chronic colitis induced the development of aberrant crypt foci more frequently in PTPN2xVilCre mice compared to their wild type littermates. On the other hand, loss of PTPN2-induced enhanced epithelial cell proliferation and promoted wound closure.Loss of PTPN2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) has no significant influence on inflammation in DSS colitis. Obviously, loss of PTPN2 in IECs can be compensated in vivo, thereby suppressing a phenotype. This lack of a colitis-phenotype might be due to enhanced epithelial cell proliferation and subsequent increased wound-healing capacity of the epithelial layer.© 2016 S.

We have recently identified a novel role for MCH in intestinal inflammation by demonstrating attenuated experimental colitis in MCH deficient mice or wild type mice treated with an anti-MCH antibody. Therefore, targeting MCH has been proposed for the treatment of . Given the link between chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer, in the present study we sought to investigate whether blocking MCH might have effects on intestinal tumorigenesis that are independent of inflammation.Tumor development was evaluated in MCH-deficient mice crossed to the APCmin mice which develop spontaneously intestinal adenomas. A different cohort of MCH-/- and MCH+/+ mice in the APCmin background was treated with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to induce inflammation-dependent colorectal tumors. In Caco2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, the role of MCH on cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis was investigated.APCmin mice lacking MCH developed fewer, smaller and less dysplastic tumors in the intestine and colon which at the molecular level are characterized by attenuated activation of the wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and increased apoptotic indices. Form a mechanistic point of view, MCH increased the survival of colonic adenocarcinoma Caco2 cells via inhibiting apoptosis, consistent with the mouse studies.In addition to modulating inflammation, MCH was found to promote intestinal tumorigenesis at least in part by inhibiting epithelial cell apoptosis. Thereby, blocking MCH as a therapeutic approach is expected to decrease the risk for colorectal cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846720>Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk receptor signaling in  and colitis-associated cancer.</a></h1><p>Three receptor  kinases, Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S, have emerged as potent negative regulators of innate immune responses. A number of studies using genetic ablation of TAM loci in mice have elucidated the mechanism of TAM engagement and function during the immune response and removal of apoptotic cells.

Injury to the intestinal mucosa can occur with infection, surgical trauma, and in idiopathic . Repair of mucosal injury, termed restitution, as well as restoration of intestinal homeostasis involves induced and coordinated proliferation and migration of intestinal epithelial cells. N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are widely expressed pattern recognition receptors that can specifically bind and induce responses to host-derived and bacterial peptides and small molecules. Here we report that specific members of the gut microbiota stimulate FPR1 on intestinal epithelial cells to generate reactive oxygen species via enterocyte NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), causing rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase. These events stimulate migration and proliferation of enterocytes adjacent to colonic wounds.

We examined the role of Wnt5a signaling in intestinal immunity using conditional knockout mice for Wnt5a and its receptor Ror2. Removing Wnt5a or Ror2 in adult mice suppressed dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. It also attenuated the DSS-dependent increase in  cytokine production and decreased interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing CD4(+) Th1 cell numbers in the colon. Wnt5a was highly expressed in stromal fibroblasts in ulcerative lesions in the DSS-treated mice and  patients. Dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from the colon of Wnt5a and Ror2 deficient mice reduced the ability to differentiate naïve CD4(+) T cells to IFN-γ-producing CD4(+) Th1 cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling axis augmented the DCs priming effect of IFN-γ, leading to enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-12 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Wnt5a promotes IFN-γ signaling, leading to IL-12 expression in DCs, and thereby inducing Th1 differentiation in colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651526>Embelin reduces colitis-associated tumorigenesis through limiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling.</a></h1><p>The interleukin-6 (IL-6)/STAT3 signaling regulates survival and proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of  and colorectal cancer. Embelin is a small molecule inhibitor of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), with antioxidant, anti-, and antitumor activities. We previously showed that embelin inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro, and effectively suppresses 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride-induced colon carcinogenesis in mice. Here, we explored the antitumor effects and mechanisms of embelin on colitis-associated cancer (CAC) using the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) model, with a particular focus on whether embelin exerts its effect through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. We found that embelin significantly reduced incidence and tumor size in CAC-bearing mice. In addition to inhibiting proliferation of tumor epithelial cells, embelin suppressed colonic IL-6 expression and secretion, and subsequently STAT3 activation in vivo. Importantly, in vitro studies have revealed that in colon cancer cells, embelin diminished both the constitutive and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation by stimulating Src homology domain 2-containing protein  phosphatase (SHP2) activity. Moreover, embelin protected mice from AOM/DSS-induced colitis before tumor development. Embelin decreased IL-1β, IL-17a, and IL-23a expression as well as the number of CD4(+) T cells and macrophages infiltrating the colonic tissues. Thus, our findings demonstrated that embelin suppresses CAC tumorigenesis, and its antitumor effect is partly mediated by limiting IL-6/STAT3 activation and Th17 immune response. Embelin may be a potential agent in the prevention and treatment of CAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24385580>Protein  phosphatase σ targets apical junction complex proteins in the intestine and regulates epithelial permeability.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase (PTP)σ (PTPRS) was shown previously to be associated with susceptibility to  (IBD). PTPσ(-/-) mice exhibit an IBD-like phenotype in the intestine and show increased susceptibility to acute models of murine colitis. However, the function of PTPσ in the intestine is uncharacterized. Here, we show an intestinal epithelial barrier defect in the PTPσ(-/-) mouse, demonstrated by a decrease in transepithelial resistance and a leaky intestinal epithelium that was determined by in vivo tracer analysis. Increased  phosphorylation was observed at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the crypts of the small  and colon of the PTPσ(-/-) mouse, suggesting the presence of PTPσ substrates in these regions. Using mass spectrometry, we identified several putative PTPσ intestinal substrates that were hyper--phosphorylated in the PTPσ(-/-) mice relative to wild type. Among these were proteins that form or regulate the apical junction complex, including ezrin. We show that ezrin binds to and is dephosphorylated by PTPσ in vitro, suggesting it is a direct PTPσ substrate, and identified ezrin-Y353/Y145 as important sites targeted by PTPσ. Moreover, subcellular localization of the ezrin phosphomimetic Y353E or Y145 mutants were disrupted in colonic Caco-2 cells, similar to ezrin mislocalization in the colon of PTPσ(-/-) mice following induction of colitis. Our results suggest that PTPσ is a positive regulator of intestinal epithelial barrier, which mediates its effects by modulating epithelial cell adhesion through targeting of apical junction complex-associated proteins (including ezrin), a process impaired in IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776072>ToF-SIMS and principal component analysis of lipids and amino acids from inflamed and dysplastic human colonic mucosa.</a></h1><p>Here, time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and multivariate analysis were combined to study the role of ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of  (IBD), in the colon cancer progression. ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC) colon tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino acid composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, arachidonic, and linoleic acid. In the same way, differences in the amino acid composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, , methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino acid fragments. In this case, human colonic inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

Mechanisms contributing to muscle impairment, and thus potential therapeutic targets, are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure and compare skeletal muscle size and molecular targets involved in skeletal muscle growth, in CD subjects and healthy controls.CD (n=27) and healthy (n=22) subjects were recruited from the IBD outpatient clinic and via local advertisement respectively. Demographics and clinical data were collected via survey and interview. Quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area was measured using peripheral quantitative CT scanning. Levels of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy signalling targets using quantitative PCR and western blotting were measured in muscle biopsies.Muscle size was 14% lower (p=0.055) and a 54% lower phosphorylated:total (p:t) Akt ratio was measured in the muscle samples (p<0.05), indicating an attenuated muscle hypertrophy pathway in CD compared with controls. In those with CD, a lower p:t Akt ratio (<0.97) was associated with lower serum vitamin D3, lower physical activity indices (49 vs 64 mmol/L, 1.7 vs 2.2×10(6) accelerometer counts respectively, each p<0.05) and a trend towards lower serum ferritin levels (128 vs 322mg/L, p=0.07), compared with CD subjects with normal/high p:t Akt ratios.The reduced muscle mass in CD may be explained, in part, by impaired activation of muscle protein synthesis pathways, notably the IGF1-Akt pathway. Normal vitamin D levels and regular exercise may be protective in CD against this trend, though confirmatory longitudinal studies are needed.Copyright © 2013 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.

These sentinel cells rely on pattern recognition receptors such as Nod-like or Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to launch immune reactions against pathogens, but also to mediate tolerance to self-antigens and, in the intestinal milieu, to nutrients and commensals. Since inappropriate DC activation contributes to   and immunopathologies, a key question in the evaluation of orally ingested nanomaterials is whether their contact with DCs in the intestinal mucosa disrupts this delicate homeostatic balance between pathogen defense and tolerance. Here, we generated steady-state DCs by incubating hematopoietic progenitors with feline McDonough sarcoma-like  kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and used the resulting immature DCs to test potential biological responses against food-grade synthetic amorphous silica (SAS) representing a common nanomaterial generally thought to be safe.Interaction of immature and unprimed DCs with food-grade SAS particles and their internalization by endocytic uptake fails to elicit cytotoxicity and the release of interleukin (IL)-1α or tumor necrosis factor-α, which were identified as master regulators of acute inflammation in lung-related studies. However, the display of maturation markers on the cell surface shows that SAS particles activate completely immature DCs. Also, the endocytic uptake of SAS particles into these steady-state DCs leads to induction of the pro-IL-1β precursor, subsequently cleaved by the inflammasome to secrete mature IL-1β. In contrast, neither pro-IL-1β induction nor mature IL-1β secretion occurs upon internalization of TiO or FePO nanoparticles. The pro-IL-1β induction is suppressed by pharmacologic inhibitors of endosomal TLR activation or by genetic ablation of MyD88, a downstream adapter of TLR pathways, indicating that endosomal pattern recognition is responsible for the observed cytokine response to food-grade SAS particles.Our results unexpectedly show that food-grade SAS particles are able to directly initiate the endosomal MyD88-dependent pathogen pattern recognition and signaling pathway in steady-state DCs. The ensuing activation of immature DCs with de novo induction of pro-IL-1β implies that the currently massive use of SAS particles as food additive should be reconsidered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25452553>THEMIS is required for pathogenesis of cerebral malaria and protection against pulmonary tuberculosis.</a></h1><p>We identify an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced I23N mutation in the THEMIS protein that causes protection against experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Themis(I23N) homozygous mice show reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte numbers. ECM resistance in P. berghei ANKA-infected Themis(I23N) mice is associated with decreased cerebral cellular infiltration, retention of blood-brain barrier integrity, and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production. THEMIS(I23N) protein expression is absent from mutant mice, concurrent with the decreased THEMIS(I23N) stability observed in vitro. Biochemical studies in vitro and functional complementation in vivo in Themis(I23N/+):Lck(-/+) doubly heterozygous mice demonstrate that functional coupling of THEMIS to LCK  kinase is required for ECM pathogenesis. Damping of proinflammatory responses in Themis(I23N) mice causes susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, THEMIS is required for the development and ultimately the function of proinflammatory T cells. Themis(I23N) mice can be used to study the newly discovered association of THEMIS (6p22.33) with  and multiple sclerosis.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Flavonoids have demonstrated radical-scavenging and anti- activities. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of BJe in mice subjected to experimental colitis.Colitis was induced in mice by intracolonic instillation of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS). BJe was administered daily orally (at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg).Four days after DNBS administration, colon nuclear factor NF-κB translocation and MAP kinase phospho-JNK activation were increased as well as cytokine production such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. Neutrophil infiltration, by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, in the mucosa was associated with up-regulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and P-selectin). Immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine and poly ADP-ribose (PAR) also showed an intense staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with BJe decreased the appearance of diarrhea and body weight loss. This was associated with a reduction in colonic MPO activity. BJe reduced nuclear NF-κB translocation, p-JNK activation, the pro- cytokines release, the appearance of nitrotyrosine and PAR in the colon and reduced the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. In addition, colon inflammation was also associated with apoptotic damage. Treatment with BJe caused a decrease of pro-apoptotic Bax expression and an increase of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression.The results of this study suggested that administration of BJe induced, partly specified, anti- mechanisms, which potentially may be beneficial for the treatment of IBD in humans.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

SCFA (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) are formed by the anaerobic carbohydrates fermentation and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA), such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, are derived from amino acids valine and leucine. Phenylcarboxylic acids (PCA), such as phenylacetic acid (PAA), phenyipropionic acid (PPA), phenyllactic acid (PLA) and some other acids, are metabolites of amino acids phenylalanine and  involved in host adaptation and regulation. ma unique experiment, the authors first examined effect of the carboxylic acids on host cell proliferation in organotypic tissue cultures (rat spleen explants). The study showed that almost all biogenic aliphatic carboxylic acids have a positive effect on cell proliferation in rat spleen tissue. This fundamentally distinguishes them from amino acids, many of which have an inhibitory effect at the same concentrations. These findings suggest that SCFA, including hydrox~ and oxo derivatives, can act as positive regulators of host immune tissues. Some SCFA (for example, butyric acid), stimulate proliferation of normal host cells (immune tissue, intestinal epithelium), but inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells ('butyrate paradox'). Unlike SCFA, phenylcarboxylic acids have a negative effect on host immune tissues explants and induce apoptosis. These data confirm the potential contribution of phenylcarboxylic acids in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders associated with impaired immune response, including autoimmune . The authors suggest that PCA may serve as early metabolic markers of sepsis, immune-related  and chronic inflammation, such as  (iBD), colorectal cancer, chronic kidney  and liver, secondary imrnunodeficiency. It can be assumed that carboxylic acids are evolutionary precursors of amino acids that have a wide variety of functions and able to modulate not only proliferation but also apoptosis. The results agree well with the data obtained in the study of Actoflor-C (microbial metabolites complex) and can be used to study mechanisms of action of probiotic strains and metabiotics (e.g. butyrate and propionate-containing formulations), as well as for the development of innovative medicines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23295687>: dysfunction of autophagy?</a></h1><p>Recent genome-wide association studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms within gene loci, encoding autophagy genes, e.g. the autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) and the immunity-related GTPase family M (IRGM), as an important risk factor for the onset of chronic   such as Crohn's  (CD) or rheumatoid arthritis. CD is characterized by a breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier function leading to an overwhelming and uncontrolled immune response to bacterial antigens. Autophagy, and therefore ATG16L1 and IRGM, are critically involved in the innate immune response to invading pathogens. Dysfunction of these molecules results in the increased survival of intracellular bacteria, defective antigen presentation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Interestingly, autophagy can also be regulated by other CD susceptibility genes, such as nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 or protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 2, and the presence of the CD-associated variations within these genes results in comparable effects. ATG16L1 also plays a crucial role in maintaining Paneth cell function and morphology, while IRGM seems to be associated with mitochondrial function and apoptosis. Dysfunction of these molecules, i.e. of autophagy in vivo, is clearly associated with the increased bacterial infection and the onset of colitis. Interestingly, the phenotype of aberrant Paneth cells and dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis in ATG16L1 hypomorphic mice closely resembles human CD. Taken together, the available data strongly suggest an important role for autophagy in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and dysfunction of autophagy seems to be a major risk factor for the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation.Copyright © 2012 S.

A meta-analysis was conducted using 23 comparative studies with a total of 16,719 patients and 17,783 controls. The meta-analysis showed an association between the A allele of the PTPN22 G788A polymorphism and decreased risk of autoimmune  in all subjects (p &lt; 0.001). Analysis after stratification by ethnicity indicated that the PTPN22 788A allele was significantly associated with autoimmune  in Europeans (p &lt; 0.001) but not in Latin Americans.

We investigated whether PTPN2 genetic variants (rs2542151 and rs2542152) were associated with CD in a familial IBD registry. Both rs2542151 and rs2542152 are associated with CD, but not ulcerative colitis (UC). mRNA expression levels of PTPN2 were significantly increased in intestinal tissues (p=0.0493), and nearly significantly increased in B cells (p=0.0889) from CD patients, but not significantly altered in UC. cDNA microarray results found that PTPN2 was down-regulated by NKX2-3 knockdown in human cells. We confirmed this observation by RT-PCR analyses in NKX2-3 knockdown in B cells from IBD patients and human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC). In addition, we found that mRNA expression of another IBD-associated gene, NKX2-3, was increased in intestinal tissues and B cells from CD patients, but not significantly increased in UC patients. A positive correlation was observed between mRNA expression of PTPN2 and NKX2-3 in B cells and in intestinal tissues from both CD and UC patients.

Uveitis occurs with varying frequency according to the SpA subtype (33% in AS, 6-9% in PsA, 25% in ReA, 13% in undifferentiated SpA and 2-5% in IBD), the presence of HLA-B27 and with increasing duration of . The majority of cases of uveitis in SpA are attributed to acute anterior uveitis but a minority of uveitis cases occur in the posterior segment of the eye. The latter are more frequently complicated by cystoid macular oedema (CMO) and sight loss. The nature of the tissue specificity exhibited by the SpAs is poorly understood. Three current investigational approaches are discussed: high-throughput genomics to identify and confirm uveitis-specific susceptibility alleles; investigation of the role of the intestinal microbiome and its potential role in innate immune signalling in uveitis; and study of a novel IL23R-bearing cell population in several entheseal sites including the eye. The treatment for uveitis in SpAs is predominantly with topical corticosteroids for acute episodes. Among the systemic drugs used for the treatment of SpAs, infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab are effective in reducing the frequency of uveitis but etanercept is not. Other targets in spondyloarthropathy include cytokines within the IL23/IL17 axis, of which the IL17A inhibitor secukinumab has not been shown to be effective in uveitis. Future therapeutic approaches may include small molecules such as selective and non-selective janus kinase and  kinase inhibitors.Copyright © 2018.

Here, we genetically fine-map the RA risk locus at 19p13 to define causal variants, and explore the pleiotropic effects of these same variants in other complex traits. First, we combined Immunochip dense genotyping (n = 23,092 case/control samples), Exomechip genotyping (n = 18,409 case/control samples) and targeted exon-sequencing (n = 2,236 case/controls samples) to demonstrate that three protein-coding variants in TYK2 ( kinase 2) independently protect against RA: P1104A (rs34536443, OR = 0.66, P = 2.3 x 10(-21)), A928V (rs35018800, OR = 0.53, P = 1.2 x 10(-9)), and I684S (rs12720356, OR = 0.86, P = 4.6 x 10(-7)). Second, we show that the same three TYK2 variants protect against systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, Pomnibus = 6 x 10(-18)), and provide suggestive evidence that two of the TYK2 variants (P1104A and A928V) may also protect against  (IBD; P(omnibus) = 0.005). Finally, in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) assessing >500 phenotypes using electronic medical records (EMR) in >29,000 subjects, we found no convincing evidence for association of P1104A and A928V with complex phenotypes other than autoimmune  such as RA, SLE and IBD.

Although the isolated FimH lectin domain has affinities in the nanomolar range for all high-mannosidic glycans, differentiation between these glycans is based on their capacity to form predominantly hydrophobic interactions within the  gate at the entrance to the binding pocket. In this study, novel crystal structures of -gate mutants of FimH, ligand-free or in complex with heptyl α-d--mannopyranoside or 4-biphenyl α-d-mannopyranoside, are combined with quantum-mechanical calculations and molecular-dynamics simulations. In the Y48A FimH crystal structure, a large increase in the dynamics of the alkyl chain of heptyl α-d--mannopyranoside attempts to compensate for the absence of the aromatic ring; however, the highly energetic and stringent mannose-binding pocket of wild-type FimH is largely maintained. The Y137A mutation, on the other hand, is the most detrimental to FimH affinity and specificity: (i) in the absence of ligand the FimH C-terminal residue Thr158 intrudes into the mannose-binding pocket and (ii) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid interacts strongly with Glu50, Thr53 and Asn136, in spite of multiple dialysis and purification steps. Upon mutation, pre-ligand-binding relaxation of the backbone dihedral angles at position 137 in the  gate and their coupling to Tyr48  the interiorly located Ile52 form the basis of the loss of affinity of the FimH adhesin in the Y137A mutant.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22671596>Regulation of epithelial barrier function by the  candidate gene, PTPN2.</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2) has been identified as an  (IBD) candidate gene. However, the mechanism through which mutations in the PTPN2 gene contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD has not been identified. PTPN2 acts as a negative regulator of signaling induced by the proinflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). IFN-γ is known not only to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's  (CD), but also to increase permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier. We have shown that PTPN2 protects epithelial barrier function by restricting the capacity of IFN-γ to increase epithelial permeability and prevent induction of expression of the pore-forming protein, claudin-2.

There are three main clinical settings in which Sweet's syndrome has been described: classical or idiopathic Sweet's syndrome, malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome and drug-induced Sweet's syndrome. Classical Sweet's is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and may be associated with  and pregnancy. Approximately 21% of patients have an associated malignancy, most commonly hematological . The syndrome may occur as a paraneoplastic accompaniment to established cancer or may be a first sign of malignancy or its recurrence. The incidence is said to be increasing in recent years due to the frequent use of growth factors in cancer patients. Several anticancer agents including all-trans-retinoic acid proteosome inhibitors, hypomethylating agents,  kinase inhibitors and lenalidomide are potential harbingers of Sweet's syndrome. Unfortunately, little is known about the pathophysiology of Sweet's syndrome and there are no established guidelines for treatment of malignancy-associated Sweet's syndrome. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment. Sweet's syndrome caused by anticancer agents sometimes involves withdrawal or temporary discontinuation of anticancer agents, use of systemic corticosteroids and/or rechallenge with either with the same anticancer agents or different agents.

CD47, a widely expressed transmembrane protein, is a ligand for SIRPα, with the two proteins constituting a cell-cell communication system. It was previously demonstrated that the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway is important for prevention of clearance by splenic macrophages of red blood cells or platelets from the bloodstream. In addition, this signaling pathway is also implicated in homeostatic regulation of dendritic cells and development of autoimmunity. Here we describe the detailed protocols for methods that were used in our recent studies to study the role of the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway in autoimmunity. We also demonstrate that hematopoietic SIRPα as well as nonhematopoietic CD47 are important for development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

These processes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of -based disorders of the gut, like  (IBDs). Accordingly, our aim was to investigate the role of the EphB/ephrin-B system in intestinal inflammation by assessing the local and systemic effects produced by its pharmacological manipulation in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)- (Th1-dependent model) and dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)- (innate response model) induced colitis in mice. To this purpose, we administered chimeric Fc-conjugated proteins, allegedly able to uni-directionally activate either forward (ephrin-B1-Fc) or reverse (EphB1-Fc) signaling, and the soluble monomeric EphB4 extracellular domain protein, that, simultaneously interfering with both signaling pathways, acts as EphB/ephrin-B antagonist.The blockade of the EphB/ephrin-B forward signaling by EphB4 and EphB1-Fc was ineffective against DSS-induced colitis while it evoked remarkable beneficial effects against TNBS colitis: it counteracted all the evaluated  responses and the changes elicited on splenic T lymphocytes subpopulations, without preventing the appearance of a splice variant of ephrin-B2 gene elicited by the haptenating agent in the colon. Interestingly, EphB4, preferentially displacing EphB4/ephrin-B2 interaction over EphB1/ephrin-B1 binding, was able to promote Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) release by splenic mononuclear cells . On the whole, the collected results point to a potential role of the EphB/ephrin-B system as a pharmacological target in intestinal  disorders and suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of its blockade seemingly works through the modulation of immune responses, independent of the changes at the transcriptional and translational level of EphB4 and ephrin-B2 genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372858>Exploration of the therapeutic aspects of Lck: A kinase target in  mediated pathological conditions.</a></h1><p>Lck, a non-receptor src family kinase, plays a vital role in various cellular processes such as cell cycle control, cell adhesion, motility, proliferation and differentiation.

Physiologically, Lck is involved in the development, function and differentiation of T-cells. Additionally, Lck regulates neurite outgrowth and maintains long-term synaptic plasticity in neurons. Given a major role of Lck in cytokine production and T cell signaling, alteration in expression and activity of Lck may result in various diseased conditions like cancer, asthma, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,  such as Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis, atherosclerosis etc. This article provides evidence and information establishing Lck as one of the therapeutic targets in various inflammation mediated pathophysiological conditions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We identified seven other TYK2-deficient patients from five families and four different ethnic groups. These patients were homozygous for one of five null mutations, different from that seen in P1. They displayed mycobacterial and/or viral infections, but no HIES. All eight TYK2-deficient patients displayed impaired but not abolished cellular responses to (a) IL-12 and IFN-α/β, accounting for mycobacterial and viral infections, respectively; (b) IL-23, with normal proportions of circulating IL-17(+) T cells, accounting for their apparent lack of mucocutaneous candidiasis; and (c) IL-10, with no overt clinical consequences, including a lack of . Cellular responses to IL-21, IL-27, IFN-γ, IL-28/29 (IFN-λ), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were normal. The leukocytes and fibroblasts of all seven newly identified TYK2-deficient patients, unlike those of P1, responded normally to IL-6, possibly accounting for the lack of HIES in these patients. The expression of exogenous wild-type TYK2 or the silencing of endogenous TYK2 did not rescue IL-6 hyporesponsiveness, suggesting that this phenotype was not a consequence of the TYK2 genotype. The core clinical phenotype of TYK2 deficiency is mycobacterial and/or viral infections, caused by impaired responses to IL-12 and IFN-α/β. Moreover, impaired IL-6 responses and HIES do not appear to be intrinsic features of TYK2 deficiency in humans.© 2015 Kreins et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29029005>Biopsy-derived Intestinal Epithelial Cell Cultures for Pathway-based Stratification of Patients With .</a></h1><p>Endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress was shown to be pivotal in the pathogenesis of . Despite progress in  [IBD] drug development, not more than one-third of patients achieve steroid-free remission and mucosal healing with current therapies. Furthermore, patient stratification tools for therapy selection are lacking. We aimed to identify and quantify epithelial ER stress in a patient-specific manner in an attempt towards personalised therapy.A biopsy-derived intestinal epithelial cell culture system was developed and characterised. ER stress was induced by thapsigargin and quantified with a BiP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] of cell lysates from 35 patients with known genotypes, who were grouped based on the number of IBD-associated ER stress and autophagy risk alleles.The epithelial character of the cells was confirmed by E-cadherin, ZO-1, and MUC2 staining and CK-18, CK-20, and LGR5 gene expression. Patients with three risk alleles had higher median epithelial BiP-induction [vs untreated] levels compared with patients with one or two risk alleles [p = 0.026 and 0.043, respectively]. When autophagy risk alleles were included and patients were stratified in genetic risk quartiles, patients in Q2, Q3, and Q4 had significantly higher ER stress [BiP] when compared with Q1 [p = 0.034, 0.040, and 0.034, respectively].We developed and validated an ex vivo intestinal epithelial cell culture system and showed that patients with more ER stress and autophagy risk alleles have augmented epithelial ER stress responses. We thus presented a personalised approach whereby patient-specific defects can be identified, which in turn could help in selecting tailored therapies.Copyright © 2017 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Identification of novel, noninvasive, diagnostic biomarkers remains a priority. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of fecal amino acid composition as diagnostic biomarker for pediatric IBD.In this case-control study, treatment-naïve, de novo pediatric patients with IBD from two tertiary centers were included. Endoscopic severity of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) was based on physician global assessment scores, substantiated by levels of fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein at study inclusion. Patients were instructed to collect a fecal sample prior to  cleansing. Healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from primary schools in the same region. Dedicated amino acid analysis was performed on all samples.Significant differences between 30 IBD patients (15 UC, 15 CD) and 15 age and sex-matched HCs were found in six amino acids (histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, , and valine; all area under the curve >0.75 and P < 0.005), displaying higher levels in IBD. When distributing the patients according to type of IBD, a similar spectrum of amino acids differed between UC and HC (histidine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, and serine), whereas three amino acids were different between CD and HC (histidine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine).Significantly increased levels of six different fecal amino acids were found in patients with IBD compared to controls. Whether these differences reflect decreased absorption or increased loss by inflamed intestines needs to be elucidated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29889418>METABOLIC DYSBIOSIS OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA AND ITS BIOMARKERS.</a></h1><p>Existing methods of clustering of gut microbiota (enterotypes, clusters, gradients), as well as the term 'phylogenetic core' do not reflect its functional activity. The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human  is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly deoxycholic acid). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to  (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular . Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and  derivatives (phenyl carboxylic acid, p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic acid, indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS.

Fungi are important components of the intestinal microflora. The potential role of fungi, and in particular their cell wall component β-glucan, in modulating human intestinal epithelial responses is still unclear. Here we examined whether human IECs are capable of recognizing and responding to β-glucans, and the potential mechanisms of their activation. We show that human IECs freshly isolated from surgical specimens, and the human IEC lines HT-29 and SW480, express the β-glucan receptor Dectin-1. The β-glucan-consisting glycans curdlan and zymosan stimulated IL-8 and CCL2 secretion by IEC lines. This was significantly inhibited by a Dectin-1 blockade using its soluble antagonist laminarin. Spleen  kinase (Syk), a signaling mediator of Dectin-1 activation, is expressed in human IECs. β-glucans and Candida albicans induced Syk phosphorylation, and Syk inhibition significantly decreased β-glucan-induced chemokine secretion from IECs. Thus, IECs may respond to β-glucans by the secretion of pro- chemokines in a Dectin-1- and Syk-dependent pathway, via receptors and a signaling pathway described to date only for myeloid cells. These findings highlight the importance of fungi-IEC interactions in intestinal inflammation.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Leukocyte myeloperoxidase (MPO) produces the two-electron oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), damaging tissue and playing a role in cellular recruitment, thereby exacerbating gut injury. We tested whether the MPO-inhibitor, 4-Methoxy-TEMPO (MetT), ameliorates experimental IBD. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 3% w/v dextran-sodium-sulfate (DSS) in drinking water ad libitum over 9-days with MetT (15 mg/kg; via i. p. injection) or vehicle control (10% v/v DMSO+90% v/v phosphate buffered saline) administered twice daily during DSS challenge. MetT attenuated body-weight loss (50%, p < 0.05, n = 6), improved clinical score (53%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and inhibited serum lipid peroxidation. Histopathological damage decreased markedly in MetT-treated mice, as judged by maintenance of crypt integrity, goblet cell density and decreased cellular infiltrate. Colonic Ly6C, MPO-labelled cells and 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr) decreased in MetT-treated mice, although biomarkers for nitrosative stress (3-nitro--; 3-NO-Tyr) and low-molecular weight thiol damage (assessed as glutathione sulfonamide; GSA) were unchanged. Interestingly, MetT did not significantly impact colonic IL-10 and IL-6 levels, suggesting a non-immunomodulatory pathway. Overall, MetT ameliorated the severity of experimental IBD, likely via a mechanism involving the modulation of MPO-mediated damage.Copyright © 2019.

The mechanisms underlying such disorders are still largely unknown, although the occurrence of a   condition has been hypothesized. This study examined the impact of central dopaminergic degeneration, induced by intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), on distal colonic excitatory tachykininergic motility in rats.Animals were euthanized 4 and 8 weeks after 6-OHDA injection. Tachykininergic contractions, elicited by electrical stimulation or exogenous substance P (SP), were recorded in vitro from longitudinal muscle colonic preparations. SP, tachykininergic NK1 receptor, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, as well as the density of eosinophils and mast cells in the colonic wall, were examined by immunohistochemical analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA, colorimetric assay), TNF, and IL-1β (ELISA assay) levels were also examined. The polarization of peritoneal macrophages was evaluated by real-time PCR.In colonic preparations, electrically and SP-evoked tachykininergic contractions were increased in 6-OHDA rats. Immunohistochemistry displayed an increase in SP and GFAP levels in the myenteric plexus, as well as NK1 receptor expression in the colonic muscle layer of 6-OHDA rats. MDA, TNF, and IL-1β levels were increased also in colonic tissues from 6-OHDA rats. In 6-OHDA rats, the number of eosinophils and mast cells was increased as compared with control animals, and peritoneal macrophages polarized towards a pro- phenotype.The results indicate that the induction of central nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration is followed by  inflammation associated with increased oxidative stress, increase in pro- cytokine levels, activation of enteric glia and  cells, and enhancement of colonic excitatory tachykininergic motility.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25531352>New therapeutic avenues for treatment of fibrosis: can we learn from other ?</a></h1><p>Crohn's  (CD) is characterized by the frequent occurrence of complications, such as fibrotic strictures and subsequently the need for CD-related surgery. Chronic or recurrent inflammation is generally regarded to be a necessary precondition for the initiation of intestinal fibrosis. In this view, fibrosis is a pathologically augmented healing response to inflammation-induced mucosal tissue destruction and injury. At present, there are no approved or effective medical therapies aimed specifically at fibrosis or stricture in IBD. Indirect benefits may occur from anti- therapies, although there is no consensus on this. Therapy for fibrosis is complicated by the fact that a wound-healing response is essential in CD and ulcerative colitis. Several pharmaceutical companies are now working on the therapy of fibrosis in other . Strategies interfering with TGF-β expression and activation are promising. Pirfenidone has been studied in several clinical trials. Further therapeutic options are second-generation and wide-spectrum  kinase inhibitors. These inhibit growth factor receptor signaling, thus reducing fibrosis in animal models and some patients with tumor-associated fibrosis. At present, the development of antifibrotic therapies takes place in other  such as lung and liver fibrosis. This is partially due to a lack of experimental models for gut fibrosis and the fact that reliable readouts (MRI, serum markers) in patients are lacking.

Here, the protective effect and its mechanism of tryptophan administration on dextran sulfate sodium -induced colitis in mice was studied.Twenty C57black6 female mice were equally divided into the control group, and treatment group. The control group received a standard CE-2 diet, while the tryptophan group received a CE-2 diet containing 0.5% l-tryptophan. After one week on this diet, all mice were orally administered a solution of 3.5% dextran sulfate sodium for 12 days to induce colitis. Changes in body weight and bloody stool frequency were monitored during dextran sulfate sodium administration. At 12 days post initial dextran sulfate sodium administration, all mice were sacrificed and the histology of their colonic tissue was examined. The nitrotyrosine levels in colonic tissues in both groups, and nitrate and nitrite levels in the urine of the control group, the tryptophan group and the group of mice without dextran sulfate sodium administration was measured.The tryptophan group showed significantly attenuated body weight loss, bloody stool frequency and ameliorated histological changes of colitis. While tryptophan treatment significantly reduced nitrotyrosine level in the colonic tissues, there was no significant reduction in urine nitrate and nitrite levels compared with the (dextran sulfate sodium-induced) control group.Tryptophan treatment ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in this study.

IBD is characterized by a breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier function leading to an overwhelming and uncontrolled immune response to bacterial antigens. Recent studies demonstrated that PTPN2 regulates cytokine-induced signaling pathways, epithelial barrier function, and cytokine secretion in human intestinal cells. Dysfunction of PTPN2 is also associated with impaired autophagosome formation and defective bacterial handling in intestinal cells. All of these cellular functions have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The genetic variations within the PTPN2 gene may result in altered protein function, thereby essentially contributing to the onset and perpetuation of chronic  conditions in the intestine.© 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25972152>Role of Dopamine and D2 Dopamine Receptor in the Pathogenesis of .</a></h1><p>VEGF-induced vascular permeability and blood vessels remodeling are key features of  (IBD) pathogenesis. Dopamine through D2 receptor (D2R) inhibits VEGF/VPF-mediated vascular permeability and angiogenesis in tumor models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pathogenesis of IBD is characterized by the disturbance of dopaminergic system and D2R activity.IL-10 knockout (KO) mice and rats with iodoacetamide-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) were treated intragastrically with D2R agonists quinpirole (1 mg/100 g) or cabergoline (1 or 5 µg/100 g). Macroscopic, histologic, and clinical features of IBD, colonic vascular permeability, and angiogenesis were examined.Although colonic D2R protein increased, levels of  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter DAT decreased in both models of IBD. Treatment with quinpirole decreased the size of colonic lesions in rats with iodoacetamide-induced UC (p < 0.01) and reduced colon wet weight in IL-10 KO mice (p < 0.05). Quinpirole decreased colonic vascular permeability (p < 0.001) via downregulation of c-Src and Akt phosphorylation. Cabergoline (5 µg/100 g) reduced vascular permeability but did not affect angiogenesis and improved signs of iodoacetamide-induced UC in rats (p < 0.05).Treatment with D2R agonists decreased the severity of UC in two animal models, in part, by attenuation of enhanced vascular permeability and prevention of excessive vascular leakage.

Whereas TLR-induced  mediators are required for pathogen clearance, many are toxic to the host and can cause pathological inflammation when over-produced. This is demonstrated by the role of TLR-induced cytokines in autoimmune , such as rheumatoid arthritis, , and systemic lupus erythematosus. Because of the potent effects of TLR-induced cytokines, we have diverse mechanisms to dampen TLR signaling. Here, we highlight three pathways that participate in inhibition of TLR responses in macrophages and DC, and their implications in autoimmunity; A20, encoded by the TNFAIP3 gene, Lyp encoded by the PTPN22 gene, and the BCAP/PI3K pathway. We present new findings that Lyp promotes TLR responses in primary human monocytes and that the autoimmunity risk Lyp620W variant is more effective at promoting TLR-induced interleukin-6 than the non-risk Lyp620R protein. This suggests that Lyp serves to downregulate a TLR inhibitory pathway in monocytes, and we propose that Lyp inhibits the TREM2/DAP12 inhibitory pathway. Overall, these pathways demonstrate distinct mechanisms of negative regulation of TLR responses, and all impact autoimmune  pathogenesis and treatment.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, their functional relevance is unknown. We thus investigated the role of epithelial SHP-2 in the control of intestinal homeostasis. Mice with an intestinal epithelial cell-specific SHP-2 deletion (SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice) were generated. Control and SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice were monitored for clinical symptoms and sacrificed for histological staining and Western blot analyses. Cytokines and chemokines, as well as intestinal permeability, were quantified. SHP-2 mRNA expression was evaluated in control and UC patients. SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice showed growth retardation compared to control littermates and rapidly developed severe colitis. Colon architecture was markedly altered with infiltration of immune cells, crypt abscesses, neutrophil accumulation, and reduced goblet cell numbers. Decreased expression of claudins was associated with enhanced intestinal permeability in mutant SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice.  transcription factors Stat3 and NF-κB were hyperactivated early in the mutant colonic epithelium. Levels of several epithelial chemokines and cytokines were markedly enhanced in SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice. Of note, antibiotic treatment remarkably impaired the development of colitis in SHP-2(IEC-KO) mice. Finally, SHP-2 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in intestinal biopsy specimens from UC patients.

Sulfasalazine is converted by gut bacteria into sulfapyridine and the clinically active metabolite 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), and its efficacy is proportional to the 5-ASA concentration within the intestinal lumen. Renal complications are commonly reported for the chemically similar 5-ASA derivative mesalamine, but are not well-known side effects of sulfasalazine therapy. We report a 72-year-old patient with Crohn's  managed with sulfasalazine for more than 10 years who presented with severe acute kidney injury (serum creatinine, 9.7mg/dL). Renal ultrasound revealed calculi and he subsequently spontaneously voided innumerable stones, which were composed of sulfasalazine metabolites. His renal calculi cleared and serum creatinine concentration improved to 3.1mg/dL after discontinuing sulfasalazine therapy and intravenous fluid hydration. His kidney function eventually returned to baseline. This case demonstrates that renal complications, in particular nephrolithiasis, may be an under-reported but potentially serious phenomenon in patients with  treated with sulfasalazine and that their hydration status may play an important role in this process.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Here we show in mice and human cells that gp130, a co-receptor for IL-6 cytokines, triggers activation of YAP and Notch, transcriptional regulators that control tissue growth and regeneration, independently of the gp130 effector STAT3. Through YAP and Notch, intestinal gp130 signalling stimulates epithelial cell proliferation, causes aberrant differentiation and confers resistance to mucosal erosion. gp130 associates with the related  kinases Src and Yes, which are activated on receptor engagement to phosphorylate YAP and induce its stabilization and nuclear translocation.

We have previously reported high expression of MCH and its receptor MCHR1 in the affected mucosa of patients with . Furthermore, MCH deficiency in mice attenuated experimental colitis, pointing to MCH as a mediator of intestinal inflammation. In the present study, in order to gain further insights into the underlying mechanisms of such effects of MCH, we treated mice with established experimental colitis due to IL-10 deficiency with a MCHR1 antagonist (DABA-822). While treatment with the same drug was successful in attenuating TNBS-induced colitis in previous studies, it offered no benefit to the IL-10 knockout mouse model, suggesting that perhaps IL-10 is a downstream target of MCH. Indeed, in experiments focusing on monocytes, we found that treatment with MCH inhibited LPS-mediated IL-10 upregulation. Conversely, in the same cells, exogenous IL-10 prevented LPS-induced MCHR1 expression. Taken together, these findings indicate a functional cross-talk between MCH and IL-10 which prevents resolution of inflammation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Saline was administered orally for 14 d to the control and the TNBS group. The TNBS group received rectal TNBS on the first day while saline was administered to the control group. The nilotinib group received 20 mg/kg nilotinib for 14 d in 2 divided doses, starting the same day as TNBS administration. For 14 d, the rats were fed a standard diet, and their weights were recorded daily. After sacrifice, colon tissue samples from each group were scored for macroscopic and microscopic pathology. Apoptotic indices were determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling method. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha and beta levels were assessed through immunohistochemistry staining scores and compared among the groups. Tissue and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Between days 1 and 14, the nilotinib group rats lost significantly less weight than the TNBS group rats (-0.7 g vs -14.0 g, P = 0.047). The difference in weight between the control and nilotinib groups was also statistically significant (+8.3 g vs -0.7 g, P = 0.031). From day 7 to day 14, the weight differences of the control group vs the TNBS group, the TNBS group vs the nilotinib group, and the control group vs the nilotinib group were all statistically significant (+8.0 g vs -11.1 g, P = 0.007; -11.1 g vs +2.9 g, P = 0.015; +8.0 g vs +2.9 g, P = 0.042, respectively). Macroscopic and microscopic scores were significantly lower in the nilotinib group than in the TNBS group (0.00 ± 0.00 vs 1.43 ± 0.65, P = 0.009; 2.86 ± 0.55 vs 7.71 ± 1.48, P = 0.030, respectively). However, these scores were similar between the nilotinib and control groups. While no significant difference for the nilotinib vs control groups could be determined for PDGFR alpha and beta scores, PDGFR alpha and beta scores were lower in the nilotinib group than in the TNBS group. Furthermore, the TNF alpha levels in the serum, tissue and apoptosis scores were similar between the nilotinib and TNBS groups.Nilotinib prevents weight loss, facilitates mucosal healing by improving the pathological scores without introducing variation into the apoptotic scores or TNF alpha levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24853984>Hirsutenone reduces deterioration of tight junction proteins through EGFR/Akt and ERK1/2 pathway both converging to HO-1 induction.</a></h1><p>Oxidative stress-induced disruption of epithelial tight junctions (TJ) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of intestinal disorders, including  (IBD). The current study investigated the protective effect of hirsutenone against disruption of the intestinal barrier in vitro and in a mouse model of colitis. Caco-2 cells were stimulated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH). Hirsutenone prevented the t-BH-induced increase in permeability by inhibiting the reduction in zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression, and rapidly stimulated  phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Hirsutenone-mediated protection against the loss of ZO-1 depends on the activation of both ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Interestingly, hirsutenone-mediated activation of Akt, but not ERK1/2, signaling was EGFR-dependent. Hirsutenone increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression through both EGFR/Akt- and ERK1/2-dependent pathways, contributing to the protective effects against TJ dysfunction. Colitis was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Hirsutenone administration improved the clinical parameters and tissue histological appearance, increased HO-1 expression, attenuated reduction of ZO-1 and occludin mRNA, and promoted BrdU incorporation in the colonic epithelium of TNBS-treated mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that hirsutenone reverse disordered intestinal permeability by activating EGFR/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, which are involved in the regulation of HO-1 expression. These findings highlight the potential of hirsutenone for clinical applications in the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A disturbed regulation of T helper (Th) cell responses causing loss of tolerance against self- or commensal-derived antigens and an altered intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in CD pathogenesis. Loss of PTPN2 in the T-cell compartment causes enhanced induction of Th1 and Th17 cells, but impaired induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in several mouse colitis models, namely acute and chronic dextran sodium sulfate colitis, and T-cell transfer colitis models. This results in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis which is comparable with that observed in CD patients. We detected  infiltrates in liver, kidney, and skin and elevated autoantibody levels indicating systemic loss of tolerance in PTPN2-deficient animals. CD patients featuring a loss-of-function PTPN2 variant exhibit enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell, but reduced Treg markers when compared with PTPN2 wild-type patients in serum and intestinal tissue samples. Our data demonstrate that dysfunction of PTPN2 results in aberrant T-cell differentiation and intestinal dysbiosis similar to those observed in human CD. Our findings indicate a novel and crucial role for PTPN2 in chronic intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23859759>Angiopoietins in inflammation and their implication in the development of . A review.</a></h1><p>Angiopoietins are essential angiogenic mediators. Since  (IBD) involves inflammation, ulceration and regeneration of the intestinal mucosa, the angiopoietin system has been proposed as a factor to maintain pathological angiogenesis during the development of the IBD.To review the potential role of angiopoietins in the inflammation driven by angiogenesis during the course of the IBD.Publications were identified by PubMed searches using the following key words: angiopoietin; Tie-2 receptor; angiogenesis;  and inflammation, in various combinations.Angiopoietin-1 acts as a regulator of blood vessel maturation and has anti- properties, whereas angiopoietin-2 marks the onset of angiogenesis and is required for normal formation of lymph vessels. Both angiopoietins make use of their angiogenic regulatory effects via the angiopoietin -kinase receptor (Tie-2). While angiogenesis has been shown to promote and sustain many events of inflammation, the involvement of the angiopoietin system in IBD has been reported in few studies. It is not clear whether the angiopoietins' role in the development of intestinal inflammation is due to an imbalance in the levels of these proteins or this system exerts its pro-angiogenic properties through a different mechanism during the close-loop relationship between angiogenesis and inflammation.Angiopoietins have key functions in the angiogenic process, and their abnormal activation might depend on their surrounding inflamed environment. The determination of these angiogenic factors in serum and tissue could be useful for monitoring IBD progression.© 2013. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have previously demonstrated that dysfunction of protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 contributes to alterations of intestinal microbiota and the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo. Here, we investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients.Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2 (rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq R package and MaAsLin pipeline.In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients. Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with severe  course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild . In UC patients with severe , relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2 and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with PTPN2 variant genotype.We identified that IBD-associated genetic risk variants,  severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant alterations in intestinal microbiota composition of IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867837>Absence of GdX/UBL4A Protects against   by Regulating NF-кB Signaling in Macrophages and Dendritic Cells.</a></h1><p>Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation is critical for innate immune responses. However, cellular-intrinsic regulation of NF-κB activity during   remains incompletely understood. Ubiquitin-like protein 4A (UBL4A, GdX) is a small adaptor protein involved in protein folding, biogenesis and transcription. Yet, whether GdX has a role during innate immune response is largely unknown.  To investigate the involvement of GdX in innate immunity, we challenged GdX-deficient mice with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). To investigate the underlying mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing, real-time PCR, ELISA, luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, flow cytometry, and structure analyses. To investigate whether GdX functions in , we generated dendritic cell (DC), macrophage (Mφ), epithelial-cell specific GdX-deficient mice and induced colitis with dextran sulfate sodium.  GdX enhances DC and Mφ-mediated innate immune defenses by positively regulating NF-κB signaling. GdX-deficient mice were resistant to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and DSS-induced colitis. DC- or Mφ- specific GdX-deficient mice displayed alleviated mucosal inflammation. The production of pro- cytokines by GdX-deficient DCs and Mφ was reduced. Mechanistically, we found that -protein phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2, TC45) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) form a complex with RelA (p65) to mediate its dephosphorylation whereas GdX interrupts the TC45/PP2A/p65 complex formation and restrict p65 dephosphorylation by trapping TC45.  Our study provides a mechanism by which NF-κB signaling is positively regulated by an adaptor protein GdX in DC or Mφ to maintain the innate immune response.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenesis are clinically elevated in . By targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) with receptor  kinase inhibitors in a murine model of colitis, we hypothesize that angiogenesis will be suppressed and  severity improved.Sorafenib, sunitinib, and axitinib were administered by oral gavage in a murine model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis. Inflammation score, microvessel density (MVD), and gene expression of VEGF, VEGFR, platelet-derived growth factor, PDGFR, Ang-2, and epidermal growth factor receptor was assessed.Inflammation and MVD were elevated in groups receiving DSS, but were similar between DSS-only and treatment cohorts. Unexpected weight loss was present in the gavaged groups versus DSS only. In treated groups, VEGFR was significantly decreased (P = 0.002) and VEGF gene expression trended down (P = 0.213) versus DSS only. Neither the platelet-derived growth factor/PDGFR pathway nor the alternative pathways, Ang-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, were significantly changed from DSS control in treatment cohorts.This study confirms the association between inflammation and MVD. Antiangiogenic receptor  kinase inhibitors suppressed the VEGF/VEGFR pathway but the expected decrease in colonic MVD did not follow, suggesting possible involvement of other angiogenic pathway(s).

This signal is transferred from Jak-3 to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell by a chain of kinases, ultimately activating extracellular receptor kinase (Erk/MAPK). The latter phosphorylates c-myc, an oncogene, which alters the levels and activities of many transcription factors leading to cell survival, proliferation and invasion. The oncogenic PI3K pathway plays a similar role by activating c-myc, leading to cell survival and proliferation. The present study explores the role of ulcerative colitis in colon cancer by investigating the activities of  kinase activated MAPK pathway and various components of the PI3K pathway including PI3K, PTEN, PDK1, GSK3β, Akt, mTOR, Wnt and β-catenin. This was done by western blot and fluorescent immunohistochemical analysis of the above-mentioned proteins. Also, the morphological and histological investigation of the colonic samples from various animal groups revealed significant alterations as compared to the control in both  as well as carcinogenic conditions.

TULA-family proteins act as downregulators of receptor-induced activation in several cell types, including T cells and platelets. Deletion of both family members in mice has been shown to result in hyperresponsiveness of T cells to T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex engagement, but little is known about the biological consequences of double knockout (dKO) and especially of either single KO (sKO). We elucidated the biological consequences of the lack of TULA-family proteins in dKO and TULA and TULA-2 sKO animals. In order to do so, we examined immune responses in Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, a mouse model of human , which is characterized by the involvement of multiple cell types, of which T cells have a crucial role, in the development of a pathological  condition. Our data indicate that TNBS treatment upregulates T-cell responses in all KO mice studied to a significantly higher degree than in wild-type mice. Although the lack of either TULA-family member exacerbates inflammation and T-cell responses in a specific fashion, the lack of both TULA and TULA-2 in dKO exerts a higher effect than the lack of a single family member in TULA and TULA-2 sKO.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that a physical interaction between transcription factor FOXP3 and the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is essential for gene co-repressive function.Human FOXP3 mutations clinically relevant to intestinal inflammation were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. T lymphocytes were isolated from mice, human blood, and lamina propria of Crohn's  (CD) patients and non-CD controls. We performed proximity ligation or a co-immunoprecipitation assay in FOXP3-mutant, interleukin 6 (IL6)-treated or CD-CD4 T cells to assess FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction. We studied  promoter activity and chromatin state of the interferon γ locus via luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, in cells expressing FOXP3 mutants.EZH2 binding was abrogated by -associated FOXP3 cysteine 232 (C232) mutation. The C232 mutant showed impaired repression of  and diminished EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 on interferon γ, indicative of compromised Treg physiologic function. Generalizing this mechanism, IL6 impaired FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. IL6-induced effects were reversed by Janus kinase 1/2 inhibition. In lamina propria-derived CD4T cells from CD patients, we observed decreased FOXP3-EZH2 interaction.FOXP3-C232 mutation disrupts EZH2 recruitment and gene co-repressive function. The proinflammatory cytokine IL6 abrogates FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. Studies in lesion-derived CD4 T cells have shown that reduced FOXP3-EZH2 interaction is a molecular feature of CD patients.

We undertook this study to identify HLA-B27-dependent changes in both host and microbial metabolites in the HLA-B27/β -microglobulin (β m)-transgenic rat and to determine whether microbiota-derived metabolites could impact  in this major model of spondyloarthritis.Cecal contents were collected from Fischer 344 33-3 HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats and wild-type controls at 6 weeks (before ) and 16 weeks (with active  inflammation). Metabolomic profiling was performed by high-throughput gas and liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometry. HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats were treated with the microbial metabolites propionate or butyrate in drinking water for 10 weeks, and  activity was subsequently assessed.Our screen identified 582 metabolites, of which more than half were significantly altered by HLA-B27 expression at 16 weeks. Both microbial and host metabolites were altered, with multiple pathways affected, including those for amino acid, carbohydrate, xenobiotic, and medium-chain fatty acid metabolism. Differences were even observed at 6 weeks, with up-regulation of histidine, , spermidine, N-acetylmuramate, and glycerate in HLA-B27/β m-transgenic rats. Administration of the short-chain fatty acid propionate significantly attenuated HLA-B27-associated  , although this was not associated with increased FoxP3+ T cell induction or with altered expression of the immunomodulatory cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-33 or of the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1. HLA-B27 expression was also associated with altered host expression of messenger RNA for the microbial metabolite receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), FFAR3, and niacin receptor 1.HLA-B27 expression profoundly impacts the intestinal metabolome, with changes evident in rats even at age 6 weeks. Critically, we demonstrate that a microbial metabolite, propionate, attenuates development of HLA-B27-associated  .

A variant in protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is associated with reduced risk of developing IBD, but promotes the onset of autoimmune disorders. While the role of PTPN22 in modulating molecular pathways involved in IBD pathogenesis is well studied, its impact on shaping the intestinal microbiota has not been addressed in depth. Here, we demonstrate that mice carrying the PTPN22 variant (619W mice) were protected from acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, but suffered from pronounced inflammation upon chronic DSS treatment. The basal microbiota composition was distinct between genotypes, and DSS-induced dysbiosis was milder in 619W mice than in WT littermates. Transfer of microbiota from 619W mice after the first DSS cycle into treatment-naive 619W mice promoted colitis, indicating that changes in microbial composition enhanced chronic colitis in those animals.

However, due to high similarity in the active sites of the four members (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2), developing selective inhibitors within this family is challenging. We have designed and characterized substituted, tricyclic Jak3 inhibitors that selectively avoid inhibition of the other JAKs. This is accomplished through a covalent interaction between an inhibitor containing a terminal electrophile and an active site cysteine (Cys-909). We found that these ATP competitive compounds are irreversible inhibitors of Jak3 enzyme activity in vitro. They possess high selectivity against other kinases and can potently (IC50 < 100 nm) inhibit Jak3 activity in cell-based assays.

The patient also had clinical manifestations of autoimmunity, such as eczematous skin lesion,  (IBD), and intractable diarrhea, suggesting compromised T cell tolerogenic functions. Residual ZAP70 expression was identified. Immunological analysis revealed the selective absence of CD8 T cells in the periphery and the presence of CD4 T cells that failed to respond to phytohemagglutinin.

However, excessive NOD2 signaling has been associated with numerous , including  (IBD), sarcoidosis and  arthritis, making pharmacologic inhibition of RIPK2 an appealing strategy. In this work, we report the generation, identification, and evaluation of novel RIPK2 specific inhibitors. These compounds potently inhibit the RIPK2  kinase activity in in vitro biochemical assays and cellular assays, as well as effectively reduce RIPK2-mediated effects in an in vivo peritonitis model. In conjunction with the development of these inhibitors, we have also defined a panel of genes whose expression is regulated by RIPK2 kinase activity. Such RIPK2 activation markers may serve as a useful tool for predicting settings likely to benefit from RIPK2 inhibition. Using these markers and the FDA-approved RIPK2 inhibitor Gefitinib, we show that pharmacologic RIPK2 inhibition drastically improves  in a spontaneous model of Crohn -like ileitis. Furthermore, using novel RIPK2-specific inhibitors, we show that cellular recruitment is inhibited in an in vivo peritonitis model.

We investigated whether colonic mucosal miRs are altered in children with ulcerative colitis (UC).We used a library of 316 miRs to identify those that regulate phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in NCM460 human colonocytes incubated with interleukin-6. Levels of miR-124 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of colon biopsies from pediatric and adult patients with UC and patients without IBD (controls), and of HCT-116 colonocytes incubated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA). Methylation of the MIR124 promoter was measured by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.Levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and the genes it regulates (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), BCL2, BCLXL, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 [MMP9]) were increased in pediatric patients with UC compared with control tissues. Overexpression of miR-124, let-7, miR-125, miR-26, or miR-101 reduced STAT3 phosphorylation by ≥ 75% in NCM460 cells; miR-124 had the greatest effect. miR-124 was down-regulated specifically in colon tissues from pediatric patients with UC and directly targeted STAT3 messenger RNA (mRNA). Levels of miR-124 were decreased, whereas levels of STAT3 phosphorylation increased in colon tissues from pediatric patients with active UC compared with those with inactive . In addition, levels of miR-124 and STAT3 were inversely correlated in mice with experimental colitis. Down-regulation of miR-124 in tissues from children with UC was attributed to hypermethylation of its promoter region. Incubation of HCT-116 colonocytes with 5-AZA up-regulated miR-124 and reduced levels of STAT3 mRNA.miR-124 appears to regulate the expression of STAT3. Reduced levels of miR-124 in colon tissues of children with active UC appear to increase expression and activity of STAT3, which could promote inflammation and the pathogenesis of UC in children.Copyright © 2013 AGA Institute.

Expression of the PTPN2 gene product, T cell protein- phosphatase (TCPTP), in intestinal epithelial cells has been shown to play an important role in the protection of epithelial barrier function during periods of inflammation by acting as a negative regulator of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. Therefore, agents that increase the activity of TCPTP are of general interest as modifiers of  signaling events. A previous study demonstrated that the small molecule spermidine is a selective activator of TCPTP in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate whether activation of TCPTP by spermidine was capable of alleviating IFN-γ-induced, proinflammatory signaling and barrier dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells. Studies revealed that treatment of T84 and HT29/cl.19A colonocytes with spermidine increased both TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a decrease in the phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 3, downstream mediators of IFN-γ signaling, upon coadministration of spermidine to IFN-γ-treated cells. On a functional level, spermidine protected barrier function in the setting of inflammation, restricting the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in epithelial permeability induced by IFN-γ in coincubation experiments. These data implicate spermidine as a potential therapeutic agent to treat conditions associated with elevated IFN-γ signaling and a faulty mucosal barrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24127071>Associations between PTPN2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's : a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) result from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Though several polymorphisms have been identified in PTPN2, their roles in the incidence of UC and CD are conflicting. This meta-analysis was aimed to clarify the impact of these polymorphisms on UC and CD risk.PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CBM were searched until 23 July 2013 for eligible studies on three PTPN2 polymorphisms: rs2542151, rs1893217 and rs7234029. Data were extracted, and pooled odd ratios (ORs) as well as 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated.The meta-analysis indicated that rs2542151, rs1893217 and rs1893217 were associated with increased CD risk, while the former was associated with increased UC risk. The differences in age of onset and ethnic groups may influence the associations. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should be investigated in the future.Seventeen studies with 18,308 cases and 20,406 controls were included. Significant associations were found between rs2542151 polymorphism and CD susceptibility (OR = 1.22, 95 % CI, 1.15-1.30, I (2) = 32 %), as well as between rs2542151 and UC susceptibility (OR = 1.16, 95 % CI, 1.07-1.25, I (2) = 39 %).

Numerous factors may cause temporary damage of the intestinal epithelium. A complex network of highly divergent factors regulates healing of the epithelium to prevent  response. However, the exact repair mechanisms involved in maintaining homeostatic intestinal barrier integrity remain to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) augments the restitution of epithelial barrier function in T84 cell monolayers after ethanol-induced epithelial injury, via ERK-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We have shown that ethanol injury decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) along with the reduction of ERK and FAK phosphorylation. Carbachol (CCh) increased ERK and FAK phosphorylation with enhanced TER recovery, which was completely blocked by either MT-7 (M1 antagonist) or atropine. The CCh-induced enhancement of TER recovery was also blocked by either U0126 (ERK pathway inhibitor) or PF-228 (FAK inhibitor). Treatment of T84 cell monolayers with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) impaired the barrier function with the reduction of FAK phosphorylation. The CCh-induced ERK and FAK phosphorylation were also attenuated by the IFN-γ treatment. Immunological and binding experiments exhibited a significant reduction of M1 mAChR after IFN-γ treatment. The reduction of M1 mAChR in  area was also observed in surgical specimens from IBD patients, using immunohistochemical analysis. These findings provide important clues regarding mechanisms by which M1 mAChR participates in the maintenance of intestinal barrier function under not only physiological but also pathological conditions.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aimed to determine the biological role of activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1) in TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis and proliferation in Caco-2 cells. ACK1 expression was knocked down using ACK1-specific siRNAs, and ACK1 activity was disrupted using a small molecule ACK1 inhibitor. The Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and the BrdU incorporation assays were used to measure apoptosis and cell proliferation, respectively. ACK1-specific siRNA and the pharmacological ACK1 inhibitor significantly abrogated the TNF-alpha-mediated anti-apoptotic effects and proliferation of Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, TNF-alpha activated ACK1 at  284 (Tyr284), and the ErbB family of proteins was implicated in ACK1 activation in Caco-2 cells. ACK1-Tyr284 was required for protein kinase B (AKT) activation, and ACK1 signaling was mediated through recruiting and phosphorylating the down-stream adaptor protein AKT, which likely promoted cell proliferation in response to TNF-alpha. Moreover, ACK1 activated AKT and Src enhanced nuclear factor-кB (NF-кB) activity, suggesting a correlation between NF-кB signaling and TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. Our results demonstrate that ACK1 plays an important role in modulating TNF-alpha-induced aberrant cell proliferation and apoptosis, mediated in part by ACK1 activation. ACK1 and its down-stream effectors may hold promise as therapeutic targets in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, in particular, those induced by chronic intestinal inflammation.© 2017 The Authors.

Recently, several studies described the health-promoting effects of red wine, including anti- properties, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial role remain largely unknown. Red wine is rich in phenolic compounds and it has been suggested that the positive effect of red wine intake might be attributed not only to the antioxidant properties of these compounds but also to the modulation of signalling cascades in connection with physiological and pathophysiological conditions such as  processes. This study assesses the potential anti- action of a red wine extract (RWE) enriched in polyphenols in a cellular model of intestinal inflammation using cytokines-stimulated HT-29 colon epithelial cells. RWE suppressed cytokines-induced IκB degradation and interleukin-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. Coherently, key  mediators downstream NF-κB activation; notably cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were maintained at low levels by RWE in the presence of the cytokines. Additionally, RWE inhibited both the increase of nitric oxide derived from iNOS and of protein  nitration, a biomarker of nitrosative stress that typically requires the reaction of nitric oxide with the superoxide radical. Taken together, the anti- action of RWE, mechanistically supported by the modulation of cascades orchestrated by NF-κB and involving nitric oxide, suggests that RWE (a readily straightforward preparation when compared with the purification of specific compounds) may represent a simple and inexpensive therapeutic strategy in the context of intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24311782>Modulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) activation by the stress response gene immediate early response-3 (IER3) in colonic epithelial cells: a novel mechanism of cellular adaption to  stress.</a></h1><p>Although nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) protects from carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis, underlying the rationale for using Nrf2 inducers in chemoprevention, this antioxidative transcription factor may also act as a proto-oncogene. Thus, an enhanced Nrf2 activity promotes formation and chemoresistance of colon cancer. One mechanism causing persistent Nrf2 activation is the adaptation of epithelial cells to oxidative stress during chronic inflammation, e.g. colonocytes in , and the multifunctional stress response gene immediate early response-3 (IER3) has a crucial role under these conditions. We now demonstrate that colonic tissue from Ier3(-/-) mice subject of dextran sodium sulfate colitis exhibit greater Nrf2 activity than Ier3(+/+) mice, manifesting as increased nuclear Nrf2 protein level and Nrf2 target gene expression. Likewise, human NCM460 colonocytes subjected to shRNA-mediated IER3 knockdown exhibit greater Nrf2 activity compared with control cells, whereas IER3 overexpression attenuated Nrf2 activation. IER3-deficient NCM460 cells exhibited reduced reactive oxygen species levels, indicating increased antioxidative protection, as well as lower sensitivity to TRAIL or anticancer drug-induced apoptosis and greater clonogenicity. Knockdown of Nrf2 expression reversed these IER3-dependent effects. Further, the enhancing effect of IER3 deficiency on Nrf2 activity relates to the control of the inhibitory  kinase Fyn by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Thus, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or knockdown of Akt or Fyn expression abrogated the impact of IER3 deficiency on Nrf2 activity. In conclusion, the interference of IER3 with the PI3K/Akt-Fyn pathway represents a novel mechanism of Nrf2 regulation that may get lost in tumors and by which IER3 exerts its stress-adaptive and tumor-suppressive activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560787>A role for interleukin 17A in IBD-related neuroplasticity.</a></h1><p>Changes to the structure and function of the innervation of the gut contribute to symptom generation in  (IBD). However, delineation of the mechanisms of these effects has proven difficult. Previous work on sympathetic neurons identified interleukin (IL)-17A as a novel neurotrophic cytokine. Since IL-17A is involved in IBD pathogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that IL-17A contributes to neuroanatomical remodeling during IBD.Immunohistochemistry for  hydroxylase was used to identify sympathetic axons in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and controls. Axon outgrowth from sympathetic neurons in response to incubation in cytokines or endoscopic patient biopsy supernatants was quantified.DSS-induced colitis led to an increase in  hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the inflamed colon but not the spleen. Colonic supernatants from mice with colitis and biopsy supernatants from Crohn's  patients increased axon outgrowth from mouse sympathetic neurons compared to supernatants from uninflamed controls. An antibody that neutralized IL-17A blocked the ability of DSS-induced colitis and Crohn's  supernatants to induce axon extension.These findings identify IL-17A as a potential mediator of neuroanatomical remodeling of the gut innervation during IBD.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409221>Functional consequences of the macrophage stimulating protein 689C  risk allele.</a></h1><p>Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a serum growth factor that binds to and activates the receptor  kinase, Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON). A non-synonymous coding variant in MSP (689C) has been associated with genetic susceptibility to both Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis, two major types of  (IBD) characterized by chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. We investigated the consequences of this polymorphism for MSP-RON pathway activity and IBD pathogenesis.RON expression patterns were examined on mouse and human cells and tissues under normal and  conditions to identify cell types regulated by MSP-RON. Recombinant MSP variants were tested for their ability to bind and stimulate RON and undergo proteolytic activation. MSP concentrations were quantified in the serum of individuals carrying the MSP 689R and 689C alleles.In intestinal tissue, RON was primarily expressed by epithelial cells under normal and  conditions. The 689C polymorphism had no impact on the ability of MSP to bind to or signal through RON. In a cohort of normal individuals and IBD patients, carriers of the 689C polymorphism had lower concentrations of MSP in their serum.By reducing the quantities of circulating MSP, the 689C polymorphism, or a variant in linkage disequilibrium with this polymorphism, may impact RON ligand availability and thus receptor activity. Given the known functions of RON in regulating wound healing and our analysis of RON expression patterns in human intestinal tissue, these data suggest that decreased RON activity may impact the efficiency of epithelial repair and thus underlie the increased IBD susceptibility associated with the MSP 689C allele.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27926694>Involvement of Activated Cdc42 Kinase1 in Colitis and Colorectal Neoplasms.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Activated Cdc42 kinase1 (ACK1) is a non-receptor  kinase which is critical for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Genomic amplification of ACK1 has been reported in multiple human cancers. We aimed to investigate ACK1 protein expression in colorectal mucosa with inflammation and neoplasm, and to evaluate its correlation with  activity and severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 250 individuals who underwent total colonoscopy were collected randomly from January 2007 to May 2013 in Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, China. Colorectal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained by endoscopy from 78 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 22 with Crohn's  (CD), 20 with infectious colitis, 26 with non-IBD and noninfectious colitis, 16 with sporadic adenomas, 4 with dysplasia-associated lesions or masses, 10 with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), 4 with UC-related CRC, 10 with hyperplastic polyps, and 60 without colonic abnormalities. ACK1 protein levels were determined immunohistochemically. The correlations of ACK1 expression with  activity and severity were also evaluated. RESULTS Significantly increased ACK1 expression was observed in epithelial cells of colorectal mucosa with inflammation and dysplasia compared to controls (P<0.05). ACK1 expression correlated with clinical activity in IBD (χ²=4.57, P=0.033 for UC; χ²=5.68, P=0.017 for CD), as well as grade of dysplasia in preneoplastic lesions (P<0.05). No significant differences in ACK1 expression were found between UC and CD, or between IBD and non-IBD conditions (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS ACK1 protein is increased extensively in colitis and colorectal dysplasia. ACK1 overexpression may play a role in colorectal inflammation and neoplasms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30321331>An Increased Abundance of Clostridiaceae Characterizes Arthritis in  and Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cross-sectional Study.</a></h1><p> (IBDs) are a group of heterogeneous  conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Although there is considerable evidence linking the gut microbiota to intestinal inflammation, there is limited knowledge on its potential role in the development of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD.Four groups of patients were included: IBD-associated arthropathy (IBD-A); IBD without arthropathy (IBD-N); rheumatoid arthritis (RA); and non-IBD, nonarthritis controls. DNA from stool samples was isolated and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Paired-end reads were quality-controlled using SHI7 and processed with SHOGUN. Abundance and diversity analyses were performed using QIIME, and compositional biomarker identification was performed using LEfSe.One hundred eighty patients were included in the analysis. IBD-A was associated with an increased abundance of microbial  degradation pathways when compared with IBD-N (P = 0.02), whereas IBD-A and RA patients both shared an increased abundance of Clostridiaceae when compared with controls (P = 0.045). We found that history of  surgery was a significant source of variability (P = 0.001) among all IBD patients and was associated with decreased alpha diversity and increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.004).An increased abundance of gut microbial  degradation pathways was associated with IBD-A. An increased abundance of Clostridiaceae was shared by both IBD-A and RA patients and suggests a potentially common microbial link for  arthritis. The increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, previously reported in IBD, may be due to the effects of previous  surgery and highlights the importance of controlling for this variable in future studies.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In this study, we investigated the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC since gankyrin is overexpressed in sporadic colorectal cancers. We analyzed gene expression of colon tissues obtained from 344 patients with IBD and CAC and found that expression of gankyrin was much higher in colonic mucosa of patients with refractory IBD than in those with IBD in remission. Expression of gankyrin was upregulated in  cells as well as tumor cells in colonic mucosa of patients with CAC. Over-expressing studies utilizing tagged ganlyrin-cDNA identified physical interaction between ganlyrin and Src homology 2-containing protein  phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). Importantly, the interaction between ganlyrin and SHP-1 leads to inhibition of STAT3 activation and to enhancement of TNF-α and IL-17 in  cells. To further address the role of gankyrin in the development of CAC, we created mice with intestinal epithelial cell-specific gankyrin ablation (Vil-Cre;Gankyrinf/f) and deletion of gankyrin in myeloid and epithelial cells (Mx1-Cre;Gankyrinf/f). Gankyrin deficiency in myeloid cells, but not in epithelial cells, reduced the activity of mitogen activated protein kinase and the expression of stem cell markers, leading to attenuated tumorigenic potential. These findings provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CAC and suggest that gankyrin is a promising target for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies against CAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30320600>Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 mediates trauma-induced intestinal injury and multi-organ failure.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis initiates gut injury, alters the intestinal barrier, and can facilitate bacterial translocation leading to a systemic  response syndrome (SIRS) and/or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). A variety of gastrointestinal disorders, including , have been linked to intestinal apoptosis. Similarly, intestinal hyperpermeability and gut failure occur in critically ill patients, putting the gut at the center of SIRS pathology. Regulation of apoptosis and immune-modulatory functions have been ascribed to Thirty-eight-negative kinase 1 (TNK1), whose activity is regulated merely by expression. We investigated the effect of TNK1 on intestinal integrity and its role in MODS. TNK1 expression induced crypt-specific apoptosis, leading to bacterial translocation, subsequent septic shock, and early death. Mechanistically, TNK1 expression in vivo resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of p65, and release of IL-6 and TNF-α. A TNF-α neutralizing antibody partially blocked development of intestinal damage. Conversely, gut-specific deletion of TNK1 protected the intestinal mucosa from experimental colitis and prevented cytokine release in the gut. Finally, TNK1 was found to be deregulated in the gut in murine and porcine trauma models and human . Thus, TNK1 might be a target during MODS to prevent damage in several organs, notably the gut.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174704>New and Unexpected Biological Functions for the Src-Homology 2 Domain-Containing Phosphatase SHP-2 in the Gastrointestinal Tract.</a></h1><p>SHP-2 is a  phosphatase expressed in most embryonic and adult tissues. SHP-2 regulates many cellular functions including growth, differentiation, migration, and survival. Genetic and biochemical evidence show that SHP-2 is required for rat sarcoma viral oncogene/extracellular signal-regulated kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by most  kinase receptors, as well as by G-protein-coupled and cytokine receptors. In addition, SHP-2 can regulate the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, nuclear factor-κB, phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase/Akt, RhoA, Hippo, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Emerging evidence has shown that SHP-2 dysfunction represents a key factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal , in particular in chronic inflammation and cancer. Variations within the gene locus encoding SHP-2 have been associated with increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis and gastric atrophy. Furthermore, mice with conditional deletion of SHP-2 in intestinal epithelial cells rapidly develop severe colitis. Similarly, hepatocyte-specific deletion of SHP-2 induces hepatic inflammation, resulting in regenerative hyperplasia and development of tumors in aged mice. However, the SHP-2 gene initially was suggested to be a proto-oncogene because activating mutations of this gene were found in pediatric leukemias and certain forms of liver and colon cancers. Moreover, SHP-2 expression is up-regulated in gastric and hepatocellular cancers. Notably, SHP-2 functions downstream of cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA), the major virulence factor of , and is associated with increased risks of gastric cancer. Further compounding this complexity, most recent findings suggest that SHP-2 also coordinates carbohydrate, lipid, and bile acid synthesis in the liver and pancreas.

Psychological stress has been postulated to affect the clinical symptoms and recurrence of IBD. The exact molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that psychological stress promotes neutrophil infiltration into colon tissues in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model. The psychological stress resulted in abnormal expression of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22) and neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL2) and overactivation of the STAT3  signaling pathway. Under chronic unpredictable stress, the adrenergic nervous system was markedly activated, as the expression of  hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in bone marrow and colonic epithelium was enhanced, especially in the myenteric ganglia. The β-AR agonist isoproterenol mimicked the effects of psychological stress on neutrophilia, neutrophil infiltration, and colonic damage in DSS-induced colitis. The β1-AR/β2-AR inhibitor propranolol reduced the numbers of the neutrophils in the circulation, suppressed neutrophil infiltration into colonic tissues, and attenuated the colonic tissue damage promoted by chronic stress. Propranolol also abolished stress-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil chemokines. Our data reveal a close linkage between the β1-AR/β2-AR activation and neutrophil trafficking and also suggest the critical roles of adrenergic nervous system in exacerbation of inflammation and damage of colonic tissues in experimental colitis. The current study provides a new insight into the mechanisms underlying the association of psychological stress with excessive  response and pathophysiological consequences in IBD. The findings also suggest a potential application of neuroprotective agents to prevent relapsing immune activation in the treatment of IBD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced  phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and  conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of colitis induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression. This study clearly demonstrates that adelmidrol exerts important anti- effects that are partly dependent on PPARγ, suggesting that this molecule may represent a new pharmacologic approach for  treatment.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26232640>The emerging pharmacology and function of GPR35 in the nervous system.</a></h1><p>G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that can be activated by kynurenic acid at high micromolar concentrations. A previously unappreciated mechanism of action of GPR35 has emerged as a Gα-coupled inhibitor of synaptic transmission, a finding that has significant implications for the accepted role of kynurenic acid as a broad-spectrum antagonist of the NMDA, AMPA/kainite and α7 nicotinic receptors. In conjunction with previous findings that link agonism of GPR35 with significant reduction in nociceptive pain, GPR35 has emerged as a potential effector of regulation of mechanical sensitivity and analgesia of the Ret  kinase, and as a receptor involved in the transmission of anti- effects of aspirin- potentially through affecting leucocyte rolling, adhesion and extravasation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of GPR35 have linked this receptor to coronary artery calcification,  and primary sclerosing cholangitis, while chromosomal aberrations of the 2q37.3 locus and altered copy number of GPR35 have been linked with autism, Albight's hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome, and congenital malformations, respectively. Herein, we present an update on both the pharmacology and potential function of GPR35, particularly pertaining to the nervous system.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2476601 within the PTPN22 gene locus results in aberrant function of PTPN22 protein and protects from Crohn's  (CD). Here, we investigated associations of PTPN22 SNP rs2476601 in  (IBD) patients in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDCS).2'028 SIBDCS patients (1173 CD and 855 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients) were included. The clinical characteristics were analysed for an association with the presence of the PTPN22 SNP rs2476601 genotypes 'homozygous variant' (AA), 'heterozygous' (GA) and 'homozygous wild-type' (GG).13 patients (0.6%) were homozygous variant (AA) for the PTPN22 polymorphism, 269 (13.3%) heterozygous variant (GA) and 1'746 (86.1%) homozygous wild-type (GG). In CD, AA and GA genotypes were associated with less use of steroids and antibiotics, and reduced prevalence of vitamin D and calcium deficiency. In UC the AA and GA genotype was associated with increased use of azathioprine and anti-TNF antibodies, but significantly less patients with the PTPN22 variant featured malabsorption syndrome (p = 0.026).Our study for the first time addressed how presence of SNP rs2476601 within the PTPN22 gene affects clinical characteristics in IBD-patients. Several factors that correlate with more severe  were found to be less common in CD patients carrying the A-allele, pointing towards a protective role for this variant in affected CD patients. In UC patients however, we found the opposite trend, suggesting a -promoting effect of the A-allele.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460084>Brain derived neurotrophic factor inhibits apoptosis in enteric glia during gut inflammation.</a></h1><p>Enteric glia cells (EGCs) are essential for the integrity of the . A loss of EGCs leads to a severe inflammation of the intestines. As a diminished EGC network is postulated in Crohn's  (CD), we aimed to investigate if EGCs could be a target of apoptosis during inflammation in CD, which can be influenced by Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).GFAP, BDNF and cCaspase-3 were detected in the gut of patients with CD. Primary EGC cultures were established and cultivated.  receptor kinase (TrkB) receptors on these cells were investigated by western blot and immunofluorescence. Rate of apoptosis was induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN-gamma). Apoptosis was determined by a fluorometric caspase 3/7 activation assay after preincubation of these cells with BDNF or neutralizing anti-BDNF antibodies.Mucosal GFAP-positive EGCs undergo apoptosis revealed by cCaspase-3 in the gut of patients with CD expressing BDNF highly. The combination of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was able to induce apoptosis in primary EGCs, whereas these factors alone did not. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) attenuate glia cell apoptosis to a small extent, but neutralizing antibodies against BDNF dramatically increased apoptosis.Mucosal EGC apoptosis is an important finding in the gut of patients with CD. Proinflammatory cytokines, which are highly increased in CD, induce EGC apoptosis, whereas the neurotrophin BDNF might be protective for EGC. Since EGCs are implicated in the maintenance of the enteric mucosal integrity, EGC apoptosis may contribute to the pathophysiological changes in CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30140167>Elevated Expression of  May Contribute to the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in  Patients.</a></h1><p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms inducing and regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) upon chronic intestinal inflammation is critical for understanding the exact pathomechanism of  (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the expression profile of TAM family receptors in an inflamed colon. For this, we used a rat model of experimental colitis and also collected samples from colons of IBD patients. Samples were taken from both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the same colon; the total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA and microRNA expressions were monitored. We have determined that AXL is highly induced in active-inflamed colon, which is accompanied with reduced expression of AXL-regulating microRNAs. In addition, the expression of genes responsible for inducing or maintaining mesenchymal phenotype, such as SNAI1, ZEB2, VIM, MMP9, and HIF1 were all significantly induced in the active-inflamed colon of IBD patients while the epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1) was downregulated. We also show that, , monocytic and colonic epithelial cells increase the expression of  in response to LPS or TNF stimuli, respectively. In summary, we identified several interacting genes and microRNAs with mutually exclusive expression pattern in active-inflamed colon of IBD patients. Our results shed light onto a possible - and microRNA-mediated regulation influencing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824650>VSL#3 Probiotic Stimulates T-cell Protein  Phosphatase-mediated Recovery of IFN-γ-induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Defects.</a></h1><p>VSL#3 is a probiotic compound that has been used in the treatment of . T-cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) is the protein product of the  candidate gene, PTPN2, and we have previously shown that it protects epithelial barrier function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VSL#3 improves intestinal epithelial barrier function against the effects of the -associated proinflammatory cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) through activation of TCPTP.Polarized monolayers of T84 intestinal epithelial cells were treated with increasing concentrations of VSL#3 to determine effects on TCPTP expression and enzymatic activity. Therapeutic effects of VSL#3 against barrier disruption by IFN-γ were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability. A novel TCPTP-deficient HT-29 intestinal epithelial cell line was generated to study the role of TCPTP in mediating the effects of VSL#3. Tight junction protein distribution was assessed with confocal microscopy.VSL#3 increased TCPTP protein levels and enzymatic activity, correlating with a VSL#3-induced decrease in IFN-γ signaling. VSL#3 corrected the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in epithelial permeability induced by IFN-γ. Moreover, the restorative effect of VSL#3 against IFN-γ signaling, epithelial permeability defects, altered expression and localization of the tight junction proteins claudin-2, occludin, and zonula occludens-1, were not realized in stable TCPTP/(PTPN2)-deficient HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells.VSL#3 reduces IFN-γ signaling and IFN-γ-induced epithelial barrier defects in a TCPTP-dependent manner. These data point to a key role for TCPTP as a therapeutic target for restoration of barrier function using probiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25092526>Differential stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in Crohn's  by fungal glycans.</a></h1><p>Crohn's  (CD) is characterized by loss of tolerance to intestinal microorganisms. This is reflected by serological responses to fungal glycans such as mannan and β-glucans. Fungal glycans have various effects on immune cells. However, the evidence for their effects in CD is vague. This study aimed to assess the effects of fungal cell wall glycans on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CD and control patients.Human PBMCs from CD and control patients were stimulated by fungal cell wall glycans. Cytokine secretion was detected by ELISA and glycan receptor expression by flow cytometry.Mannan, β-glucans (curdlan), chitosan, and zymosan induced the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α by PBMCs. Spleen tyrosin kinase and Src  kinase were involved in the response to mannan and β-glucans. Mannan and whole yeast cells induced a significantly higher pro- cytokine response in CD compared with control patients.The results may suggest that CD is characterized by hyperresponsiveness to fungal glycans. Thus, glycans may potentially be triggering or perpetuating inflammation.© 2014 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30579252>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1  kinase signaling facilitates healing of DSS-induced colitis by accumulation of Tregs in ulcer area.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an  that affects the colon. The development of UC is regulated by immune cells. Previously, we showed that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1)  kinase (TK) signaling induces healing of mucosal damage by recruiting VEGFR1 cells appear to be lineage monocyte cells. Recent studies show that development of UC correlates with the number of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, we investigated whether VEGFR1-TK signaling induces healing of UC via accumulation of Tregs or not.Acute colitis was induced in C57/Bl6N (wild-type [WT]) and VEGFR1 T K knockout (VEGFR1 T K) mice by administration of 2.0% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).Total colon length in VEGFR1 T K mice was shorter than that in WT mice. The ulcer length and the  activity index (DAI) score were significantly higher in VEGFR1 T K mice than in WT mice, whereas CD31 mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower. Accumulation of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) VEGFR1 Tregs was lower in VEGFR1 T K mice, as was expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. The survival rate of WT mice treated with an anti-folate receptor 4 (FR4) antibody was 40%, while that of WT mice treated with control IgG was 90%. Moreover, WT mice treated with a neutralizing antibody against C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) showed significantly shorter colon length than WT with control antibody. In VEGFR1 T K, infiltration of Foxp3 Tregs expressing VEGFR1 and CXCR4 into ulcerated areas was lower than that in WT mice.VEGFR1-TK signaling plays a critical role in UC healing and angiogenesis via accumulation of VEGFR1CXCR4Foxp3 Tregs in ulcerated tissue.

However, it is only in recent years that this has been taken into increasing consideration. Some authors still use both terms synonymously or interchangeably.  myofibroblastic tumor is a real neoplasm because of the proliferation of myofibroblastic cells.  pseudotumor is a more  reactive or regenerative entity and shows an overlapping with immunoglobulin G4-related .To analyze the current situation, 443 publications from the last 5 years (2009 to February 2014) were included. Reports involved 938 patients and 956 organ sites. The age distribution is twin peaked with one maximum in childhood and the other between 50 and 60 years of age. This distribution is questionable due to the more frequent occurrence of IPT in the liver and of IMT in the lung.  pseudotumors mainly occur in older patients; IMTs in children and young adults.The liver and biliary tract were the most commonly affected of all body regions, at 32%. This was followed by the lung, including the respiratory tract, at 27%, and by the gastrointestinal tract, at 10%. Lesions of the large , as in the present case of a 9-year-old boy, are very rare. There were organ-related as well as nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Laboratory test results revealed anemia and elevated inflammation-dependent parameters. The patterns in medical imaging are variable and nonspecific. Morphology often suggests a malignant process. For this reason, therapy in most cases is surgical, but this is required more often in IMTs. Many IPTs could be treated conservatively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043286>NLRP3  phosphorylation is controlled by protein  phosphatase PTPN22.</a></h1><p>Inflammasomes form as the result of the intracellular presence of danger-associated molecular patterns and mediate the release of active IL-1β, which influences a variety of  responses. Excessive inflammasome activation results in severe  conditions, but physiological IL-1β secretion is necessary for intestinal homeostasis. Here, we have described a mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome regulation by  phosphorylation of NLRP3 at Tyr861. We demonstrated that protein  phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22), variants in which are associated with chronic  disorders, dephosphorylates NLRP3 upon inflammasome induction, allowing efficient NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β release. In murine models, PTPN22 deficiency resulted in pronounced colitis, increased NLRP3 phosphorylation, but reduced levels of mature IL-1β. Conversely, patients with  (IBD) that carried an autoimmunity-associated PTPN22 variant had increased IL-1β levels. Together, our results identify  phosphorylation as an important regulatory mechanism for NLRP3 that prevents aberrant inflammasome activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116555>The Syk Inhibitor Fostamatinib Decreases the Severity of Colonic Mucosal Damage in a Rodent Model of Colitis.</a></h1><p> is a chronic   of the gastrointestinal system. In some cases, current medications used for  may not be enough for remission, creating a need for more potent and reliable medications. There is no study showing the efficacy of fostamatinib, with proven effects on some  , on ulcerative colitis. In our study we planned to research the efficacy of fostamatinib, a spleen  kinase inhibitor, on acetic acid-induced colitis.The study included 28 male Sprague-Dawley rats, randomly divided into control group, fostamatinib group, colitis group and fostamatinib + colitis group, each containing seven rats. Colitis induction was performed with 4% acetic acid. Colonic inflammation was assessed with  activity index, macroscopic and histological damage scores, colonic myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase activity, and tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNFα], CD3, Syk, and phospho-Syk expression.There was a significant difference between the colitis and control groups in terms of all parameters. The  activity index, macroscopic and microscopic damage scores, immunohistochemical TNFα, CD3, Syk, and phospho-Syk expression, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity were found to be significantly lower in the colitis + fostamatinib group compared with the colitis group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde activity.Fostamatinib reduced the  damage in the experimental colitis. This effect may be due to suppression of TNFα, T-lymphocytes, and neutrophils in colonic mucosa via suppression of Syk. Fostamatinib may be an appropriate treatment alternative for ulcerative colitis. Further clinical studies are required to support this.Copyright © 2015 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Many of these inhibitors possess several key advantages over their reversible counterparts. The patent literature from 2010 to 2013 has been reviewed and novel irreversible kinase inhibitors for Bruton's  kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, Janus kinase 3, phosphoinsitide 3 and other kinases are disclosed and discussed.

Epithelial barrier consists of various intercellular junctions, in which the tight junction (TJ) is an important component. However, the regulatory mechanism of tight junction is still not clear. Here we examined the role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the epithelial barrier function on Caco-2 monolayers using a specific FAK inhibitor, PF-573, 228 (PF-228). We found that the decrease of transepithelial resistance and the increase of paracellular permeability were accompanied with the inhibition of autophosphorylation of FAK by PF-228 treatment. In addition, PF-228 inhibited the FAK phosphorylation at Y576/577 on activation loop by Src, suggesting Src-dependent regulation of FAK in Caco-2 monolayers. In an ethanol-induced barrier injury model, PF-228 treatment also inhibited the recovery of transepithelial resistance as well as these phosphorylations of FAK. In a sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, FAK co-localized with claudin-1, an element of the TJ complex, and they co-migrate after ethanol-induced barrier injury. Immunofluorescence imaging analysis revealed that PF-228 inhibited the FAK redistribution to the cell border and reassembly of TJ proteins in the recovery after ethanol-induced barrier injury. Finally, knockdown of FAK by siRNA resulted in the decrease of transepithelial resistance. These findings reveal that activation of FAK is necessary for maintaining and repairing epithelial barrier in Caco-2 cell monolayer via regulating TJ redistribution.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Defects in this defense system may lead to  disorders such as . Downstream of  kinases 1 (Dok-1) and its closest homolog, Dok-2, are preferentially expressed in immune cells, and play essential roles in the negative regulation of multiple signaling pathways in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the function of these proteins in intestinal homeostasis remained unclear. Here we show that Dok-1/-2 double knockout (DKO) mice were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis compared with Dok-1 or Dok-2 single KO and wild type (WT) mice. Furthermore, DSS-treated Dok-1/-2 DKO mice exhibited increased colonic tissue damage accompanied by reduced proliferation of the epithelial cells relative to WT controls, suggesting that Dok-1/-2 DKO mice have defects in the repair of intestinal epithelial lesions. In addition, the levels of the Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-22, which have protective roles in DSS-induced colitis, were reduced in DSS-treated Dok-1/-2 DKO mice compared with WT mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Dok-1 and Dok-2 negatively regulate intestinal inflammation, apparently through the induction of IL-17A and IL-22 expression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular studies and, in particular, gene expression have contributed to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of many cancers. Genes can be molecular and therapeutic markers, but because of the large molecular diversity in colorectal cancer the knowledge is not yet fully established. Probably one of the most crucial processes during early cancer development is inflammation. The  response in the tumor is an important indicator of molecular etiology and later of cancer progression.The aim of this work is to identify potential biomarkers for early stage of colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients'  tissues using transcriptomic analysis.Expression of the  response genes of colorectal cancer at all clinical stages (I-IV) and control of the  were evaluated by oligonucleotide microarrays.Based on statistical analysis many differentially expressed genes were selected. LCK (LCK Proto-Oncogene, Src Family  Kinase), GNLY (granulysin), SLC6A6 (Solute-Carrier Family 6 Member 6) and LAMP2 (Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 2) were specific for the early stage of the .

Under  conditions, we report that the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-A is  phosphorylated (p-Y280) in association with loss of barrier function. While barely detectable Y280 phosphorylation was observed in confluent monolayers of human intestinal epithelial cells under basal conditions, exposure to cytokines TNFα, IFNγ, IL-22, or IL-17A, resulted in compromised barrier function in parallel with increased p-Y280. Phosphorylation was Src kinase dependent, and we identified Yes-1 and PTPN13 as a major kinase and phosphatase for p-JAM-A Y280, respectively. Moreover, cytokines IL-22 or IL-17A induced increased activity of Yes-1. Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 rescued cytokine-induced epithelial barrier defects and inhibited phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 in vitro. Phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 and increased permeability correlated with reduced JAM-A association with active Rap2. Finally, we observed increased phosphorylation of Y280 in colonic epithelium of individuals with ulcerative colitis and in mice with experimentally induced colitis. These findings support a novel mechanism by which  phosphorylation of JAM-A Y280 regulates epithelial barrier function during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230865>ErbB4 signaling stimulates pro- macrophage apoptosis and limits colonic inflammation.</a></h1><p>Efficient clearance of pro- macrophages from tissues after resolution of a challenge is critical to prevent prolonged inflammation. Defects in clearance can contribute to conditions such as , and thus may be therapeutically targetable. However, the signaling pathways that induce termination of pro- macrophages are incompletely defined. We tested whether the ErbB4 receptor  kinase, previously not known to have role in macrophage biology, is involved in this process. In vitro, pro- activation of cultured murine and human macrophages induced ErbB4 expression; in contrast, other ErbB family members were not induced in pro- cells, and other innate immune lineages (dendritic cells, neutrophils) did not express detectable ErbB4 levels. Treatment of activated pro- macrophages with the ErbB4 ligand neuregulin-4 (NRG4) induced apoptosis. ErbB4 localized to the mitochondria in these cells. Apoptosis was accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and was dependent upon the proteases that generate the cleaved ErbB4 intracellular domain fragment, suggesting a requirement for this fragment and mitochondrial pathway apoptosis. In vivo, ErbB4 was highly expressed on pro- macrophages but not neutrophils during experimental DSS colitis in C57Bl/6 mice. Active inflammation in this model suppressed NRG4 expression, which may allow for macrophage persistence and ongoing inflammation. Consistent with this notion, NRG4 levels rebounded during the recovery phase, and administration of exogenous NRG4 during colitis reduced colonic macrophage numbers and ameliorated inflammation. These data define a novel role for ErbB4 in macrophage apoptosis, and outline a mechanism of feedback inhibition that may promote resolution of colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901824>A distinct pattern of -associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in IBD risk genes in a family with Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Recent studies have identified more than 160  susceptibility loci and provided evidence for genetic heritability in  pathogenesis. Here we describe a case of a 47-year-old White woman suffering from Crohn's  (CD), who had four children, two with CD and two with a factor V Leiden variation. We analysed the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in several CD susceptibility genes. SNP analysis was carried out using commercially available assays. The female CD patient had a positive  family history. All of the patients had a mild  course, without fistulae or symptomatic stenosis. The patient was heterozygous for risk variants of the genes encoding nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and a homozygous carrier of both of the identified protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2) risk alleles. The CD-affected daughter carried heterozygous risk alleles of the genes encoding TLR5, NOD2 and PTPN2. The son, with the earliest onset of  in the family at the age of 12 years, was heterozygous for risk alleles of autophagy 16 like 1 (ATG16L1), TLR5, NOD2 and PTPN2. This study reports an interesting pattern of CD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in a family with CD.

Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are critical in regulating these interactions. Multiple genetic loci are associated with IBD, but altered functions for most, including in the rs713875 MTMR3/HORMAD2/LIF/OSM region, are unknown. We identified a previously undefined role for myotubularin-related protein 3 (MTMR3) in amplifying PRR-induced cytokine secretion in human macrophages and defined MTMR3-initiated mechanisms contributing to this amplification. MTMR3 decreased PRR-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and autophagy levels, thereby increasing PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, autocrine IL-1β secretion, NFκB signaling, and, ultimately, overall cytokine secretion. This MTMR3-mediated regulation required the N-terminal pleckstrin homology-GRAM domain and Cys413 within the phosphatase domain of MTMR3. In MTMR3-deficient macrophages, reducing the enhanced autophagy or restoring NFκB signaling rescued PRR-induced cytokines. Macrophages from rs713875 CC IBD risk carriers demonstrated increased MTMR3 expression and, in turn, decreased PRR-induced PtdIns3P and autophagy and increased PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, signaling, and cytokine secretion. Thus, the rs713875 IBD risk polymorphism increases MTMR3 expression, which modulates PRR-induced outcomes, ultimately leading to enhanced PRR-induced cytokines.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26479789>The phosphatase DUSP2 controls the activity of the transcription activator STAT3 and regulates TH17 differentiation.</a></h1><p>Deregulation of the TH17 subset of helper T cells is closely linked with immunological disorders and  . However, the mechanism by which TH17 cells are regulated remains elusive. Here we found that the phosphatase DUSP2 (PAC1) negatively regulated the development of TH17 cells. DUSP2 was directly associated with the signal transducer and transcription activator STAT3 and attenuated its activity through dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 and Ser727. DUSP2-deficient mice exhibited severe susceptibility to experimental colitis, with enhanced differentiation of TH17 cells and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In clinical patients with ulcerative colitis, DUSP2 was downregulated by DNA methylation and was not induced during T cell activation. Our data demonstrate that DUSP2 is a true STAT3 phosphatase that modulates the development of TH17 cells in the autoimmune response and inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26811645>Protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 and .</a></h1><p>Genome wide association studies have associated single nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene locus encoding protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) with the onset of  (IBD) and other  disorders. Expression of PTPN2 is enhanced in actively inflamed intestinal tissue featuring a marked up-regulation in intestinal epithelial cells. PTPN2 deficient mice suffer from severe intestinal and systemic inflammation and display aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses. In particular, PTPN2 is involved in the regulation of  signalling cascades, and critical for protecting intestinal epithelial barrier function, regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, and finally for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. On one hand, dysfunction of PTPN2 has drastic effects on innate host defence mechanisms, including increased secretion of pro- cytokines, limited autophagosome formation in response to invading pathogens, and disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier. On the other hand, PTPN2 function is crucial for controlling adaptive immune functions, by regulating T cell proliferation and differentiation as well as maintaining T cell tolerance. In this way, dysfunction of PTPN2 contributes to the manifestation of IBD. The aim of this review is to present an overview of recent findings on the role of PTPN2 in intestinal homeostasis and the impact of dysfunctional PTPN2 on intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24376661>Intestinal upregulation of melanin-concentrating hormone in TNBS-induced enterocolitis in adult zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), an evolutionarily conserved appetite-regulating neuropeptide, has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of  (IBD). Expression of MCH is upregulated in inflamed intestinal mucosa in humans with colitis and MCH-deficient mice treated with trinitrobenzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) develop an attenuated form of colitis compared to wild type animals. Zebrafish have emerged as a new animal model of IBD, although the majority of the reported studies concern zebrafish larvae. Regulation MCH expression in the adult zebrafish intestine remains unknown.In the present study we induced enterocolitis in adult zebrafish by intrarectal administration of TNBS. Follow-up included survival analysis, histological assessment of changes in intestinal architecture, and assessment of intestinal infiltration by myeloperoxidase positive cells and cytokine transcript levels.Treatment with TNBS dose-dependently reduced fish survival. This response required the presence of an intact microbiome, since fish pre-treated with vancomycin developed less severe enterocolitis. At 6 hours post-challenge, we detected a significant influx of myeloperoxidase positive cells in the intestine and upregulation of both proinflammatory and anti- cytokines. Most importantly, and in analogy to human IBD and TNBS-induced mouse experimental colitis, we found increased intestinal expression of MCH and its receptor in TNBS-treated zebrafish.Taken together these findings not only establish a model of chemically-induced experimental enterocolitis in adult zebrafish, but point to effects of MCH in intestinal inflammation that are conserved across species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140405>Tofacitinib in ulcerative colitis.</a></h1><p>Cytokines orchestrate immune and  responses involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). Protein kinases are essential for signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of protein  kinases that play a pivotal role in cytokine receptor signaling. Indeed, a major subgroup of cytokines use Type I and II cytokine receptors which signal via the activation of JAKs. Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that has been studied in autoimmune pathologies, including UC and rheumatoid arthritis with good overall efficacy and acceptable safety profile. This literature review was performed with the goal of summarizing the knowledge on JAK inhibitors in UC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581833>Role of protein  phosphatases in regulating the immune system: implications for chronic intestinal inflammation.</a></h1><p>Current hypothesis suggests that genetic, immunological, and bacterial factors contribute essentially to the pathogenesis of . Variations within the gene loci encoding protein  phosphatases (PTPs) have been associated with the onset of . PTPs modulate the activity of their substrates by dephosphorylation of  residues and are critical for the regulation of fundamental cellular signaling processes. Evidence emerges that expression levels of PTPN2, PTPN11, and PTPN22 are altered in actively inflamed intestinal tissue. PTPN2 seems to be critical for protecting intestinal epithelial barrier function, regulating innate and adaptive immune responses and finally for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These observations have been confirmed in PTPN2 knockout mice in vivo. Those animals are clearly more susceptible to intestinal and systemic inflammation and feature alterations in innate and adaptive immune responses. PTPN22 controls  signaling in lymphocytes and mononuclear cells resulting in aberrant cytokine secretion pattern and autophagosome formation. PTPN22 deficiency in vivo results in more severe colitis demonstrating the relevance of PTPN22 for intestinal homeostasis in vivo. Of note, loss of PTPN22 promotes mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced cytokine secretion but limits secretion of nuclear factor κB-associated cytokines and autophagy in mononuclear cells. Loss of PTPN11 is also associated with increased colitis severity in vivo. In summary, dysfunction of those PTPs results in aberrant and uncontrolled immune responses that result in chronic  conditions. This way, it becomes more and more evident that dysfunction of PTPs displays an important factor in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation, in particular .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23518806>Association between the PTPN2 gene and Crohn's : dissection of potential causal variants.</a></h1><p>Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent meta-analyses have confirmed associations between the PTPN2 (protein  phosphatase, nonreceptor type 2) gene and Crohn's  (CD), the potential causal variants remain unidentified. We aimed to dissect potential causal CD-associated PTPN2 variants, assess their functional significance, and relate PTPN2 protein expression with inflammation in CD.A 3-stage study was carried out. In stage 1, we genotyped tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag-SNPs) in the PTPN2 gene in a sample of patients with CD (<20 years, n = 556) and controls (n = 602). In stage 2, we resequenced the putative promoter, target exons and introns in the PTPN2 gene, and examined associations with high-frequency variants with CD in the stage 1 cohort. In stage 3 we studied the relationship between PTPN2 protein expression and mucosal inflammation and carried out in silico analyses to study the functional characteristics of the PTPN2 CD-associated SNPs.In stage 1, we observed associations between 5 intronic SNPs and CD including rs1893217 (P = 2 × 10⁻⁴), the SNP that is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with the lead genome-wide association studies SNP rs2542151. Resequencing revealed 2 known promoter polymorphisms. No associations between these promoter SNPs and CD were evident. In silico analyses revealed that the 5 associated intronic SNPs influenced PTPN2 expression and binding to important transcription factors. PTPN2 protein was overexpressed in inflamed intestinal tissues of patients with CD.Our findings suggest that noncoding variation in the PTPN2 gene may represent the causal variations influencing susceptibility for CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25998054>The kinase DYRK1A reciprocally regulates the differentiation of Th17 and regulatory T cells.</a></h1><p>The balance between Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells critically modulates immune homeostasis, with an inadequate Treg response contributing to  . Using an unbiased chemical biology approach, we identified a novel role for the dual specificity -phosphorylation-regulated kinase DYRK1A in regulating this balance. Inhibition of DYRK1A enhances Treg differentiation and impairs Th17 differentiation without affecting known pathways of Treg/Th17 differentiation. Thus, DYRK1A represents a novel mechanistic node at the branch point between commitment to either Treg or Th17 lineages. Importantly, both Treg cells generated using the DYRK1A inhibitor harmine and direct administration of harmine itself potently attenuate inflammation in multiple experimental models of systemic autoimmunity and mucosal inflammation. Our results identify DYRK1A as a physiologically relevant regulator of Treg cell differentiation and suggest a broader role for other DYRK family members in immune homeostasis.

Here we have analysed the effects of autophagy stimulators on murine colitis.Mice were treated with intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) (3.5 mg·20 g ) and body weight was measured daily. Histological damage was scored 2 or 4 days after treatment. Some mice received trehalose (3% in drinking water 3 weeks before TNBS administration) or a daily administration of rapamycin (1.25 mg·kg , i.p.), betanin (1 g·kg , i.p.) or betanin + 3-methyladenine (3MA) (10 mg·kg , i.p.). Protein levels of p-mTOR, p62, LC3, BCL10, NFκB, IκBα and p-IκBα in mucosa were determined by Western blots and mRNA expression of TNFα, IL1β, IL6, IL10, COX2, CCR7, CD11c, inducible NOS and CD86 by qRT-PCR.Impaired autophagy associated with body weight loss and intestinal damage was detected in the mucosa of TNBS-treated mice. Administration of trehalose, rapamycin or betanin prevented the impaired autophagic flux induced by TNBS and decreased mucosal protein levels of BCL10, p-IκBα and NFκB-p65 and the expression of pro- cytokines and M1 macrophage markers. Blockade of autophagosome formation by treatment with 3MA, prevented the reduction in protein levels of p62, BCL10, p-IκBα and NFκB-p65 induced by betanin in TNBS-treated mice and weakened the protective effects of betanin on murine colitis.Pharmacological stimulation of mucosal autophagy reduced intestinal inflammation and improved murine colitis.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23600834>Paediatric Crohn  patients with stricturing behaviour exhibit ileal granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibody production and reduced neutrophil bacterial killing and GM-CSF bioactivity.</a></h1><p>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies are associated with stricturing behaviour in Crohn  (CD). We hypothesized that CD ileal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) would produce GM-CSF autoantibodies and peripheral blood (PB) samples would contain GM-CSF neutralizing capacity (NC). Paediatric CD and control PBMC and ileal biopsies or LPMC were isolated and cultured and GM-CSF, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and GM-CSF autoantibodies production were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Basal and GM-CSF-primed neutrophil bacterial killing and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)  phosphorylation (pSTAT5) were measured by flow cytometry. GM-CSF autoantibodies were enriched within total IgG for LPMC isolated from CD ileal strictures and proximal margins compared to control ileum. Neutrophil bacterial killing was reduced in CD patients compared to controls. Within CD, neutrophil GM-CSF-dependent STAT5 activation and bacterial killing were reduced as GM-CSF autoantibodies increased. GM-CSF stimulation of pSTAT5 did not vary between controls and CD patients in washed PB granulocytes in which serum was removed. However, GM-CSF stimulation of pSTAT5 was reduced in whole PB samples from CD patients. These data were used to calculate the GM-CSF NC. CD patients with GM-CSF NC greater than 25% exhibited a fourfold higher rate of stricturing behaviour and surgery. The likelihood ratio (95% confidence interval) for stricturing behaviour for patients with elevation in both GM-CSF autoantibodies and GM-CSF NC was equal to 5 (2, 11). GM-CSF autoantibodies are produced by LPMC isolated from CD ileal resection specimens and are associated with reduced neutrophil bacterial killing. CD peripheral blood contains GM-CSF NC, which is associated with increased rates of stricturing behaviour.© 2013 British Society for Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23406209>Association of ZAP70 and PTPN6, but Not BANK1 or CLEC2D, with  in the Tunisian population.</a></h1><p> (IBDs), consisting of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD), are complex disorders with multiple genes contributing to  pathogenesis. We aimed to identify the associations of genetic variations in the ZAP70, PTPN6, BANK1, and CLEC2D genes encoding for intracellular signaling molecules with IBDs. One hundred seven patients (39 CD and 68 UC) with IBD and 162 healthy control subjects from the Southern Tunisia were recruited. We genotyped 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZAP70 (rs1020396, rs11686881, rs13420683, and rs17695937), 2 SNPs in PTPN6 (rs7310161 and rs759052), 3 SNPs in BANK1 (rs10516487, rs17266594, and rs3733197), and 1 SNP in CLEC2D (rs3764021). ZAP70 displayed a strong genetic association with CD for rs13420683 [allele C, p=0.003, P(corr)=0.006, odds ratio (OR)=2.25 (1.32; 3.85); genotype CC, p=0.016, P(corr)=0.048, OR=2.57 (1.22; 5.41)]. However, in UC, a weak association with PTPN6 was observed [TT (p=0.01; P(corr)=0.03; OR=2.11 (1.18; 3.76)]. No significant association in the BANK1 and CLEC2D genes was observed. These results suggest the involvement of the ZAP70 and PTPN6 genes in the genetic component conferring a general susceptibility to CD and UC, respectively.

Although protein  kinase 6 (PTK6, also known as breast tumor kinase BRK) has been primarily studied in an oncogenic context, it was noted that PTK6 null mice exhibited significantly enhanced colonic epithelial barrier function. Considering that the  functions of PTK6 have not yet been explored, we hypothesized that cytokines responsible for mediating IBD, such as TNFα/IFNγ, may solicit the action of PTK6 to alter barrier function. After first assessing critical mediators of TNFα/IFNγ driven epithelial barrier dysfunction, we further explored the possibility of PTK6 in this  context. In this report, we showed that PTK6 siRNA and PTK6 null young adult mouse colonic epithelial cells (YAMC) exhibited significant attenuation of TNFα/IFNγ induced barrier dysfunction as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assay and permeability assays. In addition, PTK6 null cells transfected with PTK6 cDNA displayed restored barrier dysfunction in response to TNFα/IFNγ, while the cells transfected with vector alone showed similar attenuation of barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, using subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry experiments, we found that PTK6 plays a role in FoxO1 nuclear accumulation leading to down-regulation of claudin-3, a tight junction protein. Moreover, we searched for relevant miRNA candidates putative for targeting PTK6 in order to identify and assess the impact of microRNA that target PTK6 with respect to TNFα/IFNγ induced barrier dysfunction. Subsequently, we assayed likely targets and determined their effectiveness in attenuating PTK6 expression as well as cytokine induced barrier dysfunction. Results showed that miR-93 reduced PTK6 expression and attenuated TNFα/IFNγ imposed decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), as well as excluded FoxO1 from the nucleus. Our results indicate that PTK6 may act as a novel mediator of intestinal epithelial permeability during  injury, and miR-93 may protect intestinal epithelial barrier function, at least in part, by targeting PTK6.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429852>Protein  Phosphatases: Regulators of CD4 T Cells in .</a></h1><p>Protein  phosphatases (PTPs) play a critical role in co-ordinating the signaling networks that maintain lymphocyte homeostasis and direct lymphocyte activation. By dephosphorylating  residues, PTPs have been shown to modulate enzyme activity and both mediate and disrupt protein-protein interactions. Through these molecular mechanisms, PTPs ultimately impact lymphocyte responses to environmental cues such as  cytokines and chemokines, as well as antigenic stimulation. Mouse models of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation have been shown to be exacerbated in the absence of PTPs such as PTPN2 and PTPN22. This increase in  severity is due in part to hyper-activation of lymphocytes in the absence of PTP activity. In accordance, human PTPs have been linked to intestinal inflammation. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified several PTPs within risk loci for  (IBD). Therapeutically targeting PTP substrates and their associated signaling pathways, such as those implicated in CD4 T cell responses, has demonstrated clinical efficacy.

These include 439 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which we study in detail using whole genome bisulphite sequencing. We replicate the top DMP (RPS6KA2) and DMRs (VMP1, ITGB2 and TXK) in an independent cohort. Using paired genetic and epigenetic data, we delineate methylation quantitative trait loci; VMP1/microRNA-21 methylation associates with two polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with a known IBD susceptibility variant. Separated cell data shows that IBD-associated hypermethylation within the TXK promoter region negatively correlates with gene expression in whole-blood and CD8 T cells, but not other cell types. Thus, site-specific DNA methylation changes in IBD relate to underlying genotype and associate with cell-specific alteration in gene expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994241>Characterization of PTPN2 and its use as a biomarker.</a></h1><p>For years, the two main isoforms of PTPN2 have been an interesting yet academic topic of debate for researchers working on this phosphatase.

Epidemiologic,  and treatment characteristics were analysed for an association with the presence of one of the rs1893217 genotypes 'homozygous wild-type' (TT), 'heterozygous' (CT) and 'homozygous variant' (CC).About 2.88% of IBD patients were identified with CC, 26.8% with CT and 70.4% with TT genotype. The CC-genotype was associated with the existence of gallstones in CD and pancolitis in UC patients. The presence of the C-allele (i.e. either CC or CT genotype) was associated with the onset of uveitis, but protected from aphthous oral ulcers in CD patients. UC patients carrying a C-allele were diagnosed at an older age but required intestinal surgery more often. The presence of the C-allele was associated with a successful treatment with anti-TNF antibodies in both CD and UC patients.IBD patients carrying the C-allele of PTPN2 SNP rs1893217 are at greater risk for developing a severe  course but are more likely to respond to treatment with anti-TNF antibodies.

These include genes, proteins (eg, antibodies, receptors, enzymes, inhibitors), recombinant proteins, and fusion proteins. Biologics often are produced using recombinant DNA technology. For example, monoclonal antibodies are produced by inserting human genes into immortalized cell cultures, which then produce the gene product (ie, an antibody) in large quantity. Another approach is to fuse genetic material from nonhuman sources (eg, mice) with human genetic material. The fused gene is inserted into a tissue culture that produces the gene product (ie, a chimeric monoclonal antibody). Biologics are used to manage many conditions, including malignant and nonmalignant conditions. They are widely used in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( [formerly  or ])-positive breast cancer. They also are used in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, and colorectal and lung cancer. Biologics improve outcomes in autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, , and multiple sclerosis.

PTPN22 is involved in the regulation of T- and B-cell receptor signaling, but although it is highly expressed in innate immune cells, its function in other signaling pathways is less clear. Here, we study whether loss of PTPN22 controls muramyl-dipeptide (MDP)-induced signaling and effects in immune cells.Stable knockdown of PTPN22 was induced in THP-1 cells by shRNA transduction prior to stimulation with the NOD2 ligand MDP. Cells were analyzed for signaling protein activation and mRNA expression by Western blot and quantitative PCR; cytokine secretion was assessed by ELISA, autophagosome induction by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were obtained from PTPN22 knockout mice or wild-type animals.MDP-treatment induced PTPN22 expression and activity in human and mouse cells. Knockdown of PTPN22 enhanced MDP-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-isoforms p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase as well as canonical NF-κB signaling molecules in THP-1 cells and BMDC derived from PTPN22 knockout mice. Loss of PTPN22 enhanced mRNA levels and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and TNF in THP-1 cells and PTPN22 knockout BMDC. Additionally, loss of PTPN22 resulted in increased, MDP-mediated autophagy in human and mouse cells.Our data demonstrate that PTPN22 controls NOD2 signaling, and loss of PTPN22 renders monocytes more reactive towards bacterial products, what might explain the association of PTPN22 variants with IBD pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457781>PTPN2 gene variants are associated with susceptibility to both Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis supporting a common genetic  background.</a></h1><p>Genome-wide association studies identified PTPN2 (protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 2) as susceptibility gene for  (IBD). However, the exact role of PTPN2 in Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and its phenotypic effect are unclear. We therefore performed a detailed genotype-phenotype and epistasis analysis of PTPN2 gene variants.Genomic DNA from 2131 individuals of Caucasian origin (905 patients with CD, 318 patients with UC, and 908 healthy, unrelated controls) was analyzed for two SNPs in the PTPN2 region (rs2542151, rs7234029) for which associations with IBD were found in previous studies in other cohorts. Our analysis revealed a significant association of PTPN2 SNP rs2542151 with both susceptibility to CD (p = 1.95×10⁻⁵; OR 1.49 [1.34-1.79]) and UC (p = 3.87×10⁻², OR 1.31 [1.02-1.68]). Moreover, PTPN2 SNP rs7234029 demonstrated a significant association with susceptibility to CD (p = 1.30×10⁻³; OR 1.35 [1.13-1.62]) and a trend towards association with UC (p = 7.53×10⁻²; OR 1.26 [0.98-1.62]). Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed an association of PTPN2 SNP rs7234029 with a stricturing  phenotype (B2) in CD patients (p = 6.62×10⁻³). Epistasis analysis showed weak epistasis between the ATG16L1 SNP rs2241879 and PTPN2 SNP rs2542151 (p = 0.024) in CD and between ATG16L1 SNP rs4663396 and PTPN2 SNP rs7234029 (p = 4.68×10⁻³) in UC. There was no evidence of epistasis between PTPN2 and NOD2 and PTPN2 and IL23R.

Together, these observations suggest that ErbB4 induction may be a protective response. However, the effects of ErbB4 signaling in the colonic epithelium in vivo are not known. Furthermore, previous work on ErbB4 used ligands shared with other receptors, raising the question of whether the observed responses are explicitly due to ErbB4. In this study, we used the ErbB4-specific ligand neuregulin-4 (NRG4) to activate ErbB4 and define its role in colonocyte biology. NRG4 treatment, either in cultured cells or in mice, blocked colonic epithelial apoptosis induced by TNF and IFN-γ. It was also protective in a murine experimental colitis model. NRG4 stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB4 but not other ErbB receptors, indicating that this is a specific response. Furthermore, in contrast to related ligands, NRG4 enhanced cell survival but not proliferation or migration, and stimulated phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic mediator Akt but not ERK MAPK. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling reversed the anti-apoptotic effects of NRG4, confirming the role of this cascade in NRG4-induced cell survival. With regard to the potential clinical importance of this pathway, NRG4 expression was decreased in human  samples and mouse models of colitis, suggesting that activation of ErbB4 is altered in .

A critical function of the intestinal epithelium is formation of a selective barrier to luminal contents. The structural units of the epithelium that regulate barrier function are the tight junctions (TJs), and the protein composition of the TJ determines the tightness of the barrier. Claudin-2 is a TJ protein that increases permeability to cations and reduces transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). We previously showed that transient knockdown (KD) of TCPTP permits increased expression of claudin-2 by IFN-γ. Here, we demonstrate that the decreased TER in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells is alleviated by STAT1 KD. Moreover, increased claudin-2 in TCPTP-deficient cells requires enhanced STAT1 activation and STAT1 binding to the CLDN2 promoter. We also show that mutation of this STAT-binding site prevents elevated CLDN2 promoter activity in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells.

It is important to be aware of this association as both conditions can present with similar clinical features, however, require different therapeutic approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538494>Anti-melanin-concentrating hormone treatment attenuates chronic experimental colitis and fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Fibrosis represents a major complication of several chronic , including  (IBD). Treatment of IBD remains a clinical challenge despite several recent therapeutic advances. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide shown to regulate appetite and energy balance. However, accumulating evidence suggests that MCH has additional biological effects, including modulation of inflammation. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of an MCH-blocking antibody in treating established, dextran sodium sulfate-induced experimental colitis. Histological and molecular analysis of mouse tissues revealed that mice receiving anti-MCH had accelerated mucosal restitution and lower colonic expression of several proinflammatory cytokines, as well as fibrogenic genes, including COL1A1. In parallel, they spared collagen deposits seen in the untreated mice, suggesting attenuated fibrosis. These findings raised the possibility of perhaps direct effects of MCH on myofibroblasts. Indeed, in biopsies from patients with IBD, we demonstrate expression of the MCH receptor MCHR1 in α-smooth muscle actin(+) subepithelial cells. CCD-18Co cells, a primary human colonic myofibroblast cell line, were also positive for MCHR1. In these cells, MCH acted as a profibrotic modulator by potentiating the effects of IGF-1 and TGF-β on proliferation and collagen production. Thus, by virtue of combined anti- and anti-fibrotic effects, blocking MCH might represent a compelling approach for treating IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22937039>Fc gamma receptor CD64 modulates the inhibitory activity of infliximab.</a></h1><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important cytokine in the pathogenesis of  (IBD). Anti-TNF antibodies have been successfully implemented in IBD therapy, however their efficacies differ among IBD patients. Here we investigate the influence of CD64 Fc receptor on the inhibitory activity of anti-TNFs in cells of intestinal wall.Intestinal cell lines, monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used as models. The efficacies of adalimumab, infliximab and certolizumab-pegol were assessed by RT-PCR for target genes. Protein levels and localizations were examined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Antibody fragments were obtained by proteolytic digestion, immunoprecipitation and protein chip analysis. Knock-down of specific gene expression was performed using siRNAs.Infliximab had limited efficacy towards soluble TNF in cell types expressing Fc gamma receptor CD64. Both adalimumab and infliximab had lower efficacies in PBMCs of IBD patients, which express elevated levels of CD64. Infliximab-TNF complexes were more potent in activating CD64 in THP-1 cells than adalimumab, which was accompanied by distinct phospho- signals. Blocking Fc parts and isolation of Fab fragments of infliximab improved its efficacy. IFN-γ-induced expression of CD64 correlated with a loss of efficacy of infliximab, whereas reduction of CD64 expression by either siRNA or PMA treatment improved inhibitory activity of this drug. Colonic mRNA expression levels of CD64 and other Fc gamma receptors were significantly increased in the inflamed tissues of infliximab non-responders.CD64 modulates the efficacy of infliximab both in vitro and ex vivo, whereas the presence of this receptor has no impact on the inhibitory activity of certolizumab-pegol, which lacks Fc fragment. These data could be helpful in both predicting and evaluating the outcome of anti-TNF therapy in IBD patients with elevated systemic and local levels of Fc receptors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24040033>Activation of protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 by spermidine exerts anti- effects in human THP-1 monocytes and in a mouse model of acute colitis.</a></h1><p>Spermidine is a dietary polyamine that is able to activate protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2). As PTPN2 is known to be a negative regulator of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-induced responses, and IFN-γ stimulation of immune cells is a critical process in the immunopathology of  (IBD), we wished to explore the potential of spermidine for reducing pro- effects in vitro and in vivo.Human THP-1 monocytes were treated with IFN-γ and/or spermidine. Protein expression and phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blot, cytokine expression by quantitative-PCR, and cytokine secretion by ELISA. Colitis was induced in mice by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) administration.  severity was assessed by recording body weight, colonoscopy and histology.Spermidine increased expression and activity of PTPN2 in THP-1 monocytes and reduced IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and 3, as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in a PTPN2 dependent manner. Subsequently, IFN-γ-induced expression/secretion of intracellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 mRNA, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and interleukin (IL)-6 was reduced in spermidine-treated cells. The latter effects were absent in PTPN2-knockdown cells. In mice with DSS-induced colitis, spermidine treatment resulted in ameliorated weight loss and decreased mucosal damage indicating reduced  severity.Activation of PTPN2 by spermidine ameliorates IFN-γ-induced  responses in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, spermidine treatment significantly reduces  severity in mice with DSS-induced colitis; hence, spermidine supplementation and subsequent PTPN2 activation may be helpful in the treatment of chronic intestinal inflammation such as IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462267>Novel Compound Heterozygote Mutation in IL10RA in a Patient With Very Early-Onset .</a></h1><p>Very early-onset  (VEO-IBD) is often associated with monogenetic disorders. IL-10RA deficiency is one of the major causal mutations in VEO-IBD. Here, we aimed to identify the causal mutation associated with severe IBD in a 1-year-old patient, validate the pathogenicity of the mutation, and characterize the mutant protein.To identify the causal mutation, targeted exome sequencing (ES) was performed using the genomic DNA from the patient. To validate the pathogenicity, IL-10RA functional tests were performed using the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, flow cytometry analysis, confocal microscopy on overexpressed green fluorescent protein-fused mutants, and computational analysis on the structures of IL-10RA proteins were performed.We identified a novel compound heterozygote mutation p.[Tyr91Cys];[Pro146Alafs*40] in the IL10RA gene of the patient. The missense variant p.Tyr91Cys was previously identified but not functionally tested, and a frameshift variant, p.Pro146Alafs*40, is novel and nonfunctional. PBMCs from the patient showed defective signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. The p.Tyr91Cys mutant protein failed to properly localize on the plasma membrane. The p.Tyr91Cys mutation seems to disrupt the hydrophobic core structure surrounding the  91 residue, causing structural instability.Targeted ES and linkage analysis identified novel compound heterozygous mutations p.[Tyr91Cys];[Pro146Alafs*40] in the IL10RA gene of a child with severe VEO-IBD. p.Tyr91Cys proteins were functionally defective in IL-10RA signaling and failed to properly localize on the plasma membrane, probably due to its structural instability.© 2018 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

In particular, growth-restricted infants or infants born prematurely may develop a severe form of intestinal inflammation known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which has a high mortality. Milk provides a multitude of proteins with anti- properties and in this review we gather together some recent significant advances regarding the isolation and proteomic identification of these minor constituents of both human and bovine milk. We introduce the process of inflammation, with a focus on the immature gut, and describe how a multitude of milk proteins act against the  process according to both in vitro and in vivo studies. We highlight the effects of milk proteins such as caseins, and of whey proteins such as alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, osteopontin, immunoglobulins, trefoil factors, lactoperoxidase, superoxide dismutase, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, alkaline phosphatase, and growth factors (TGF-β, IGF-I and IGF-II, EGF, HB-EGF). The effects of milk fat globule proteins, such as TLR-2, TLR-4, sCD14 and MFG-E8/lactadherin, are also discussed. Finally, we indicate how milk proteins could be useful for the prophylaxis and therapy of intestinal inflammation in infants and children.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Both Crohn's  and T1D have a profound impact on the lives of patients and it is pivotal to investigate the genetic role in patients acquiring these . Understanding the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in key genes in patients suffering from T1D and Crohn's  is crucial to finding an effective treatment and generating novel therapeutic drugs. This review article is focused on the impact of SNP's in PTPN2 (protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 2) and PTPN22 (protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 22) on the development of Crohn's  and T1D. The PTPN2 gene mutation in T1D patients play a direct role in the destruction of beta cells while in Crohn's  patients, it modulates the innate immune responses. The PTPN22 gene mutations also play a role in both  by modulating intracellular signaling. Examining the mechanism through which these genes increase the susceptibility to both  and gaining a better understanding of their structure and function is of vital importance to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes and Crohn's .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24045942>Role of Janus kinase 3 in mucosal differentiation and predisposition to colitis.</a></h1><p>Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a nonreceptor  kinase expressed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Previously, we characterized the functions of Jak3 in cytoskeletal remodeling, epithelial wound healing, and mucosal homeostasis. However, the role of Jak3 in mucosal differentiation and  was not known. In this report, we characterize the role of Jak3 in mucosal differentiation, basal colonic inflammation, and predisposition toward colitis. Using the Jak3 knock-out (KO) mouse model, we show that Jak3 is expressed in colonic mucosa of mice, and the loss of mucosal expression of Jak3 resulted in reduced expression of differentiation markers for the cells of both enterocytic and secretory lineages. Jak3 KO mice showed reduced expression of colonic villin, carbonic anhydrase, secretory mucin muc2, and increased basal colonic inflammation reflected by increased levels of pro- cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A in colon along with increased colonic myeloperoxidase activity. The inflammations in KO mice were associated with shortening of colon length, reduced cecum length, decreased crypt heights, and increased severity toward dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. In differentiated human colonic epithelial cells, Jak3 redistributed to basolateral surfaces and interacted with adherens junction (AJ) protein β-catenin. Jak3 expression in these cells was essential for AJ localization of β-catenin and maintenance of epithelial barrier functions. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in the colon where it facilitated mucosal differentiation by promoting the expression of differentiation markers and enhanced colonic barrier functions through AJ localization of β-catenin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30504685>Nitric Oxide Is Involved in Activation of Toll-Like Receptor 4 Signaling through  Nitration of Src Homology Protein  Phosphatase 2 in Murine Dextran Sulfate-Induced Colitis.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis is characterized by colonic mucosal bleeding and ulceration, often with repeated active and remission stages. One factor in ulcerative colitis development is increased susceptibility to commensal bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS activates macrophages to release nitric oxide (NO) through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. However, whether NO is beneficial or detrimental to colitis remains controversial. In this study, we investigated whether NO enhances the development of colitis in mice treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and inflammation in cells treated with low-dose LPS. An NO donor, NOC18, induced colitis and increased CD14 protein and nitrotyrosine levels in colonic macrophages from mice treated with DSS for 7 d (molecular weight: 5000). In the mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line RAW264.7 stimulated with 3 ng/mL LPS, NO activated the CD14-TLR4-nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) axis. Low-dose LPS stimulation did not change the levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation, CD14, inducible NO synthase, interleukin (IL)-6, or NF-κB. In addition, low-dose LPS increased phosphorylation of src homology protein  phosphatase 2 (SHP2), a negative regulator of STAT3 phosphorylation. However, NO decreased SHP2 phosphorylation and significantly activated the downstream signaling molecules. NO increased SHP2 nitration in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and DSS-treated mice. These results indicate that SHP2 nitration in macrophages might be involved in activation of the CD14-TLR4-NF-κB axis through STAT3 signaling in mice with DSS-induced colitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974994>Replication study of ulcerative colitis risk loci in a Lithuanian-Latvian case-control sample.</a></h1><p>Differences between populations might be reflected in their different genetic risk maps to complex , for example, . We here investigated the role of known -associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) from the Northeastern European countries Lithuania and Latvia and evaluated possible epistatic interactions between these genetic variants.We investigated 77 SNPs derived from 5 previously published genome-wide association studies for Crohn's  and UC. Our study panel comprised 444 Lithuanian and Latvian patients with UC and 1154 healthy controls. Single marker case-control association and SNP-SNP epistasis analyses were performed.We found 14 SNPs tagging 9 loci, including 21q21.1, NKX2-3, MST1, the HLA region, 1p36.13, IL10, JAK2, ORMDL3, and IL23R, to be associated with UC. Interestingly, the association of UC with previously identified variants in the HLA region was not the strongest association in our study (P = 4.34 × 10, odds ratio [OR] = 1.25), which is in contrast to all previously published studies. No association with any  subphenotype was found. SNP-SNP interaction analysis showed significant epistasis between SNPs in the PTPN22 (rs2476601) and C13orf31 (rs3764147) genes and increased risk for UC (P = 1.64 × 10, OR = 2.44). The association has been confirmed in the Danish study group (P = 0.04, OR = 3.25).We confirmed the association of the 9 loci (21q21.1, 1p36.13, NKX2-3, MST1, the HLA region, IL10, JAK2, ORMDL3, and IL23R) with UC in the Lithuanian-Latvian population.

Diverse expression between CSF-1 and IL-34, suggest that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. Receptor-type protein- phosphatase ζ (PTPRZ1, RPTP-ζ), an additional IL-34 receptor, was recently identified. Here, we aimed to assess PTPRZ1 expression in IBD and non-IBD intestinal biopsies. Further, we aimed to investigate cellular PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R expression, and cytokine- and chemokine responses by IL-34 and CSF-1. The expression of PTPRZ1 was higher in non-IBD colon compared to ileum. PTPRZ1 expression was not altered with inflammation in IBD, however, correlated to IL34, CSF1, and CSF1R. The expression patterns of PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R differed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cell line. PBMCs and monocytes of the same donors responded differently to IL-34 and CSF-1 with altered expression of tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, interferon γ (IFN-γ), IL-13, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. This study shows that PTPRZ1 was expressed in  tissue. Furthermore, CSF-1R protein was detected in an intestinal epithelial cell line and donor dependently in primary PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages, and first hints also suggest an expression in these cells for PTPRZ1, which may mediate IL-34 and CSF-1 actions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384859>The PTPN22 C1858T (R620W) functional polymorphism in .</a></h1><p>In view of the discrepant data regarding the association between the protein  phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) rs2476601 (R620W, 1858C→T) polymorphism and susceptibility to autoimmune  including  (IBD), we investigated whether this functional single-nucleotide polymorphism influences IBD risk in a group of Moroccan patients.This is the first report on the prevalence of PTPN22 (R620W) variant in a Moroccan cohort. No evidence of statistically significant differences was observed when the PTPN22 (R620W) allele and genotype distribution among IBD, Crohn's  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and healthy controls were compared.

In the present study, we observed that azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate treatments induced increasingly severe colorectal mucosal inflammation and the intratumoural accumulation of CAFs. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 and FGF-3 were detected in infiltrating cells, and FGFR4, the specific receptor for FGF-1 and FGF-3, was detected in colon cancer tissues. The phosphorylation of FGFR4 enhanced the production of metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Mek)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), which was accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation. Moreover, we separated CAFs, pericarcinoma fibroblasts (PFs), and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from human colon tissue specimens to characterize the function of CAFs. We observed that CAFs secrete more FGF-1/-3 than NFs and PFs and promote cancer cell growth and angiogenesis through the activation of FGFR4, which is followed by the activation of Mek/Erk and the modulation of MMP-7 expression. The administration of FGF-1/-3-neutralizing antibodies or the treatment of cells with FGFR4 siRNA or the FGFR4 inhibitor PD173074 markedly suppressed colon cancer cell proliferation and neovascularization. These observations suggest a crucial role for CAFs and FGF signaling in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer. The inhibition of the FGF signaling pathway may be a useful strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.© 2015 The Authors.

A recent study demonstrated that PTPN2 regulates ER stress signalling in pancreatic β-cells. Therefore, we investigated whether PTPN2 regulates ER stress pathways, apoptosis and cytokine secretion in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and monocytes.THP-1 and HT-29 IECs were stimulated with 2 µg/ml tunicamycin (TNM) for the indicated periods of time. For knockdown experiments, cells were transfected using a mixture of three different PTPN2-specific siRNA oligonucleotides. Cell lysates were analysed by Western blot and real-time PCR. Cytokine secretion was studied by ELISA measurements of cell culture supernatant.TNM treatment reduced PTPN2 protein levels in HT-29 IECs and THP-1 monocytes. Knockdown of PTPN2 in THP-1 monocytes led to an exaggerated induction of phospho-eIF2α, enhanced PARP cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, and attenuated IL-8 and TNF secretion upon TNM stimulation. In HT-29 cells PTPN2 deficiency caused reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α and PARP cleavage under ER stress conditions.Whereas the knockdown of PTPN2 made THP-1 cells more susceptible to ER stress, PTPN2 deficiency reduced ER stress responses in HT-29 IECs. This suggests that PTPN2 regulates adaptation to ER stress in a cell type-specific manner.© 2015 S.

FPR signaling and function have been extensively studied in phagocytes, yet their functional biology in epithelia is poorly understood. We describe a novel intestinal epithelial FPR signaling pathway that is activated by an endogenous FPR ligand, annexin A1 (ANXA1), and its cleavage product Ac2-26, which mediate activation of ROS by an epithelial NADPH oxidase, NOX1. We show that epithelial cell migration was regulated by this signaling cascade through oxidative inactivation of the regulatory phosphatases PTEN and PTP-PEST, with consequent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. In vivo studies using intestinal epithelial specific Nox1(-/-IEC) and AnxA1(-/-) mice demonstrated defects in intestinal mucosal wound repair, while systemic administration of ANXA1 promoted wound recovery in a NOX1-dependent fashion. Additionally, increased ANXA1 expression was observed in the intestinal epithelium and infiltrating leukocytes in the mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients compared with normal intestinal mucosa. Our findings delineate a novel epithelial FPR1/NOX1-dependent redox signaling pathway that promotes mucosal wound repair.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668352>Plasma free amino acid profile in quiescent  patients orally administered with Mastiha (Pistacia lentiscus); a randomised clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Natural products have been studied regarding their effectiveness on  (IBD).To examine the effects of Mastiha (Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia) on clinical course and amino acid (AA) profile of patients in remission.This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Patients (n = 68) were randomly allocated to Mastiha (2.8  g/day) or placebo adjunct to stable medication. Free AAs were identified applying Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry in plasma. Medical-dietary history,  Questionnaire, Harvey-Bradshaw Index, Partial Mayo Score, biochemical, faecal and blood  markers were assessed. Primary endpoint was the clinical relapse rate at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included variations in free AAs,  biomarkers and quality of life. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.Concerning AAs and biochemical data, alanine (p = 0.006), valine (p = 0.047), proline (p = 0.022), glutamine (p < 0.001) and  (p = 0.043) along with total cholesterol (p = 0.032) and LDL cholesterol (p = 0.045) increased only in placebo group compared with baseline and the change between the study groups was significantly different.  markers had not a significantly different change between the two groups, even serum IL-6, faecal calprotectin and faecal lactoferrin increased only in the placebo group. Although Mastiha was not proven superior to placebo in remission rate (17.6% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.549), attenuation in increase of free AAs levels in verum group is reported.Mastiha inhibited an increase in plasma free AAs seen in patients with quiescent IBD. Since change of AAs is considered an early prognostic marker of  activity, this indicates a potential role of Mastiha in remission maintenance.Copyright © 2018.

Signaling elicited by these receptors promotes epithelial cell growth and survival, and ErbB ligands have been proposed as therapeutic agents for intestinal  of pediatric populations, including  (IBD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and inflammation associated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Furthermore, emerging evidence points to reduced ErbB ligand expression and thus reduced ErbB activity in IBD, NEC, and TPN models. This review will discuss the current understanding of the role of ErbB receptors in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of pediatric intestinal inflammation, with focus on the altered signaling in  and the molecular mechanisms by which exogenous ligands are protective.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28551086>HMGB1-RAGE pathway drives peroxynitrite signaling-induced IBD-like inflammation in murine nonalcoholic fatty liver .</a></h1><p>Recent clinical studies found a strong association of colonic inflammation and  (IBD)-like phenotype with NonAlcoholic Fatty liver  (NAFLD) yet the mechanisms remain unknown. The present study identifies high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a key mediator of intestinal inflammation in NAFLD and outlines a detailed redox signaling mechanism for such a pathway. NAFLD mice showed liver damage and release of elevated HMGB1 in systemic circulation and increased intestinal  nitration that was dependent on NADPH oxidase. Intestines from NAFLD mice showed higher Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, an outcome strongly dependent on the existence of NAFLD pathology and NADPH oxidase. Mechanistically intestinal epithelial cells showed the HMGB1 activation of TLR-4 was both NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite dependent with the latter being formed by the activation of NADPH oxidase. Proinflammatory cytokine production was significantly blocked by the specific peroxynitrite scavenger phenyl boronic acid (FBA), AKT inhibition and NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin suggesting NADPH oxidase-dependent peroxynitrite is a key mediator in TLR-4 activation and cytokine release via an AKT dependent pathway. Studies to ascertain the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated NADPH oxidase activation showed a distinct role of Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) as the use of inhibitors targeted against RAGE or use of deformed HMGB1 protein prevented NADPH oxidase activation, peroxynitrite formation, TLR4 activation and finally cytokine release. Thus, in conclusion the present study identifies a novel role of HMGB1 mediated  pathway that is RAGE and redox signaling dependent and helps promote ectopic intestinal inflammation in NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the possible influence of ACP1 polymorphisms in the susceptibility of  (IBD). A total of 1271 IBD Spanish patients [720 Crohn's  (CD) and 551 ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 1877 healthy subjects were included. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10167992, rs11553742, rs7576247 and rs3828329, were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Common ACP1 alleles (i.e. ACP1*A, ACP1*B and ACP1*C) were determined by two of these SNPs. After the analysis, no evidence of association of the ACP1 genetic variants was found with CD or UC. Therefore, our results suggest that the ACP1 gene may not play a relevant role in the development of IBD.© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173891>Role of Csk in intestinal epithelial barrier function and protection against colitis.</a></h1><p>Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) play a pivotal role in the maintenance of the integrity and barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. Dysfunctions of IECs are thought to participate in the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, resulting in gastrointestinal , such as colitis and colorectal cancer. Here we show that IEC-specific COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-deficient mice (Csk CKO mice) manifested the increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, a model of . DSS-treated Csk CKO mice also exhibited the significantly elevated intestinal permeability. Following DSS treatment, Csk CKO mice exhibited the higher proliferative activity of colonic epithelial cells and the increased number of apoptotic cells in the colon compared with that apparent for control mice. Moreover, the abundance of the tight junction protein occludin, which regulates cell-cell adhesion as well as epithelial permeability, was markedly reduced in the colon of DSS-treated Csk CKO mice. These results thus suggest that Csk in IECs plays important roles in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier function and protection against colitis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether these susceptibility loci also existed in a Chinese Han IBD population.Peripheral blood DNA samples from groups of patients with Crohn's  (CD) (n = 48), ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 49), and healthy controls (n = 50) were genotyped for eight genes. Then, an extended analysis of the relationship between genotype and phenotype was performed.NOD2-P268S (P = 0.025) was found to contribute susceptibility to CD in the Chinese population. IL23R-rs11805303 was detected to confer a strong protective effect against UC (P = 0.010), whereas PTPN2-rs2542151 was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC (P = 0.001). Further phenotype-genotype analysis revealed that P268S was associated with early age of onset (P = 0.028), ileal  (P = 0.003), and enteric cavity narrowing (P = 0.007).The study indicates that IL23R-rs11805303 and PTPN2-rs2542151 might contribute to the development of UC and NOD2-P268S might be involved in the etiology of CD in the Chinese Han population.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455690>ATF3 Sustains IL-22-Induced STAT3 Phosphorylation to Maintain Mucosal Immunity Through Inhibiting Phosphatases.</a></h1><p>In gut epithelium, IL-22 transmits signals through STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) which provides intestinal immunity. Many components in the IL-22-pSTAT3 pathway have been identified as risk factors for  (IBD) and some of them are considered as promising therapeutic targets. However, new perspectives are still needed to understand IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling for effective clinical interventions in IBD patients. Here, we revealed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), recently identified to be upregulated in patients with active IBD, as a crucial player in the epithelial IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling cascade. We found ATF3 is central to intestinal homeostasis and provides protection during colitis. Loss of ATF3 led to decreased crypt numbers, more shortened colon length, impaired ileal fucosylation at the steady state, and lethal  activity during DSS-induced colitis which can be effectively ameliorated by rectal transplantation of wild-type colonic organoids. Epithelial stem cells and Paneth cells form a niche to orchestrate epithelial regeneration and host-microbe interactions, and IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling is a key guardian for this niche. We found ATF3 is critical for niche maintenance as ATF3 deficiency caused compromised stem cell growth and regeneration, as well as Paneth cell degeneration and loss of anti-microbial peptide (AMP)-producing granules, indicative of malfunction of Paneth/stem cell network. Mechanistically, we found IL-22 upregulates ATF3, which is required to relay IL-22 signaling leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequent AMP induction. Intriguingly, ATF3 itself does not act on STAT3 directly, instead ATF3 regulates pSTAT3 by negatively targeting protein  phosphatases (PTPs) including SHP2 and PTP-Meg2. Furthermore, we identified ATF3 is also involved in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in T cells and loss of ATF3 leads to reduced capacity of Th17 cells to produce their signature cytokine IL-22 and IL-17A. Collectively, our results suggest that via IL-22-pSTAT3 signaling in the epithelium and IL-6-pSTAT3 signaling in Th17 cells, ATF3 mediates a cross-regulation in the barrier to maintain mucosal homeostasis and immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237878>Protein profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a candidate biomarker for Behçet's .</a></h1><p>To investigate the pathophysiology of Behçet's  (BD) and find biomarkers for the , we analysed protein profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).Proteins, extracted from PBMCs, were comprehensively analysed in 16 patients with BD, 16 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 12 patients with Crohn's  (CD), and 16 healthy control subjects (HC) by 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoResis (2D-DIGE). Differently expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry.563 protein spots were detected. We completely discriminated between the BD and HC groups, between the BD and RA groups, and between the BD and CD groups by multivariate analysis of intensity of 23, 35, and 1 spots, respectively. The spots contributing to the differences included proteins related to cytoskeleton, transcription/translation, T cell activation, bone turnover, regulating apoptosis, and microbial infection. Intensity of 3 spots (-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 4, threonine synthase-like 2, and β-actin) provided area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) of 0.889 for discrimination between the BD group and the non-BD groups. Informatively, intensity of the above 1 spot completely discriminated the CD group from the other groups (AUROC 1.000). This spot, identified as β-actin, had different pI from the above β-actin-spot probably due to different post-translational modification.PBMC protein profiles, especially the profile of the 3 spots, would be candidate biomarkers for BD. The latter β-actin subtype would be useful for discriminating  from BD and other .

We investigated the regulatory effects of dietary supplementation with aromatic amino acids - tryptophan, phenylalanine and  (TPT) - on the CaSR signalling pathway and intestinal  response. The in vivo study was conducted with weanling piglets using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement in a randomised complete block design. Piglets were fed a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with TPT and with or without  challenge. The in vitro study was performed in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line to investigate the effects of TPT on  response using NPS-2143 to inhibit CaSR. Dietary supplementation of TPT alleviated histopathological injury and decreased myeloperoxidase activity in intestine challenged with lipopolysaccharide. Dietary supplementation of TPT decreased serum concentration of pro- cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α), as well as the mRNA abundances of pro- cytokines in intestine but enhanced anti- cytokines IL-4 and transforming growth factor-β mRNA levels compared with pigs fed control diet and infected by lipopolysaccharide. Supplementation of TPT increased CaSR and phospholipase Cβ2 protein levels, but decreased inhibitor of NF-κB kinase α/β and inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) protein levels in the lipopolysaccharide-challenged piglets. When the CaSR signalling pathway was blocked by NPS-2143, supplementation of TPT decreased the CaSR protein level, but enhanced phosphorylated NF-κB and IκB levels in IPEC-J2 cells. To conclude, supplementation of aromatic amino acids alleviated intestinal inflammation as mediated through the CaSR signalling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24742989>Ron receptor signaling is protective against DSS-induced colitis in mice.</a></h1><p> (IBD) are chronic  disorders of the intestine that result in painful and debilitating complications. Currently no cure exists for IBD, and treatments are primarily aimed at reducing inflammation to alleviate symptoms. Genome-wide linkage studies have identified the Ron receptor  kinase (TK) and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL), as genes highly associated with IBD. However, only scant information exists on the role of Ron or HGFL in IBD. Based on the linkage of Ron to IBD, we directly examined the biological role of Ron in colitis. Wild-type mice and mice lacking the TK signaling domain of Ron (TK-/- mice) were utilized in a well-characterized model of chronic colitis induced by cyclic exposure to dextran sulfate sodium. In this model, TK-/- mice were more susceptible to injury as judged by increased mortality compared with control mice and developed more severe colitis. Loss of Ron led to significantly reduced body weights and more aggressive clinical and histopathologies. Ron loss also resulted in a dramatic reduction in colonic epithelial cell proliferation and increased proinflammatory cytokine production, which was associated with alterations in important signaling pathways known to regulate IBD. Examination of human gene expression data further supports the contention that loss of Ron signaling is associated with IBD. In total, our studies point to important functional roles for Ron in IBD by regulating healing of the colonic epithelium and by controlling cytokine secretion.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20301626>X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia.</a></h1><p>X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections in affected males in the first two years of life. Recurrent otitis is the most common infection prior to diagnosis. Conjunctivitis, sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea, and skin infections are also frequently seen. Approximately 60% of individuals with XLA are recognized as having immunodeficiency when they develop a severe, life-threatening infection such as pneumonia, empyema, meningitis, sepsis, cellulitis, or septic arthritis.  and  are the most common organisms found prior to diagnosis and may continue to cause sinusitis and otitis after diagnosis and the initiation of gammaglobulin substitution therapy. Severe, difficult-to-treat enteroviral infections (often manifest as dermatomyositis or chronic meningoencephalitis) can be prevented by this treatment. The prognosis for individuals with XLA has improved markedly in the last 25 years as a result of earlier diagnosis, the development of preparations of gammaglobulin that allow normal concentrations of serum IgG to be achieved, and more liberal use of antibiotics.The diagnosis of XLA is suspected in males with early-onset bacterial infections, marked reduction in all classes of serum immunoglobulins, and absent B cells (CD19+ cells); the decrease in the number of B cells is the most consistent and distinctive feature. Adenoids and tonsils are frequently rudimentary and lymph nodes are reduced in size. Having a maternal uncle or male cousin with absent B cells makes the diagnosis almost certain. The diagnosis is established (or confirmed) in males who have a hemizygous  pathogenic variant and females who have a heterozygous  pathogenic variant. The mainstay of treatment is gammaglobulin substitution therapy (by weekly subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion every 2-4 weeks) to prevent bacterial infections; some centers use chronic prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections.  The most common secondary complications of XLA are chronic sinusitis, chronic lung , , and enteroviral infection. Generous use of antibiotics can decrease the incidence of chronic sinusitis and lung . Diagnosis and treatment of  infections may decrease the risk of .  Live viral vaccines, particularly oral polio vaccine; inactivated polio vaccine rather than live oral polio vaccine should be given to patients and their family contacts.  Molecular genetic testing of at-risk male relatives as soon after birth as possible ensures that gammaglobulin substitution therapy is initiated as soon as possible in affected individuals.XLA is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to the sibs depends on the carrier status of the mother: if the mother is heterozygous for a  pathogenic variant, there is a 50% chance of transmitting the  pathogenic variant in each pregnancy; males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. All daughters of a male proband will inherit the  pathogenic variant and will be carriers; sons are not affected. Once the  pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk females is possible and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible options.Copyright © 1993-2019, University of Washington, Seattle.

The aim of the study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in genes encoding interacting TJ proteins and corresponding expressions, in relation to IBD.Allelic associations between TJ-related genes (F11R, MAGI1, MAGI2, MAGI3, PARD3, PTEN, and TJP1) and IBD, Crohn's  (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) were investigated. PTPN22 was included since it's located in the same genetic region as MAGI3. Gene expression levels were investigated in relation to genotype,  status, phenotype, and medical treatment.The two strongest allelic associations were observed between IBD and SNPs in MAGI2 (rs6962966) and MAGI3 (rs1343126). Another MAGI3 SNP marker (rs6689879) contributed to increased ileal MAGI3 expression level in non-IBD controls. Furthermore, association between inflammation and decreased expression levels of MAGI3, PTEN, and TJP1 in colonic IBD as well as UC mucosa, and between inflammation and increased expression of PTPN22 in colonic IBD mucosa, was observed.Our findings lend support to a genetic basis for modulation of intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD, and we have identified MAGI3 as a new candidate gene for IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23380085>Loss of protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 regulates interferon-γ-induced signaling in human monocytes.</a></h1><p>A gain-of-function variation within the locus that encodes protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type (PTPN)22 is associated with a reduced risk for Crohn's  (CD), whereas a loss-of-function variant seems to promote autoimmune disorders. We investigated how loss of PTPN22 could contribute to chronic inflammation of the intestine.Intestinal tissue samples from patients with or without  (controls) were analyzed for levels of PTPN22 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. In human THP-1 monocytes, protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting, mRNA levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and cytokine release by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Intestinal tissue samples from patients with CD had reduced levels of PTPN22 mRNA and protein, compared with samples from controls. In human THP-1 monocytes, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced expression and activity of PTPN22. Loss of PTPN22 increased levels of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, but reduced phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB subunits. Increased activity of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 and signal-transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 in PTPN22-deficient cells incubated with cytokines. PTPN22 knockdown increased secretion of the  cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17, but reduced expression or secretion of T-bet, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, IL-2, and IL-12p40 in response to IFN-γ.PTPN22 expression is reduced in intestinal tissues of patients with active CD. PTPN22 regulates intracellular signaling events and is induced by IFN-γ in human monocytes. Knockdown of PTPN22 alters activation of  signal transducers, increasing secretion of T-helper 17-related  mediators. Genetic variants that reduce PTPN22 activity might contribute to the pathogenesis of CD by these mechanisms.Copyright © 2013 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

To date, comprehensive genomic analysis of SBA is lacking.To perform in-depth genomic characterization of a large series of SBAs and other gastrointestinal tumors to draw comparisons and identify potentially clinically actionable alterations.Prospective analysis was performed of clinical samples from patients with SBA (n = 317), colorectal cancer (n = 6353), and gastric carcinoma (n = 889) collected between August 24, 2012, and February 3, 2016, using hybrid-capture-based genomic profiling, at the request of the individual treating physicians in the course of clinical care for the purpose of making therapy decisions.Of the 7559 patients included in analysis, 4138 (54.7%) were male; the median age was 56 (range, 12-101) years. The frequency of genomic alterations seen in SBA demonstrated distinct differences in comparison with either colorectal cancer (APC: 26.8% [85 of 317] vs 75.9% [4823 of 6353], P < .001; and CDKN2A: 14.5% [46 of 317] vs 2.6% [165 of 6353], P < .001) or gastric carcinoma (KRAS: 53.6% [170 of 317] vs 14.2% [126 of 889], P < .001; APC: 26.8% [85 of 317] vs 7.8% [69 of 889], P < .001; and SMAD4: 17.4% [55 of 317] vs 5.2% [46 of 889], P < .001). BRAF was mutated in 7.6% (484 of 6353) of colorectal cancer and 9.1% (29 of 317) of SBA samples, but V600E mutations were much less common in SBA, representing only 10.3% (3 of 29) of BRAF-mutated cases. The ERBB2/HER2 point mutations (8.2% [26 of 317]), microsatellite instability (7.6% [13 of 170]), and high tumor mutational burden (9.5% [30 of 317]) were all enriched in SBA. Significant differences were noted in the molecular profile of unspecified SBA compared with duodenal adenocarcinoma, as well as in -associated SBAs. Targetable alterations in several additional genes, including PIK3CA and MEK1, and receptor  kinase fusions, were also identified in all 3 series.This study presents to our knowledge the first large-scale genomic comparison of SBA with colorectal cancer and gastric carcinoma. The distinct genomic differences establish SBA as a molecularly unique intestinal cancer. In addition, genomic profiling can identify potentially targetable genomic alterations in the majority of SBA cases (91%), and the higher incidence of microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden in SBA suggests a potential role for immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25463744>JAK2 and AMP-kinase inhibition in vitro by food extracts, fractions and purified phytochemicals.</a></h1><p>We have identified a range of food phytochemicals that inhibit Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) and Adenosine Monophosphate Kinase (AMPK).

Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested 49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products, herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TC-PTP locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to  (IBDs) in patients. To further understand how TC-PTP is related to IBDs, we investigated the role of TC-PTP in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using an in vivo genetic approach. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of TC-PTP was achieved in a mouse model at steady state and in the context of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Knockout (KO) of TC-PTP in IECs did not result in an altered intestinal barrier. However, upon DSS treatment, IEC-specific TC-PTP KO mice displayed a more severe colitis phenotype with a corresponding increase in the immune response and  cytokine profile. The absence of TC-PTP caused an altered turnover of IECs, which is further explained by the role of the  phosphatase in colonic stem cell (CoSC) proliferation. Our results suggest a novel role for TC-PTP in regulating the homeostasis of CoSC proliferation. This supports the protective function of TC-PTP against IBDs, independently of its previously demonstrated role in intestinal immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488437>Inhibition of non-receptor  kinase Src induces phosphoserine 256-independent aquaporin-2 membrane accumulation.</a></h1><p>Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is crucial for water homeostasis, and vasopressin (VP) induces AQP2 membrane trafficking by increasing intracellular cAMP, activating PKA and causing phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256, 264 and 269 residues and dephosphorylation of serine 261 residue on the AQP2 C-terminus. It is thought that serine 256 is the master regulator of AQP2 trafficking, and its phosphorylation has to precede the change of phosphorylation state of other serine residues. We found that Src inhibition causes serine 256-independent AQP2 membrane trafficking and induces phosphorylation of serine 269 independently of serine 256. This targeted phosphorylation of serine 269 is important for Src inhibition-induced AQP2 membrane accumulation; without serine 269, Src inhibition exerts no effect on AQP2 trafficking. This result helps us better understand the independent pathways that can target different AQP2 residues, and design new strategies to induce or sustain AQP2 membrane expression when VP signalling is defective.Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is essential for water homeostasis. Upon stimulation by vasopressin, AQP2 is phosphorylated at serine 256 (S256), S264 and S269, and dephosphorylated at S261. It is thought that S256 is the master regulator of AQP2 trafficking and membrane accumulation, and that its phosphorylation has to precede phosphorylation of other serine residues. In this study, we found that VP reduces Src kinase phosphorylation: by suppressing Src using the inhibitor dasatinib and siRNA, we could increase AQP2 membrane accumulation in cultured AQP2-expressing cells and in kidney collecting duct principal cells. Src inhibition increased exocytosis and inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AQP2, but exerted its effect in a cAMP, PKA and S256 phosphorylation (pS256)-independent manner. Despite the lack of S256 phosphorylation, dasatinib increased phosphorylation of S269, even in S256A mutant cells in which S256 phosphorylation cannot occur. To confirm the importance of pS269 in AQP2 re-distribution, we expressed an AQP2 S269A mutant in LLC-PK1 cells, and found that dasatinib no longer induced AQP2 membrane accumulation. In conclusion, Src inhibition causes phosphorylation of S269 independently of pS256, and induces AQP2 membrane accumulation by inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis and increasing exocytosis. We conclude that S269 can be phosphorylated without pS256, and pS269 alone is important for AQP2 apical membrane accumulation under some conditions. These data increase our understanding of the independent pathways that can phosphorylate different residues in the AQP2 C-terminus, and suggest new strategies to target distinct AQP2 serine residues to induce membrane expression of this water channel when VP signalling is defective.© 2018 The Authors.

Protein  phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) controls immune cell activation and the equilibrium between regulatory and effector T cells, playing an important role in controlling immune homoeostasis of the gut. Here, we examined the role of PTPN22 in intestinal inflammation of IL-10-deficient (IL-10 ) mice. We crossed IL-10 mice with PTPN22 mice to generate PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice and induced colitis with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In line with previous reports, DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis was exacerbated in IL-10 mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. However, PTPN22 IL-10 double knock-out mice developed milder  compared to IL-10 mice. IL-17-promoting innate cytokines and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells were markedly increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but did not provide a protctive function. CXCL1/KC was also increased in PTPN22 IL-10 mice, but therapeutic injection of CXCL1/KC in IL-10 mice did not ameliorate colitis. These results show that PTPN22 promotes intestinal inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of PTPN22 might be beneficial in patients with IBD and mutations in IL-10 and IL-10R.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31327403>Pharmacology, efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Orally bioavailable inhibitors of the  kinases (TYKs), also referred to as Janus kinases (JAKs), are being evaluated for the treatment of patients with Crohn's  (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and other chronic  disorders. To date, three JAK inhibitors have been tested in patients with moderate-to-severe CD: tofacitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor), filgotinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). Clinical development of tofacitinib was discontinued in CD because the primary endpoint of clinical remission in the phase II induction and maintenance trials was not met, although outcomes may have been influenced by trial design flaws and a high placebo rate was noted. In contrast, filgotinib did meet its primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 10 in the phase II FITZROY trial, in addition to several other clinically important secondary outcomes, spurring a subsequent larger phase III trial. Following promising results for upadacitinib in its phase II trial, larger phase III trials were also initiated to corroborate the efficacy results. Although JAK inhibitors appear to have an acceptable safety profile, higher rates of infections compared to placebo were noted. Overall, JAK inhibitors constitute a new promising class of drugs, given the efficacy signals observed in pivotal clinical trials in several chronic  . Here we review the existing evidence on the pharmacology, safety and efficacy of JAK-STAT inhibitors that are currently under investigation for the treatment of patients with CD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism has remained obscure, but we demonstrate that IL-22 acts via  kinase 2 (Tyk2), a member of the Jak family. Using a mouse model for colitis, we show that Tyk2 deficiency is associated with an altered composition of the gut microbiota and exacerbates . Colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice have less p-STAT3 in colon tissue and their IECs proliferate less efficiently. Tyk2-deficient primary IECs show reduced p-STAT3 in response to IL-22 stimulation, and expression of IL-22-STAT3 target genes is reduced in IECs from healthy and colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice. Experiments with conditional Tyk2(-/-) mice reveal that IEC-specific depletion of Tyk2 aggravates colitis.  symptoms can be alleviated by administering high doses of rIL-22-Fc, indicating that Tyk2 deficiency can be rescued via the IL-22 receptor complex. The pivotal function of Tyk2 in IL-22-dependent colitis was confirmed in Citrobacter rodentium-induced . Thus, Tyk2 protects against acute colitis in part by amplifying inflammation-induced epithelial IL-22 signaling to STAT3.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27311871>Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive large B-cell lymphoma in a patient treated with azathioprine for ulcerative colitis.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278700>Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in the etiology of Crohn's , cause or epiphenomenon?</a></h1><p>The origin of  is unknown. Attempts have been made to isolate a microorganism that could explain the onset of inflammation, but no pathological agent has ever been identified. Johne's  is a granulomatous chronic enteritis of cattle and sheep caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and shows some analogies with Crohn's  (CD). Several studies have tried to clarify if MAP has a role in the etiology of CD. The present article provides an overview of the evidence in favor and against the "MAP-hypothesis", analyzing the methods commonly adopted to detect MAP and the role of antimycobacterial therapy in patients with . Studies were identified through the electronic database, MEDLINE, and were selected based on their relevance to the objective of the review. The presence of MAP was investigated using multiple diagnostic methods for MAP detection and in different tissue samples from patients affected by CD or ulcerative colitis and in healthy controls. On the basis of their studies, several authors support a close relationship between MAP and CD. Although increasing evidence of MAP detection in CD patients is unquestionable, a clear etiological link still needs to be proven.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29398253>T cells are influenced by a long non-coding RNA in the autoimmune associated PTPN2 locus.</a></h1><p>Non-coding SNPs in the protein  phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) locus have been linked with several autoimmune , including rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, and . However, the functional consequences of these SNPs are poorly characterized. Herein, we show in blood cells that SNPs in the PTPN2 locus are highly correlated with DNA methylation levels at four CpG sites downstream of PTPN2 and expression levels of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01882 downstream of these CpG sites. We observed that LINC01882 is mainly expressed in T cells and that anti-CD3/CD28 activated naïve CD4 T cells downregulate the expression of LINC01882. RNA sequencing analysis of LINC01882 knockdown in Jurkat T cells, using a combination of antisense oligonucleotides and RNA interference, revealed the upregulation of the transcription factor ZEB1 and kinase MAP2K4, both involved in IL-2 regulation. Overall, our data suggests the involvement of LINC01882 in T cell activation and hints towards an auxiliary role of these non-coding SNPs in autoimmunity associated with the PTPN2 locus.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

A growing body of evidence suggests epithelial cells also directly exchange information at cell-cell contacts via the Eph family of receptor  kinases and their membrane-associated ephrin ligands. Ligand-dependent and -independent signaling via Eph receptors as well as reverse signaling through ephrins impact epithelial tissue homeostasis by organizing stem cell compartments and regulating cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and survival. This review focuses on breast, gut, and skin epithelia as representative examples for how Eph receptors and ephrins modulate diverse epithelial cell responses in a context-dependent manner. Abnormal Eph receptor and ephrin signaling is implicated in a variety of epithelial  raising the intriguing possibility that this cell-cell communication pathway can be therapeutically harnessed to normalize epithelial function in pathological settings like cancer or chronic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24146755>The tumor suppressor gene, RASSF1A, is essential for protection against inflammation -induced injury.</a></h1><p>Ras association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A) is a tumor suppressor gene silenced in cancer. Here we report that RASSF1A is a novel regulator of intestinal inflammation as Rassf1a(+/-) , Rassf1a(-/-) and an intestinal epithelial cell specific knockout mouse (Rassf1a (IEC-KO) ) rapidly became sick following dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) administration, a chemical inducer of colitis. Rassf1a knockout mice displayed clinical symptoms of  including: increased intestinal permeability, enhanced cytokine/chemokine production, elevated nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NFκB) activity, elevated colonic cell death and epithelial cell injury. Furthermore, epithelial restitution/repair was inhibited in DSS-treated Rassf1a(-/-) mice with reduction of several makers of proliferation including Yes associated protein (YAP)-driven proliferation. Surprisingly,  phosphorylation of YAP was detected which coincided with increased nuclear p73 association, Bax-driven epithelial cell death and p53 accumulation resulting in enhanced apoptosis and poor survival of DSS-treated Rassf1a knockout mice. We can inhibit these events and promote the survival of DSS-treated Rassf1a knockout mice with intraperitoneal injection of the c-Abl and c-Abl related protein  kinase inhibitor, imatinib/gleevec. However, p53 accumulation was not inhibited by imatinib/gleevec in the Rassf1a(-/-) background which revealed the importance of p53-dependent cell death during intestinal inflammation. These observations suggest that  phosphorylation of YAP (to drive p73 association and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax) and accumulation of p53 are consequences of inflammation-induced injury in DSS-treated Rassf1a(-/-) mice. Mechanistically, we can detect robust associations of RASSF1A with membrane proximal Toll-like receptor (TLR) components to suggest that RASSF1A may function to interfere and restrict TLR-driven activation of NFκB. Failure to restrict NFκB resulted in the inflammation-induced DNA damage driven  phosphorylation of YAP, subsequent p53 accumulation and loss of intestinal epithelial homeostasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28439935>Neonatal immune challenge followed by adult immune challenge induces epigenetic-susceptibility to aggravated visceral hypersensitivity.</a></h1><p>Abdominal pain is one of the major symptoms of  (IBD). The  mediators released by colon inflammation are known to sensitize the afferent neurons, which is one of the contributors to abdominal pain. However, not all IBD patients have abdominal pain, and some patients report abdominal pain during remission, suggesting contributions of other pathological factors to abdominal pain in IBD. Epidemiological studies found early-life gastrointestinal infections a risk factor for IBD symptoms and adult-life gastrointestinal infections may trigger the onset of IBD. We investigated the hypothesis that neonatal colon immune challenge followed by an adult colon immune challenge upregulates spinal cord BDNF that aggravates visceral sensitivity over and above that induced by adult colon immune challenge alone.We induced neonatal and adult colon immune challenges by intraluminal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to the rat colon.We found that neonatal immune challenge triggers epigenetic programming that upregulates  hydroxylase in the locus ceruleus when these rats are subjected to an adult colon immune challenge. The upregulation of locus ceruleus  hydroxylase, upregulates norepinephrine in the cerebrospinal fluid that acts on adrenergic receptors to enhance pCREB binding to the cAMP response element, which recruits histone acetylene transferase (HAT) to the BDNF gene to enhance its transcription resulting in aggravated visceromotor response to colorectal distension. HAT and adrenergic receptor antagonists block the aggravation of visceral sensitivity.HAT and adrenergic receptor inhibitors may serve as alternates to opioids and NSAIDS in suppressing abdominal pain in IBD.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22877871>Synthesis and biological evaluation of  modified analogues of the α4β7 integrin inhibitor biotin-R₈ERY.</a></h1><p>The α4β7 integrin is a well-known target for the development of drugs against various   states including , type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn . Studies using  and  models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for  management.

They directly inhibit the activity of Fyn, a non-receptor Src-family  kinase, triggering anti- events associated with down-regulation of T-cell receptor signal transduction, leading to inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production. This is one of the major pro- cytokines, associated with  such as diabetes, tumorigenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and . Porphyrins, as a chemical class, inhibited Fyn kinase activity in a non-competitive, linear-mixed fashion. In cell-based in vitro experiments on polymorphonuclear cells, porphyrins inhibited TNF-α cytokine production, T-cell proliferation, and the generation of free radicals in the oxidative burst, in a concentration-related manner. In vivo, lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α production in mice was inhibited by several of the porphyrins. These findings may be very important for the overall understanding of the role(s) of porphyrins in inflammation and their possible application as new anti- agents.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Our previous studies showed that beetroot (Beta vulgaris var. rubra) products and their major component betanin modulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of betanin on the oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in neutrophils isolated from blood of patients with --ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD). The results were compared with those obtained in colon carcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells. Betanin treatment at the concentration of 100 μM for 24 h increased DNA damage assessed by comet assay in IBD patients' neutrophils. A similar effect although less pronounced was observed in Caco-2 cells. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with H2O2 caused a 4-fold increase of DNA strand breaks in comparison to untreated cells, but pre-treatment with betanin reduced DNA damage in these cells. Betanin also induced procaspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3 activity accompanied by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating its pro-apoptotic activity. These results suggest that betanin may support mechanisms that lead to the release of ROS and apoptotic cell death. In this way betanin may exert anti- and potentially cancer preventive activity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25905918>Selective targeting of the IL23 pathway: Generation and characterization of a novel high-affinity humanized anti-IL23A antibody.</a></h1><p>Herein, we describe the generation and characterization of BI 655066, a novel, highly potent neutralizing anti-interleukin-23 (IL23) monoclonal antibody in clinical development for autoimmune conditions, including psoriasis and Crohn's . IL23 is a key driver of the differentiation, maintenance, and activity of a number of immune cell subsets, including T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are believed to mediate the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated disorders. Thus, IL23 neutralization is an attractive therapeutic approach. Designing an antibody for clinical activity and convenience for the patient requires certain properties, such as high affinity, specificity, and solubility. These properties were achieved by directed design of the immunization, lead identification, and humanization procedures. Favorable substance and pharmacokinetic properties were established by biophysical assessments and studies in cynomolgus monkeys.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969282>Crohn's : loss of tolerance or a disorder of autophagy?</a></h1><p>Crohn's  (CD) is characterized by a breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier function leading to an uncontrolled immune response to bacterial antigens. Available data demonstrate that appropriate response and early host defense against invading bacteria are crucial to maintain tolerance towards commensal bacteria. When the mechanisms of early removal of invading bacteria are disturbed, a loss of tolerance and a full-blown adaptive immune reaction, which is mounted against the usually harmless commensal flora, are induced. Dysfunction of autophagy caused by genetic variations within CD susceptibility genes, such as ATG16L1 and IRGM, results in defective handling of intracellular and invading bacteria and causes prolonged survival and defective clearance of those microbes. Dysfunction of ATG16L1 and IRGM has also been shown to cause aberrant Paneth cell function and uncontrolled secretion of proinflammatory cytokines finally resulting in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection and the onset of colitis. Interestingly, autophagy can also be regulated by other CD susceptibility genes, such as NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain 2) or PTPN2 (protein  phosphatase nonreceptor type 2) and the presence of the CD-associated variations within these genes results in similar effects. Taken together, more and more evidence suggests a close functional correlation between loss of tolerance and defective autophagy in CD patients. Therefore, most likely, the onset of CD is triggered by both a loss of tolerance as well as a dysfunction of autophagy, which finally results in the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation.© 2014 S.

Recent evidence suggests that TNF-α is a central regulator of multiple  signaling cascades. One important target of TNF-α may be the signaling pathway downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which has been associated with many human cancers. Here, we show that long-term exposure of 18Co cells, a model of human colonic myofibroblasts, with TNF-α led to a striking increase in cell surface EGFR expression, an effect that was completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Subsequent EGFR binding by EGF and heparin binding (HB)-EGF was associated with enhanced EGFR  kinase activity, prolonged ERK activation, and a significant increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression compared with 18Co cells treated with EGF and HB-EGF alone. TNF-α also increased EGFR expression and signaling in primary myofibroblasts isolated from human colon tissue. TNF-α-induced upregulation of EGFR may be a plausible mechanism to explain the exaggerated cellular responsiveness that characterizes  and that may contribute to a microenvironment that predisposes to colitis-associated cancer through enhanced COX-2 expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27705005>Future therapeutic potential of SAP-1 in .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891020>A galectin-specific signature in the gut delineates Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis from other human  intestinal disorders.</a></h1><p> (IBD) are chronic and relapsing  conditions of the gastrointestinal tract including Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

However, the relevance of the galectin network in the pathogenesis of human IBD has not yet been explored. Here, we analyzed the expression of relevant members of the galectin family in intestinal biopsies, and identified their contribution as novel mucosal markers in IBD. Colonic biopsies were obtained from 59 IBD patients (22 CD and 37 UC), 9 patients with gut rejection after transplantation, 8 adult celiac patients, and 32 non-IBD donors. Galectin mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and qPCR using specific primers for individual galectins. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to analyze galectin expression in individual intestinal samples. Expression of common mucosal-associated galectins (Gal-1, -3, -4, -9) is dysregulated in inflamed tissues of IBD patients compared with non-inflamed IBD or control samples. LDA discriminated between different inflammation grades in active IBD and showed that remission IBD samples were clusterized with control samples. Galectin profiling could not distinguish CD and UC. Furthermore, inflamed IBD was discriminated from inflamed tissue of rejected gut in transplanted patients and duodenum of celiac patients, which could not be distinguished from control duodenum samples. The integrative analysis of galectins discriminated IBD from other intestinal  conditions and could be used as potential mucosal biomarker.© 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796676>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist therapy suppresses colon motility and  activation six days after the onset of experimental colitis in rats.</a></h1><p>We set out to investigate the time-dependent colon motility and  changes in a rodent model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in order to estimate the efficacy of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist therapy administered 6 day after the acute  event. Anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to control (n=6) or colitis groups (n=18). The endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (n=6) or the synthetic analog SZR-72 (n=6) was administered 6 day after TNBS induction. Large  motility parameters, macrohaemodynamics and serosal microcirculatory changes were recorded; the severity of colonic damage was monitored by using in vivo confocal laser endomicroscopy. Nitrite/nitrate and nitrotyrosine levels, and xanthine oxidoreductase and myeloperoxidase activities were determined on colon biopsies; plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were compared with those under control and 1-day colitis (n=6) conditions. TNBS induction elevated the tissue  enzyme activities, proinflammatory cytokine release, and nitrite/nitrate and nitrotyrosine formation. The microscopic vascular and mucosal lesions were accompanied by significant increases in serosal microcirculation and frequent intestinal movements 6 day after colitis. The NMDA receptor antagonist treatments significantly decreased the signs of  activation and the levels of nitric oxide end-products, normalized the microcirculation and the rate of  movements in both NMDA receptor antagonist-treated colitis groups. Blockade of the enteric NMDA receptors 6 day after colitis induction concurrently influenced NO production-linked nitrosative stress and colon dysmotility and may therefore offer a possibility via which to inhibit the progression of  changes in the later phase of TNBS colitis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that primary macrophages deficient in the autophagic factor LC3 demonstrate diminished fungicidal activity but increased cytokine production in response to Candida albicans stimulation. LC3 recruitment to fungal phagosomes requires activation of the fungal pattern receptor dectin-1. LC3 recruitment to the phagosome also requires Syk signaling but is independent of all activity by Toll-like receptors and does not require the presence of the adaptor protein Card9. We further demonstrate that reactive oxygen species generation by NADPH oxidase is required for LC3 recruitment to the fungal phagosome. These observations directly link LC3 to the  pathway against C. albicans in macrophages.© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious  Society of America.

Helicobacter hepaticus-infected Rag2(-/-) mice emulate many aspects of human IBD, and our recent work using this experimental model highlights the importance of neutrophils in the pathology of colitis. To define molecular mechanisms linking colitis to the identity of  biomarkers, we performed a translational comparison of protein expression and protein damage products in tissues of mice and human IBD patients. Analysis in inflamed mouse colons identified the neutrophil- and macrophage-derived damage products 3-chlorotyrosine (Cl-Tyr) and 3-nitrotyrosine, both of which increased with  duration. Analysis also revealed higher Cl-Tyr levels in colon relative to serum in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn . The DNA chlorination damage product, 5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine, was quantified in diseased human colon samples and found to be present at levels similar to those in inflamed mouse colons. Multivariate analysis of these markers, together with serum proteins and cytokines, revealed a general signature of activated innate immunity in human IBD. Signatures in ulcerative colitis sera were strongly suggestive of neutrophil activity, and those in Crohn  and mouse sera were suggestive of both macrophage and neutrophil activity. These data point to innate immunity as a major determinant of serum and tissue profiles and provide insight into IBD  processes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25710489>Negative regulation of DSS-induced experimental colitis by PILRα.</a></h1><p> is thought to be a complex multifactorial , in which an increased  response plays an important role. Paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor α (PILRα), well conserved in almost all mammals, is an inhibitory receptor containing immunoreceptor -based inhibitory motifs in the cytoplasmic domain. PILRα is mainly expressed on myeloid cells and plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the function of PILRα in  using PILRα-deficient mice. When mice were orally administered dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), colonic mucosal injury and inflammation were significantly exacerbated in DSS-treated PILRα-deficient mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that neutrophil and macrophage cell numbers were higher in the colons of DSS-treated PILRα-deficient mice than in those of WT mice. Blockade of CXCR2 expressed on neutrophils using a CXCR2 inhibitor decreased the severity of colitis observed in PILRα-deficient mice. These results suggest that PILRα negatively regulates  colitis by regulating the infiltration of  cells such as neutrophils and macrophages.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2015.

Considerable progress was made recently in understanding the role of TRAF3 in T cell biology. Here we review these new findings about how TRAF3 participates in T cell development and function. The different roles of TRAF3 in distinct immune cells are also compared. That TRAF3 is required for T cell effector functions, and invariant Natural Killer T cell function and development, was unexpected. Another surprising finding is that TRAF3 normally restrains regulatory T cell development. It is now clear that TRAF3 regulates signaling to T cells not only through costimulatory members of the TNFR superfamily, but also through the T cell receptor complex, and cytokine receptors. The diverse roles it plays support the multifaceted nature of this molecule. How TRAF3 mediates integration of different signaling cascades is an important topic for future study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26202676>Galectin-3 Modulates Experimental Colitis.</a></h1><p>We recently identified galectin-3 (gal-3) as a new and strong fibroblast activator produced by colonic epithelial cells. Very little is known about the influence of gal-3 in . We, therefore, investigated the impact of gal-3 on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model.Colonic lamina propria fibroblasts of healthy controls were used for co-incubation studies of gal-3 with gal-1, TGF-β1, IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-10. Acute and chronic DSS colitis was induced by 3% DSS in drinking water in female Balb/c mice weighing 20-22 g. Recombinant gal-3 was expressed by the pET vector system and used for a 5-day treatment in different concentrations intraperitoneally. The distal third of the colon was used for histologic analysis. Colonic cytokine expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR.In vitro, gal-3 induced IL-8 secretion was significantly reduced by co-incubation with IL-10 (5 ng/ml) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml). Acute DSS-induced colitis was ameliorated by gal-3 treatment as indicated by increased colonic length and reduced weight loss compared to that of controls. In acute and chronic colitis, gal-3 treatment resulted in a significant suppression of colonic IL-6.Gal-3 significantly reduces inflammation in acute and chronic DSS colitis in mice indicating a potential role in intestinal inflammation.© 2015 S.

Recent therapies targeting several cytokines were reviewed to evaluate efficacy in IBD patients.Ustekinumab is an interleukin inhibitor which blocks the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 axis and is already approved for the treatment of Crohn's  patients, specially those who had inadequate response or intolerance to conventional treatment with anti-TNF-α agents. Several treatments have been developed that are focused on the blockade of specific cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IL-23 and a chemokine named IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 as well as some oral small-molecule inhibitors of intracellular cytoplasmic  kinases like tofacitinib, filgotinib and upadacitinib.Several biologics blocking different and specific cytokines and oral small molecule agents have been and are being evaluated in IBD patients. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying immunological mechanisms will allow to develop effective and safe agents that inhibit one or more cytokines to improve the outcome in patients with IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23827161>Involvement of JAK/STAT signaling in the pathogenesis of .</a></h1><p>The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway constitute the fulcrum in many vital cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, and regulatory immune functions. Various cytokines, growth factors, and protein  kinases communicate through the JAK/STAT pathway and regulate the transcription of numerous genes. In addition to their critical roles in a plethora of key cellular activities, the JAK/STAT signaling pathways also have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several , including  (IBD), especially since a JAK inhibitor recently has been shown to be effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this review is to highlight the recent findings on the regulatory mechanism of JAK/STAT signaling pathways and to reveal the evolving comprehension of their interface which might be of interest for clinicians involved in IBD therapy. Further, it is described how these signaling pathways have been exploited for the development of promising novel JAK inhibitors with anti- effects verified in clinical trials.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
