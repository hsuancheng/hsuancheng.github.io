In this work, eight peptides were isolated from F7 and identified as Gly-Pro-Tyr (GPY, 335.31 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Glu (GPTGE, 459.47 Da), Pro--Gly-Pro-Asp (PFGPD, 531.52 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Ala-Lys (GPTGAKG, 586.65 Da), Pro-Tyr-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gly (PYGAKG, 591.69 Da), Gly-Ala--Gly-Pro-Gln-Gly (GATGPQG, 586.61 Da), Gly-Pro--Gly-Pro-Met (GPFGPM, 604.73 Da), and Tyr-Gly-Pro-Met (YGPM, 466.50 Da), respectively. Among them, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM exhibited strong radical scavenging activities on DPPH (EC values of 0.80, 3.02, and 0.72 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), hydroxyl (EC values of 0.81, 0.66, and 0.88 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), superoxide anion (EC values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.73 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) cation (EC values of 0.86, 1.07, and 0.82 mg/mL for PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM, respectively) in a positive concentration-activity relationship. Furthermore, PFGPD, PYGAKG, and YGPM could effectively reduce Fe to Fe and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Hence, eight collagen peptides from hydrolysate of Spanish mackerel skins might be served as antioxidant candidates for various industrial applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30005070>Fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs exhibit differences in nutrient composition according to body weight and gestational period.</a></h1><p>Low birth weight may negatively affect energy storage and nutrient , and impair fetal growth and development. We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and fatty acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, Arg, crude fat, Gly, Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the liver, lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746701>Nitrogen retention, energy, and amino acid digestibility of wheat bran, without or with multicarbohydrase and phytase supplementation, fed to broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>The study was conducted to determine the effects of multicarbohydrase (MC) preparation (700 U α-galactosidase, 2,200 U galactomannanase, 3,000 U xylanase, and 22,000 U β-glucanase per kg of diet) and phytase (Phy, 500 FTU per kg of diet) supplementation on the nutritive value of wheat bran (WB) in broiler chicks. Trial 1 determined retention of nutrients and apparent metabolizable energy corrected by nitrogen (AMEn). One reference diet (RD) protein-free (85% corn based) was fortified to determine the WB nutrient retention coefficient. Trial 2 determined standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of AA, when pancreas and liver were weighed. An additional group of bird was fed with an RD with 5% casein-corn starch diet, fortified with vitamins and minerals to quantify the endogenous fraction and determine SID of AA. For each trial, the test diets were made by mixing RD and WB 7:3 (wt/wt) and fed without or with MC or Phy or combination. Male broilers (Cobb 500), 245 d old, were allocated to five treatments to give seven replicates (seven birds/cage). The birds were fed a commercial diet from day 0 to10 followed by Trial 1 diets from day 11 to 18 and finally Trial 2 diets from day 19 to 21. Excreta samples were collected on days 15-18 and all birds were slaughtered on day 21 for ileal digesta. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between MC and Phy on retention of DM, N, P, and AMEn. An interaction (P < 0.05) was also observed on SID of Arg, His, Leu, Lys, , , Val, Asp, Cys, Glu, and Ser. Responses of MC plus Phy supplementation were higher (P < 0.05) on overall SID of AA by 6.05% (75.18 to 94.26%), compared with responses for MC (2.35%; 72.04 to 88.97) or Phy (3.46%; 73.27 to 92.13). Liver and pancreas weights were affected (P < 0.05) by the single MC supplementation. The MC and Phy combination may be an effective strategy to improve AA utilization of WB in broiler chickens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494047>Production of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory peptides and isolation of four novel peptides from jellyfish (Rhopilema esculentum) protein hydrolysate.</a></h1><p>Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in regulating blood pressure in the human body. ACE inhibitory peptides derived from food proteins could exert antihypertensive effects without side effects. Jellyfish (Rhopilema esculentum) is an important fishery resource suitable for production of ACE inhibitory peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis conditions for production of protein hydrolysate from R. esculentum (RPH) with ACE inhibitory activity, and to isolate and identify the ACE inhibitory peptides from RPH.Rhopilema esculentum protein was hydrolyzed with Compound proteinase AQ to produce protein hydrolysate with ACE inhibitory activity, and the hydrolysis conditions were optimized using response surface methodology. The optimum parameters for producing peptides with the highest ACE inhibitory activity were as follows: hydrolysis time 3.90 h, hydrolysis temperature 58 °C, enzyme:substrate ratio 2.8% and pH 7.60. Under these conditions, the ACE inhibitory rate reached 32.21%. In addition, four novel ACE inhibitory peptides were isolated, and their amino acids sequences were identified as Val-Gly-Pro-Tyr, --Tyr-Val-Pro-Gly, --Tyr-Val-Pro-Gly-Ala and -Gln-Ala-Val-Trp-Ala-Gly, respectively. The IC50 value of the purified peptides for ACE inhibitory activity was 8.40, 23.42, 21.15 and 19.11 µmol L(-1) .These results indicate that the protein hydrolysate prepared from R. esculentum might be a commercial competitive source of ACE inhibitory ingredients to be used in functional foods. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28289093>A hot spot on interferon α/β receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) underpins its interaction with interferon-β and dictates signaling.</a></h1><p>The interaction of IFN-β with its receptor IFNAR1 (interferon α/β receptor subunit 1) is vital for host-protective anti-viral and anti-proliferative responses, but signaling via this interaction can be detrimental if dysregulated. Whereas it is established that IFNAR1 is an essential component of the IFNAR signaling complex, the key residues underpinning the IFN-β-IFNAR1 interaction are unknown. Guided by the crystal structure of the IFN-β-IFNAR1 complex, we used truncation variants and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate domains and residues enabling complexation of IFN-β to IFNAR1. We have identified an interface on IFNAR1-subdomain-3 that is differentially utilized by IFN-β and IFN-α for signal transduction. We used surface plasmon resonance and cell-based assays to investigate this important IFN-β binding interface that is centered on IFNAR1 residues Tyr and Tyr binding the C and N termini of the B and C helices of IFN-β, respectively. Using IFNAR1 and IFN-β variants, we show that this interface contributes significantly to the affinity of IFN-β for IFNAR1, its ability to activate STAT1, the expression of interferon stimulated genes, and ultimately to the anti-viral and anti-proliferative properties of IFN-β. These results identify a key interface created by IFNAR1 residues Tyr and Tyr interacting with IFN-β residues , Leu, Glu, , Val, and Arg that underlie IFN-β-IFNAR1-mediated signaling and biological processes.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27852824>Differential Receptor Binding and Regulatory Mechanisms for the Lymphangiogenic Growth Factors Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-C and -D.</a></h1><p>VEGF-C and VEGF-D are secreted glycoproteins that induce angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in cancer, thereby promoting tumor growth and spread. They exhibit structural homology and activate VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, receptors on endothelial cells that signal for growth of blood vessels and lymphatics. VEGF-C and VEGF-D were thought to exhibit similar bioactivities, yet recent studies indicated distinct signaling mechanisms (e.g. tumor-derived VEGF-C promoted expression of the prostaglandin biosynthetic enzyme COX-2 in lymphatics, a response thought to facilitate metastasis via the lymphatic vasculature, whereas VEGF-D did not). Here we explore the basis of the distinct bioactivities of VEGF-D using a neutralizing antibody, peptide mapping, and mutagenesis to demonstrate that the N-terminal α-helix of mature VEGF-D (-Arg) is critical for binding VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Importantly, the N-terminal part of this α-helix, from  to , is required for binding VEGFR-3 but not VEGFR-2. Surprisingly, the corresponding part of the α-helix in mature VEGF-C did not influence binding to either VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3, indicating distinct determinants of receptor binding by these growth factors. A variant of mature VEGF-D harboring a mutation in the N-terminal α-helix, D103A, exhibited enhanced potency for activating VEGFR-3, was able to promote increased COX-2 mRNA levels in lymphatic endothelial cells, and had enhanced capacity to induce lymphatic sprouting in vivo This mutant may be useful for developing protein-based therapeutics to drive lymphangiogenesis in clinical settings, such as lymphedema. Our studies shed light on the VEGF-D structure/function relationship and provide a basis for understanding functional differences compared with VEGF-C.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187204>Differentiating founder and chronic HIV envelope sequences.</a></h1><p>Significant progress has been made in characterizing broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV envelope glycoprotein Env, but an effective vaccine has proven elusive. Vaccine development would be facilitated if common features of early founder virus required for transmission could be identified. Here we employ a combination of bioinformatic and operations research methods to determine the most prevalent features that distinguish 78 subtype B and 55 subtype C founder Env sequences from an equal number of chronic sequences. There were a number of equivalent optimal  (based on the fewest covarying amino acid (AA) pairs or a measure of maximal covariance) that separated founders from chronics: 13 pairs for subtype B and 75 for subtype C. Every subtype B optimal solution contained the founder pairs 178-346 Asn-Val, 232-236 -Ser, 240-340 Lys-Lys, 279-315 Asp-Lys, 291-792 Ala-Ile, 322-347 Asp-, 535-620 Leu-Asp, 742-837 Arg-, and 750-836 Asp-Ile; the most common optimal pairs for subtype C were 644-781 Lys-Ala (74 of 75 ), 133-287 Ala-Gln (73/75) and 307-337 Ile-Gln (73/75). No pair was present in all optimal subtype C solutions highlighting the difficulty in targeting transmission with a single vaccine strain. Relative to the size of its domain (0.35% of Env), the α4β7 binding site occurred most frequently among optimal pairs, especially for subtype C: 4.2% of optimal pairs (1.2% for subtype B). Early sequences from 5 subtype B pre-seroconverters each exhibited at least one clone containing an optimal feature 553-624 (Ser-Asn), 724-747 (Arg-Arg), or 46-293 (Arg-Glu).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315826>Effect of extrusion processing of soybean meal on ileal amino acid digestibility and growth performance of broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>The present experiments were conducted to investigate the efficacy of extrusion of inadequately processed soybean meal (SBM) on amino acid (AA) digestibility and performance of broiler chicks. In Exp. 1, 180 day-old Ross broiler chicks were randomly distributed between 6 pen replicates (15 chicks each) of 2 dietary treatments; diets based on SBM or extruded SBM (ESBM) as the main protein sources. Based on the results of Exp. 1 and AA digestibility assay, Exp. 2 was designed using 216 day-old Ross broiler chicks (6 replicates of 18 chicks each), in which dietary SBM content was replaced by 86% using ESBM. This replacement caused about a 9% decrease in dietary crude protein (CP) level. Results showed that coefficients of CP and AA digestibility were greater (P < 0.05) for ESBM than those of SBM. Extrusion processing of SBM increased digestibility coefficients of Lys, , Cys, Leu, , Tyr, Pro, Ser, and Gly. Except during the starter period, dietary inclusion of ESBM increased (P < 0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) in Exp. 1 and caused increases (P < 0.01) in average daily weight gains (ADWG) throughout the trial period. Also, using ESBM improved the (P < 0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter and finisher periods. In Exp. 2, reducing dietary CP level using ESBM decreased both ADFI (P < 0.05) and ADWG (P < 0.01) in the starter period. During grower, finisher, and entire trial periods, however, ADFI and ADWG were not influenced by dietary treatments. Dietary inclusion of ESBM improved (P < 0.05) FCR value in the finisher period. Although carcass yield was not affected by dietary treatments, reducing dietary CP level resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in abdominal fat percentage. Moreover, a decrease in dietary CP level reduced (P = 0.08) breast yield. The present findings indicate that extrusion of SBM could improve its nutritive value for broiler chicks. Using ESBM, one can reduce dietary CP level by about 9% without any detrimental effect on performance parameters of broiler chicks.© 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26020311>Low-protein amino acid-supplemented diets for growing pigs: effect on expression of amino acid transporters, serum concentration, performance, and carcass composition.</a></h1><p>Pigs fed protein-bound AA appear to have a higher abundance of AA transporters for their absorption in the jejunum compared with the duodenum. However, there is limited data about the effect of dietary free AA, readily available in the duodenum, on the duodenal abundance of AA transporters and its impact on pig performance. Forty-eight pigs (24.3 kg initial BW) distributed in 4 treatments were used to evaluate the effect of the CP level and form (free vs. protein bound) in which AA are added to diets on the expression of AA transporters in the 3 small intestine segments, serum concentration of AA, and performance. Dietary treatments based on wheat and soybean meal (SBM) were 1) low-CP (14%) diet supplemented with L-Lys, L-, DL-Met, L-Leu, L-Ile, L-Val, L-His, L-Trp, and L- (LPAA); 2) as in the LPAA but with added L-Gly as a N source (LPAA+N); 3) intermediate CP content (16%) supplemented with L-Lys HCl, L-, and DL-Met (MPAA); and 4) high-CP (22%) diet (HP) without free AA. At the end of the experiment, 8 pigs from LPAA and HP were sacrificed to collect intestinal mucosa and blood samples and to dissect the carcasses. There were no differences in ADG, ADFI, G:F, and weights of carcass components and some visceral organs between treatments. Weights of the large intestine and kidney were higher in HP pigs (P < 0.01). Expression of b(0,+) in the duodenum was higher in pigs fed the LPAA compared with the HP diet (P= 0.036) but there was no difference in the jejunum and ileum. In the ileum, y+ L expression tended to be higher in pigs fed the LPAA diet (P = 0.098). Expression of b(0,+) in LPAA pigs did not differ between the duodenum and the jejunum, but in HP pigs, the expression of all AA transporters was higher in the jejunum than in the duodenum or ileum (P < 0.05). The serum concentration of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, , and Val was higher but serum Lys and Met were lower in pigs fed the HP diet (P < 0.05). These results indicate that LPAA can substitute up to 8 percentage units of protein in HP wheat-SBM diets without affecting pig performance; nonessential N does not seem to be limiting in very low-protein wheat-SBM diets for growing pigs. Also, the inclusion of free AA in the diet appears to affect their serum concentration and the expression of the AA transporter b0,+ in the duodenum of pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29769318>Structural basis for selective inhibition of human PKG Iα by the balanol-like compound N46.</a></h1><p>Activation of protein kinase G (PKG) Iα in nociceptive neurons induces long-term hyperexcitability that causes chronic pain. Recently, a derivative of the fungal metabolite balanol, N46, has been reported to inhibit PKG Iα with high potency and selectivity and attenuate thermal hyperalgesia and osteoarthritic pain. Here we determined co-crystal structures of the PKG Iα C-domain and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) Cα, each bound with N46, at 1.98 Å and 2.65 Å, respectively. N46 binds the active site with its external phenyl ring, specifically interacting with the glycine-rich loop and the αC helix. -371 at the PKG Iα glycine-rich loop is oriented parallel to the phenyl ring of N46, forming a strong π-stacking interaction, whereas the analogous -54 in PKA Cα rotates 30° and forms a weaker interaction. Structural comparison revealed that steric hindrance between the preceding Ser-53 and the propoxy group of the phenyl ring may explain the weaker interaction with PKA Cα. The analogous Gly-370 in PKG Iα, however, causes little steric hindrance with -371. Moreover, Ile-406 on the αC helix forms a hydrophobic interaction with N46 whereas its counterpart in PKA, -88, does not. Substituting these residues in PKG Iα with those in PKA Cα increases the IC values for N46, whereas replacing these residues in PKA Cα with those in PKG Iα reduces the IC, consistent with our structural findings. In conclusion, our results explain the structural basis for N46-mediated selective inhibition of human PKG Iα and provide a starting point for structure-guided design of selective PKG Iα inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28003514> Trm140 has two recognition modes for 3-methylcytidine modification of the anticodon loop of tRNA substrates.</a></h1><p>The 3-methylcytidine (mC) modification is ubiquitous in eukaryotic tRNA, widely found at C in the anticodon loop of tRNA, tRNA, and some tRNA species, as well as in the variable loop (V-loop) of certain tRNA species. In the yeast , formation of mC requires Trm140 for six tRNA substrates, including three tRNA species and three tRNA species, whereas in , two Trm140 homologs are used, one for tRNA and one for tRNA The occurrence of a single Trm140 homolog is conserved broadly among Ascomycota, whereas multiple Trm140-related homologs are found in metazoans and other fungi. We investigate here how  Trm140 protein recognizes its six tRNA substrates. We show that Trm140 has two modes of tRNA substrate recognition. Trm140 recognizes G-U-tA of the anticodon loop of tRNA substrates, and this sequence is an identity element because it can be used to direct mC modification of tRNA However, Trm140 recognition of tRNA substrates is different, since their anticodons do not share G-U and do not have any nucleotides in common. Rather, specificity of Trm140 for tRNA is achieved by seryl-tRNA synthetase and the distinctive tRNA V-loop, as well as by tA and iA We provide evidence that all of these components are important in vivo and that seryl-tRNA synthetase greatly stimulates mC modification of tRNA and tRNA in vitro. In addition, our results show that Trm140 binding is a significant driving force for tRNA modification and suggest separate contributions from each recognition element for the modification.© 2017 Han et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25941172>Amino acid residues Leu135 and Tyr236 are required for RNA binding activity of CFIm25 in Entamoeba histolytica.</a></h1><p>Pre-mRNA 3' end processing in the nucleus is essential for mRNA stability, efficient nuclear transport, and translation in eukaryotic cells. In Human, the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery contains the 25 kDa subunit of the Cleavage Factor Im (CFIm25), which specifically recognizes two UGUA elements and regulates the assembly of polyadenylation factors, poly(A) site selection and polyadenylation. In Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan parasite responsible for human amoebiasis, EhCFIm25 has been reported as a RNA binding protein that interacts with the Poly(A) Polymerase.

Here, we used microbial detection, metabolomics, extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, and multivariate statistical analysis to address this issue. The aggregation capacity of anammox consortia varied periodically during reactor operation, which was determined by the hydrophobic force and the ratio of extracellular protein (PN) to extracellular polysaccharides (PS). Fundamentally, it related to the variation of polysaccharides degradation bacteria abundance and the discrepancy of consortia . Specifically, the distinguishable up-regulation of the amino acids , Leu, Ala, , Gly, Glu, and Val potentially contributed to the high biosynthesis of extracellular PN. Together with the reduced extracellular PS production that was regulated via the uridine diphosphate (UDP)- N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and UDP- N-acetyl-d-galactosamine , the elevated extracellular PN-to-PS ratio resulted in the obviously increased extracellular hydrophobicity and aggregation capacity. Additionally, the overtly enriched phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis pathway was also vital to increasing extracellular hydrophobicity to accelerate aggregation. Understanding aggregation capacity variation is useful for advancing anammox aggregation for its application in wastewater treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30244134>Insulinotropic activity of the host-defense peptide frenatin 2D: Conformational, structure-function and mechanistic studies.</a></h1><p>Of four naturally occurring frenatin peptides tested, frenatin 2D (DLLGTLGNLPLPFI.NH) from Discoglossus sardus was the most potent and effective in producing concentration-dependent stimulation of insulin release from BRIN-BD11 rat clonal β-cells without displaying cytotoxicity. The peptide also stimulated insulin release from 1.1B4 human-derived clonal β-cells and isolated mouse islets and improved glucose tolerance concomitant with increased circulating insulin concentrations in mice following intraperitoneal administration. The insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D was not associated with membrane depolarization or an increase in intracellular [Ca] but incubation of the peptide (1 μM) with BRIN-BD11 cells produced a modest, but significant (P < 0.05), increase in cAMP production. Stimulation of insulin release was abolished in protein kinase A-downregulated cells but maintained in protein kinase C-downregulated cells. Circular dichroism studies showed that, in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles, frenatin 2D exhibited a helical content of 35% and a turn content of 28%. Substitution of the , Asn, Pro, and Ile residues in frenatin-2D by Trp and interchange of Pro and  led to loss of insulinotropic activity but the [D1W] and [G7W] analogues were as potent and effective as the native peptide. Frenatin 2D (1 μM) also stimulated proliferation of BRIN-BD11 cells and provided significant protection of the cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. It is concluded that the insulinotropic activity of frenatin 2D is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by the K channel-independent pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Sham-operated animals (n = 6) were used as controls. Results demonstrated that mTBI caused modest, transient changes in NAA, Asp, GABA, Gly, Arg. Following sTBI, animals showed profound, long-lasting modifications of Glu, Gln, NAA, Asp, GABA, Ser, Gly, Ala, Arg, Citr, Tau, Met, SAH, l-Cystat, Tyr and . Increase in Glu and Gln, depletion of NAA and Asp increase, suggested a link between NAA hydrolysis and excitotoxicity after sTBI. Additionally, sTBI rats showed net imbalances of the Glu-Gln/GABA cycle between neurons and astrocytes, and of the methyl-cycle (demonstrated by decrease in Met, and increase in SAH and l-Cystat), throughout the post-injury period. Besides evidencing new potential targets for novel pharmacological treatments, these results suggest that the force acting on the brain tissue at the time of the impact is the main determinant of the reactions ignited and involving amino acid .© 2016 The Authors.

The protein degradation characteristics of BSD1 was studied with rice protein as the sole nitrogen source. Maximum protein degradation activity was obtained when BSD1 was inoculated with an inoculum of 5% into a medium with glucose as carbon source and initial pH value of 7.0 and incubated at 30°C for 48 h. In this optimal condition, protein concentration decreased from 156.8 mg/L to 19.2 mg/L, and protein degradation efficiency of BSD1 reached 88%. Free amino acid analysis showed that the content of , Tyr, Pro, Ala, Lys,  and His increased in protein degradation process. After degradation, NHN concentration producing in medium supernatant reached 232.2 mg/L. These results indicated the strain BSD1 could transform proteins into free amino acids and eventually convert them to ammonium or ammonia. Furthermore, strain BSD1 could also be used for deproteinization of brewery spent diatomite and 51% of proteins in spent diatomite were degraded. After biological deproteinization the specific surface area and total pore volume of diatomite improved obviously. These results illustrated that the application of strain BSD1 for bio-regeneration of high-protein brewery spent diatomite was efficient and feasible.Copyright © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Following Preplanting Seedling Spray with Salicylic Acid.</a></h1><p>Preplanting foliar spray of salicylic acid (SA) (0.0, 5.0, and 10.0 μg/mL) to Solanum lycopersicum (L.) altered the metabolite profile of amino acids, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and SA in leaf, root, and fruits. Free amino acid pools increased; bound amino acid pools reduced. In vegetative tissues, amino acid biosyntheses linked to osmo-compatibility (Pro, Leu, Val and GABA); N (Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln, and Glu); C (Pro, Ser, and Tyr); S (Cys) assimilation; stress tolerance (Ala, Gly, Hyp, His, Lys, Met, and ); and central  (, Trp, and Tyr) enhanced for 60-120 days. Concentrations of Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Leu, and Ser in leaf and of Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Hyp, Lys, Met, Pro, and Val in root predominated. In planta SA and GABA biosynthesis increased concurrently. SA affected GABA biosynthesis via Glu, Pro, and Arg . SA, GABA, Glu, and Pro were key canonical variables. This study first reported SA-induced metabolites promoting health (SA/GABA; Cys/Met) and palatability (Glu/Asp; Gln) in table tomato.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27695790>Heat stress affects the apparent and standardized ileal digestibilities of amino acids in growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Heat stress (HS) appears to impair the pig's small intestine digestive and absorptive capacities and, therefore, may affect the AA digestibilities. A crossover-designed experiment was conducted utilizing two 7-d periods with 8 pigs (30.8 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-type cannulas at the terminal ileum to analyze the effect of HS on both apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility of AA in pigs fed a wheat-soybean meal diet. Subcutaneous skin and ileal lumen temperatures were continuously monitored in 15-min intervals during the entire experiment. After recovery from surgery, all pigs were adapted to the diet and trained to consume the same amount of feed twice a day for 5 d in thermal-neutral (TN) conditions (22°C ± 2°C). Following adaptation, pigs were divided into 2 groups (4 pigs each); 1 remained in TN conditions, and the other group was exposed to natural HS (24°C to 45°C) for 7 d (period 1). In period 2, the 2 groups switched environments. Ileal digesta were continuously collected for 12 h, starting at 0700 h, on d 6 and 7 of each period. Chromic oxide was used as an indicator of intestinal digesta flow. The subcutaneous and the ileal temperatures were increased between 1.3°C and 1.6°C in HS compared to TN pigs ( < 0.001). The AID of AA (%) for the TN and HS pigs were Arg, 90.6, 88.1; His, 88.7, 85.9; Ile, 84.8, 83.9; Leu, 86.9, 84.1; Lys, 86.8, 86.2; Met, 89.8, 89.1; , 86.0, 84.8; , 76.7, 74.3; and Val, 82.8, 81.7, respectively. The SID (%) of AA for the TN and HS pigs were Arg, 94.0, 92.0; His, 92.5, 90.2; Ile, 89.5, 88.1; Leu, 90.1, 88.6; Lys, 91.0, 90.1; Met, 94.4, 93.6; , 90.4, 88.9; , 86.0, 83.7; and Val, 88.1, 86.5, respectively. The AID of Arg, His, and Leu was lower ( < 0.01) in HS pigs, and the SID of Arg and His was also lower in HS pigs. Neither the AID nor the SID of the remaining essential AA was affected by HS. In summary, the digestibility of essential AA is differentially affected in pigs exposed to natural HS, and thus, special attention should be given to Arg and His when formulating diets for growing pigs under HS conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28592826>PH-Dependent Enantioselectivity of D-amino Acid Oxidase in Aqueous Solution.</a></h1><p>D-amino acid oxidases (DAAO) are stereospecific enzymes which are generally almost inactive towards L-enantiomer in neutral solution when L-, D-amino acids are supplied as substrates. In this paper, the D-amino acid oxidase can catalytic oxidize L-amino acids by modulating pH of aqueous solution. With L-Pro as substrate, the catalytic rate (k ) and the affinity (K ) of DAAO were 6.71 s and 33 mM at pH 8.0, respectively, suggesting that optimal pH condition enhanced the activity of DAAO towards L-Pro. Similar results were obtained when L-Ala (pH 9.8), L-Arg (pH 6.5), L- (pH 9.0), L- (pH 9.4), and L-Val (pH 8.5) were catalyzed by DAAO at various pH values. The racemization of the L-amino acids was not found by capillary electrophoresis analysis during oxidation, and quantification analysis of L-amino acids before and after catalytic reaction was performed, which confirmed that the modulation of enantioselectivity of DAAO resulted from the oxidation of L-amino acids rather than D-amino acids by changing pH. A mechanistic model was proposed to explain enhanced activity of DAAO towards L-amino acids under optimal pH condition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26801824>Identification of a novel starfish neuropeptide that acts as a muscle relaxant.</a></h1><p>Neuropeptides that act as muscle relaxants have been identified in chordates and protostomian invertebrates but little is known about the molecular identity of neuropeptides that act as muscle relaxants in deuterostomian invertebrates (e.g. echinoderms) that are 'evolutionary intermediates' of chordates and protostomes. Here, we have used the apical muscle of the starfish Patiria pectinifera to assay for myorelaxants in extracts of this species. A hexadecapeptide with the amino acid sequence -Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly-Ala-Tyr-Asp-Pro-Leu-Ser-Ala-Gly---Asp was identified and designated starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP). Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the SMP precursor protein revealed that it comprises 12 copies of SMP as well as 3 peptides (7 copies in total) that are structurally related to SMP. Analysis of the expression of SMP precursor transcripts in P. pectinifera using qPCR revealed the highest expression in the radial nerve cords and lower expression levels in a range of neuromuscular tissues, including the apical muscle, tube feet and cardiac stomach. Consistent with these findings, SMP also caused relaxation of tube foot and cardiac stomach preparations. Furthermore, SMP caused relaxation of apical muscle preparations from another starfish species - Asterias amurensis. Collectively, these data indicate that SMP has a general physiological role as a muscle relaxant in starfish. Interestingly, comparison of the sequence of the SMP precursor with known neuropeptide precursors revealed that SMP belongs to a bilaterian family of neuropeptides that include molluscan pedal peptides (PP) and arthropodan orcokinins (OK). This is the first study to determine the function of a PP/OK-type peptide in a deuterostome. Pedal peptide/orcokinin (PP/OK)-type peptides are a family of structurally related neuropeptides that were first identified and functionally characterised in protostomian invertebrates. Here, we report the discovery of starfish myorelaxant peptide (SMP), a novel member of the PP/OK-type neuropeptide identified in the starfish Patiria pectinifera (phylum Echinodermata). SMP is the first PP/OK-type neuropeptide to be functionally characterised in a deuterostome.© 2016 The Authors.

Many kinases are regulated via phosphorylation within their activation loop. This loop is embedded in the activation segment, which additionally contains the Mg binding loop and a P + 1 loop that is important in substrate binding. In this report, we identify Abl-mediated phosphorylation of a highly conserved Tyr residue in the P + 1 loop of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) during oxidative stress. Remarkably, we observed that the three human PKD isoforms display very different degrees of P + 1 loop Tyr phosphorylation and we identify one of the molecular determinants for this divergence. This is paralleled by a different activation mechanism of PKD1 and PKD2 during oxidative stress. Tyr phosphorylation in the P + 1 loop of PKD2 increases turnover for Syntide-2, while substrate specificity and the role of PKD2 in NF-κB signaling remain unaffected. Importantly, Tyr to  substitution renders the kinase inactive, jeopardizing its use as a non-phosphorylatable mutant. Since large-scale proteomics studies identified P + 1 loop Tyr phosphorylation in more than 70 Ser/ kinases in multiple conditions, our results do not only demonstrate differential regulation/function of PKD isoforms under oxidative stress, but also have implications for kinase regulation in general.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988118>Effects of feeding betaine-containing liquid supplement to transition dairy cows.</a></h1><p>Betaine is a natural compound found in sugar beets that serves as a methyl donor and organic osmolyte when fed to animals. The objective was to evaluate the effect of feeding betaine-containing molasses on performance of transition dairy cows during late summer in 2 trials. In early September, cows were randomly assigned to betaine (BET) or control (CON) groups either shortly after dry off (trial 1; n = 10 per treatment) or 24 d before calving (trial 2; n = 8 per treatment) based on parity and previous mature equivalent milk yield. Cows were fed common diets supplemented either with a liquid supplement made of molasses from sugar cane and condensed beet solubles containing betaine [BET, 89.1 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] or a sugar cane molasses-based liquid supplement without betaine (CON) until 8 wk postpartum. The liquid supplements had similar nutrient contents and were fed at a rate of 1.1 and 1.4 kg DM/d for pre- and postpartum cows, respectively. Starting at their entry in the studies, cows were housed in the same freestall barn without a cooling system. After calving, all cows were housed in the same barn cooled by misters and fans and milked thrice daily. Intake was recorded daily and body weight and body condition score were assessed every 2 wk. Milk yield was recorded at each milking and composition was analyzed weekly. Blood samples were collected weekly from a subset of cows to assess concentrations of metabolites and AA. No treatment effects were apparent for DM intake and body weight in the prepartum and postpartum periods. For cows enrolled at dry off, BET supported higher milk yield (45.1 vs. 41.9 kg/d) and fat content (4.78 vs. 4.34%) and elevated plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in early lactation compared to CON. However, no differences were observed for milk yield, most milk component contents and yields, and blood metabolites between treatments for cows enrolled during the close-up period. Compared to cows in the CON group, BET cows enrolled during the far-off period tended to have lower plasma concentrations of Met, , and Trp during the pre- and postpartum periods. They also had lower plasma concentrations of Lys and  before calving but higher plasma Gly concentration after parturition. In conclusion, feeding a betaine-containing liquid supplement from far-off through early lactation improves lactation performance but increases adipose tissue mobilization and production of ketone bodies in early lactation.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Data on somatostatin receptor expression in follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer has been limited and conflicting. This study seeks to characterize somatostatin receptor expression in follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer and to assess the effects of somatostatin analogues.Anaplastic thyroid cancer (Hth7 and 8505C) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC-236) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) cells were cultured. Capillary immunoblotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to determine the basal expression of protein and mRNA of SSTR1-SSTR5. Cells were treated with the somatostatin analogues octreotide, pasireotride (SOM230), and KE-108 for 48h. IC was determined via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and cell proliferation was measured by viable cell count. Presence of SSTR2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that most cell lines expressed SSTR1-SSTR3 and SSTR5 in varying degrees. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that mRNA expression for SSTR2 and SSTR3 correlated with protein expression. MTT assays showed that KE-108 and SOM230 were able to inhibit cell proliferation. Tissue microarray (TMA) showed that SSTR2 was highly expressed in human tissues of aggressive thyroid carcinomas.Follicular thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer express SSTR1-3 and SSTR5 in distinct fashions both at a message and protein level. Our results suggest that somatostatin receptors are still a relevant and promising drug target against non-medullary thyroid cancers.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29148165>Dinitroaniline herbicide resistance in a multiple-resistant Lolium rigidum population.</a></h1><p>The pre-emergence dinitroaniline herbicides (such as trifluralin and pendimethalin) are vital to Australian no-till farming systems. A Lolium rigidum population collected from the Western Australian grain belt with a 12-year trifluralin use history was characterised for resistance to dinitroaniline, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase)- and acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides. Target-site resistance mechanisms were investigated.This L. rigidum population exhibited 32-fold resistance to trifluralin, as compared with the susceptible population. It also displayed 12- to 30-fold cross-resistance to other dinitroaniline herbicides (pendimethalin, ethalfluralin and oryzalin). In addition, this population showed multiple resistance to commonly used post-emergence ACCase- and ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Two target-site α-tubulin gene mutations (Val-202- and -239-Ile) previously documented in other dinitroaniline-resistant weed species were identified, and some known target-site mutations in ACCase (Ile-1781-Leu, Asp-2078-Gly and Cys-2088-Arg) and ALS (Pro-197-Gln/Ser) were found in the same population. An agar-based Petri dish screening method was established for the rapid diagnosis of resistance to dinitroaniline herbicides.Evolution of target-site resistance to both pre- and post-emergence herbicides was confirmed in a single L. rigidum population. The α-tubulin mutations Val-202- and -239-Ile, documented here for the first time in L. rigidum, are likely to be responsible for dinitroaniline resistance in this population. Early detection of dinitroaniline herbicide resistance and integrated weed management strategies are needed to maintain the effectiveness of dinitroaniline herbicides. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28374069>Mu and kappa opioid receptors of the periaqueductal gray stimulate and inhibit thermogenesis, respectively, during psychological stress in rats.</a></h1><p>The periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is rich in mu and kappa opioid receptors, and this system is involved in thermoregulation, analgesia, and defensive behaviors. No study approached the involvement of the PAG opioids in body temperature (Tb) regulation during psychological stress such as restraint. Because activation of mu and kappa receptors increases and reduces Tb, respectively, we tested the hypothesis that they exert excitatory and inhibitory modulation, respectively, of the restraint-induced fever in rats. To this end, Tb, heat loss index (HLI, inference for peripheral vasoconstriction/vasodilation), and oxygen consumption (inference for thermogenesis) were monitored in unanesthetized rats, restrained or unrestrained, before and after intra-PAG microinjection of the selective mu opioid receptor antagonist (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH cyclic, CTAP; 1 and 10 μg/100 nL) or the selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist (nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride, nor-BNI; 1 and 4 μg/100 nL) or saline (100 nL). CTAP and nor-BNI did not change the Tb or HLI of euthermic animals. During restraint, Tb increased (1.0 ± 0.1 °C) in all groups; however, this effect was lower in those animals treated with CTAP and higher in animals treated with nor-BNI. The HLI decreased during restraint and increased after animals were released, but this response was not affected by any treatment. Restraint stress increased oxygen consumption (35.9 ± 3.9% elevation), but this response was diminished by CTAP and overstimulated by nor-BNI. Confirming our hypothesis, the results indicate that the mu and kappa opioid receptors in the PAG of rats play a pyrogenic and antipyretic role, respectively, during fever induced by restraint by affecting the thermogenic but not the heat conservation effector.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210629>Development of a Substrate Identification Method for Human Scp1 Phosphatase Using Phosphorylation Mimic Phage Display.</a></h1><p>Protein phosphorylation is strictly regulated by protein kinases and protein phosphatases, and disordered regulation of protein phosphorylation often causes serious diseases, such as cancer. Protein phosphatases are divided into two major groups: tyrosine (Tyr) phosphatases and serine/threonine (Ser/) phosphatases. Substrate trapping mutants are frequently used to characterize Tyr phosphatases and identify their substrates; however, a rapid and simple method to identify substrates for Ser/ phosphatases has yet to be developed. Recently it has reported that AlF4 -/AlF3 and BeF3 - form a complex with Mg2+ in the catalytic center of FCP/SCP phosphatases, and that the Mg2+-AlF4 -/AlF3 complex mimics the transition state of the hydrolysis step, while the Mg2+-BeF3 - complex mimics the aspartylphosphate intermediate.The main objective of this study was to develop a novel methodology, termed Phosphorylation Mimic Phage Display (PMPD), to identify substrates for Ser/ phosphatase Scp1 using peptide phage display libraries with Mg2+ and AlF4 -.Recombinant protein of human full-length Scp1 (rScp1) expressed in E. coli system was purified by Co2+ chelated affinity column, and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The Ph.D.-C7C or M12 Phage Display Libraries (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) were screened using purified rScp1 immobilized on ELISA plate. Then, the plate was blocked with 0.5% (w/v) BSA in maleate buffer at 4°C for 3 h, before adding approximately 1×1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the phages in maleate blocking AlF4 - buffer to each well. After incubating, the wells were washed with maleate AlF4 - buffer to remove unbound phages. Then, phages were eluted with Mg2+ and AlF4 - free maleate buffer or with excess rScp1. After the third round of screening, the isolated phages were sequenced and subjected to binding analyses.After panning by PMPD method, 46 and 60 clones were isolated from the Ph.D. C7C and Ph.D. 12 phage libraries, respectively, as Mg2+ or/and AlF4 - -dependent binding clones. The binding analyses showed that M12-1 and Dep-3 specifically bind to Scp1 in an AlF4 --dependent manner. Notably, the Dep-3 peptide contained a -Pro-Met-Ser sequence, which is similar to the Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5 (Ser/-Pro-partially hydrophobic residue-Ser) sequence found in CTD, which is an endogenous substrate for Scp1. Binding analyses also showed that both BP-14 and M12-6a bound to Scp1 in a Mg2+-dependent manner. BP-14 peptide contained Ser- -Tyr and Pro--Glu sequences, which are similar to the Ser--Trp and Ile--Glu sequences found in M12-6a, suggesting that one or both of these tripeptides may be the binding motif(s) recognized by Scp1.We developed a substrate identification method for the Ser/ phosphatase Scp1 using a novel phage display method with AlF4 -. Dep-3 showed a core sequence similar to that of the CTD of RNA polymerase II, an endogenous Scp1 substrate, suggesting that this method is applicable for identifying novel Scp1 substrate candidates. This method will also be applicable for other FCP/SCP-type phosphatases, allowing us to better understand the substrate recognition mechanisms of Ser/ phosphatases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25605306>Structural insights into the multispecific recognition of dipeptides of deep-sea gram-negative bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain SM9913.</a></h1><p>Peptide uptake is important for nutrition supply for marine bacteria. It is also an important step in marine nitrogen cycling. However, how marine bacteria absorb peptides is still not fully understood. DppA is the periplasmic dipeptide binding protein of dipeptide permease (Dpp; an important peptide transporter in bacteria) and exclusively controls the substrate specificity of Dpp. Here, the substrate binding specificity of deep-sea Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain SM9913 DppA (PsDppA) was analyzed for 25 different dipeptides with various properties by using isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. PsDppA showed binding affinities for 8 dipeptides. To explain the multispecific substrate recognition mechanism of PsDppA, we solved the crystal structures of unliganded PsDppA and of PsDppA in complex with 4 different types of dipeptides (Ala-, Met-Leu, Gly-Glu, and Val-). PsDppA alternates between an "open" and a "closed" form during substrate binding. Structural analyses of the 4 PsDppA-substrate complexes combined with mutational assays indicate that PsDppA binds to different substrates through a precise mechanism: dipeptides are bound mainly by the interactions between their backbones and PsDppA, in particular by anchoring their N and C termini through ion-pair interactions; hydrophobic interactions are important in binding hydrophobic dipeptides; and Lys457 is necessary for the binding of dipeptides with a C-terminal glutamic acid or glutamine. Additionally, sequence alignment suggests that the substrate recognition mechanism of PsDppA may be common in Gram-negative bacteria. All together, our results provide structural insights into the multispecific substrate recognition mechanism of marine Gram-negative bacterial DppA, which provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of marine bacterial peptide uptake.Peptide uptake plays a significant role in nutrition supply for marine bacteria. It is also an important step in marine nitrogen cycling. However, how marine bacteria recognize and absorb peptides is still unclear. This study analyzed the substrate binding specificity of deep-sea Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain SM9913 DppA (PsDppA; the dipeptide-binding protein of dipeptide permease) and solved the crystal structures of unliganded PsDppA and PsDppA in complex with 4 different types of dipeptides. The multispecific recognition mechanism of PsDppA for dipeptides is explained based on structural and mutational analyses. We also find that the substrate-binding mechanism of PsDppA may be common in Gram-negative bacteria.

As such, developing a greater understanding of their substrate selectivity would expand our ability to engineer the enzymatic or microbial production of a broad range of small-molecule targets. Here, we report the crystal structures and biochemical characterization of Acat2 and Acat5, two biosynthetic thiolases from Ascaris suum with varying selectivity toward branched compared to linear compounds. The structure of the Acat2-C91S mutant bound to propionyl-CoA shows that the terminal methyl group of the substrate, representing the α-branch point, is directed toward the conserved  288 and Met 158 residues. In Acat5, the  ring is rotated to accommodate a hydroxyl-π interaction with an adjacent  side chain, decreasing space in the binding pocket and possibly accounting for its strong preference for linear substrates compared to Acat2. Comparison of the different Acat thiolase structures shows that Met 158 is flexible, adopting alternate conformations with the side chain rotated toward or away from a covering loop at the back of the active site. Mutagenesis of residues in the covering loop in Acat5 with the corresponding residues from Acat2 allows for highly increased accommodation of branched substrates, whereas the converse mutations do not significantly affect Acat2 substrate selectivity. Our results suggest an important contribution of second-shell residues to thiolase substrate selectivity and offer insights into engineering this enzyme class.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155583>Abnormal Amino Acid Profiles of Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid from Cystathionine β-Synthase-Deficient Mice, an Animal Model of Homocystinuria.</a></h1><p>Mental retardation is the most common feature among inborn errors of amino acid . Patients with homocystinuria/homocysteinemia caused by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency suffer from thromboembolism and mental retardation from early ages; therefore, detection by newborn screening is performed. Furthermore, elevated levels of serum homocysteine during pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in newborns. However, the causes of such central nervous system (CNS) defects are unknown. We found previously impaired learning abilities in Cbs-deficient (Cbs) mice (but not NTD births). Here, we investigated the amino acid profiles of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Cbs mice. Mice deficient in cystathionine γ-lyase (Cth), a downstream enzyme of CBS in transsulfuration, as well as wild-type mice, were analyzed as controls. Cbs and Cth mice were smaller than wild-type mice, and CSF yields in Cbs mice were lower than the others. CSF amino acid levels were generally lower than those in serum, and compared with the dramatic amino acid level alterations in Cbs mouse serum, alterations in CSF were less apparent. However, marked upregulation (versus wild-type) of aspartic acid/asparagine (Asp/Asn), glutamine (Gln), serine (Ser), threonine (), phenylalanine (), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), total homocysteine, and citrulline, and downregulation of lysine (Lys) were found in Cbs mouse CSF. Because similar regulation of total homocysteine/citrulline/Lys was observed in the CSF of Cth mice, which are free of CNS dysfunction, the reduced CSF volumes and the level changes of other amino acids could be relevant to Cbs-specific CNS defects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26812323>Effect of heat stress on the endogenous intestinal loss of amino acids in growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Heat stress (HS) increases the death of intestinal cells in pigs, which, in turn, may elevate the endogenous intestinal loss (EIL) of proteins and AA. An experiment was conducted to analyze the effect of HS on the AA composition of intestinal endogenous proteins and the EIL of AA in pigs. Eight pigs (25.2 ± 1.2 kg initial BW) were surgically implanted with T-type cannulas at the end of the small intestine. After surgery recovery, during the subsequent 7 d, all pigs were adapted to a protein- and AA-free diet and trained to consume the same amount of feed twice a day. All pigs were housed under thermoneutral (TN) conditions (22 ± 2°C) during this time. The following day, all pigs were still under TN conditions and ileal content was collected during 12 consecutive hours, at the end of which and for the following 8 d the pigs were exposed to natural HS conditions (31 to 37°C). Ileal content was collected again on d 2 (HS at d 2 [HSd2]) and 8 (HS at d 8 [HSd8]). Body temperature (BT) was measured in another group of 8 pigs every 15 min during the whole study. The average BT at HSd2 (39.6°C) was higher ( < 0.05) compared with both TN conditions (38.6°C) and HSd8 (38.8°C), but it did not differ between TN conditions and HSd8. The AA composition of endogenous intestinal protein was not affected by HS. The EIL of Arg and His were greater ( < 0.05) and the EIL of  and  tended to be greater ( ≤ 0.10) at HSd2 than in TN conditions; the EIL of Pro was greater ( = 0.01) at HSd8. The EIL of the remaining AA was not affected by HS. Although HS increased the EIL of Arg and His within the first 2 d, it appeared that normal EIL was shortly reestablished. These data show that acute HS does not affect the AA composition of intestinal endogenous proteins in growing pigs and that the EIL of AA may not be critical in growing pigs acclimated to high ambient temperature. Nevertheless, the increased EIL of Arg and  at HSd2 indicate that HS might affect the integrity of the intestinal epithelium of pigs during the first day of their exposure to high ambient temperature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30329054>Immune system stimulation induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Changes in plasma free AA flux reflect the modification of AA metabolism in different metabolic states. Immune system stimulation (ISS) in growing pigs may redistribute AA from protein retention towards processes involved in the immune response, thus impacting AA utilization. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ISS on whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization and the kinetics of plasma free AA. Ten gilts (BW 9.4 ± 1.1 kg) were surgically fitted with jugular vein catheters, individually housed in metabolism crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Repeated intramuscular injections of increasing amounts of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to induce ISS (30 and 36 µg/kg BW, given 48 h apart). Whole-body N-balance was determined for 3-d before ISS (ISS-) and 3-d during ISS (ISS+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for determination of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma-free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood samples were collected before and 76-h after the initiation of ISS and assayed for hematology and blood chemistry. Body temperature (BT) was monitored during the course of study. Blood chemistry, hematology, and BT results indicated that LPS induced effective ISS in pigs (P < 0.05). ISS tended to reduce N retention (P = 0.09) and the N retention-to-N intake ratio (P = 0.08). Apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy and AID of N were reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Ile and  was reduced by ISS (P < 0.05). Strong tendencies for decreased Lys flux and N retention were observed in ISS pigs (P < 0.10). ISS increased the pool size for Leu but reduced the pool size for Ile (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that ISS alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size in growing pigs. The decrease in Lys, , and Ile flux during ISS may be attributed to a reduction in whole-body protein synthesis or decreased catabolism of these AA. Relative to other AA, dietary Lys, , and Ile requirements may decrease in ISS pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864055>Changes in mammary  in response to the provision of an ideal amino acid profile at 2 levels of metabolizable protein supply in dairy cows: Consequences on efficiency.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to compare the modifications in mammary gland  by supplying an ideal versus an imbalanced essential AA (EAA) profile at low and high metabolizable protein (or PDIE, its equivalent in the INRA feeding system). Four lactating, multiparous Holstein cows received 4 treatments composed of 2 basal diets containing 2 levels of PDIE (LP or HP) and 2 different infusions of AA mixtures (AA- or AA+) in the duodenum. The AA+ mixture contained Lys, Met, Leu, His, Ile, Val, , Arg, Trp, and Glu, whereas the AA- mixture contained Glu, Pro, and Ser. The infusion mixtures were iso-PDIE. The diet plus infusions provided 13.9 versus 15.8% of crude protein that corresponded to 102 versus 118g/kg of dry matter of PDIE in LP and HP treatments, respectively. The treatments were designed as a 2×2 crossover design of 2 levels of PDIE supply (LP vs. HP) with 28-d periods. Infusions of AA in the duodenum (AA- vs. AA+) were superimposed to diet within each 28-d period according to 2×2 crossover designs with 14-d subperiods. Increasing the PDIE supply tended to increase milk protein yield; however, the efficiency of PDIE utilization decreased and the plasma urea concentration increased, indicating a higher catabolism of AA. The AA+ treatments increased milk protein yield and content similarly at both levels of protein supply. This was explained by an increase in the mammary uptake of all EAA except His and Trp. The mammary uptake of non-EAA (NEAA) was altered to the increase in EAA uptake so that the total AA uptake was almost equal to milk protein output on a nitrogen basis. The ratio between NEAA to total AA uptake decreased from 46% in LPAA- to 40% in LPAA+, HPAA-, and HPAA+ treatments. The PDIE efficiency tended to increase in the AA+ versus the AA- treatments because the NEAA supply and the amount of NEAA not used by the mammary both decreased. Nevertheless, our AA+ treatments seemed not to be the ideal profile: the mammary uptake-to-output ratio for  was higher than 1 in LPAA-, but it decreased to 1 in all the other treatments, suggesting that  was deficient in these treatments. Conversely, an excess of His was indicated because its uptake was similar in AA+ and AA- treatments. In conclusion, balancing the EAA profile increased milk protein yield and metabolizable protein efficiency at both levels of protein supply by increasing the mammary uptake of EAA and altering the NEAA uptake, leading to less AA available for catabolism.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of addition of precursor amino acids during fermentation on polymyxin E biosynthesis in Paenibacillus polymyxa. The results showed that, after 35 h fermentation, addition of direct precursor amino acids to certain concentration significantly inhibited polymyxin E production and affected the expression of genes involved in its biosynthesis. L-Dab repressed the expression of polymyxin synthetase genes pmxA and pmxE, as well as 2,4-diaminobutyrate aminotransferase gene ectB; both L-Leu and D-Leu repressed the pmxA expression. In addition, L- affected the expression of not only pmxA, but also regulatory genes spo0A and abrB. As L-Dab precursor, L-Asp repressed the expression of ectB, pmxA, and pmxE. Moreover, it affected the expression of spo0A and abrB. In contrast, L-, a nonprecursor amino acid, had no obvious effect on polymyxin E biosynthesis and those biosynthesis-related genes expression. Taken together, our data demonstrated that addition of precursor amino acids during fermentation will inhibit polymyxin E production probably by affecting the expression of its biosynthesis-related genes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26885710>Manganism and Parkinson's disease: Mn(II) and Zn(II) interaction with a 30-amino acid fragment.</a></h1><p>A protected 30-amino acid fragment, Acetyl-SPDEKHELMIQLQKLDYTVGFCGDGANDCG-Amide, Acetyl-Ser-Pro-Asp-Glu-Lys-His-Glu-Leu-Met-Ile-Gln-Leu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Asp-Tyr--Val-Gly--Cys-Gly-Asp-Gly-Ala-Asn-Asp-Cys-Gly-Amide, encompassing the sequence from residues 1164 to 1193 in the encoded protein from Parkinson's disease gene Park9 (YPk9), was studied for manganese and zinc binding. Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of Glu and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale. The coordination may involve both S and N donor atoms from cysteine as well as histidine residues, together with O donor atoms from glutamic and aspartic residues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620971>The adipokinetic hormone of the coleopteran suborder Adephaga: Structure, function, and comparison of distribution in other insects.</a></h1><p>The aim of the current study is to identify the adipokinetic hormone(s) (AKHs) of a basal suborder of the species-rich Coleoptera, the Adephaga, and possibly learn more about the ancestral AKH of beetles. Moreover, we wanted to compare the ancestral AKH with AKHs of more advanced beetles, of which a number are pest insects. This would allow us to assess whether AKH mimetics would be suitable as insecticides, that is, be harmful to the pest species but not to the beneficial species. Nine species of the Adephaga were investigated and all synthesize only one octapeptide in the corpus cardiacum, as revealed by Edman degradation sequencing techniques or by mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence pGlu-Leu-Asn--Ser--Gly-Trp corresponds to Schgr-AKH-II that was first identified in the desert locust. It is assumed that Schgr-AKH-II-the peptide of a basal beetle clade-is the ancestral AKH for beetles. Some other beetle families, as well as some Hymenoptera (including honey bees) also contain this peptide, whereas most of the pest beetle species have different AKHs. This argues that those peptides and their receptors should be explored for developing mimetics with insecticidal properties. A scenario where Schgr-AKH-II (the only AKH of Adephaga) is used as basic molecular structure to derive almost all other known beetle AKHs via single step mutations is very likely, and supports the interpretation that Schgr-AKH-II is the ancestral AKH of Coleoptera.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25795677>Lantibiotic Reductase LtnJ Substrate Selectivity Assessed with a Collection of Nisin Derivatives as Substrates.</a></h1><p>Lantibiotics are potent antimicrobial peptides characterized by the presence of dehydrated amino acids, dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine, and (methyl)lanthionine rings. In addition to these posttranslational modifications, some lantibiotics exhibit additional modifications that usually confer increased biological activity or stability on the peptide. LtnJ is a reductase responsible for the introduction of D-alanine in the lantibiotic lacticin 3147. The conversion of L-serine into D-alanine requires dehydroalanine as the substrate, which is produced in vivo by the dehydration of serine by a lantibiotic dehydratase, i.e., LanB or LanM. In this work, we probe the substrate specificity of LtnJ using a system that combines the nisin modification machinery (dehydratase, cyclase, and transporter) and the stereospecific reductase LtnJ in Lactococcus lactis. We also describe an improvement in the production yield of this system by inserting a putative attenuator from the nisin biosynthesis gene cluster in front of the ltnJ gene. In order to clarify the sequence selectivity of LtnJ, peptides composed of truncated nisin and different mutated C-terminal tails were designed and coexpressed with LtnJ and the nisin biosynthetic machinery. In these tails, serine was flanked by diverse amino acids to determine the influence of the surrounding residues in the reaction. LtnJ successfully hydrogenated peptides when hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, , and Ala) were flanking the intermediate dehydroalanine, while those in which dehydroalanine was flanked by one or two polar residues (Ser, , Glu, Lys, and Asn) or Gly were either less prone to be modified by LtnJ or not modified at all. Moreover, our results showed that dehydrobutyrine cannot serve as a substrate for LtnJ.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of essential AA ratios on milk protein synthesis in vitro and to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms. Triplicate cultures of MAC-T cells and bovine mammary tissue explants (MTE) were incubated with the optimal AA ratio (OPAA; Lys:Met, 2.9:1; :, 1.05:1; Lys:, 1.8:1; Lys:His, 2.38:1; and Lys:Val, 1.23:1) in the presence of rapamycin (control), OPAA, a Lys: ratio of 2.1:1, a Lys: ratio of 1.3:1, a Lys:His ratio of 3.05:1, or a Lys:Val ratio of 1.62:1 for 12 h; the other AA concentrations were equal to OPAA. In some experiments, the cells were cultured with OPAA with or without rapamycin (100 ng/mL) or with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) small interference RNA, and the MTE were exposed to OPAA with rapamycin for β-casein expression. Among the treatments, the expression of β-casein was greatest in the MTE cultured with OPAA. In MAC-T cells, the OPAA upregulated the mRNA expression of SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 but downregulated the expression of IRS1, AKT3, EEF1A1, and EEF2 compared with the control. The OPAA had no effect on the mTOR phosphorylation status but increased the phosphorylation of S6K1 and RPS6. When the MTE were treated with rapamycin in the presence of OPAA, the expression of β-casein was markedly decreased. The phosphorylation of RPS6 and 4EBP1 also was reduced in MAC-T cells. A similar negative effect on the expression of RPS6KB1 and EIF4EBP1 was detected when the cells were cultured with either rapamycin or mTOR small interference RNA. The optimal AA ratio stimulated β-casein expression partly by enhancing the transport of AA into the cells, cross-talk with insulin signaling and a subsequent enhancement of mTOR signaling, or translation elongation in both MAC-T cells and bovine MTE.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

These PLP-dependent enzymes show high sequence homology (∼40% identity) and both form homotetrameric structures. Steady state kinetic studies with both enzymes show that an active site base is essential for activity, and α-deuterated substrates exhibit modest primary isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km, suggesting that substrate deprotonation is partially rate-limiting. Pre-steady state kinetics with TPL and TIL show rapid formation of external aldimine intermediates, followed by deprotonation to give quinonoid intermediates absorbing at about 500nm. In the presence of phenol and indole analogues, 4-hydroxypyridine and benzimidazole, the quinonoid intermediates of TPL and TIL decay to aminoacrylate intermediates, with λmax at about 340nm. Surprisingly, there are significant kinetic isotope effects on both formation and subsequent decay of the quinonoid intermediates when α-deuterated substrates are used. The crystal structure of TPL with a bound competitive inhibitor, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate, identified several essential catalytic residues: Tyr-71, -124, Arg-381, and -448. The active sites of TIL and TPL are highly conserved with the exceptions of these residues: Arg-381(TPL)/Ile-396 (TIL); -124 (TPL)/Asp-137 (TIL), and -448 (TPL)/His-463 (TIL). Mutagenesis of these residues results in dramatic decreases in catalytic activity without changing substrate specificity. The conserved tyrosine, Tyr-71 (TPL)/Tyr-74 (TIL) is essential for elimination activity with both enzymes, and likely plays a role as a proton donor to the leaving group. Mutation of Arg-381 and -124 of TPL to alanine results in very low but measurable catalytic activity. Crystallography of Y71F and F448H TPL with 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine bound demonstrated that there are two quinonoid structures, relaxed and tense. In the relaxed structure, the substrate aromatic ring is in plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond, but in the tense structure, the substrate aromatic ring is about 20° out of plane with the Cβ-Cγ bond. In the tense structure, hydrogen bonds are formed between the substrate OH and the guanidinium of Arg-381 and the OH of -124, and the phenyl rings of -448 and 449 provide steric strain. Based on the effects of mutagenesis, the substrate strain is estimated to contribute about 10(8) to TPL catalysis. Thus, the mechanisms of TPL and TIL require both substrate strain and acid/base catalysis, and substrate strain is probably responsible for the very high substrate specificity of TPL and TIL.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A nitrogen balance (NB) trial was conducted using 198 adult roosters, housed individually in  cages. The treatments were 33 purified diets being 11 diets with an amino acid mixture providing high protein intake of 500 mg N/BWkg (0.75) per day, 11 diets providing medium protein intake of 250 mg N/BWkg (0.75) per day (in each diet, one amino acid tested was diluted 50%) and 11 diets providing low protein intake of 125 mg N/BWkg (0.75) per day (made by omitting the amino acid tested). Each treatment had six replicates. After 48 h of fasting receiving water plus sucrose, the roosters were fed 40 g of the diets by tube once a day for 3 days. The excreta were collected within 72 h after the first feeding. The diets and excreta were analysed for nitrogen content. For each amino acid studied, a linear regression was fitted by NB and amino acid intake (AAI). The maintenance requirements were estimated as the AAI to maintain the NB equal to zero. The daily amino acid requirements for maintenance were estimated to be Lys 11, Met 29,  23, Trp 5, Arg 50, Val 29, His 6, Gly 54,  49, Leu 78 and Ile 21 mg/BWkg (0.75) per day. Therefore, the amino acid ratio for maintenance was concluded to be Lys 100, Met 276,  220, Trp 48, Arg 467, Val 275, His 60, Gly 511,  467, Leu 735 and Ile 198% independent of the scale.

Forty-nine cross-bred Angus heifers were bred via artificial insemination and fed a control diet (CON = 100% of requirements for growth) or a restricted diet (RES = 60% of CON) and ovariohysterectomized on days 16, 34, or 50 of gestation; nonpregnant controls were not bred and ovariohysterectomized on day 16 of the synchronized estrous cycle. The resulting design was a completely randomized design with a 2 × 3 factorial + 1 arrangement of treatments. Maternal serum, histotroph, allantoic fluid, and amniotic fluid were collected at time of ovariohysterectomy. Samples were then analyzed for concentrations of AAs and intermediary metabolites: alanine (Ala), arginine, asparagine (Asn), aspartate (Asp), citrulline, cysteine, glutamine, glutamate (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine, isoleucine, leucine (Leu), lysine, methionine (Met), ornithine, phenylalanine (), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (), tryptophan, tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val). The concentrations of Gly, Ser, and  in maternal serum were greater (P ≤ 0.05) in CON compared with RES. Furthermore, day of gestation affected (P ≤ 0.05) concentrations of Asn, Glu, , , and Tyr in maternal serum. Status of maternal nutrition affected the Asp concentration of histotroph where RES was greater (P = 0.02) than CON. In histotroph, Ala, Leu, Met, and Val concentrations were greater (P ≤ 0.05) on day 50 compared with day 16. Additionally, Glu and Pro concentrations in histotroph were greater (P < 0.01) on days 34 and 50 compared with day 16. A day × treatment interaction was observed for the concentration of Val in allantoic fluid where day 34 CON was greater (P = 0.05) than all other days and nutritional treatments. In addition, the concentration of Gln in amniotic fluid experienced a day × treatment interaction where day 34 RES was greater (P ≤ 0.05) than day 34 CON, which was greater (P ≤ 0.05) than day 50 CON and RES. These data support our hypothesis that day of gestation and maternal nutrition affect the concentrations of various neutral and acidic AA in beef heifer utero-placental fluids and maternal serum from days 16 to 50 of gestation.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies have characterized different physiological/biological aspects of this transporter, but nothing is known about the glycosylation status of the hRFVT-3 protein and role of this modification in its physiology/biology. Additionally, little is known about the residues in the hRFVT-3 protein that interact with the ligand, RF. We addressed these issues using appropriate biochemical/molecular approaches, a protein-docking model, and established intestinal/renal epithelial cells. Our results showed that the hRFVT-3 protein is glycosylated and that glycosylation is important for its function. Mutating the predicted -glycosylation sites at Asn and Asn led to a significant decrease in RF uptake; it also led to a marked intracellular (in the endoplasmic reticulum, ER) retention of the mutated proteins as shown by live-cell confocal imaging studies. The protein-docking model used in this study has identified a number of putative substrate-interacting sites: Ser, Ile, Trp, , , and Asn Mutating these potential interacting sites was indeed found to lead to a significant inhibition in RF uptake and to intracellular (ER) retention of the mutated proteins (except for the  mutant).

To date, the structural basis for CYP1A2's preference to the planar substrates remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the structure-activity relationships for pig CYP1A2 catalyzing AFB and 7-ethoxyresorufin (7-ER). A molecular docking study was performed based on a constructed model of pig CYP1A2, which predicted the contributions of -118, -124, -125, -226, Leu-260, and Asp-313 to the substrate catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses exhibited the common grounds: -125, -226 and Asp-313 were vital to AFB oxidation (including exo-epoxidation and 9A-hydroxylation) and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation. Meanwhile, -125 and -226 formed CH/π interactions with AFB/7-ER, and Asp-313 formed hydrogen bonds with them. Based on other published reports, this study further emphasizes the critical roles of -125 and -226 in recognizing the planar substrates. Our findings highlight the structural basis of pig CYP1A2 specifically catalyzing AFB and 7-ER, and may help to elucidate the underlying mechanism of CYP1A2's  preference to the planar and aromatic substrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous studies that have examined the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin embedded in a variety of model phospholipid membranes have suggested that partial unfolding of the protein is a precursor to the apoptotic response. However, these studies lacked site resolution and used model systems with negligible or a positive membrane curvature, which is distinct from the large negative curvature of the invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane where cytochrome c resides. We have used reverse micelle encapsulation to mimic the potential effects of confinement on the interaction of cytochrome c with cardiolipin. Encapsulation of oxidized horse cytochrome c in 1-decanoyl-rac-glycerol/lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide/hexanol reverse micelles prepared in pentane yields NMR spectra essentially identical to the protein in free aqueous solution. The structure of encapsulated ferricytochrome c was determined to high precision (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 0.23 Å) using NMR-based methods and is closely similar to the cryogenic crystal structure (<r.m.s. deviation>bb ∼ 1.2 Å). Incorporation of cardiolipin into the reverse micelle surfactant shell causes localized chemical shift perturbations of the encapsulated protein, providing the first view of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction interface at atomic resolution. Three distinct sites of interaction are detected: the so-called A- and L-sites, plus a previously undocumented interaction centered on residues -36, Gly-37, -58, Trp-59, and Lys-60. Importantly, in distinct contrast to earlier studies of this interaction, the protein is not significantly disturbed by the binding of cardiolipin in the context of the reverse micelle.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682906>Profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002 nutrient requirements in controlled pH batch fermentations.</a></h1><p>This study aimed to evaluate the profiles of Streptococcus thermophilus nutrient requirements to guide the design of media for high cell density culturing. The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil. The nutrient components with the largest required ratios were Arg, His, and Met; folic acid, cyanocobalamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid; Ca and Mg ; and guanine and uracil.

Met, Pro, , Ala, Gly, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin were mainly used from midexponential to late-exponential phase. The highest bioavailabilities of nutrient components were also found at diverse phase. Met, Leu, Ile, Asn, Glu, Lys, Pro, Gly, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, adenine, uracil, inosine, and Ca had the highest bioavailability from late-lag to midexponential phase.

It also has immense potential to cure autoimmune and infectious diseases. The vast application of this enzyme in healthcare sector increases its market demand. However, presently the huge market demand is not achieved completely. This serves the basis to explore better producer microbial strains to bridge the gap between huge demand and supply of this therapeutic enzyme. The present study deals with the successful screening of potent microorganisms producing l-asparaginase. 47 microorganisms were screened including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts. Among all, Penicillium lilacinum showed the highest enzyme activity i.e., 39.67 IU/ml. Shigella flexneri has 23.21 IU/ml of enzyme activity (highest among all the bacterial strain tested). Further, the 3-D structure of l-asparaginase from higher producer strains was developed and validated in silico for its activity. l-asparagine (substrate for l-asparaginase) was docked inside the binding pocket of P. lilacinum and S. flexneri. Docking score for the most common substrate l-asparagine is -6.188 (P. lilacinum), -5.576 (S. flexneri) which is quite good. Moreover, the chemical property of the binding pocket revealed that amino acid residues  243, Gln 260, Gly 365, Asp 386 in P. lilacinum and residues Asp 181,  318, Asn 320 in S. flexneri have an important role in H-bonding. The in silico results supports and strengthen the wet lab results. The outcome obtained motivates to take the present study result from lab to industry for the economic/massive production of this enzyme for the diverse therapeutic application.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although opioidergic agonists depress cortical excitatory synaptic transmission, little is known about opioidergic roles in inhibitory synaptic transmission. In the IC, the opioid receptors differentially regulate the excitatory propagation: agonists of the mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR) exhibit suppressive, facilitative, and little effects, respectively. Thus, we aimed to examine the effects of opioid receptor agonists on unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) in the IC. Pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in the rat IC were recorded by a multiple whole-cell patch-clamp technique. [D-Ala,N-Me-,Gly-ol]-Enkephalin acetate salt (DAMGO), an MOR agonist, reduced uIPSC amplitude by 74% in fast-spiking GABAergic interneuron (FS)→FS connections without a significant effect on FS→pyramidal cell (Pyr) connections. These effects of DAMGO were also observed in non-FS→FS and non-FS→Pyr connections: DAMGO reduced the uIPSC amplitude in non-FS→FS but not in non-FS→Pyr connections. DAMGO-induced depression of uIPSCs was blocked by the MOR antagonist, D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH. The DOR agonist, [D-Pen]-Enkephalin hydrate (DPDPE), reduced uIPSC amplitude by 39% in FS→FS and by 49% in FS→Pyr connections, which was antagonized by the DOR antagonist, naltrindole. However, DPDPE had little effect on non-FS→FS/Pyr connections. (±)-trans-U-50488 methanesulfonate salt (U50488), a KOR agonist, had little effect on uIPSC in FS→FS/Pyr connections. These results suggest that MOR-induced uIPSC depression in FS→FS and non-FS→FS, but not FS→Pyr and non-FS→Pyr connections, results in the depression of excitatory propagation in the IC, which may be an underlying mechanism of the powerful analgesic effects of MOR agonists.Copyright © 2016 IBRO.

PrnB, a highly specific l-proline transporter, only weakly recognizes other Put4p substrates, its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue. Taking advantage of the high sequence similarity between the two transporters, we combined molecular modeling, induced fit docking, genetic, and biochemical approaches to investigate the molecular basis of this difference and identify residues governing substrate binding and specificity. We demonstrate that l-proline is recognized by PrnB via interactions with residues within TMS1 (Gly(56), (57)), TMS3 (Glu(138)), and TMS6 ((248)), which are evolutionary conserved in YATs, whereas specificity is achieved by subtle amino acid substitutions in variable residues. Put4p-mimicking substitutions in TMS3 (S130C), TMS6 (F252L, S253G), TMS8 (W351F), and TMS10 (T414S) broadened the specificity of PrnB, enabling it to recognize more efficiently l-alanine, l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, and glycine without significantly affecting the apparent Km for l-proline. S253G and W351F could transport l-alanine, whereas T414S, despite displaying reduced proline uptake, could transport l-alanine and glycine, a phenotype suppressed by the S130C mutation. A combination of all five Put4p-ressembling substitutions resulted in a functional allele that could also transport l-alanine and glycine, displaying a specificity profile impressively similar to that of Put4p. Our results support a model where residues in these positions determine specificity by interacting with the substrates, acting as gating elements, altering the flexibility of the substrate binding core, or affecting conformational changes of the transport cycle.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633411>Apparent and standardised ileal amino acid digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles with or without exogenous protease in broilers and turkeys.</a></h1><p>The apparent (AIAAD) and standardised ileal amino acid digestibility (SIAAD) of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (wheat-DDGS) was determined for broilers and turkeys at 28 d using two experiments. A total of 84 male Ross 308 broiler chicks (Experiment 1) or 84 male BUT 10 turkey poults (Experiment 2) were offered a nutrient-adequate diet from d 1 to 23. On d 23, birds in each experiment were allocated to 4 treatments consisting of a nitrogen-free diet (NFD) (with or without protease) and an assay diet containing wheat-DDGS as the only source of amino acids (with or without protease) in a randomised complete block design. In Experiments 1 and 2, the coefficient of AIAAD or SIAAD of Lys and Asp were low irrespective of protease. In Experiment 1, the coefficient of AIAAD ranged from 0.35 (Ala) to 0.75 (Pro) without protease, whereas the range was 0.42 () to 0.82 (Pro) with protease. Protease improved the coefficient of AIAAD for Arg and Pro and tended to improve the coefficient of AIAAD for Met. Without protease, the coefficient of SIAAD ranged from 0.51 (Ala) to 0.84 (Pro), whereas the range was from 0.65 (Ala) to 0.93 (Pro) with protease. Protease improved the coefficient of SIAAD of Arg, Leu, , Met, Val and Pro. In Experiment 2, the coefficient of AIAAD was lower than 0.50 for all amino acids except for Glu (0.70) and Pro (0.81) without protease. On the other hand, the coefficient of SIAAD ranged from 0.41 () to 0.89 (Pro) without protease, whereas the range was from 0.56 (Arg) to 0.88 (Pro) with protease supplementation. With the exception of Cys and Pro, protease improved the coefficient of AIAAD and SIAAD of all other amino acids by 0.05-0.19. It was concluded that the AIAAD and SIAAD of wheat-DDGS are variable and are generally greater in broilers compared to turkeys at 28 d of age. Protease improved the ileal digestibility of a large number of amino acids in wheat-DDGS for broilers and turkeys.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29674316>Activation of renal ClC-K chloride channels depends on an intact N terminus of their accessory subunit barttin.</a></h1><p>ClC-K channels belong to the CLC family of chloride channels and chloride/proton antiporters. They contribute to sodium chloride reabsorption in Henle's loop of the kidney and to potassium secretion into the endolymph by the stria vascularis of the inner ear. Their accessory subunit barttin stabilizes the ClC-K/barttin complex, promotes its insertion into the surface membrane, and turns the pore-forming subunits into a conductive state. Barttin mutations cause Bartter syndrome type IV, a salt-wasting nephropathy with sensorineural deafness. Here, studying ClC-K/barttin channels heterologously expressed in MDCK-II and HEK293T cells with confocal imaging and patch-clamp recordings, we demonstrate that the eight-amino-acids-long barttin N terminus is required for channel trafficking and activation. Deletion of the complete N terminus (Δ2-8 barttin) retained barttin and human hClC-Ka channels in intracellular compartments. Partial N-terminal deletions did not compromise subcellular hClC-Ka trafficking but drastically reduced current amplitudes. Sequence deletions encompassing -6, -7, or Arg-8 in barttin completely failed to activate hClC-Ka. Analyses of protein expression and whole-cell current noise revealed that inactive channels reside in the plasma membrane. Substituting the deleted N terminus with a polyalanine sequence was insufficient for recovering chloride currents, and single amino acid substitutions highlighted that the correct sequence is required for proper function. Fast and slow gate activation curves obtained from rat V166E rClC-K1/barttin channels indicated that mutant barttin fails to constitutively open the slow gate. Increasing expression of barttin over that of ClC-K partially recovered this insufficiency, indicating that N-terminal modifications of barttin alter both binding affinities and gating properties.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155652>Effects of increased energy and amino acid intake in late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, , and redox status of sows1.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to determine the effects of increased AA and energy intake during late gestation on reproductive performance, milk composition, and  and redox status of sows. A total of 118 Yorkshire sows (third through sixth parity) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments from day 90 of gestation until farrowing. Dietary treatments consisted of combinations of 2 standardized ileal digestible (SID) AA levels [14.7 or 20.6 g/d SID Lys, SID Lys and other AA met or exceeded the NRC (2012) recommendations] and 2 energy levels (28.24 or 33.78 MJ/d intake of NE) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. After parturition, all sows were fed a standard lactation diet. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for parameters on , redox status, and amino acid profile. The data were analyzed using the generalized linear mixed models to reveal the impact of dietary levels of energy, AA, and their interaction. Sows with increased intake of AA had greater BW gain (P < 0.01) during late gestation. Furthermore, the BW loss during lactation was increased in sows with increasing intake of energy (P < 0.05) or AA (P < 0.05). Sows fed high energy had higher total litter birth weights (20.2 kg vs. 18.4 kg, P < 0.05) and shorter duration of farrowing (261 min vs. 215 min, P < 0.05), compared with those fed low energy, which likely was due to higher (P < 0.05) plasma glucose and lower (P < 0.05) plasma lactate prior to parturition. High AA intake in late gestation increased the ADG of piglets during the following lactation (P < 0.05), and increased the concentrations of plasma urea, and the following AA: Lys, Met, , Val, Ile, Leu, , Asp, Ser, and Arg at farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the increased intake of energy increased total litter weight of newborns and shortened the farrowing duration, which likely was due to improved energy status at farrowing. Furthermore, sows with increased intake of AA led to higher growth rate of piglets during the following lactation, accompanying with the increasing levels of plasma urea and amino acids. Therefore, the higher energy intake in late gestation appeared to improve litter weight and farrowing duration, while higher AA intake may have positive effect on piglets performance in lactation.© The Author(s) 2019.

FXII circulates as a zymogen, which when auto-activated forms factor XIIa (FXIIa). Here, the production of the recombinant FXIIa protease domain (βFXIIa) with yields of ∼1-2 mg per litre of insect-cell culture is reported. A second construct utilized an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion (MBP-βFXIIa). Crystal structures were determined of MBP-βFXIIa in complex with the inhibitor D--Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) and of βFXIIa in isolation. The βFXIIa structure revealed that the S2 and S1 pockets were occupied by  and Arg residues, respectively, from an adjacent molecule in the crystal. The -Arg sequence mimics the P2-P1 FXIIa cleavage-site residues present in the natural substrates prekallikrein and FXII, and Pro-Arg (from PPACK) mimics the factor XI cleavage site. A comparison of the βFXIIa structure with the available crystal structure of the zymogen-like FXII protease revealed large conformational changes centred around the S1 pocket and an alternate conformation for the 99-loop, Tyr99 and the S2 pocket. Further comparison with activated protease structures of factors IXa and Xa, which also have the Tyr99 residue, reveals that a more open form of the S2 pocket only occurs in the presence of a substrate mimetic. The FXIIa inhibitors EcTI and infestin-4 have Pro-Arg and -Arg P2-P1 sequences, respectively, and the interactions that these inhibitors make with βFXIIa are also described. These structural studies of βFXIIa provide insight into substrate and inhibitor recognition and establish a scaffold for the structure-guided drug design of novel antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901437>Dynamics of human protein kinase Aurora A linked to drug selectivity.</a></h1><p>Protein kinases are major drug targets, but the development of highly-selective inhibitors has been challenging due to the similarity of their active sites. The observation of distinct structural states of the fully-conserved Asp--Gly (DFG) loop has put the concept of conformational selection for the DFG-state at the center of kinase drug discovery. Recently, it was shown that Gleevec selectivity for the Tyr-kinase Abl was instead rooted in conformational changes after drug binding. Here, we investigate whether protein dynamics after binding is a more general paradigm for drug selectivity by characterizing the binding of several approved drugs to the Ser/-kinase Aurora A. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we propose a universal drug-binding mechanism, that rationalizes selectivity, affinity and long on-target residence time for kinase inhibitors. These new concepts, where protein dynamics in the drug-bound state plays the crucial role, can be applied to inhibitor design of targets outside the kinome.© 2018, Pitsawong et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428413>A deuterohemin peptide protects a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting Aβ aggregation.</a></h1><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disease and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. The main hallmark of AD is the deposition of insoluble amyloid (Aβ) outside the neuron, leading to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Deuterohemin-Ala-His--Val-Glu-Lys (DhHP-6), a novel porphyrin-peptide, has both microperoxidase activity and cell permeability. In the present study, DhHP-6 efficiently inhibited the aggregation of Aβ and reduced the β-sheet percentage of Aβ from 89.1% to 78.3%. DhHP-6 has a stronger affinity (K = 100 ± 12 μM) for binding with Aβ at , Arg, Val, Glu and Glu. In addition, DhHP-6 (100 μM) significantly prolonged lifespan, alleviated paralysis and reduced Aβ plaque formation in the Aβ transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model of AD. Our results demonstrate that DhHP-6 is a potential drug candidate that efficiently protects a transgenic C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting Aβ aggregation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The 4 processed soybean products included 2 sources of enzyme-treated soybean meal (ESBM-1 and ESBM-2), extruded soybean meal, and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Twenty-seven weanling barrows (9.29 ± 0.58 kg initial BW) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. Pigs were randomly allotted to three 9 × 5 Youden squares with 9 pigs and five 7-d periods in each square. Seven cornstarch-based diets were prepared using each of the protein sources as the sole source of CP and AA. A N-free diet was prepared to calculate basal endogenous losses of CP and AA, and this diet was fed to 2 groups of pigs, which resulted in a total of 9 dietary treatments. Results indicate that the SID of CP was greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, RSE, or FCM. The SID of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, and  were greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, and the SID of Lys was greater ( < 0.05) in SBM-CV than in ESBM-2. The SID of , Trp, Val, and total indispensable AA were not different among the soybean products, but the SID of total dispensable AA in ESBM-1 was greater ( < 0.05) than in SPC. Therefore, the SID of total AA was greater ( < 0.05) in ESBM-1 than in SPC, but no other differences were observed among soybean meal (SBM) products. The SID of most AA in RSE and the SID of all AA in FCM were less ( < 0.05) than in all the SBM products, but the SID of all AA in RSE were greater ( < 0.05) than in FCM. Results of this research indicate that although processing of SBM results in increased concentration of CP, processing may also reduce the digestibility of AA, which is likely due to heat damage during processing. There are, however, differences among processed soy products, with some products having greater SID of AA than others. Results also indicate that fermentation of a mixture of rapeseed meal, wheat, and relatively low quality coproducts does not result in SID values that are similar to those of unfermented 00-rapeseed expellers or soybean products.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28343923>First characterization of an archaeal amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3.</a></h1><p>A novel amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity (BAR) was recently isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3. Characterization of this enzyme has been difficult, however, because the recombinant enzyme is produced mainly as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli. In this study, expression of the recombinant protein into the soluble fraction was markedly improved by co-expression with chaperone molecules. The purified enzyme retained its full activity after incubation at 80°C for at least 2 h in buffer (pH 7-10), making this enzyme the most thermostable amino acid racemase so far known. Besides the nine amino acids containing hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids previously reported (Kawakami et al., Amino Acids, 47, 1579-1587, 2015), the enzyme exhibited substantial activity toward  (about 42% of relative activity toward ) and showed no activity toward Arg, His, Gln, and Asn. The substrate specificity of this enzyme thus differs markedly from those of other known amino acid racemases. In particular, the high reaction rate with Trp and Tyr, in addition to Leu, Met and  as substrates is a noteworthy feature of this enzyme. The high reactivity toward Trp and Tyr, as well as extremely high thermostability, is likely a major advantage of using BAR for biochemical conversion of these aromatic amino acids.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Eight mid-lactation Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 5-day continuous jugular infusions of saline (CTL), EAA mixture prepared on the profile of casein and supplied (in % of lysine (Lys)) 100% of Lys, 33.3% of methionine (Met), 110.2% of Leu, 43.6% of Arg, 50.8% of threonine (), 81.6% of valine (Val), 69.7% of isoleucine (Ile), 61.4% of phenylalanine () and 34.2% of histidine (His) (Casein, 160 g/d), EAA mixture excluding Leu (-Leu, 163 g/d) or EAA mixture excluding Arg (-Arg, 158 g/d) in a duplicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four infusion periods separated by 7-day interval period. The basal diet supplied 1.6 Mcal NE and 94.4 g MP per 1 kg DM to meet requirements for lactation. The Casein treatment provided a balanced supply (in % of MP) of 10.3% Leu and 5.3% Arg, whereas in the two subsequent -Leu and -Arg treatments, the concentration of Leu and Arg was reduced to 8.4 and 4.6% respectively. Dry matter intake (15.4 kg/day) was not affected by treatments. The Casein treatment increased milk yield (14.9%, p < 0.001), milk protein yield (120 g, p < 0.001) and milk protein efficiency (0.03, p = 0.099) than CTL treatment. However, the -Leu treatment decreased the responses of above-measured parameters by 6.25%, 70 g, 0.05 (p < 0.06) (compared with Casein). These effects of Leu were related to decreased Leu concentration and improved concentration of Ile and Val in plasma. The -Arg treatment decreased the plasma Arg concentration than the Casein treatment, whereby resulted in the decrease of milk yield (5.7%, p = 0.073), milk protein yield (60 g, p = 0.011) and milk protein efficiency (0.04, p = 0.037). In conclusion, supply of EAA profile of casein can increase the lactation production in dairy cows, and 8.6% of Leu in MP partly limits the milk protein response when the requirements of Lys, Met and His were met. The level of Arg at 4.6% MP is not deemed to an ideal profile, as evidenced by decreased milk protein efficiency.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380606>Amino acid digestibility in soybean meal sourced from different regions of the United States and fed to pigs.</a></h1><p>An experiment was conducted to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) by growing pigs of AA in soybean meal (SBM) produced in different regions of the United States. Twenty-two growing barrows (25.5 ± 1.73 kg) were fitted with a T-cannula near the distal ileum and allotted to a 22 × 8 Youden square design. Twenty-two sources of SBM were procured from soybean crushing plants located throughout the United States. For analysis, the crushing plant locations were separated into the following 3 zones: 1) Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota ( = 4); 2) Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio ( = 11); and 3) Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska ( = 7). Dietary treatments included 22 diets based on a mixture of cornstarch, sucrose, and each source of SBM as the sole source of CP. Results indicated that the concentration of most indispensable and dispensable AA in SBM were not different among zones. However, SBM from zone 2 had a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of  than SBM from zone 3 and a greater ( < 0.05) concentration of Gly than SBM from zone 1. The concentration of Tyr in SBM from zone 2 was also greater ( < 0.05) than in SBM from zones 1 and 3. However, if concentrations of AA were calculated as a percent of CP, there were no differences in the concentrations of indispensable and dispensable AA among SBM from the 3 zones. Likewise, the AID of CP and the AID of indispensable and dispensable AA were not different among SBM from the 3 zones. The SID of CP and most AA was also not different among SBM from the 3 zones. However, SBM from zone 3 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of His, Asp, and Cys than SBM from zone 2, and SBM from zone 1 had a greater ( < 0.05) SID of Lys than SBM from zone 2. There was also a tendency ( < 0.10) for SBM from zone 3 to have a greater SID of Ile, Leu, , Val, Ala, and Tyr than SBM from zone 2. If the concentrations of SID CP and AA were calculated as grams per kilogram, SBM among the 3 zones were not different with the exception that there was a tendency ( = 0.07) for SBM from zone 2 to contain more SID  and SID Tyr than SBM from zone 3. In conclusion, only a few differences in concentrations and digestibility of CP and AA exist among sources of SBM from different zones in the United States. These observations indicate that the protein value is not different among SBM produced in the United States regardless of the location of the crushing plants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317643>Multiple mutations and overexpression of the MdaE7 carboxylesterase gene associated with male-linked malathion resistance in housefly, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).</a></h1><p>Two unique housefly strains, MSS and N-MRS, were selected and used to clarify mechanisms of sex-associated malathion resistance in the housefly, Musca domestica. Compared with the lab-susceptible CSS strain, susceptible females and resistant males were observed in the malathion-susceptible MSS strain, while the malathion-resistant near-isogenic line, N-MRS, achieved similar resistance level between genders. Significant synergistic effect of the esterase-inhibitor DEF on resistant houseflies pointed to the important involvement of esterase in this specific malathion resistance. Examination of the carboxylesterase gene MdαE7 in malathion resistant housefly populations found seven, non-synonymous SNP mutations (Ser-, Trp-Ser, Met-Ile, Leu-, Ser-Leu, Trp-Arg and Ser-), not found in susceptible houseflies, revealing a strong correlation between these mutations and the development of malathion resistance. Further genetic analysis conducted with bioassays by topical application and nucleotide polymorphism detection provided a first line of molecular evidence for a linkage between a male-determining factor and MdαE7 gene in the MSS and N-MRS males. This linkage results in a much higher level of malathion resistance for males than females in the MSS strain. Lastly, quantitative real-time PCR showed that MdαE7 was over expressed in the resistant strain due to the increased transcription level of mRNA rather than gene duplication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26446788>Biochemical Characterization and Substrate Specificity of Autophagin-2 from the Parasite Trypanosoma cruzi.</a></h1><p>The genome of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi encodes two copies of autophagy-related cysteine proteases, Atg4.1 and Atg4.2. T. cruzi autophagin-2 (TcAtg4.2) carries the majority of proteolytic activity and is responsible for processing Atg8 proteins near the carboxyl terminus, exposing a conserved glycine. This enables progression of autophagy and differentiation of the parasite, which is required for successful colonization of humans. The mechanism of substrate hydrolysis by Atg4 was found to be highly conserved among the species as critical mutations in the TcAtg4.2, including mutation of the conserved Gly-244 residue in the hinge region enabling flexibility of the regulatory loop, and deletion of the regulatory loop, completely abolished processing capacity of the mutants. Using the positional scanning-substrate combinatorial library (PS-SCL) we determined that TcAtg4.2 tolerates a broad spectrum of amino acids in the P4 and P3 positions, similar to the human orthologue autophagin-1 (HsAtg4B). In contrast, both human and trypanosome Atg4 orthologues exhibited exclusive preference for aromatic amino acid residues in the P2 position, and for Gly in the P1 position, which is absolutely conserved in the natural Atg8 substrates. Using an extended P2 substrate library, which also included the unnatural amino acid cyclohexylalanine (Cha) derivative of , we generated highly selective tetrapeptide substrates acetyl-Lys-Lys-Cha-Gly-AFC (Ac-KKChaG-AFC) and acetyl-Lys--Cha-Gly-AFC (Ac-KTChaG-AFC). Althoughthese substrates were cleaved by cathepsins, making them unsuitable for analysis of complex cellular systems, they were recognized exclusively by TcAtg4.2, but not by HsAtg4B nor by the structurally related human proteases SENP1, SENP2, and UCH-L3.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26210756>Low-protein diets affect ileal amino acid digestibility and gene expression of digestive enzymes in growing and finishing pigs.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of dietary crude protein (CP) intake on ileal amino acid digestibilities and expression of genes for digestive enzymes in growing and finishing pigs.

In both experiments, diets with low and very low CP were supplemented with crystalline amino acids to achieve equal content of standardized ileal digestible Lys, Met, , and Trp, and were provided to pigs ad libitum. Daily feed intake, BW, and feed/gain ratios were determined. At the end of each experiment, all pigs were slaughtered to collect pancreas, small-intestine samples, and terminal ileal chymes. Samples were used for determining expression of genes for digestive enzymes and ileal amino acid digestibilities. Growing pigs fed the 12 % CP and 15 % CP diets had lower final body weight (P < 0.01) and ADG (P < 0.0001) when compared with pigs fed the 18 % dietary CP diet. Growing pigs fed with the 12 % CP diet showed higher digestibilities for CP (P < 0.05), DM (P < 0.05), Lys (P < 0.0001), Met (P < 0.01), Cys (P < 0.01),  (P < 0.01), Trp (P < 0.05), Val (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05), Ala (P < 0.05), Cys (P < 0.01), and Gly (P < 0.05) than those fed the 18 % CP diet. Finishing pigs fed the 16 % CP diet had a higher (P < 0.01) final body weight than those fed the 10 % CP diet. mRNA levels for digestive enzymes (trypsinogen, chymotrypsin B, and dipeptidases-II and III) differed among the three groups of pigs (P < 0.05), and no difference was noted in the genes expression between control group and lower CP group. These results indicated that a reduction of dietary CP by a six-percentage value limited the growth performance of growing-finishing pigs and that a low-protein diet supplemented with deficient amino acids could reduce the excretion of nitrogen into the environment without affecting weight gain.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26360925>The detection of a synthetic Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist peptide in a seized product from a racing stable.</a></h1><p>A synthetic Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist peptide with the sequence Acetyl--Glu-Trp--Pro-Gly-Tyr-Trp-Gln-Pro-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Pro-Leu-OH has been identified in a vial seized during a stable inspection. The use of peptide-based Interleukin-1 receptor antagonists as anti-inflammatory agents has not been previously reported, making this peptide the first in a new class of sports doping peptides. The peptide has been characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry and a detection method developed based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Using in vitro and in vivo models to study the properties of the peptide after administration, the peptide was shown to be highly unstable in plasma and was not detected in urine after administration in a rat. The poor stability of the peptide makes detection challenging but also suggests that it has limited effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory drug.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363343>Peptide Probes Reveal a Hydrophobic Steric Ratchet in the Anthrax Toxin Protective Antigen Translocase.</a></h1><p>Anthrax toxin is a tripartite virulence factor produced by Bacillus anthracis during infection. Under acidic endosomal pH conditions, the toxin's protective antigen (PA) component forms a transmembrane channel in host cells. The PA channel then translocates its two enzyme components, lethal factor and edema factor, into the host cytosol under the proton motive force. Protein translocation under a proton motive force is catalyzed by a series of nonspecific polypeptide binding sites, called clamps. A 10-residue guest/host peptide model system, KKKKKXXSXX, was used to functionally probe polypeptide-clamp interactions within wild-type PA channels. The guest residues were , Ala, Leu, , Tyr, and Trp. In steady-state translocation experiments, the channel blocked most tightly with peptides that had increasing amounts of nonpolar surface area. Cooperative peptide binding was observed in the Trp-containing peptide sequence but not the other tested sequences. Trp substitutions into a flexible, uncharged linker between the lethal factor amino-terminal domain and diphtheria toxin A chain expedited translocation. Therefore, peptide-clamp sites in translocase channels can sense large steric features (like tryptophan) in peptides, and while these steric interactions may make a peptide translocate poorly, in the context of folded domains, they can make the protein translocate more rapidly presumably via a hydrophobic steric ratchet mechanism.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Gemcitabine is the first choice for treatment of pancreatic malignancy, but increasing resistance to this drug is decreasing its overall efficacy. Studies on new therapies that target  , growth factor inhibitors, and tumor stroma or tumor stem cells are currently underway in many research groups. Herein we report the bioactive properties (cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity) of synthetic peptidomimetics containing an opioid tripeptide fragment (Tyr-R -R -; where R is d-Ala or d-, and R is  or Trp) hybridized with trans-1-cinnamylpiperazine.

Trypsin and chymotrypsin activities, AA serum concentrations and expression of AA transporters in the small intestine of pigs fed a low protein, AA-supplemented (19.2%, LPAA) or a high protein (28.1%, HP), wheat-soybean meal diet were measured in two 14-d trials. The LPAA diet contained free L-Lys, L-, DL-Met, L-Leu, L-Ile, L-Val, L-His, L-Trp and L-. All pigs were fed the same amount of feed (890 and 800 g/d for trial 1 and 2 respectively). In trial 1, samples of mucosa (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and digesta (duodenum and jejunum) were collected from 14 pigs (17.2 ± 0.4 kg); in trial 2, blood samples were collected from 12 pigs (12.7 ± 0.3 kg). The trypsin and chymotrypsin activities in both intestinal segments were higher in pigs fed the HP diet (p < 0.01). Trypsin activity was higher in jejunum than in duodenum regardless the dietary treatment (p < 0.05). Pigs fed the LPAA diet expressed more b AT in duodenum, B AT1 in ileum (p < 0.05), and tended to express more y LAT1 in duodenum (p = 0.10). In pigs fed the LPAA diet, the expression of b AT was higher in duodenum than in jejunum and ileum (p < 0.01), but no difference was observed in pigs fed the HP diet. Ileum had the lowest b AT expression regardless the diet. The serum concentrations of Lys,  and Met were higher in LPAA pigs while serum Arg was higher in HP pigs (p < 0.05). Serum concentrations of AA appear to reflect the AA absorption. In conclusion, these data indicate that the dietary protein contents affect the extent of protein digestion and that supplemental free AA may influence the intestinal site of AA release and absorption, which may impact their availability for growth of young pigs.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26463125>Amino Acid Carbamates As Prodrugs Of Resveratrol.</a></h1><p>Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a plant polyphenol, has important drug-like properties, but its pharmacological exploitation in vivo is hindered by its rapid transformation via phase II conjugative . One approach to bypass this problem relies on prodrugs. We report here the synthesis, characterization, stability and in vivo pharmacokinetic behaviour of prodrugs of resveratrol in which the OH groups are engaged in an N-monosubstituted carbamate ester (-OC(O)NHR) linkage with a natural amino acid (Leu, Ile, , ) to prevent conjugation and modulate the physicochemical properties of the molecule. We also report a convenient, high-yield protocol to obtain derivatives of this type. The new carbamate ester derivatives are stable at pH 1, while they undergo slow hydrolysis at physiological pH and hydrolyse with kinetics suitable for use in prodrugs in whole blood. After administration to rats by oral gavage the isoleucine-containing prodrug was significantly absorbed, and was present in the bloodstream as non-metabolized unaltered or partially deprotected species, demonstrating effective shielding from first-pass . We conclude that prodrugs based on the N-monosubstituted carbamate ester bond have the appropriate stability profile for the systemic delivery of phenolic compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931241>In Cold Blood: Compositional Bias and Positive Selection Drive the High Evolutionary Rate of Vampire Bats Mitochondrial Genomes.</a></h1><p>Mitochondrial genomes of animals have long been considered to evolve under the action of purifying selection. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that they can also undergo episodes of positive selection in response to shifts in physiological or environmental demands. Vampire bats experienced such a shift, as they are the only mammals feeding exclusively on blood and possessing anatomical adaptations to deal with the associated physiological requirements (e.g., ingestion of high amounts of liquid water and iron). We sequenced eight new chiropteran mitogenomes including two species of vampire bats, five representatives of other lineages of phyllostomids and one close outgroup. Conducting detailed comparative mitogenomic analyses, we found evidence for accelerated evolutionary rates at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in vampires. Moreover, the mitogenomes of vampire bats are characterized by an increased cytosine (C) content mirrored by a decrease in thymine (T) compared with other chiropterans. Proteins encoded by the vampire bat mitogenomes also exhibit a significant increase in threonine () and slight reductions in frequency of the hydrophobic residues isoleucine (Ile), valine (Val), methionine (Met), and phenylalanine (). We show that these peculiar substitution patterns can be explained by the co-occurrence of both neutral (mutational bias) and adaptive (positive selection) processes. We propose that vampire bat mitogenomes may have been impacted by selection on mitochondrial proteins to accommodate the  and nutritional qualities of blood meals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h1><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser--Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, Lys-Arg-Arg-Gln--Ser-Met--Asp--Tyr-His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and Lys--Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser----Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively. The corresponding values obtained using fluorescence spectroscopic methods were 0.22±0.06μM, 0.68±0.07μM, 0.44±0.07μM and 0.75±0.05μM respectively.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A helix N-capping motif within this region has been postulated to directly contribute to agonist activity while also stabilizing formation of a helix extending toward the peptide carboxyl terminus and docking within the receptor amino terminus. We used cysteine trapping to systematically explore spatial approximations between cysteines replacing each residue in this motif of secretin (sec), (6), (7), and Leu(10), and cysteines incorporated into the extracellular face of the receptor. Each peptide was a full agonist for cAMP, but had a lower binding affinity than natural hormone. These bound to COS cells expressing 61 receptor constructs incorporating cysteines in every position along each extracellular loop (ECL) and adjacent parts of transmembrane (TM) segments. Patterns of covalent labeling were distinct for each probe, with Cys(6)-sec labeling multiple residues in the carboxyl-terminal half of ECL2 and throughout ECL3, Cys(7)-sec predominantly labeling only single residues in the carboxyl-terminal end of ECL2 and the amino-terminal end of ECL3, and Cys(10)-sec not efficiently labeling any of these residues. These spatial constraints were used to refine our model of secretin bound to its receptor, now bringing ECL3 above the amino terminus of the ligand and revealing possible charge-charge interactions between this part of secretin and receptor residues in TM5, TM6, ECL2, and ECL3, which can orient and stabilize the peptide-receptor complex. This was validated by testing predicted approximations by mutagenesis and residue-residue complementation studies.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27027724>The novel nonapeptide acein targets angiotensin converting enzyme in the brain and induces dopamine release.</a></h1><p>Using an in-house bioinformatics programme, we identified and synthesized a novel nonapeptide, H-Pro-Pro----Lys--Ala-Ala-OH. Here, we have studied its biological activity, in vitro and in vivo, and have identified its target in the brain.The affinity of the peptide was characterized using purified whole brain and striatal membranes from guinea pigs and rats . Its effect on behaviour in rats following intra-striatal injection of the peptide was investigated. A photoaffinity UV cross-linking approach combined with subsequent affinity purification of the ligand covalently bound to its receptor allowed identification of its target.The peptide bound with high affinity to a single class of binding sites, specifically localized in the striatum and substantia nigra of brains from guinea pigs and rats. When injected within the striatum of rats, the peptide stimulated in vitro and in vivo dopamine release and induced dopamine-like motor effects. We purified the target of the peptide, a ~151 kDa protein that was identified by MS/MS as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE I). Therefore, we decided to name the peptide acein.The synthetic nonapeptide acein interacted with high affinity with brain membrane-bound ACE. This interaction occurs at a different site from the active site involved in the well-known peptidase activity, without modifying the peptidase activity. Acein, in vitro and in vivo, significantly increased stimulated release of dopamine from the brain. These results suggest a more important role for brain ACE than initially suspected.© 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30260636>Crystal Structures of Wild-Type and F448A Mutant Citrobacter freundii Tyrosine Phenol-Lyase Complexed with a Substrate and Inhibitors: Implications for the Reaction Mechanism.</a></h1><p>Tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL; EC 4.1.99.2) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydrolytic cleavage of l-tyrosine to phenol and ammonium pyruvate. We have shown previously that F448A TPL has k and k/ K values for l-tyrosine reduced by ∼10-fold [Phillips, R. S., Vita, A., Spivey, J. B., Rudloff, A. P., Driscoll, M. D., and Hay, S. (2016) ACS Catal. 6, 6770-6779]. We have now obtained crystal structures of F448A TPL and complexes with l-alanine, l-methionine, l-phenylalanine, and 3-F-l-tyrosine at 2.05-2.27 Å and the complex of wild-type TPL with l-phenylalanine at 1.8 Å. The small domain of F448A TPL, where -448 is located, is more disordered in chain A than in wild-type TPL. The complexes of F448A TPL with l-alanine and l-phenylalanine are in an open conformation in both chains, while the complex with l-methionine is a 52:48 open:closed equilibrium mixture in chain A. Wild-type TPL with l-alanine is closed in chain A and open in chain B, and the complex with l-phenylalanine is a 56:44 open:closed mixture in chain A. Thus, the -448 to alanine mutation affects the conformational equilibrium of open and closed active sites. The structure of the 3-F-l-tyrosine quinonoid complex of F448A TPL is unstrained and in an open conformation, with a hydrogen bond from the phenolic OH to -124. These results support our previous conclusion that ground-state strain plays a critical role in the mechanism of TPL.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248224>Varying the ratio of Lys:Met while maintaining the ratios of :, Lys:, Lys:His, and Lys:Val alters mammary cellular metabolites, mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, and gene transcription.</a></h1><p>Amino acids are not only precursors for but also signaling molecules regulating protein synthesis. Regulation of protein synthesis via AA occurs at least in part by alterations in the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway proteins. Although the ideal profile of Lys:Met to promote milk protein synthesis during established lactation in dairy cows has been proposed to be 3:1, aside from being the most-limiting AA for milk protein synthesis, the role of Met in other key biologic  such as methylation is not well characterized in the bovine. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of increasing supplemental Met, based on the ideal 3:1 ratio of Lys to Met, on intracellular  related to protein synthesis and mTOR pathway phosphorylation status. MAC-T cells, an immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line, were incubated (n = 5 replicates/treatment) for 12 h with 3 incremental doses of Met while holding Lys concentration constant to achieve the following: Lys:Met 2.9:1 (ideal AA ratio; IPAA), Lys:Met 2.5:1 (LM2.5), and Lys:Met 2.0:1 (LM2.0). The ratios of : (1.05:1), Lys: (1.8:1), Lys:His (2.38:1), and Lys:Val (1.23:1) were the same across the 3 treatments. Applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics revealed distinct clusters of differentially concentrated metabolites in response to Lys:Met. Lower , branched-chain AA, and putrescine concentrations were observed with LM2.5 compared with IPAA. Apart from greater intracellular Met concentrations, further elevations in Met level (LM2.0) led to greater intracellular concentrations of nonessential AA (Pro, Glu, Gln, and Gly) compared with IPAA and greater essential AA (EAA; Met, Ile, and Leu) and nonessential AA (Pro, Gly, Ala, Gln, and Glu) compared with LM2.5. However, compared with IPAA, mRNA expression of β-casein and AA transporters (SLC7A5, SLC36A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A9, and SLC43A1) and mTOR phosphorylation were lower in response to LM2.5 and LM2.0. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence that increasing Met while Lys and the ratios of , , His, and Val relative to Lys were held constant could increase the concentration and utilization of intracellular EAA, in particular branched-chain AA, potentially through improving the activity of AA transporters partly controlled by mTOR signaling. Because EAA likely are metabolized by other tissues upon absorption, a question for future in vivo studies is whether formulating diets for optimal ratios of EAA in the metabolizable protein is sufficient to provide the desired levels of these AA to the mammary cells.The Authors.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less Lys and  than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free Lys--Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, Lys, , , Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, , and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and Tyr were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is evidence that MOR and DOR interact, however the extent to which these interactions occur in vivo and affect synaptic function is unknown. There are two stable DOR subtypes: DPDPE sensitive (DOR1) and deltorphin II sensitive (DOR2); both agonists are blocked by DOR selective antagonists. Robust motivational effects are produced by local actions of both MOR and DOR ligands in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here we demonstrate that a majority of both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons express combinations of functional DOR1, DOR2, and/or MOR, and that within a single VTA neuron, DOR1, DOR2, and MOR agonists can differentially couple to downstream signaling . As reported for the MOR agonist DAMGO, DPDPE and deltorphin II produced either a predominant K dependent hyperpolarization or a Ca2.1 mediated depolarization in different neurons. In some neurons DPDPE and deltorphin II produced opposite responses. Excitation, inhibition, or no effect by DAMGO did not predict the response to DPDPE or deltorphin II, arguing against a MOR-DOR interaction generating DOR subtypes. However, in a subset of VTA neurons the DOR antagonist TIPP-Ψ augmented DAMGO responses; we also observed DPDPE or deltorphin II responses augmented by the MOR selective antagonist CTAP. These findings directly support the existence of two independent, stable forms of the DOR, and show that MOR and DOR can interact in some neurons to alter downstream signaling.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is known that the parasite's production of amino acids from hemoglobin far exceeds its  needs. Here, we show that P. falciparum effluxes large quantities of certain non-polar (Ala, Leu, Val, Pro, , Gly) and polar (Ser, , His) amino acids to the external medium. That these amino acids originate from hemoglobin catabolism is indicated by the strong correlation between individual amino acid efflux rates and their abundances in hemoglobin, and the ability of the food vacuole falcipain inhibitor E-64d to greatly suppress efflux rates. We then developed a rapid, sensitive and precise method for quantifying flux through the hemoglobin endocytic-catabolic pathway that is based on leucine efflux. Optimization of the method involved the generation of a novel amino acid-restricted RPMI formulation as well as the validation of D-norvaline as an internal standard. The utility of this method was demonstrated by characterizing the effects of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and dihydroartemisinin on the kinetics of Leu efflux. Both compounds rapidly inhibited Leu efflux, which is consistent with a role for phosphtidylinositol-3-phosphate production in the delivery of hemoglobin to the food vacuole; however, wortmannin inhibition was transient, which was likely due to the instability of this compound in culture medium. The simplicity, convenience and non-invasive nature of the Leu efflux assay described here makes it ideal for characterizing the in vivo kinetics of hemoglobin endocytosis and catabolism, for inhibitor target validation studies, and for medium-throughput screens to identify novel inhibitors of cytostomal endocytosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They have been identified as candidate targets for next-generation insecticides, yet these targets have been relatively poorly exploited for insect control. In this study, we present a pipeline of novel  allatotropin (Manse-AT) antagonist discovery with homology modeling, docking, molecular dynamics simulation and structure-activity relationship. A series of truncated and alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT were assayed for the stimulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The minimum sequence required to retain potent biological activity is the -terminal amidated octapeptide Manse-AT (6-13). We identified three residues essential for bioactivity (⁴, Arg6 and ⁸) by assaying alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT (6-13). Alanine replacement of other residues resulted in reduced potency but bioactivity was retained. The 3D structure of the receptor (Manse-ATR) was built and the binding pocket was identified. The binding affinities of all the analogs were estimated by calculating the free energy of binding. The calculated binding affinities corresponded to the biological activities of the analogs, which supporting our localization of the binding pocket. Then, based on the docking and molecular dynamics studies of Manse-AT (10-13), we described it can act as a potent Manse-AT antagonist. The antagonistic effect on JH biosynthesis of Manse-AT (10-13) validated our hypothesis. The IC value of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) is 0.9 nM. The structure-activity relationship of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) was also studied for the further purpose of investigating theoretically the structure factors influencing activity. These data will be useful for the design of new Manse-AT agonist and antagonist as potential pest control agents.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718430>Post-ruminal branched-chain amino acid supplementation and intravenous lipopolysaccharide infusion alter blood metabolites, rumen fermentation, and nitrogen balance of beef steers.</a></h1><p>Steers exposed to an endotoxin may require additional branched-chain AA (BCAA) to support an increase in synthesis of immune proteins.

Blood, rumen fluid, and rectal temperature were collected on day 15 at h 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 after LPS infusion. Feces and urine were collected from day 16 to 20. Rectal temperatures were greater for +LPS vs. -LPS steers at 4 h and lower at 8 h after LPS infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.01). Serum cortisol and plasma urea N were greater for +LPS than -LPS steers at 2 (cortisol only), 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after LPS infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.01). Serum cortisol was greater for +BCAA than -BCAA steers at 12 h after LPS infusion (BCAA × h, P < 0.05). Serum glucose was greater for +LPS than -LPS steers at 2 h after LPS infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.01). Plasma Ile, Leu, and Val were lower, and plasma His was greater in +LPS than -LPS steers (LPS, P < 0.05). Plasma Lys, Met, , and Trp of +LPS steers were lower than -LPS steers at 4 ( only), 8 (Lys and Trp only), 12, and 24 h after infusion (LPS × h, P < 0.05). Plasma Ile, Leu, and Val were greater (BCAA, P < 0.01), and Met, His, , , and Trp were lower for +BCAA than -BCAA steers at 0 and 24 h after LPS infusion (BCAA × h, P ≤ 0.05). Steers receiving +LPS had lower rumen pH at 8 h, greater total VFA at 8 h, and lower rumen NH3 at 24 h after LPS infusion compared with -LPS steers (LPS × h, P ≤ 0.04). Total tract passage rates, DM, OM, NDF, ADF, and N intake, fecal N, digested N, and retained N were lower (P < 0.05) for +LPS than -LPS steers. Total N supply (dietary plus infused) and fecal N were greater (P < 0.05) for +BCAA vs. -BCAA steers. The absence of LPS × BCAA interactions (P ≥ 0.20) for N balance indicated that post-ruminal supplementation of BCAA did not alleviate the negative effects of endotoxin on N utilization by growing steers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25713061>Key residues in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β2 subunit contribute to α-conotoxin LvIA binding.</a></h1><p>α-Conotoxin LvIA (α-CTx LvIA) is a small peptide from the venom of the carnivorous marine gastropod Conus lividus and is the most selective inhibitor of α3β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) known to date. It can distinguish the α3β2 nAChR subtype from the α6β2* (* indicates the other subunit) and α3β4 nAChR subtypes. In this study, we performed mutational studies to assess the influence of residues of the β2 subunit versus those of the β4 subunit on the binding of α-CTx LvIA. Although two β2 mutations, α3β2[F119Q] and α3β2[T59K], strongly enhanced the affinity of LvIA, the β2 mutation α3β2[V111I] substantially reduced the binding of LvIA. Increased activity of LvIA was also observed when the β2-T59L mutant was combined with the α3 subunit. There were no significant difference in inhibition of α3β2[T59I], α3β2[Q34A], and α3β2[K79A] nAChRs when compared with wild-type α3β2 nAChR. α-CTx LvIA displayed slower off-rate kinetics at α3β2[F119Q] and α3β2[T59K] than at the wild-type receptor, with the latter mutant having the most pronounced effect. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the β2 subunit contributes to α-CTx LvIA binding and selectivity. The results demonstrate that Val(111) is critical and facilitates LvIA binding; this position has not previously been identified as important to binding of other 4/7 framework α-conotoxins. (59) and (119) of the β2 subunit appear to interfere with LvIA binding, and their replacement by the corresponding residues of the β4 subunit leads to increased affinity.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25679092>Optimization and validation of a chiral GC-MS method for the determination of free D-amino acids ratio in human urine: application to a gestational diabetes mellitus study.</a></h1><p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of obesity and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L-Val N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-Lys. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, , Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, , Tyr, Orn and Lys. Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D- and higher values were found in the GDM group. It is possible that D- could be involved in /signaling  to compensate early stages of insulin resistance, although further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We here found that the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3 requires , Leu, Val, , Tyr, Trp, His and Arg in the medium for growth, and shows slow growth in medium lacking Met or Ile. This largely corresponds to the presence, or absence, of genes related to amino acid biosynthesis in its genome, though there are exceptions. The amino acid requirements were dramatically lost by addition of D-isomers of Met, Leu, Val, allo-Ile, , Tyr, Trp and Arg. Tracer analysis using (14)C-labeled D-Trp showed that D-Trp in the medium was used as a protein component in the cells, suggesting the presence of D-amino acid  enzymes. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent racemase activity toward Met, Leu and  was detected in crude extract of P. horikoshii and was enhanced in cells grown in the medium supplemented with D-amino acids, especially D-allo-Ile. The gene encoding the racemase was narrowed down to one open reading frame on the basis of enzyme purification from P. horikoshii cells, and the recombinant enzyme exhibited PLP-dependent racemase activity toward several amino acids, including Met, Leu and , but not Pro, Asp or Glu. This is the first report showing the presence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon of a PLP-dependent amino acid racemase with broad substrate specificity that is likely responsible for utilization of D-amino acids for growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28380619>Effects of ileal digesta collection time on standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and distiller's dried grains with solubles fed to growing pigs.</a></h1><p>The objective of this experiment was to determine the minimum collection time needed to obtain representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets. Eight barrows with an initial BW of 34.6 kg (SD 2.1) were individually fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and randomly allotted to a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 diets and 4 periods per square. Three diets contained corn, soybean meal (SBM), or distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) as the sole source of CP. An N-free diet was also prepared. All diets contained 0.5% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. Equal meals were provided at 0800 and 2000 h. Ileal digesta samples were collected in 2-h intervals from 0800 to 2000 h during the last 3 d of each 7-d period. When pigs were fed the corn diet, the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of most indispensable AA and dispensable AA increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during each of the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal digesta samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h or from 1600 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the SBM diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, , Trp, Val, Ala, and Cys increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) but the SID of all other AA linearly decreased ( < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of almost all AA were greater ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 0800 to 1000 h, from 0800 to 1200 h, from 1000 to 1400 h, or from 0800 to 1400 h but less ( < 0.05) if collected from 1600 to 1800 h, from 1800 to 2000 h, from 1600 to 2000 h, or from 1400 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. When pigs were fed the DDGS-based diet, the SID of Ile, Leu, Lys, , Trp, Val, and Tyr increased and then decreased (quadratic, < 0.05) during the six 2-h periods. The SID of most AA were less ( < 0.05) if the ileal samples were collected from 1800 to 2000 h compared with the SID values from the ileal samples collected over the entire 12-h period. In conclusion, diurnal variations in SID of AA in pigs indicate that 6 h of ileal sample collection starting 4 or 6 h after feeding may provide representative samples of ileal digesta from pigs fed different types of diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261341>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonism and antagonism within the amygdaloid central nucleus suppresses pain affect: differential contribution of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray.</a></h1><p>The amygdala contributes to the generation of pain affect, and the amygdaloid central nucleus (CeA) receives nociceptive input that is mediated by glutamatergic neurotransmission. The present study compared the contribution of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonism and antagonism in the CeA to generation of the affective response of rats to an acute noxious stimulus. Vocalizations that occur following a brief tail shock (vocalization afterdischarges) are a validated rodent model of pain affect and were preferentially suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, by bilateral injection into the CeA of NMDA (.1, .25, .5, or 1 μg/side) or the NMDA receptor antagonist d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP5; 1, 2, or 4 μg/side). Vocalizations that occur during tail shock were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas spinal motor reflexes (tail flick and hind limb movements) were unaffected by injection of NMDA or AP5 into the CeA. Injection of NMDA, but not AP5, into the CeA increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, and unilateral injection of the μ-opiate receptor antagonist H-d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2 (CTAP; .25 μg) into ventrolateral periaqueductal gray prevented the antinociception generated by injection of NMDA into the CeA. These findings demonstrate that although NMDA receptor agonism and antagonism in the CeA produce similar suppression of pain behaviors, they do so via different neurobiologic mechanisms.The amygdala contributes to production of the emotional dimension of pain. NMDA receptor agonism and antagonism within the CeA suppressed rats' emotional response to acute painful stimulation. Understanding the neurobiology underlying emotional responses to pain will provide insights into new treatments for pain and its associated affective disorders.Copyright © 2014 American Pain Society.

In the present study, the anticancer effect of PAP on H1299 cell proliferation was investigated. Our results showed that PAP promoted apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of H1299 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. When the PAP concentration reached 0.92 mM, more than 95% of treated cells died after 72 h of treatment. Changes in cell morphology were further analyzed using an inverted microscope and AO/EB staining and flow cytometry was adopted for detecting apoptosis and cell cycle phase. The results showed that the early and late apoptosis rates of H1299 cells increased significantly after treatment with PAP and the total apoptosis rate was significantly higher than that of the control group. Moreover, after treatment with PAP, the number of cells in the S phase of cells was significantly reduced and the ability for the cells to proliferate was also reduced. H1299 cells were arrested in the G2/M phase and cell cycle progression was inhibited. Furthermore, the results of western blotting showed that nm23-H1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner, while the pro-apoptotic protein and anti-apoptotic protein ratios and the level of apoptosis-related caspase protein increased in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results indicated that PAP, as a natural marine bioactive substance, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of human lung cancer H1299 cells. PAP is likely to be exploited as the functional food or adjuvant that may be used for prevention or treatment of human non-small cell lung cancer in the future.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27188525>Structure-function characterization of the human mitochondrial thiamin pyrophosphate transporter (hMTPPT; SLC25A19): Important roles for Ile(33), Ser(34), Asp(37), His(137) and Lys(291).</a></h1><p>Thiamin plays a critical role in cellular energy . Mammalian cells obtain the vitamin from their surroundings, converted it to thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) in the cytoplasm, followed by uptake of TPP by mitochondria via a carrier-mediated process that involves the MTPPT (product of the SLC25A19 gene). Previous studies have characterized different physiological/biological aspects of the human MTPPT (hMTPPT), but less is known about structural features that are important for its function. Here, we used a protein-docking model ("Phyre2" and "DockingServer") to predict residues that may be important for function (substrate recognition) of the hMTPPT; we also examined the role of conserved positively-charged residues predicted ("PRALINE") to be in the trans-membrane domains (TMDs) in uptake of the negatively-charged TPP. Among the six residues predicted by the docking model (i.e., (29), Arg(30), Ile(33), Ser(34), Asp(37) and (298)), only Ile(33), Ser(34) and Asp(37) were found to be critical for function. While no change in translational efficiency/protein stability of the Ser(34) mutant was observed, both the Ile(33) and Asp(37) mutants showed a decrease in this parameter(s); there was also a decrease in the expression of the latter two mutants in mitochondria. A need for a polar residue at position 34 of the hMTPPT was evident. Our findings with the positively-charged residues (i.e., His(82), His(137), Lys(231) and Lys(291)) predicted in the TMD showed that His(137) and Lys(291) are important for function (via a role in proper delivery of the protein to mitochondria). These investigations provide important information about the structure-function relationship of the hMTPPT.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands play critical roles in various biological functions, and deregulated activation of Eph/ephrin signaling in humans is thought to lead to tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt was made to elucidate the inhibition potential of nine bioactive compounds from four different native spices of Bangladesh against this couple of receptors via molecular docking study. The molecular docking study was carried out using Vina docking protocol. Finally, the receptor-ligand interaction analysis was carried out using the Discovery Studio Client package. Quercetin and diosgenin of onion showed favorable binding with NRP-1 with low binding energy of -7.8 and -7.2 kcal/mol, respectively, in comparison with the control inhibitor (-6.1 kcal/mol). The study suggests that ligand interaction with the residues Asp 48,  44,  77, Tyr 81, Trp29, Ile 143 of NRP-1 and Lys 653,  765, Ser 763,  699, Ile 683 of Eph might be critical for the inhibitory activity of these receptors.

To dissect the central  activity of S. suis under different conditions of nutrient availability, we performed labeling experiments starting from [(13)C]glucose specimens and analyzed the resulting isotopologue patterns in amino acids of S. suis grown under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. In combination with classical growth experiments, we found that S. suis is auxotrophic for Arg, Gln/Glu, His, Leu, and Trp in chemically defined medium. De novo biosynthesis was shown for Ala, Asp, Ser, and  at high rates and for Gly, Lys, , Tyr, and Val at moderate or low rates, respectively. Glucose degradation occurred mainly by glycolysis and to a minor extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the exclusive formation of oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylation became evident from the patterns in de novo synthesized amino acids. Labeling experiments with S. suis grown ex vivo in blood or cerebrospinal fluid reflected the  adaptation to these host niches with different nutrient availability; however, similar key  activities were identified under these conditions. This points at the robustness of the core   in S. suis during the infection process. The crucial role of PEP carboxylation for growth of S. suis in the host was supported by experiments with a PEP carboxylase-deficient mutant strain in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606576>Targeting Phosphopeptide Recognition by the Human BRCA1 Tandem BRCT Domain to Interrupt BRCA1-Dependent Signaling.</a></h1><p>Intracellular signals triggered by DNA breakage flow through proteins containing BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domains. This family, comprising 23 conserved phosphopeptide-binding modules in man, is inaccessible to small-molecule chemical inhibitors. Here, we develop Bractoppin, a drug-like inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition by the human BRCA1 tandem (t)BRCT domain, which selectively inhibits substrate binding with nanomolar potency in vitro. Structure-activity exploration suggests that Bractoppin engages BRCA1 tBRCT residues recognizing pSer in the consensus motif, pSer-Pro--, plus an abutting hydrophobic pocket that is distinct in structurally related BRCT domains, conferring selectivity. In cells, Bractoppin inhibits substrate recognition detected by Förster resonance energy transfer, and diminishes BRCA1 recruitment to DNA breaks, in turn suppressing damage-induced G2 arrest and assembly of the recombinase, RAD51. But damage-induced MDC1 recruitment, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation, and TOPBP1 recruitment remain unaffected. Thus, an inhibitor of phosphopeptide recognition selectively interrupts BRCA1 tBRCT-dependent signals evoked by DNA damage.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In particular, we report model complexes of the general formula fac-[M(L)(CO)] (M = Re, Tc, Re) where L denotes NOTA-Pyr (1) or NODAGA-Pyr (2), which are derived from conjugation of NOTA/NODAGA with pyrrolidine (Pyr). Further, as proof-of-principle, we synthesized the peptide bioconjugate NODAGA-sst-ANT (3) and explored its complexation with the fac-[Re(CO)] and fac-[Tc][Tc(CO)] cores; sst-ANT denotes the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist 4-NO--c(DCys-Tyr-DTrp-Lys--Cys)-DTyr-NH. Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Rapid clearance was observed within 1 h post-injection, predominantly via the renal system (82% of the injected dose was excreted in urine by 1 h), with low kidney retention (% ID/g: 11 at 1 h, 5 at 4 h, and 1 at 24 h) and low nonspecific uptake in other organs/tissues.

URID 12.1.</a></h1><p>A strong antistaphylococcal peptide (ASP-1) from Bacillus subtilis URID 12.1 strain that is active against cefoxitin- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates was purified to homogeneity by solvent extraction, silica gel-based adsorption chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peptide sequence of ASP-1 as determined by MALDI-TOF/MS and ESI-FTICR-MS was acetylated --Ala-Val-Dhb--Ile/Leu. The peptide was further analysed by alkaline hydrolysis, ESI-Q-TOF-MS and an ion mobility assay, which detected the presence of a lactone ring in the intact peptide and a cyclic nature, subsequently revealing the linearised peptide sequence as acPhe-Leu---Val-Ala-Dhb. Based on the molecular mass (804.5 Da), peptide sequence and amino acid composition, ASP-1 was identified as a lactone ring-containing peptide similar to TL-119, a poorly studied cyclic depsipeptide. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed its predominantly random structure in aqueous solution and its β-sheet conformation in methanol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the purified peptide against S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ranged from 2 µg/mL to 64 µg/mL. At sub-MICs and 1× MIC, ASP-1 showed a strong antibiofilm characteristic. ASP-1 at a concentration of 128 µg/mL did not show haemolytic activity, and no cytotoxicity was observed against hepatic carcinoma and breast carcinoma cell lines at the same concentration. Peptide ASP-1 with anti-MRSA and antibiofilm abilities and non-haemolytic and non-cytotoxic properties has not been reported previously. These findings suggest that it may serve as a lead molecule for developing alternative topical antibacterial agents.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

Nonetheless, their prevalence has increased significantly during the last decades. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a relatively new treatment approach for inoperable or metastasised NETs. The therapeutic effect is based on the binding of radiolabelled somatostatin analogue peptides with NETs' somatostatin receptors, resulting in internal irradiation of tumours. Pre-therapeutic patient-specific dosimetry is essential to ensure that a treatment course has high levels of safety and efficacy. This paper reviews the methods applied for PRRT dosimetry, as well as the dosimetric results presented in the literature. Focus is given on data concerning the therapeutic somatostatin analogue radiopeptides (111)In-[DTPA(0),D-(1)]-octreotide ((111)In-DTPA-octreotide), (90)Y-[DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]-octreotide ((90)Y-DOTATOC) and (177)Lu-[DOTA(0),Tyr(3),(8)]-octreotide ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Following the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee formalism, dosimetric analysis demonstrates large interpatient variability in tumour and organ uptake, with kidneys and bone marrow being the critical organs. The results are dependent on the image acquisition and processing protocol, as well as the dosimetric imaging radiopharmaceutical.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26431875>Intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations generated via the extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaSR) in response to extracellular Ca(2+) or L-phenylalanine: Impact of the highly conservative mutation Ser170Thr.</a></h1><p>The extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaSR) is an allosteric protein that responds to changes in the extracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]e) and aromatic amino acids with the production of different patterns of oscillations in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). An increase in [Ca(2+)]e stimulates sinusoidal oscillations in [Ca(2+)]i whereas aromatic amino acid-induced CaR activation in the presence of a threshold [Ca(2+)]e promotes transient oscillations in [Ca(2+)]i. Here, we examined spontaneous and ligand-evoked [Ca(2+)]i oscillations in single HEK-293 cells transfected with the wild type CaSR or with a mutant CaSR in which Ser170 was converted to  (CaSRS170T). Our analysis demonstrates that cells expressing CaSRS170T display [Ca(2+)]i oscillations in the presence of low concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+) and respond to L- with robust transient [Ca(2+)]i oscillations. Our results indicate that the S170T mutation induces a marked increase in CaSR sensitivity to [Ca(2+)]e and imply that the allosteric regulation of the CaSR by aromatic amino acids is not only mediated by an heterotropic positive effect on Ca(2+) binding cooperativity but, as biased agonists, aromatic amino acids stabilize a CaSR conformation that couples to a different signaling pathway leading to transient [Ca(2+)]i oscillations.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727082>Comparison of amino acid digestibility in full-fat soybean, two soybean meals, and peanut flour between broiler chickens and growing pigs.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in full-fat soybean (FFSB), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 430 g/kg CP (SBM-43), solvent-extracted soybean meal containing 470 g/kg CP (SBM-47), and peanut flour (PNF) fed to broiler chickens and pigs and to compare the digestibility of CP and AA between broiler chickens and pigs.

In Exp. 2, twenty barrows (62.0 ± 6.9 kg initial BW) surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum were allotted to 5 experimental diets with 2 consecutive 7-d experimental periods. After 5 d of adaptation, ileal digesta samples were collected at d 6 and 7. For statistical analysis, treatments were considered a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement with effects of species and experimental diets (Exp. 1 vs. Exp. 2). There were no interactions between species and diets for the digestibility of CP and AA except for Cys ( < 0.01). The AID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.01) than in broiler chickens. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the AID of CP and indispensable AA in SBM-47 were greater ( < 0.05) than in FFSB, and the AID of Lys in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. The SID of CP and indispensable AA in pigs were greater ( < 0.05) than in broiler chickens except for Trp. In both broiler chickens and pigs, the SID of Lys in PNF was the least ( < 0.05) among ingredients. In broiler chickens, the SID of CP, Ile, Leu, , Trp, and Val in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than that in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In pigs, the SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, Met, , and Val in FFSB were less ( < 0.05) than in SBM-43, SBM-47, and PNF. In conclusion, the digestibility of CP and most AA were less in broiler chickens than in pigs, but the pattern of differences in the AA digestibility among ingredients was similar between broiler chickens and pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554003>Opioids and opioid receptors orchestrate wound repair.</a></h1><p>We have previously shown that topical opioids including morphine and its congeners promote healing of full thickness ischemic wounds in rats. We examined the contribution of mu opioid receptor (MOPr)-mediated healing of full thickness ischemic wounds using MOPr and delta or kappa opioid receptor knockout (KO) mice. Wound closure in the early (day 5) as well as later phases was delayed in topical morphine or PBS-treated MOPr-KO mice compared with reciprocal treatments of wounds in wild-type (WT) mice. MOPr expression was significantly upregulated at 30 min in the wound margins and colocalized with wound margins and vasculature in the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin. We next examined whether neuropeptide expression was involved in the mechanism of MOPr-mediated wound closure. Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in the skin of MOPr-KO mice as compared with WT mice. Neuropeptide-ir was increased significantly in PBS-treated wounds of MOPr and WT mice, but morphine treatment reduced neuropeptide immunoreactivity in both as compared with PBS. Wounding of keratinocytes led to the release of opioid peptide beta-endorphin (β-END) in conditioned medium, which stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells. MOPr-selective (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2, CTOP) and nonselective OPr antagonist naloxone-inhibited endothelial proliferation induced by wounded keratinocyte-conditioned medium. In addition, accelerated wound area closure in vitro by morphine was suppressed by methylnaltrexone, a nonselective OPr antagonist with high affinity for MOPr. Morphine and its congeners stimulated the proliferation of endothelial cells from WT mice but not those from MOPr-KO mice. Furthermore, morphine-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in endothelial cells was significantly decreased in MOPr-KO mice as compared with WT mice. Collectively, these data suggest that MOPr plays a critical role in the proliferation phase with the formation of granulation tissue during wound healing.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Their cytotoxicity and antioxidant activities in vitro were determined. Additionally, pulsed electric field technology, antioxidant activities, and circular dichroism were used together to investigate the relationship between antioxidant activities and secondary structure. The results showed that neither peptide demonstrated cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. KWFCT had higher values for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition (67.43%±1.33%) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (67.86±1.03mM Fe/mg), and Ac-QWFCT had higher values for 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) inhibition (74.9%±1.19%) and cellular antioxidant activity (916.32μmol of QE/100g) (P<0.05). The antioxidant activities reached their highest values when parameters of PEF were 5kV/cm and 2400Hz. An increase in antioxidant activities of Ac-QWFCT was correlated with a decrease in random coil content.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Data from 25 papers, published from 1995 to 2018, for a total of 44 trials and 210 observations were recorded in a database. Diets were reformulated using the NRC (2012) loading values to estimate nutrient concentrations. The response variables were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F). The predictor variables tested included average body weight (BW), crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, Ile:Lys, Leu:Lys, Val:Lys, BCAA:Lys, Ile:Leu, Val:Leu, Ile:Val, (Ile+Val):Leu, Trp:Lys, Leu:Trp, Ile:Trp, Val:Trp, BCAA:Trp, Met:Lys, Leu:Met, Ile:Met, Val:Met, BCAA:Met, His:Lys, Leu:His, Ile:His, Val:His, BCAA:His, :Lys, Leu:, Ile:, Val:, BCAA:, (+Tyr):Lys, Leu:(+Tyr), Ile:(+Tyr), Val:(+Tyr), BCAA:(+Tyr), LNAA:Lys, Leu:LNAA, Ile:LNAA, Val:LNAA, and BCAA:LNAA. Amino acids were expressed on standardized ileal digestible basis. The MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to develop the equations. The inverse of squared SEM was used to account for heterogeneous errors using the WEIGHT statement. Models were selected with a step-wise manual forward selection. In order to be included in the final model, predictor variables had to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) and provide an improvement of at least 2 points in Bayesian information criterion. The optimum equations were: ADG, g = - 985.94 + (15.2499 × average BW (kg)) - (0.08885 × average BW × average BW) + (1.063 × Leu:Lys) + (20.2659 × Ile:Lys) - (0.1479 × Ile:Lys × Ile:Lys) + (9.2243 × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.03321 × (Ile+Val):Leu × (Ile+Val):Leu) - (0.4413 × Ile:Trp); G:F, g/kg = 648.3 - (6.2974 × average BW (kg)) + (0.02051 × average BW × average BW) + (0.5396 × Ile:Lys) + (1.7284 × Val:Lys) - (0.00795 × Val:Lys × Val:Lys) - (1.7594 × Met:Lys); and ADFI, kg = predicted ADG/predicted G:F. Overall, the prediction equations suggest that increasing Leu:Lys negatively impacts ADG due to a reduction in G:F and ADFI caused by insufficient levels of other BCAA and LNAA relative to Leu. According to the model, the addition of Val, Ile, and Trp, alone or in combination, has the potential to counteract the negative effects of high dietary Leu concentrations on growth performance.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous studies on the sequence requirements for N-glycosylation have yielded the Asn-X-Ser/ (NXS/T) sequon and the enhanced aromatic sequons (-X-Asn-X- and -X-X-Asn-X-), which can be efficiently N-glycosylated. To further investigate the influence of sequence variation on N-glycosylation efficiency in the context of a five-residue enhanced aromatic sequon, we used the human CD2 adhesion domain (hCD2ad) to screen the i-2, i-1, i+1, and i+2 residues flanking Asn at the i position. We found that aromatic residues, especially Trp, and sulfur-containing residues at the i-2 position improved N-glycosylation efficiency, while positively charged residues such as Arg suppressed N-glycosylation. Thiol, hydroxyl, and aliphatic-based side chains at the i-1 position had higher N-glycosylation efficiency, and Cys, in particular, compensated for the negative effect of Arg at the i-2 position. Small residues and Ser at the i+1 position increased the likelihood of N-glycosylation, and  is better than Ser at the i+2 position. We devised an algorithm for prediction of N-glycosylation efficiency using the SAS software, employing the 120 sequences studied as a training set. We then introduced the optimized-enhanced aromatic sequons into other glycoproteins and observed an enhancement in N-glycan occupancy that was further supported by modeling the high-affinity interaction between the optimized sequence on hCD2ad and a human oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) subunit. The findings in this study provide useful information for enhancing or suppressing N-glycosylation at a site of interest and valuable data for a better understanding of OST-catalyzed N-glycosylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152513>Evolution and conservation of JmjC domain proteins in the green lineage.</a></h1><p>Histone modification regulates plant development events by epigenetically silencing or activating gene expression, and histone methylation is regulated by histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs). The JmjC domain proteins, an important KDM family, erase methyl marks (CH3-) from histones and play key roles in maintaining homeostasis of histone methylation in vivo. Here, we analyzed 169 JmjC domain proteins from whole genomes of plants ranging from green alga to higher plants together with 36 from two animals (fruit fly and human). The plant JmjC domain proteins were divided into seven groups. Group-I KDM4/JHDM3 and Group-V JMJD6 were found in all the plant species and the other groups were detected mainly in vascular or seed plants. Group-I KDM4/JHDM3 was potentially associated with demethylation of H3K9me2/3, H3K27me2/3, and H3K36me1/2/3, Group-II KDM5A with H3K4me1/2/3, Group-III KDM5B with H3K4me1/2/3 and H3K9me1/2/3, Group-V JMJD6 with H3R2, H4R3, and hydroxylation of H4, and Group-VII KDM3/JHDM2 with H3K9me1/2/3. Group-IV/Group-VI JmjC domain-only A/B proteins were involved in hydroxylation and demethylation of unknown substrate sites. The binding sites for the cofactors Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate in the JmjC domains also were analyzed. In the α-ketoglutarate binding sites, //Ser and Lys were conserved and in the Fe(II) binding sites, two His and Glu/Asp were conserved. The results show that JmjC domain proteins are a conserved family in which domain organization and cofactor binding sites have been modified in some species. Our results provide insights into KDM evolution and lay a foundation for functional characterization of KDMs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27704838>Analysis of Differential Efficacy and Affinity of GABA (α1/α2) Selective Modulators.</a></h1><p>Selective modulators of the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) family of receptors have the potential to treat a range of disease states related to cognition, pain, and anxiety. While the development of various α subunit-selective modulators is currently underway for the treatment of anxiety disorders, a mechanistic understanding of the correlation between their bioactivity and efficacy, based on ligand-target interactions, is currently still lacking. In order to alleviate this situation, in the current study we have analyzed, using ligand- and structure-based methods, a data set of 5440 GABA modulators. The Spearman correlation (ρ) between binding activity and efficacy of compounds was calculated to be 0.008 and 0.31 against the α1 and α2 subunits of GABA receptor, respectively; in other words, the compounds had little diversity in structure and bioactivity, but they differed significantly in efficacy. Two compounds were selected as a case study for detailed interaction analysis due to the small difference in their structures and affinities (ΔpK = 0.45 log units, ΔpK = 0 log units) as compared to larger relative efficacies (ΔRE = 1.03, ΔRE = 0.21). Docking analysis suggested that His-101 is involved in a characteristic interaction of the α1 receptor with both compounds 1 and 2. Residues such as -77, -142, Asn-60, and Arg-144 of the γ chain of the α1γ2 complex also showed interactions with heterocyclic rings of both compounds 1 and 2, but these interactions were disturbed in the case of α2γ2 complex docking results. Binding pocket stability analysis based on molecular dynamics identified three substitutions in the loop C region of the α2 subunit, namely, G200E, I201T, and V202I, causing a reduction in the flexibility of α2 compared to α1. These amino acids in α2, as compared to α1, were also observed to decrease the vibrational and dihedral entropy and to increase the hydrogen bond content in α2 in the apo state. However, freezing of both α1 and α2 was observed in the ligand-bound state, with an increased number of internal hydrogen bonds and increased entropy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the amino acid differences in the loop C region of α2 are responsible for conformational changes in the protein structure compared to α1, as well as for the binding modes of compounds and hence their functional signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851853>Milk protein yield and mammary  are affected by phenylalanine deficiency but not by threonine or tryptophan deficiency.</a></h1><p>Efficient milk protein synthesis requires that the essential AA be presented to the mammary gland in the right amount and proportion to maximize protein synthesis and minimize losses. This study investigated the effects of individual AA deficiencies on cow productivity, mammary , and glucose whole-body rate of appearance. Five Holstein cows were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design trial with 10-d periods. Treatments were abomasal infusions of (1) water (CTL); (2) complete AA mixture (TAA); (3) TAA without  (No-); (4) TAA without  (No-); and (5) TAA without Trp (No-Trp). Each treatment was compared with TAA. Treatment did not affect milk, fat, or lactose yields. Arterial concentrations of , , and Trp decreased with their respective deletions by 60, 76, and 69%. In response to the decreased arterial supply of the deleted AA, mammary plasma flow significantly increased by 55% with No- but did not increase with No- or No-Trp. Mammary uptake of  was reduced by No-, accompanied by a reduced milk protein yield; uptakes of  and Trp were not affected by their respective deletions, and milk protein yield did not decrease with these treatments. Deletion of  tended to reduce its mammary uptake relative to milk output (U:O), accompanied by an increased U:O of Tyr, but deletion of  and Trp did not affect the U:O of the corresponding AA. Plasma urea-N concentration was lower with CTL and tended to be higher with No-. Arterial concentrations and mammary uptake of acetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and lactate were unaffected by treatment. Treatment had no effect on glucose rate of appearance at the whole-body level. Lactose output as a percentage of glucose whole-body rate of appearance was not affected by treatment. Overall, the study indicated that a deficiency of  negatively affected productivity and mammary  but that a deficiency of  or Trp did not.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.

Here we examined the contribution of the C terminus in supporting folding of the serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4). Our working hypothesis posited that the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal α-helix ((603)-(613)) was important for folding of SERT. Accordingly, we disrupted the hydrophobic moment of the α-helix by replacing (604), Ile(608), or Ile(612) by Gln. The bulk of the resulting mutants SERT-F604Q, SERT-I608Q, and SERT-I612Q were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, but their residual delivery to the cell surface still depended on SEC24C. This indicates that the amphipathic nature of the C-terminal α-helix was dispensable to endoplasmic reticulum export. The folding trajectory of SERT is thought to proceed through the inward facing conformation. Consistent with this conjecture, cell surface expression of the misfolded mutants was restored by (i) introducing second site suppressor mutations, which trap SERT in the inward facing state, or (ii) by the pharmacochaperone noribogaine, which binds to the inward facing conformation. Finally, mutation of Glu(615) at the end of the C-terminal α-helix to Lys reduced surface expression of SERT-E615K. A charge reversal mutation in intracellular loop 1 restored surface expression of SERT-R152E/E615K to wild type levels. These observations support a mechanistic model where the C-terminal amphipathic helix is stabilized by an intramolecular salt bridge between residues Glu(615) and Arg(152). This interaction acts as a pivot in the conformational search associated with folding of SERT.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25087732>Enzymatic hydrolysis optimization of Paphia undulata and lymphocyte proliferation activity of the isolated peptide fractions.</a></h1><p>The immune system is important in preventing and controlling various infectious diseases. Immunoactive peptides derived from food proteins could exert immunomodulatory activity without side effects. Paphia undulata with high-protein is suitable for the production of immunoactive peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis parameters to maximize the immune activity of hydrolysates from Paphia undulata.Hydrolysis parameters, including temperature, time and the ratio of alkaline protease to Paphia undulata meat (E/S), were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: temperature, 51 °C; time, 3.14 h; E/S, 4,321 U g(-1) (Paphia undulata meat). Furthermore, hydrolysates obtained under the optimum conditions were fractionated by ultrafiltration and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. After two-step isolation, the isolated fractions (P2 and P3) including the peptides Pro-His--Cys, Val-Gly-Try-, Glu-, Leu-, and Glu-Gly-Ala-Lys, Trp-Ile or Trp-Leu, respectively, could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation ability.These results showed that response surface methodology and two-step separation were efficient for recovery of low-molecular-weight peptides with high spleen lymphocyte proliferation activity, and the isolated fractions of Paphia undulata hydrolysates are potential ingredients for development of functional foods.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595103>Computational identification and binding analysis of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 enzyme with substrates.</a></h1><p>Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are important heme-containing proteins, well known for their monooxygenase reaction. The human cytochrome P450 4X1 (CYP4X1) is categorized as "orphan" CYP because of its unknown function. In recent studies it is found that this enzyme is expressed in neurovascular functions of the brain. Also, various studies have found the expression and activity of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 in cancer. It is found to be a potential drug target for cancer therapy. However, three-dimensional structure, the active site topology and substrate specificity of CYP4X1 remain unclear.In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated by homology modeling using Modeller 9v8. The generated structure was accessed for geometrical errors and energy stability using PROCHECK, VERFIY 3D and PROSA. A molecular docking analysis was carried out against substrates arachidonic acid and anandamide and the docked substrates were predicted for drug-likeness, ADME-Tox parameters and biological spectrum activity.The three-dimensional model of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 was generated and assessed with various structural validation programmes. Docking of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1 with arachidonic acid revealed that TYR 112, ALA 126, ILE 222, ILE 223,  312, LEU 315, ALA 316, ASP 319,  320,  491 and ILE 492 residues were actively participating in the interaction, while docking of CYP4X1 with anandamide showed that TYR 112, GLN 114, PRO 118, ALA 126, ILE 222, ILE 223, SER 251, LEU 315, ALA 316 and  491 key residues were involved in strong interaction.From this study, several key residues were identified to be responsible for the binding of arachidonic acid and anandamide with orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1. Both substrates obeyed Lipinski rule of five in drug-likeness test and biological spectrum prediction showed anticarcinogenic activity. Compared to anandamide, arachidonic acid showed strong interaction with cytochrome P450 4X1 and also less health effect in certain human system in ADME-Tox prediction. These findings provide useful information on the biological role and structure-based drug design of orphan human cytochrome P450 4X1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26615566>Targeted mutations in Val101 and Arg27 interferon beta protein increase its transcriptional and translational activities.</a></h1><p>Interferon β (IFNβ) is the most prescribed drug that has been used frequently for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The aim of this study is to improve the production of IFNβ by induction of site directed mutagenesis. Accordingly, recombinant constructs were designed in order to enhance the expression of IFNβ mRNA and protein. The recombinant plasmids were transfected to the CHO cell line, following RNA extractions and cDNA synthesis. The effects of recombinant constructs were analyzed by real time PCR, ELISA and MTT assay. Transfected samples with either IFNβ101 or IFNβ101+27 have shown 11.55 and 2.26 fold elevation and over-expression compare to the wild type construct respectively. Our data also indicated that the IFNβ101 and IFNβ101+27 constructs increase IFNβ protein expression more than 2.2 and 4.5 fold, respectively compared to the control group. It could be concluded that the substitution of  in the codon 101 position, which may increase the binding activity of IFNβ with its receptors and introduction of an additional N glycosylation site (Asn-X-) in the position 27 of IFNβ protein may cause such an effect. The proliferative activity of transfected cells by a recombinant IFNβ101 decreases in comparison to the wild type, although it was not statistically significant. Over-expression of IFNβ in such a level is promising not only for the patients but also for the pharmaceutical industries.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the in vitro and in vivo performance of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl--cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)-Lys--Cys)D-Tyr-NH2), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist 64Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D--cyclo(Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys--Cys)). In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability. PET studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130500>Purification, characterization and application of a novel antimicrobial peptide from Andrias davidianus blood.</a></h1><p>The Andrias davidianus has been known as a traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. Its blood is considered as a waste or by-product of the meat production industry. Although there are reports on isolation of the antimicrobial peptides from different resources, there are no reports of their isolation from A. davidianus blood. In this work, an antimicrobial peptide, andricin B, was isolated from the blood of A. davidianus by an innovative method in which the magnetic liposome adsorption was combined with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The structure, antimicrobial activity and safety of andricin B were further investigated. Amino acid sequence was determined by N-terminal sequencing and found to be Gly-Leu--Arg-Leu--Ser-Val-Ile-Lys. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and prediction of three-dimensional structure by bioinformatics software suggested the presence of a well-defined random coil conformation. Andricin B was found to be active against all bacteria tested in this study as well as some fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were in the range 8-64 μg ml . Moreover, the haemolytic testing also suggested that andricin B could be considered safe at the MICs. Finally, andricin B was shown to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in the cooked meat of A. davidianus. This study shows that andricin B is a promising novel antimicrobial peptide that may provide further insights towards the development of new drugs.This is the pioneer study on screening and isolation of antimicrobial peptide from the blood of Andrias davidianus. Here, we have developed a novel method by combining magnetic liposomes adsorption with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to purify and screen the antimicrobial peptides. From this screen, we identified a novel antimicrobial peptide which we name as andricin B. Andricin B is unique as it checks the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as few fungal species.© 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25884917>Types of skin afferent fibers and spinal opioid receptors that contribute to touch-induced inhibition of heart rate changes evoked by noxious cutaneous heat stimulation.</a></h1><p>In anesthetized rats and conscious humans, a gentle touch using a soft disc covered with microcones (with a texture similar to that of a finger), but not with a flat disc, inhibits nociceptive somatocardiac reflexes. Such an inhibitory effect is most reliably evoked when touch is applied to the skin ipsilateral and closest to nociceptive inputs. However, the mechanism of this inhibition is not completely elucidated. We aimed to clarify the types of cutaneous afferent fibers and spinal opioid receptors that contribute to antinociceptive effects of microcone touch.The present study comprised two experiments with urethane-anesthetized rats. In the first experiment, unitary activity of skin afferent fibers was recorded from the saphenous nerve, and responses to a 10-min touch using a microcone disc and a flat disc (control) were compared. Greater discharge rate during microcone touch was observed in low-threshold mechanoreceptive Aδ and C afferent units, whereas many Aβ afferents responded similarly to the two types of touch. In the second experiment, the effect of an intrathecal injection of opioid receptor antagonists on the inhibitory effects of microcone touch on heart rate responses to noxious heat stimulation was examined. The magnitude of the heart rate response was significantly reduced by microcone touch in rats that received saline or naltrindole (δ-opioid receptor antagonist) injections. However, such an inhibition was not observed in rats that received naloxone (non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) or -Cys-Tyr-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2 (CTOP; μ-opioid receptor antagonist) injections.Microcone touch induced greater responses of low-threshold mechanoreceptive Aδ and C afferent units than control touch. The antinociceptive effect of microcone touch was abolished by intrathecal injection of μ-opioid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that excitation of low-threshold mechanoreceptive Aδ and C afferents produces the release of endogenous μ-opioid ligands in the spinal cord, resulting in the inhibition of nociceptive transmission that contributes to somatocardiac reflexes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667549>Advances in the Understanding of the Cannabinoid Receptor 1 - Focusing on the Inverse Agonists Interactions.</a></h1><p>Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) is a membrane protein prevalent in the central nervous system, whose crystallographic structure has recently been solved. Studies will be needed to investigate CB1 complexes with its ligands and its role in the development of new drugs.Our goal here is to review the studies on CB1, starting with general aspects and focusing on the recent structural studies, with emphasis on the inverse agonists bound structures.We start with a literature review, and then we describe recent studies on CB 1 crystallographic structure and docking simulations. We use this structural information to depict protein-ligand interactions. We also describe the molecular docking method to obtain complex structures of CB 1 with inverse agonists.Analysis of the crystallographic structure and docking results revealed the residues responsible for the specificity of the inverse agonists for CB 1. Most of the intermolecular interactions involve hydrophobic residues, with the participation of the residues  170 and Leu 359 in all complex structures investigated in the present study. For the complexes with otenabant and taranabant, we observed intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving residues His 178 (otenabant) and  197 and Ser 383 (taranabant).Analysis of the structures involving inverse agonists and CB 1 revealed the pivotal role played by residues  170 and Leu 359 in their interactions and the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds highlighting the importance of the exploration of intermolecular interactions in the development of novel inverse agonists.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567240>Production of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory peptides from Kluyveromyces marxianus protein hydrolysates: Purification and molecular docking.</a></h1><p>Kluyveromyces marxianus protein hydrolysates were prepared by two different sonicated-enzymatic (trypsin and chymotrypsin) hydrolysis treatments to obtain antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory peptides. Trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolysates obtained by 5 h, exhibited the highest antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities. After fractionation using ultrafiltration and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) techniques, two new peptides were identified. One fragment (LL-9, MW = 1180 Da) with the amino acid sequence of Leu-Pro-Glu-Ser-Val-His-Leu-Asp-Lys showed significant ACE inhibitory activity (IC = 22.88 μM) while another peptide fragment (VL-9, MW = 1118 Da) with the amino acid sequence of Val-Leu-Ser--Ser--Pro-Pro-Lys showed the highest antioxidant and ACE inhibitory properties (IC = 15.20 μM, 5568 μM TE/mg protein). The molecular docking studies revealed that the ACE inhibitory activities of VL-9 is due to interaction with the S2 (His513, His353, Glu281) and S'1 (Glu162) pockets of ACE and LL-9 can fit perfectly into the S1 (Thr345) and S2 (Tyr520, Lys511, Gln281) pockets of ACE.Copyright © 2017.

Besides surgery, there are no curative treatments for NE cancers and their metastases, emphasizing the need for the development of other forms of therapy. In this study, multifunctional unimolecular micelles were developed for targeted NE cancer therapy. The unimolecular micelles were formed by multi-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer poly(amidoamine)-poly(valerolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugated with KE108 peptide and Cy5 dye (abbreviated as PAMAM-PVL-PEG-KE108/Cy5). The unimolecular micelles with a spherical core-shell structure exhibited a uniform size distribution and excellent stability. The hydrophobic drug thailandepsin-A (TDP-A), a recently discovered HDAC inhibitor, was physically encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of the micelles. KE108 peptide, a somatostatin analog possessing high affinity for all five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTR 1-5), commonly overexpressed in NE cancer cells, was used for the first time as an NE cancer targeting ligand. KE108 exhibited superior targeting abilities compared to other common somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide, in NE cancer cell lines. The in vitro assays demonstrated that the TDP-A-loaded, KE108-targeted micelles exhibited the best capabilities in suppressing NE cancer cell growth. Moreover, the in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging on NE-tumor-bearing nude mice showed that KE108-conjugated micelles exhibited the greatest tumor accumulation due to their passive targeting and active targeting capabilities. Finally, TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated micelles possessed the best anticancer efficacy without detectable systemic toxicity. Thus, these novel TDP-A-loaded and KE108-conjugated unimolecular micelles offer a promising approach for targeted NE cancer therapy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Eutherian mammals possess a highly conserved sequence of OXT (Cys-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly). However, in this study, we sequenced the coding region for OXT in 22 species covering all New World monkeys (NWM) genera and clades, and characterize five OXT variants, including consensus mammalian Leu(8)-OXT, major variant Pro(8)-OXT, and three previously unreported variants: Ala(8)-OXT, (8)-OXT, and (2)-OXT. Pro(8)-OXT shows clear structural and physicochemical differences from Leu(8)-OXT. We report multiple predicted amino acid substitutions in the G protein-coupled OXT receptor (OXTR), especially in the critical N-terminus, which is crucial for OXT recognition and binding. Genera with same Pro(8)-OXT tend to cluster together on a phylogenetic tree based on OXTR sequence, and we demonstrate significant coevolution between OXT and OXTR. NWM species are characterized by high incidence of social monogamy, and we document an association between OXTR phylogeny and social monogamy. Our results demonstrate remarkable genetic diversity in the NWM OXT/OXTR system, which can provide a foundation for molecular, pharmacological, and behavioral studies of the role of OXT signaling in regulating complex social phenotypes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28046153>Energy content and amino acid digestibility of flaxseed expellers fed to growing pigs.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to determine the DE and ME as well as the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in flaxseed expellers fed to growing pigs. In Exp. 1, the DE and ME were determined using 66 crossbred growing pigs (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 54.2 ± 2.3 kg BW) fed 1 of 11 diets in a completely randomized design. The diets included a corn-soybean meal basal diet and 10 experimental diets containing 29.16% flaxseed expellers supplemented at the expense of corn and soybean meal. In Exp. 2, 11 growing pigs (35.5 ± 3.4 kg), fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum, were assigned to 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. The diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets containing 40% flaxseed expellers as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was used as an indigestible marker. There was considerable variation in the chemical composition among the 10 flaxseed expellers. The CV were greater than 10% for ether extract (EE), NDF, ADF, crude fiber, and Ca and ranged from 7 to 12% for the AA. On a DM basis, the DE and ME ranged from 2,786 to 3,730 and from 2,588 to 3,530 kcal/kg, respectively. The apparent total tract digestibility of GE ranged from 59.91 to 75.83% (mean = 70.92%). Ether extract, GE, and NDF were the best predictors to determine DE and ME. The best prediction equations were DE = -3,231 + (1.58 × GE) - (25.79 × % NDF) ( = 0.90) or DE = 4,189 + (56.78 × % EE) - (30.59 × % NDF) ( = 0.85) and ME = -2,968 + (1.47 × GE) - (24.82 × % NDF) ( = 0.85) or ME = 3,931 + (53.77 × % EE) - (29.31 × % NDF) ( = 0.82), respectively. In Exp. 2, there were significant differences in the AID and SID of CP and all AA with the exception of  ( < 0.05). The AID and SID of CP averaged 70.16 and 78.04%, respectively. For the indispensable AA, the AID and SID of  were the least, with average values of 70.70 and 76.68%, respectively. The digestibility of Arg and Met were the greatest, averaging over 88 and 91% for AID and SID, respectively. The AID and SID of Lys ranged from 66.10 to 81.82% (mean = 74.14%) and from 70.90 to 85.41% (mean = 78.13%), respectively. These results indicate that there is significant variability in chemical composition, energy content, and the SID and AID of CP and AA among the selected flaxseed expellers.

Due to its multiple beneficial effects, GLP-1 has gained great attention for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of GLP-1 with the heptahelical core domain of GLP1R conferring high affinity ligand binding and ligand-induced receptor activation. Here, using chimeric and point-mutated GLP1R, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue Arg(380) flanked by hydrophobic Leu(379) and (381) in extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) may have an interaction with Asp(9) and Gly(4) of the GLP-1 peptide. The molecular modeling study showed that Ile(196) at transmembrane helix 2, Met(233) at ECL1, and Asn(302) at ECL2 of GLP1R have contacts with His(1) and (7) of GLP-1. This study may shed light on the mechanism underlying high affinity interaction between the ligand and the binding pocket that is formed by these conserved residues in the GLP1R core domain.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592684>Molecular mechanism for opioid dichotomy: bidirectional effect of μ-opioid receptors on P2X₃ receptor currents in rat sensory neurones.</a></h1><p>Here, we describe a molecular switch associated with opioid receptors-linked signalling cascades that provides a dual opioid control over P2X3 purinoceptor in sensory neurones. Leu-enkephalin inhibited P2X3-mediated currents with IC50 ~10 nM in ~25% of small nociceptive rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurones. In contrast, in neurones pretreated with pertussis toxin leu-enkephalin produced stable and significant increase of P2X3 currents. All effects of opioid were abolished by selective μ-opioid receptor antagonist D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH2 (CTOP), nonselective inhibitor naloxone, and by PLC inhibitor U73122. Thus, we discovered a dual link between purinoceptors and μ-opioid receptors: the latter exert both inhibitory (pertussis toxin-sensitive) and stimulatory (pertussis toxin-insensitive) actions on P2X3 receptors through phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent . This dual opioid control of P2X3 receptors may provide a molecular explanation for dichotomy of opioid therapy. Pharmacological control of this newly identified facilitation/inhibition switch may open new perspectives for the adequate medical use of opioids, the most powerful pain-killing agents known today.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26304264>Human ketosteroid receptors interact with hazardous phthalate plasticizers and their metabolites: an in silico study.</a></h1><p>Phthalic acid esters or phthalates are ubiquitous environmental pollutants known for their adverse health effects in test animals and, of late, in humans. Thus, in this molecular docking study - using Glide (Schrödinger) - the molecular interactions of 31 ligands, including 12 diphthalates, their monophthalates and phthalic acid with selected human ketosteroid receptors, i.e., androgen (hAR), progesterone (hPR) and glucocorticoid (hGR) receptors were explored and their binding affinities were compared with that of corresponding natural steroids and a known endocrine disrupting xenobiotic, bisphenol A (BPA). Mostly, diphthalates and monophthalates showed the potential for antisteroidal activity by interacting with hAR, hPR and hGR. Of them, diphenyl phthalate showed the highest G score (-7.70 kcal mol(-1) ) with hAR, and the crucial amino acid (aa) residues in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of this receptor involved in the molecular interactions were  764, Leu 704, Asn 705 and  877. The mono-iso-decyl phthalate showed the highest G score (-8.36) with the hPR, and the crucial aa residues in the LBD interactions were Arg 766 Gln 725 and  778. The mono-iso-decyl phthalate also showed more affinity (-8.44) towards hGR than the natural ligand, and the aa residues in the LBD interactions were Gln 570 and Met 604. In addition to these, some other phthalates established comparable interactions with certain aa residues located in the LBD of these receptors, which resulted in higher G scores. Contrastingly, BPA and some natural ligands tested in this study showed lower G scores with these receptors than certain phthalates reported herein, i.e., certain phthalates are more toxic than the proven toxic BPA.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26500271>Lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, arginine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, and threonine maintenance requirements of broiler breeders.</a></h1><p>Five hundred and sixty Cobb-Vantress broiler breeders were used to determine the maintenance requirement of dietary Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , and Val in 10 21-d assays using the comparative slaughter technique.

Illuminated chloroplasts are one of the important sources of hydrogen peroxide (H O ) and are highly sensitive to environmental stimuli, yet a comprehensive view of the oxidation-sensitive chloroplast proteome is still missing. By targeting the sulfenic acid YAP1C-trapping technology to the plastids of light-grown Arabidopsis cells, we identified 132 putatively sulfenylated plastid proteins upon H O pulse treatment. Almost half of the sulfenylated proteins are enzymes of the amino acid metabolism. Using metabolomics, we observed a reversible decrease in the levels of the amino acids Ala, Asn, Cys, Gln, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser,  and Val after H O treatment, which is in line with an anticipated decrease in the levels of the  and tricarboxylic acid metabolites. Through the identification of an organelle-tailored proteome, we demonstrated that the subcellular targeting of the YAP1C probe enables us to study in vivo cysteine sulfenylation at the organellar level.

An additional experiment was conducted to determine effects on growth performance and blood characteristics of including SPC in diets fed to weanling pigs. In Exp. 1, a N-free diet and diets containing soybean meal, fish meal, or SPC ground to a mean particle size of 70, 180, or 700 μm as the only source of AA were fed to 6 barrows (initial BW: 12.90 ± 1.51 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum. In Exp. 2, 36 barrows (13.70 ± 1.86 kg BW) were allotted to a randomized complete block design with 6 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet. A corn-based diet and diets containing corn and soybean meal, fish meal, or SPC ground to the 3 particle sizes were used. In Exp. 3, 160 pigs (initial BW: 7.06 ± 1.07 kg) were allotted to 4 dietary treatments with 8 pens per treatment and 5 pigs per pen. Pigs were fed one of 4 diets during phase 1 (d 0 to 14 postweaning), and a common diet in phase 2 (d 14 to 28 postweaning). The 4 diets used in phase 1 included a control diet containing fish meal and spray-dried plasma protein, and diets in which fish meal, spray-dried plasma protein, or both fish meal and spray-dried plasma protein were replaced by SPC ground to 180 μm. Results of Exp. 1 indicated that the SID of His, Lys, and  tended ( < 0.10) to be greater in SPC ground to 180 μm than in soybean meal, and the SID of Arg, Ile, , and Trp was greater ( < 0.05) in SPC ground to 70 or 180 μm than in soybean meal. There were no differences in the DE and ME (DM-basis) among corn, soybean meal, fish meal, and SPC ground to 70, 180, or 700 μm. Results of Exp. 3 indicated that growth performance of pigs fed the 4 experimental diets in phase 1 was not different in phase 1, phase 2, or in the entire experiment. In conclusion, grinding SPC to approximately 180 µm maximizes SID of indispensable AA without impacting ME and diets based on soybean meal and SPC as the main protein sources may be fed to pigs during the initial 2 wk postweaning without affecting growth performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28091903>Effects of Opioid Peptides on Changes in Lipid  in Rats Subjected to Swimming Stress.</a></h1><p>Blood levels of nonesterified fatty acids, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL increased in rats subjected to forced swimming stress.

Here, we explored and detected the most favorable adsorption conformation of cytochrome c on graphene by measuring the adsorption energy, the number of contact atoms, and the minimal distance between protein and surface. From the root mean square deviation of the protein backbone, the radius of gyration, and the proportion of secondary structure, it is revealed that cytochrome c does not deform significantly and the secondary structures are preserved to a large extent. The residues, Lys,  and  contribute significantly to the adsorption of cytochrome c to graphene. The long hydrophobic and flexible alkyl tail of Lys, the π-π stacking interaction between  and graphene, and the presence of abundant  constitute the driving force for the stable adsorption of cytochrome c on graphene. Cytochrome c is adsorbed to graphene with the group heme lying almost perpendicular to the graphene, and the distance between Fe atom and the graphene is 10.15 A, which is shorter than that between electron donor and receptor in many other biosystems.

The emergence of drug-resistant E. aerogenes demands the need for developing new drugs. Peptidoglycan is an important component of the cell wall of bacteria and the peptidoglycan biochemical pathway is considered as the best source of antibacterial targets. Within this pathway, four Mur ligases MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF are responsible for the successive additions of L-alanine and suitable targets for developing novel antibacterial drugs. As an inference from this fact, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of above Mur ligases using best template structures available in PDB and analyzed its common binding features. Structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted Mur ligases models is also being done using molecular dynamics studies. The models of Mur ligases were further investigated for in silico docking studies using bioactive plant compounds from the literature. Interestingly, these results indicate that four plant compounds Isojuripidine, Atroviolacegenin, Porrigenin B, and Nummularogenin showing better docking results in terms of binding energy and number of hydrogen bonds.

Nitrogen excretion (mg/b/d) decreased (P < 0.001) by 14.1% when broilers were fed diet 4 compared with birds fed diet 2 from 15 to 16 d of age. Broilers fed diet 4 had lower (P = 0.011) plasma UA concentration than birds fed diet 2 at 18 d of age. In trial 2, 8 dietary treatments containing 1.25% digestible Lys and 1.70 total Gly + Ser to digestible Lys ratio were fed from 1 to 21 d of age. Diet 1 (24.0% CP) was supplemented with DL-Met, L-Lys, and L-. Free AA (L-Val, Gly, L-Ile, L-Arg, L-Trp, L-His, and L-) were sequentially supplemented in the order of limitation to decrease CP content in diets 2 to 8 from 23.8 to 20.3%. Broilers fed diet 1 had higher (P < 0.05) body weight gain and lower (P < 0.05) feed conversion when compared with diet 7 or 8. Plasma UA concentration of broiler provided diets 4 to 8 was lower (P < 0.05) compared with diet 1 at 21 d of age. Placing a minimum on dietary CP percentage may not be necessary when proper AA ratios are implemented in diet formulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29407909>Dynamics of dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin A derived from NMR relaxation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation.</a></h1><p>Dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin is the first hemoglobin identified with biologically-relevant oxidative functions, which include peroxidase, peroxygenase and oxidase activities. Herein we report a study of the protein backbone dynamics of DHP using heteronuclear NMR relaxation methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to address the role of protein dynamics in switching from one function to another. The results show that DHP's backbone helical regions and turns have average order parameters of S = 0.87 ± 0.03 and S = 0.76 ± 0.08, respectively. Furthermore, DHP is primarily a monomer in solution based on the overall tumbling correlation time τ is 9.49 ± 1.65 ns calculated using the prolate diffusion tensor model in the program relax. A number of amino acid residues have significant R using the Lipari-Szabo model-free formalism. These include Lys, Ile, Leu, Gln, Arg, Ser, Met, , , Arg,  Cys, Ala, Asn, Gly, Arg, , Leu and Met, which may experience slow conformational motions on the microseconds-milliseconds time scale according to the model. Caution should be used when the model contains >4 fitting parameters. The program caver3.0 was used to identify tunnels inside DHP obtained from MD simulation snapshots that are consistent with the importance of the Xe binding site, which is located at the central intersection of the tunnels. These tunnels provide diffusion  for small ligands such as O, HO and HO to enter the distal pocket independently of the trajectory of substrates and inhibitors, both of which are aromatic molecules.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

All corn was yellow dent corn collected from different areas in China. In Exp. 1, 60 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 40.7 ± 3.5 kg BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 10 diets to determine the DE and ME of corns. Diets were formulated to contain 96.8% of 1 of the 10 corn samples and 3.2% of other microingredients. In Exp. 2, 11 crossbred barrows (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire; 30.5 ± 2.3 kg) fitted with a T-cannula at the distal ileum were assigned to a 6 × 11 Youden square design with 6 periods and 11 diets. Diets included a N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 test diets formulated with 96.6% 1 of the 10 corns as the sole source of AA. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was added to each diet as an indigestible marker for calculating the AA digestibility. On a DM basis, the starch, ether extract (EE), CP, NDF, and ADF contents of corns averaged 74.05% (69.98 to 78.59%), 3.83% (2.04 to 4.73%), 9.63% (7.74 to 10.43%), 10.80% (10.27 to 11.46%), and 2.27% (2.03 to 2.57%), respectively. The CV of EE, CP, and ADF was 22.59, 8.22, and 8.21%, respectively. The DE and ME of corns averaged 4,087 and 3,981 kcal/kg, respectively, and ranged from 3,999 to 4,161 kcal/kg and from 3,898 to 4,067 kcal/kg, respectively. The DE and ME values were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the EE content. Optimal prediction equations of ME were ME = 940.35 + (0.72 × DE) + (21.88 × EE) (R2 = 0.94) or ME = 1,051.50 + (0.82 × DE) - (282.05 × ash) (R2 = 0.99). In Exp. 2, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the SID of Arg, His, , Ala, Pro, Cys, and Tyr. The SID of Lys (average 73.79%), Met (average 87.32%), and  (average 80.06%) ranged from 61.45 to 78.47%, from 74.09 to 90.91%, and from 79.19 to 85.79%, respectively. The standardized ileal digestible Met was positively correlated (P < 0.01) with the Met and CP contents. The obtained prediction equations were standardized ileal digestible Met = 31.34 + (3.43 × CP) + (116.04 × Met) and standardized ileal digestible Met = 104.92 + (294.71 × Met) - (7.03 × NDF). In conclusion, sources had an effect on the energy values and ileal digestibility of most AA in corn. The ME can be predicted by the DE combined with either the EE or ash content. The AA concentrations and SID of AA in corn varied largely.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

Cartilaginous proteins of the scalloped hammerhead were extracted by guanidine hydrochloride, and three antioxidant peptides, named enzymolysis peptide of scalloped hammerhead cartilage A (SCPE-A), SCPE-B and SCPE-C, were subsequently isolated from the hydrolysate of the cartilaginous proteins using ultrafiltration and chromatography. The amino acid sequences of SCPE-A, SCPE-B and SCPE-C were identified as Gly-Pro-Glu (GPE), Gly-Ala-Arg-Gly-Pro-Gln (GARGPQ), and Gly---Gly-Pro-Pro-Gly--Asn-Gly (GFTGPPGFNG), with molecular weights of 301.30 Da, 584.64 Da and 950.03 Da, respectively. As per in vitro activity testing, SCPE-A, SCPE-B and SCPE-C exhibited strong scavenging activities on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH•) (half elimination ratio (EC) 2.43, 2.66 and 1.99 mg/mL), hydroxyl radicals (HO•) (EC 0.28, 0.21 and 0.15 mg/mL), 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radicals (ABTS⁺•) (EC 0.24, 0.18 and 0.29 mg/mL), and superoxide anion radicals ( O 2 - •) (EC 0.10, 0.14 and 0.11 mg/mL). In addition, SCPE-A showed inhibition activity similar to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in lipid peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system. The amino acid residues of Gly, Pro and  could positively influence the antioxidant activities of GPE, GARGPQ and GFTGPPGFNG. These results suggested that GPE, GARGPQ and GFTGPPGFNG might serve as potential antioxidants and be used as food additives and functional foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912872>Relationships between circulating plasma concentrations and duodenal flows of essential amino acids in lactating dairy cows.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to better define essential AA (EAA) requirements in lactating dairy cows through examination of the relationship between plasma essential AA concentration (p[EAA]) and predicted duodenal flow of essential AA (EAAduo). Our hypothesis was that at a given level of milk protein output, p[EAA] would remain steady in response to increasing EAAduo until the EAA requirement was met, at which point p[EAA] would increase rapidly in response to greater duodenal flow of EAA until p[EAA] reached a plateau as other body processes degraded excess EAA to avoid toxicity. Thus, the requirement of each EAA would be fulfilled when p[EAA] increased rapidly. To investigate this hypothesis, we compiled a literature database that included 102 studies with 420 treatment means that reported p[EAA], dietary nutrient content, body weight, and milk production. A second database was produced to validate relationships developed in the first database and included 32 studies with 98 treatment means. All relationships were evaluated as regression equations with study as a random factor. Breed, days in milk, body weight, and milk protein production had no effect on the plasma concentration of any EAA. Other than metabolizable protein supply, nutritional content of the rations did not affect p[EAA]. Only p[Arg] was affected by parity, with primiparous cows having higher concentrations of Arg than older cows. No break points in the relationship between p[EAA] versus EAAduo were detected as either steep increases or plateaus. Plasma Arg, Ile, Lys, , and Val concentrations were best associated with their respective EAAduo as quadratic equations, whereas His, Leu, Met, and  were associated only linearly. Adding a quadratic term improved the adjusted R(2) or decreased the root mean square error marginally (<2.0%). Thus, we conclude that the main effect of EAAduo on p[EAA] is linear. Abomasal or duodenal infusions of Met, Lys, His, Lys+Met, and casein revealed that Met or Lys infused alone increased the plasma concentration of the infused EAA and lowered the concentration of other EAA, particularly His. Infusion of Lys+Met or His alone was associated with increases in concentrations of these EAA without affecting others. We conclude that over a wide range of protein intakes in lactating cows, plasma levels of EAA increase linearly with duodenal flow. No evidence was found that EAA requirements are reflected in blood plasma concentrations.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Within the local neuronal  of the amygdala, a population of inhibitory, intercalated neurons (ITCs) modulates the flow of information among various nuclei of amygdala, including the basal nucleus (BA) and the centromedial nucleus (CeM) of the amygdala. These ITCs have been shown to be important during fear extinction and are target of a variety of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we provide evidence that the activation of μ-opioid receptors (MORs) by the specific agonist DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin) hyperpolarizes medially located ITCs (mITCs) in acute brain slices of mice. Moreover, we use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with local electrical stimulation or glutamate uncaging to analyze the effect of MOR activation on local microcircuits. We show that the GABAergic transmission between mITCs and CeM neurons is attenuated by DAMGO, whereas the glutamatergic transmission on CeM neurons and mITCs is unaffected. Furthermore, MOR activation induced by theta burst stimulation in BA suppresses plastic changes of feedforward inhibitory transmission onto CeM neurons as revealed by the MOR antagonist CTAP d--Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg--Pen--NH2. In summary, the mITCs constitute a target for the opioid system, and therefore, the activation of MOR in ITCs might play a central role in the modulation of the information processing between the basolateral complex of the amygdala and central nuclei of the amygdala.Copyright © 2015 Blaesse, Goedecke et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27903647>The Production and Utilization of GDP-glucose in the Biosynthesis of Trehalose 6-Phosphate by Streptomyces venezuelae.</a></h1><p>Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase OtsA from streptomycetes is unusual in that it uses GDP-glucose as the donor substrate rather than the more commonly used UDP-glucose. We now confirm that OtsA from Streptomyces venezuelae has such a preference for GDP-glucose and can utilize ADP-glucose to some extent too. A crystal structure of the enzyme shows that it shares twin Rossmann-like domains with the UDP-glucose-specific OtsA from Escherichia coli However, it is structurally more similar to Streptomyces hygroscopicus VldE, a GDP-valienol-dependent pseudoglycosyltransferase enzyme. Comparison of the donor binding sites reveals that the amino acids associated with the binding of diphosphoribose are almost all identical in these three enzymes. By contrast, the amino acids associated with binding guanine in VldE (Asn, , and Val) are similar in S. venezuelae OtsA (Asp, Ser, and , respectively) but not conserved in E. coli OtsA (His, Leu, and Asp, respectively), providing a rationale for the purine base specificity of S. venezuelae OtsA. To establish which donor is used in vivo, we generated an otsA null mutant in S. venezuelae The mutant had a cell density-dependent growth phenotype and accumulated galactose 1-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and GDP-glucose when grown on galactose. To determine how the GDP-glucose is generated, we characterized three candidate GDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases. SVEN_3027 is a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, SVEN_3972 is an unusual ITP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, and SVEN_2781 is a pyrophosphorylase that is capable of generating GDP-glucose as well as GDP-mannose. We have therefore established how S. venezuelae can make and utilize GDP-glucose in the biosynthesis of trehalose 6-phosphate.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225562>The adipokinetic hormone of Mantodea in comparison to other Dictyoptera.</a></h1><p>Six species of the order Mantodea (praying mantises) are investigated for the presence and sequence of putative adipokinetic hormones (AKHs). The selected species span a wide evolutionary range of various families and subfamilies of the clade Mantodea. The corpora cardiaca of the different species are dissected, methanolic extracts prepared, peptides separated by liquid chromatography, and AKHs detected and sequenced by ion trap mass spectrometry. All six species investigated contain an octapeptide with the primary structure pGlu-Val-Asn---Pro-Asn-Trp amide, which is code-named Emppe-AKH and had been found earlier in three other species of Mantodea. Conspecific bioassays with the species Creoboter sp. (family Hymenopodidae) reveal an adipokinetic but not a hypertrehalosemic function of Emppe-AKH. Comparison with other members of the Dictyoptera (cockroaches, termites) show that Emppe-AKH is only found in certain termites, which have been recently placed into the Blattaria (cockroaches) as sister group to the family Cryptocercidae. Termites and cockroaches both show biodiversity in the sequence of AKHs, and some cockroach species even contain two AKHs.

Based on the triplet puzzle theory, it has been discovered that opioid receptors are structurally more closely related to chemokine receptors than to other class A G-protein-coupled receptors. Their similarity is established in terms of the number of triplet homologies Asn-Leu-Ala, -Leu-Pro, and Tyr-Ala- in the amino acid code of extensive numbers of members of these two receptor groups. Such widespread similarities probably mean that many opioid and chemokine receptor subtypes utilize some of these mutual triplets to form heteromers. The findings underline that heteromerization among these two receptor groups can represent a major general mechanism for significant interactions between opioid peptides and chemokines in pain and neuroinflammation within the neural-glial  of the CNS including immune cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485983>Increased N-glycosylation efficiency by generation of an aromatic sequon on N135 of antithrombin.</a></h1><p>The inefficient glycosylation of consensus sequence on N135 in antithrombin explains the two glycoforms of this key anticoagulant serpin found in plasma: α and β, with four and three N-glycans, respectively. The lack of this N-glycan increases the heparin affinity of the β-glycoform. Recent studies have demonstrated that an aromatic sequon (-Y-Asn-X-) in reverse β-turns enhances N-glycosylation efficiency and stability of different proteins. We evaluated the effect of the aromatic sequon in this defective glycosylation site of antithrombin, despite of being located in a loop between the helix D and the strand 2A. We analyzed the biochemical and functional features of variants generated in a recombinant cell system (HEK-EBNA). Cells transfected with wild-type plasmid (K133-Y-N135-X-S137) generated 50% of α and β-antithrombin. The S137T, as previously reported, K133F, and the double mutant (K133F/S137T) had improved glycosylation efficiency, leading to the secretion of α-antithrombin, as shown by electrophoretic and mass analysis. The presence of the aromatic sequon did not significantly affect the stability of this conformationally sensitive serpin, as revealed by thermal denaturation assay. Moreover, the aromatic sequon hindered the activation induced by heparin, in which is involved the helix D. Accordingly, K133F and particularly K133F/S137T mutants had a reduced anticoagulant activity. Our data support that aromatic sequons in a different structural context from reverse turns might also improve the efficiency of N-glycosylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462375>Effects of Ginkgo biloba leaves (Ginkgo biloba) and Ginkgo biloba extract on nutrient and energy utilization of broilers.</a></h1><p>An experiment using 112 21-day-old male Arbor Acres broilers that were randomly allocated to 7 treatments with 8 replicates in a completely randomized design was conducted to assess the effects of Ginkgo biloba leaves (Ginkgo biloba, GL) and Ginkgo biloba extract (EGB) on utilization of nutrients of broiler chickens. The dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal based diets: 1) T1, control diet; 2) T2, T1 + 20 g/kg GL; 3) T3, T1 + 40 g/kg GL; 4) T4, T1 + 60 g/kg GL; 5) T5, T1 + 0.4 g/kg EGB; 6) T6, T1 + 0.8 g/kg EGB; and 7) T7, T1 + 1.2 g/kg EGB. Endogenous losses were obtained from another 16 broilers. Excreta samples were collected to analyze the dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), gross energy (GE), and amino acids (AA), and GE was analyzed for computation of AME and TME. As compared with those of the control treatment, the apparent digestibility (AD) and true digestibility (TD) of EE, CP, , Val, Ile, Leu, , Lys, His, and Arg were quadratically (P < 0.05) increased; moreover, the AD and TD of Met was linearly (P < 0.05) increased as the concentration of the EGB in the diet increased. Increasing GL from 0 to 60 g/kg of diet linearly (P < 0.05) increased the AD and TD of EE, , Val, Leu, His, and Met and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase the TME, TMEn, and Arg. Supplementation of EGB increased (P < 0.05) AD and TD of EE, , Val, Ile, Leu, , His, and Arg and tended (0.05 < P < 0.1) to increase Lys as compared with those in the GL-supplemented groups. Dietary supplementation of GL and EGB improved the utilization of nutrients of broiler chickens in a dose-dependent manner, and the optimum supplementation levels of GL or EGB in the diet of broilers was 60 or 0.8 g/kg of diet, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29891674>Mechanism of gasdermin D recognition by inflammatory caspases and their inhibition by a gasdermin D-derived peptide inhibitor.</a></h1><p>The inflammasomes are signaling platforms that promote the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspases-1, -4, -5, and -11. Recent studies identified gasdermin D (GSDMD) as an effector for pyroptosis downstream of the inflammasome signaling . Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases allows its N-terminal domain to associate with membrane lipids and form pores that induce pyroptotic cell death. Despite the important role of GSDMD in pyroptosis, the molecular mechanisms of GSDMD recognition and cleavage by inflammatory caspases that trigger pyroptosis are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the catalytic domains of inflammatory caspases can directly bind to both the full-length GSDMD and its cleavage site peptide, FLTD. A GSDMD-derived inhibitor, -acetyl--Leu--Asp-chloromethylketone (Ac-FLTD-CMK), inhibits GSDMD cleavage by caspases-1, -4, -5, and -11 in vitro, suppresses pyroptosis downstream of both canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes, as well as reduces IL-1β release following activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. By contrast, the inhibitor does not target caspase-3 or apoptotic cell death, suggesting that Ac-FLTD-CMK is a specific inhibitor for inflammatory caspases. Crystal structure of caspase-1 in complex with Ac-FLTD-CMK reveals extensive enzyme-inhibitor interactions involving both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. Comparison with other caspase-1 structures demonstrates drastic conformational changes at the four active-site loops that assemble the catalytic groove. The present study not only contributes to our understanding of GSDMD recognition by inflammatory caspases but also reports a specific inhibitor for these caspases that can serve as a tool for investigating inflammasome signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h1><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, Lys, Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, Lys, , Ser, Tau,  and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and Tyr) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30084996>Amino acid digestibility of corn distillers' dried grains with solubles with the addition of casein in pigs.</a></h1><p>This experiment was conducted to determine the ileal digestibility of CP and AA in casein by regression analysis and to investigate the effects of casein in experimental diets on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) fed to pigs. Twenty barrows (initial BW = 50.5 ± 4.46 kg) surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum were used. Eighteen pigs were assigned to a triplicate 6 × 3 incomplete Latin Square design with 6 diets and 3 periods. Two pigs were used as replacements. Three diets were prepared to contain 60, 100, or 140 g/kg casein to determine the ileal digestibility of CP and AA in casein by regression analysis, and 2 diets were prepared to contain either 480 g/kg DDGS or 308 g/kg DDGS and 60 g/kg casein. Casein and DDGS were the sources of nitrogen (N) in experimental diets. A N-free diet was prepared based on cornstarch and dextrose. Experimental periods consisted of 5 d of adaptation and 2 d of ileal digesta collection periods. The AID of CP and AA in casein linearly increased (P < 0.01) with increasing concentration of casein in the diets. The SID of indispensable AA in casein ranged from 94.7% (SEM = 1.16) for Ile in pigs fed the diet containing 60 g/kg casein to 103.3% (SEM = 2.21) for Arg in pigs fed the diet containing 100 g/kg casein. Except for Arg, pigs fed the diet containing DDGS and casein had greater (P < 0.001) SID of CP and indispensable AA than those fed the diet containing DDGS without casein. The ileal digestibility of indispensable AA in casein determined by regression analysis ranged from 96.8% (SE = 3.14) for  to 103.1% (SE = 4.40) for Arg. The AID and SID of CP and AA for DDGS in the diet containing casein were calculated by difference method using the ileal digestibility of CP and AA in casein determined by regression analysis. The AID of Lys for DDGS in the diet containing casein was greater (P = 0.035) than those without casein; however, the AID of CP and the other indispensable AA, except for Arg, , and Trp, for DDGS in the diet containing casein was less (P < 0.05) than those without casein. The SID of Lys and  for DDGS in the diet containing casein was greater (P < 0.05) than those without casein. In conclusion, improved AA composition in semi-purified experimental diets may affect the SID of AA in low-quality protein ingredients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666040>Peptides as modulators of α-synuclein aggregation.</a></h1><p>α-Synuclein forms amyloid deposits in the dopaminergic neurons; a process that is believed to contribute to the Parkinson's disease. An emerging theme in amyloid research is the hypothesis that the toxic species produced during amyloid formation share common physic-chemical features and exert their effects by common modes. This prompted the idea that molecules able to inhibit a protein aggregation process may cross-react with other amyloidogenic proteins, interfering in their fibrils formation. We investigate the ability of analogues of the heptapeptide H-Arg-Lys-Val-MePhe-Tyr--Trp- OH2, an inhibitor of Aβ-peptide aggregation, to cross-react with α-synuclein interfering with its fibril formation. The influence of the MePhe topography on the interaction with α-synuclein has also been evaluated, replacing the MePhe residue with either  or the conformationally restricted Tic residues. Peptides interact with good affinity with the α-synuclein monomer, promoting its aggregation process. This work provides the basis for the development of new drugs based on peptidomimetics able to modify the oligomers - mature fibrils equilibrium towards this last species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062849>Immune system stimulation induced by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus alters plasma free amino acid flux and dietary nitrogen utilization in starter pigs1.</a></h1><p>Changes in plasma free amino acid (AA) flux reflect the modification of AA  in different  states. Infectious diseases repartition AA away from protein retention toward processes involved in immune defense, thus impacting AA utilization in pigs. The current study sought to evaluate the effects of disease induced by a live pathogen on plasma free AA flux and whole-body nitrogen (N) utilization. Twenty gilts (BW 9.4 ± 0.9 kg) were surgically catheterized into the jugular vein, individually housed in  crates, and feed-restricted (550 g/d). Intramuscular inoculation of a live field strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was used to induce disease. Whole-body N-balance was conducted across 3 d both before PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV-) and also after PRRSV inoculation (PRRSV+). At the end of each N-balance period, a bolus dose of a labeled [U-13C, U-15N]-AA mixture (Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, , , Trp, Val, and Gln) was infused intravenously, followed by serial blood collection for measurement of isotopic enrichment. A double exponential model was fitted with plasma enrichment data for each pig and each AA, and equation parameters were used to estimate plasma free AA flux and pool size. Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dietary N was determined using the slaughter technique and an indigestible marker. Blood chemistry, hematology, body temperature, and serum viremia indicated that PRRSV induced effective immune response in pigs (P < 0.05). Challenge with PRRSV reduced the AID of N (P < 0.05), but had no effect on apparent total tract digestibility of dietary energy (P = 0.12). Plasma flux (µmol/kg BW/h) for Met and  was increased by PRRSV infection (P < 0.05). A strong tendency of increased Val flux was observed in PRRSV+ pigs (P = 0.06). Infection with PRRSV increased the pool size for Lys, Met, , Trp, Leu, Val, and Gln (P < 0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that PRRSV alters the utilization of dietary N and AA flux, as well as pool size, in growing pigs. The increase in  and Met flux in PRRSV+ pigs may be associated with enhanced utilization of these AA for the synthesis of immune system metabolites and increased catabolism of these AA. Thus, dietary Met, , and Val requirements may increase in pigs infected with PRRSV, relative to the requirements for other AA.© The Author(s) 2019.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of herkinorin, a non-opioid μ-opioid receptor agonist derived from salvinorin A, on blood vessels in the rat retina and to investigate the mechanism underlying the herkinorin-induced retinal vasodilatory response. Ocular fundus images were captured using an original high-resolution digital fundus camera in vivo. The retinal vascular responses were evaluated by measuring the diameter of retinal arterioles in the fundus images. Both systemic blood pressure and heart rate were continuously recorded. Herkinorin increased the retinal arteriolar diameter without significantly changing mean blood pressure and heart rate. The retinal vasodilator response to herkinorin was almost completely prevented following treatment with naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist and H-D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn--Pen--NH (CTOP), a selective μ-opioid receptor antagonist. N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a nonselective nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, or indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the herkinorin-induced retinal vasodilator responses. In addition, N-propyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase, diminished the herkinorin-induced retinal vasodilator responses. Seven days after an intravitreal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, loss of inner retinal neurons and abolishment of the retinal vasodilator response to herkinorin were observed. These results suggest that herkinorin dilates rat retinal arterioles through stimulation of retinal μ-opioid receptors. The μ-opioid receptor-mediated retinal vasodilator response is likely mediated by NO generated by neuronal NO synthase. Retinal neurons play an important role in the retinal vasodilator mechanism involving μ-opioid receptors in rats.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The serum concentration (SC) of free AA in pigs can be used as indicators of their availability. This study was conducted with 12 crossbred (Landrace × Hampshire × Duroc) pigs (29.0 ± 2.8 kg initial BW) distributed into 2 groups to analyze the SC of free AA and some AA metabolites in pigs exposed to HS conditions. The treatments were pigs housed under natural HS conditions in a room with no ambient temperature control (23.6 to 37.6°C, HS) and pigs housed at thermoneutral conditions (24 ± 2°C), feed restricted to a level similar to that of their HS counterparts. All pigs received a wheat-soybean meal diet. Blood samples were collected at both the absorptive (2.5 h after a meal) and postabsorptive (10.0 h after a meal) phase. At the absorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, Leu, Lys, , , and Trp were lower ( < 0.05) and the SC of His, Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. At the postabsorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, His, Met, Asn, Gln, and Tyr were higher ( < 0.05) but the SC of Ala was lower ( < 0.01) and the SC of Pro tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The absorptive SC of carnosine, ornithine (Orn), and Tau were lower ( < 0.05) and of citrulline (Cit), cystathionine, and urea tended to be lower ( < 0.10) in HS pigs. The postabsorptive SC of 3-methyl-His, homo-Cys, OH-Lys, and OH-Pro increased ( = 0.05) and of Cit tended to increase ( = 0.10) but that of carnosine and sarcosine ( < 0.05) decreased in HS pigs. The results of this study show a marked and differential effect of HS on the SC of AA. These data indicate that HS negatively affects the digestive and absorptive capacity of pigs and that the  of some AA is modified in pigs to counteract the negative effects of the HS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293707>Viscous and fermentable nonstarch polysaccharides affect intestinal nutrient and energy flow and hindgut fermentation in growing pigs.</a></h1><p>Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of viscosity and fermentability of purified nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) on intestinal nutrient and energy flow and hindgut fermentation in growing pigs. In Exp. 1, 15 ileal-cannulated pigs (50.5 ± 2.9 kg BW) were allotted to 5 diets in a 2-period incompletely randomized design. Pigs were provided a cornstarch N-free diet (CST) or a diet containing 5% inulin (INU), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), or Solka-Floc (SFC). Apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of DM, ash, and GE were greater ( < 0.05) in the MCC and SFC diets than in the INU and CMC diets. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, carbohydrates (CHO), and GE and the DE content in the CST and INU diets were greater ( < 0.01) than in the CMC, MCC, and SFC diets. Hindgut disappearance of DM, CHO, and GE in the INU diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other N-free diets. The ileal endogenous flow of His, Ile, Leu, Met, , Val, and all dispensable AA in the CMC diet was greater ( < 0.05) than in the other diets. In Exp. 2, 6 ileal-cannulated pigs were allotted to 3 diets containing either a corn-soybean meal control diet or the control diet with 5% INU or CMC in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , Ser, , and Val were greater ( < 0.05) in the CMC diet than in the control and INU diets. Incorporation of 5% INU or CMC in the control diet reduced ( < 0.01) the AID of arabinoxylan and insoluble and total NSP. The ATTD of NSP and cellulose and the hindgut disappearance of NSP, β-glucan, and cellulose in the CMC diet were less ( < 0.01) than in the control and INU diets. Inclusion of 5% INU in the diet increased ( < 0.01) hindgut fermentation of insoluble and total NSP compared with the control and CMC diets. In conclusion, depending on the viscosity and fermentability of the NSP, different sources will have different effects on nutrient digestibility and hindgut fermentation. Addition of 5% INU to a corn-soybean meal diet reduced digestibility of the NSP component in the ileum and increased hindgut fermentation of total NSP. In contrast, the inclusion of CMC increased the AID and SID of the diet and reduced total tract digestion and hindgut fermentation of NSP component. Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not recommended as a source of synthetic fiber in a N-free diet to determine the SID of AA of diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25593312>Substrate tRNA recognition mechanism of eubacterial tRNA (m1A58) methyltransferase (TrmI).</a></h1><p>TrmI generates N(1)-methyladenosine at position 58 (m(1)A58) in tRNA. The Thermus thermophilus tRNA() transcript was methylated efficiently by T. thermophilus TrmI, whereas the yeast tRNA() transcript was poorly methylated. Fourteen chimeric tRNA transcripts derived from these two tRNAs revealed that TrmI recognized the combination of aminoacyl stem, variable region, and T-loop. This was confirmed by 10 deletion tRNA variants: TrmI methylated transcripts containing the aminoacyl stem, variable region, and T-arm. The requirement for the T-stem itself was confirmed by disrupting the T-stem. Disrupting the interaction between T- and D-arms accelerated the methylation, suggesting that this disruption is included in part of the reaction. Experiments with 17 point mutant transcripts elucidated the positive sequence determinants C56, purine 57, A58, and U60. Replacing A58 with inosine and 2-aminopurine completely abrogated methylation, demonstrating that the 6-amino group in A58 is recognized by TrmI. T. thermophilus tRNAGGU()GGU() contains C60 instead of U60. The tRNAGGU() transcript was poorly methylated by TrmI, and replacing C60 with U increased the methylation, consistent with the point mutation experiments. A gel shift assay revealed that tRNAGGU() had a low affinity for TrmI than tRNA(). Furthermore, analysis of tRNAGGU() purified from the trmI gene disruptant strain revealed that the other modifications in tRNA accelerated the formation of m(1)A58 by TrmI. Moreover, nucleoside analysis of tRNAGGU() from the wild-type strain indicated that less than 50% of tRNAGG() contained m(1)A58. Thus, the results from the in vitro experiments were confirmed by the in vivo methylation patterns.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25652247>Melanocortin Receptor Agonists Facilitate Oxytocin-Dependent Partner Preference Formation in the Prairie Vole.</a></h1><p>The central melanocortin (MC) system has been widely studied for its effects on food intake and sexual behavior. However, the MC system, and more specifically the MC4 receptor (MC4R), also interacts with neurochemical systems that regulate socioemotional behaviors, including oxytocin (OT) and dopamine. In monogamous prairie voles, OT and dopamine interact to promote partner preference formation, a laboratory measure of an enduring social bond between mates. Here we investigated the effects of MC receptor activation on partner preference formation in prairie voles, as well as the interaction between the MC and OT systems during this process. Peripheral administration of the brain penetrant MC3/4R receptor peptide agonist, Melanotan II (MTII), and the highly selective, small-molecule MC4R agonist, Pf-446687, enhanced partner preference formation in the prairie vole, but not in the non-monogamous meadow vole. MTII-induced partner preferences were enduring, as they were present 1 week after drug manipulation. The prosocial effects of MCR agonists may be mediated, in part, through modulation of OT, as coadministration of an OT receptor antagonist prevented MTII-induced partner preferences. MTII also selectively activated hypothalamic OT neurons and potentiated central OT release. As OT has been shown to enhance some aspects of social cognition in humans, our data suggest that the MC4R may be a viable therapeutic target for enhancing social function in psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, potentially through activation of the OT system.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568365>The efficacy of a new 6-phytase obtained from Buttiauxella spp. expressed in Trichoderma reesei on digestibility of amino acids, energy, and nutrients in pigs fed a diet based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers' dried grains with solubles.</a></h1><p>Sixteen cannulated pigs were used to evaluate the effect of a new 6-phytase derived from Buttiauxella spp. and expressed in Trichoderma reesei on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, N, Ca, P, Na, Mg, K, Cl, and energy. Pigs were fed 4 diets for 2 periods in a crossover design. Within each period, there were 4 blocks of 4 pigs per block with each diet represented within each block. The average initial BW in periods 1 and 2 were 22 and 30 kg, respectively. Each period lasted 9 d with fecal collection on d 5 and 6 and a 12-h ileal digesta collection on d 7, 8, and 9. Pigs received a daily feed allowance of approximately 4.5% of their BW. The experimental diets were based on corn, soybean meal, wheat middlings, and corn distillers dried grain with solubles. Phytase was added at 0; 500; 1,000; or 2,000 phytase units/kg of diet to a basal diet that contained 205, 15, 5.4, and 10 g of CP, Lys, total P (1.6 g of nonphytate P), and Ca/kg diet, respectively. The addition of phytase improved (P < 0.05) AID of DM, N, Ca, and P. Increasing phytase supplementation linearly and quadratically increased (P < 0.05) AID of P and Ca, respectively, with AID of Ca showing a tendency for a linear increase (P = 0.053). Phytase supplementation of the basal diet improved (P < 0.05) AID of P from 46 to 62%. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM, N, Ca, P, Mg, K, and energy. Contrasts showed that phytase supplementation of the basal diet increased (P < 0.05) AID for 8 indispensable AA (Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, , , and Val), 6 dispensable AA (Ala, Asp, Cys, Glu, Ser, and Tyr), as well as for total AA. Furthermore, phytase supplementation to the basal diet showed a tendency (P < 0.10) to increase ileal digestibility of Gly. Ileal digestibility of Met, Trp, and Pro were not affected by phytase supplementation. Increasing the level of phytase supplementation resulted in linear increases (P < 0.05) in AID of 6 indispensable AA (Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, , and Val) and 1 dispensable AA (Asp) with 4 AA (His, Cys, Glu, and Tyr) showing a tendency for linear increase (P < 0.10) in AID of AA. The results from this study showed that in addition to increasing P and Ca utilization, the new Buttiauxella 6-phytase expressed in Trichoderma reesei enhanced ileal digestibility of N and several AA in growing pigs in a dose-dependent manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199802>Effects of phenylalanine and threonine oligopeptides on milk protein synthesis in cultured bovine mammary epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to investigate the effects of phenylalanine () and threonine () oligopeptides on αs1 casein gene expression and milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Primary mammary epithelial cells were obtained from Holstein dairy cows and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium (DMEM/F12) containing lactogenic hormones (prolactin and glucocorticoids). Free  (117 μg/ml) was substituted partly with peptide-bound  (phenylalanylphenylalanine, phenylalanyl threonine, threonyl-phenylalanyl-phenylalanine) in the experimental media. After incubation with experimental medium, cells were collected for gene expression analysis and medium was collected for milk protein or amino acid determination. The results showed that peptide-bound  at 10% (11.7 μg/ml) significantly enhanced αs1 casein gene expression and milk protein synthesis as compared with equivalent amount of free . When 10%  was replaced by phenylalanylphenylalanine, the disappearance of most essential amino acids increased significantly, and gene expression of peptide transporter 2 and some amino acid transporters was significantly enhanced. These results indicate that the  and  oligopeptides are important for milk protein synthesis, and peptide-bound amino acids could be utilised more efficiently in milk protein synthesis than the equivalent amount of free amino acids.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142320>The critical role of porcine cytochrome P450 3A46 in the bioactivation of aflatoxin B.</a></h1><p>Aflatoxin B (AFB) is bioactivated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isoforms in humans to generate the highly reactive epoxide intermediate AFB-8,9-epoxide (AFBO), causing hepatotoxicity and hepatocarcinoma. Due to the unavoidable contamination in their feed, pigs are more likely to be exposed to AFB and indirectly harm human health. Therefore, identifying the porcine CYP3A isoforms involved in AFB-8,9-epoxidation is critical. In this study, we used codon optimization and N-terminal coding sequence modification to modify a CYP3A46 recombinant protein that exhibits good structure and catalytic activities and revealed its strong AFB-8,9-epoxidase activity for the first time. Site-directed mutagenesis, kinetics and docking analyses were performed and demonstrated that residues -108, Ser-119, -215, -304 and -309 play important roles in AFB-8,9-epoxidation and its responsiveness to α-naphthoflavone. Interestingly, we uncovered the dual and reverse roles of -304 in CYP3A46, CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 in AFB oxidation. Unlike the π-π interaction between the -304 phenyl of CYP3A4 and the AFB aromatic ring, -304 of CYP3A46 may function to provide steric hindrance to bind AFB. -108 and -215 could stabilize AFB with a potentially productive orientation through van der Waals interactions with AFB. Ser-119 and -309 are likely to function to form H-bonds with AFB. This study broadens our knowledge of AFB bioactivation in pigs and may contribute to reduce the deleterious effects of AFB in pigs and humans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, the weak binding of Ca/CaM to the human 12 AA cytosolic domain was studied using C-terminal anchored peptides. We now show the binding of N labeled -454 cytosolic domain peptides in solution or membrane anchored using NMR demonstrates a significant role for the lipid bilayer. Although binding is increased by the mutation Phe454Ala, this mutation was previously shown to abrogate actin binding. On the other hand, Ca/CaM binding is abrogated by phosphorylation of nearby -457, a post-translation modification required for actin binding and subsequent in vitro lumen formation. Binding of Ca/CaM to a membrane proximal peptide from the long 72 AA cytosolic domain anchored to lipid nanodiscs was very weak compared to lipid free conditions, suggesting membrane specific effects between the two isoforms. NMR analysis of N labeled Ca/CaM with unlabeled peptides showed the C-lobe of Ca/CaM is involved in peptide interactions, and hydrophobic residues such as Met-109, Val-142 and Met-144 play important roles in binding peptide. This information was incorporated into transmembrane models of CEACAM1 binding to Ca/CaM. The lack of Ca/CaM binding to phosphorylated -457, a residue we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by CaMK2D, also dependent on Ca/CaM, suggests stepwise binding of the cytosolic domain first to Ca/CaM and then to actin.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Metastin and KISS1R are suggested to play crucial roles in regulating the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and continuous administration of metastin derivatives attenuated the plasma testosterone levels in male rats. Our optimization studies of metastin derivatives led to the discovery of 1 (Ac-d-Tyr-d-Trp-Asn---azaGly-Leu-Arg(Me)-Trp-NH, TAK-683), which suppressed plasma testosterone in rats at lower doses than those of leuprolide. Although 1 possessed extremely potent pharmacological activity, 20 mg/mL aqueous solution of 1 has a gel formation property. In order to improve this physicochemical property, we substituted d-Trp at position 47 with a variety of amino acids; we identified that substitution with cyclic amino acids, which could change peptide conformation, retained its potency. Especially, analogue 24 (TAK-448) with trans-4-hydroxyproline (Hyp) at position 47 showed not only superior pharmacological activity to 1 but also excellent water solubility.

Here we apply NMR methods to analyze the interaction between active ERK2 (ppERK2), and a 13-residue F-site-bearing peptide substrate derived from its cellular target, the transcription factor Elk-1. Our results provide detailed insight into previously elusive structural and dynamic features of FRS/F-site interactions and FRS-driven substrate phosphorylation. We show that substrate F-site engagement significantly quenches slow dynamics involving the ppERK2 activation-loop and the FRS. We also demonstrate that the F-site phenylalanines make critical contacts with ppERK2, in contrast to the proline whose cis-trans isomerization has no significant effect on F-site recognition by the kinase FRS. Our results support a mechanism where phosphorylation of the disordered N-terminal phospho-acceptor is facilitated by its increased productive encounters with the ppERK2 active site due to docking of the proximal F-site at the kinase FRS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030428>A retractable lid in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase provides a structural mechanism for activation by apolipoprotein A-I.</a></h1><p>Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport by transferring an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol, promoting the maturation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) from discoidal to spherical particles. LCAT is activated through an unknown mechanism by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and other mimetic peptides that form a belt around HDL. Here, we report the crystal structure of LCAT with an extended lid that blocks access to the active site, consistent with an inactive conformation. Residues -123 and -382 in the catalytic domain form a latch-like interaction with hydrophobic residues in the lid. Because these residues are mutated in genetic disease, lid displacement was hypothesized to be an important feature of apoA-I activation. Functional studies of site-directed mutants revealed that loss of latch interactions or the entire lid enhanced activity against soluble ester substrates, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry revealed that the LCAT lid is extremely dynamic in solution. Upon addition of a covalent inhibitor that mimics one of the reaction intermediates, there is an overall decrease in HDX in the lid and adjacent regions of the protein, consistent with ordering. These data suggest a model wherein the active site of LCAT is shielded from soluble substrates by a dynamic lid until it interacts with HDL to allow transesterification to proceed.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29348648>Specific cyclic ADP-ribose phosphohydrolase obtained by mutagenic engineering of Mn-dependent ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase.</a></h1><p>Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a messenger for Ca mobilization. Its turnover is believed to occur by glycohydrolysis to ADP-ribose. However, ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase (ADPRibase-Mn) acts as cADPR phosphohydrolase with much lower efficiency than on its major substrates. Recently, we showed that mutagenesis of human ADPRibase-Mn at , Leu and Cys alters its specificity: the best substrate of the mutant F37A + L196F + C253A is cADPR by a short difference, Cys mutation being essential for cADPR preference. Its proximity to the 'northern' ribose of cADPR in docking models indicates Cys is a steric constraint for cADPR positioning. Aiming to obtain a specific cADPR phosphohydrolase, new mutations were tested at Asp, Val, Cys and , all near the 'northern' ribose. First, the mutant F37A + L196F + C253G, with a smaller residue 253 (Ala > Gly), showed increased cADPR specificity. Then, the mutant F37A + L196F + V252A + C253G, with another residue made smaller (Val > Ala), displayed the desired specificity, with cADPR k/K ≈20-200-fold larger than for any other substrate. When tested in nucleotide mixtures, cADPR was exhausted while others remained unaltered. We suggest that the specific cADPR phosphohydrolase, by cell or organism transgenesis, or the designed mutations, by genome editing, provide opportunities to study the effect of cADPR depletion on the many systems where it intervenes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535705>Bioremediation of vegetable and agrowastes by Pleurotus ostreatus: a novel strategy to produce edible mushroom with enhanced yield and nutrition.</a></h1><p>Pleurotus ostreatus was grown on paddy straw as well as other vegetable and agricultural wastes i.e. pea pod shell, cauliflower leaves, radish leaves and brassica straw in various combinations with paddy straw. The mushroom did not grow on the vegetable wastes separately. The cumulative yield and biological efficiency of the edible oyster mushroom P. ostreatus grown on substrate containing paddy straw in various combinations with different vegetable wastes i.e. 20% and 30 % vegetable wastes mixed with 80% and 70% (w/w) of paddy straw was found to be better, when compared with yield and biological efficiency obtained on paddy straw (100%) alone. The protein content and six essential amino acid contents (Leu, Ile, Val, , Met, ) showed a significant increase and total sugar and reducing sugar contents showed decrease in the mushroom fruit bodies grown at different combinations of vegetable wastes with paddy straw as compared to paddy straw alone. However, there was not any significant change in moisture content of mushroom cultivated on different groups of wastes. Hence, results of this investigation suggest that the vegetable wastes which are generally left to rot in situ in many cities and villages causing outbreak of diseases can be bioremediated by edible mushroom P. ostreatus.

Metabolomic analysis and a chemometric approach allow description of the  profile of CDCS as compared to normal subjects. In the present work, UHPLC/MS was employed to analyze blood samples withdrawn from CDCS carriers (n=18) and normal parental subjects (n=18), all aged 0-34 years, aiming to set up a representative CDCS profile constructed from 33 targeted amino acids and biogenic amines. Methionine sulfoxide (MetO) was of particular concern with respect to CDCS redox balance. Increased serotonin (3-fold), methionine sulfoxide (2-fold), and Asp levels, and a little lower Orn, citrulline, Leu, Val, Ile, Asn, Gln, Trp, , His, , Met, and creatinine levels were found in the plasma of CDCS patients. Nitrotyrosine and Trp did not differ in normal and CDCS individuals.The accumulated metabolites may reflect, respectively, disturbances in the redox balance, deficient purine biosynthesis, and altered behavior, whereas the amino acid abatement in the latter group may affect the homeostasis of the urea cycle, citric acid cycle, branched chain amino acid synthesis, Tyr and Trp  and amino acid biosynthesis.

The amino acid composition of peptides was also analyzed by amino acid analyzer on the basis of ninhydrin reaction. Three novel peptides with molecular weights of 628.64 Da, 630.71 Da, and 684.1 Da were identified as Asp-His--Lys-Glu (DHTKE), --Glu--His (FFGFN) and Met-Pro-Asp-Ala-His-Leu (MPDAHL), respectively.

However, the function and mechanism of the biological active peptide isolated from bursa on B cell development and autophagy were less reported. In this study, we isolated a new oligopeptide with nine amino acids Leu-Met---Arg-Asn-Glu-Gly- from avian bursa following RP-HPLC, MODIL-TOP-MS, and MS/MS, which was named after BP9. The results of immunization experiments showed that mice injected with 0.01 and 0.05 mg/mL BP9 plus JEV vaccine generated the significant increased antibody levels, compared to those injected with JEV vaccine only. The microarray analysis on the molecular basis of BP9-treated immature B cell showed that vast genes were involved in various immune-related biological processes in BP9-treated WEHI-231 cells, among which the regulation of cytokine production and T cell activation were both major immune-related processes in WEHI-231 cells with BP9 treatment following network analysis. Also, the differentially regulated genes were found to be involved in four significantly enriched  in BP9-treated WEHI-231 cells. Finally, we proved that BP9 induced the autophagy formation, regulated the gene and protein expressions related to autophagy in immature B cell, and stimulated AMPK-ULK1 phosphorylation expression. These results suggested that BP9 might be a strong bursal-derived active peptide on antibody response, B cell differentiation, and autophagy in immature B cells, which provided the linking among humoral immunity, B cell differentiation, and autophagy and offered the important reference for the effective immunotherapeutic strategies and immune improvement.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25784766>Standardized ileal amino acid digestibility of expeller-extracted canola meal subjected to different processing conditions for starter and grower broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>Six expeller-extracted canola meal (ECM) samples produced under different seed conditioning temperatures (90, 95, or 100°C) and screw torques in the second press (low or high) were evaluated in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to determine the effect of processing on standardized ileal amino acid digestibility (SID) in 10 and 24-day-old broilers. A nitrogen-free diet was fed to determine ileal endogenous amino acid flow. Each diet was fed for 5 d to 6 replicate cages of 10 or 7 chicks, and ileal samples were collected at 10 and 24 d, respectively. The endogenous flow (mg/kg DM intake) of CP and all amino acids except Cys decreased (P < 0.01) with age. Conditioning temperature by screw torque interactions were detected (P < 0.05) for apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP, Arg, Ile, Lys, , , Ala, Asp, Glu, Pro ,and Ser at d 10, and the same trend was observed at d 24 except for Ile, , Ala, and Pro (P > 0.05). Meals processed under medium conditioning temperature (95°C) at either low or high screw torque had the greatest (P < 0.05) AID of CP and total amino acids. The SID values followed a similar pattern as AID at both ages. When corrected for endogenous losses, the average AID of total amino acids improved approximately 3.5 and 2.0 units, at 10 and 24 d, respectively. The AID and SID values increased (P < 0.05) with age for most AA, but the effect of age was not consistent between ECMs. A negative correlation was detected between NDF and neutral detergent-insoluble nitrogen (NDIN) content of the meals and SID values of Lys at d 24 (r = -0.79, r = -0.76; P = 0.001, respectively). Processing conditions affected CP and amino acid digestibility, likely because of alterations to the chemical composition of ECM and formation of indigestible complexes of amino acids with fiber. The AID and SID values increased with age independent of meal processing conditions.© 2015 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250878>Postprandial insulin and nutrient concentrations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged growing pigs reared in thermoneutral and high ambient temperatures1.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated effects of ambient temperature and inflammation caused by repeated administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on insulin, energy, and AA . Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, Gln, Ile, Leu, , Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, Arg, Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, , Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0, Gln and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower Gln concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, , and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (Arg, Gln, , and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, structural analysis of the Cry4Ba-receptor-binding domain revealed that its N-terminal subdomain encompasses β2-β3 and β4-β5 hairpins which are stabilized by inter-hairpin hydrogen bonding between (328) in β2 and (369) in β5. Functional importance of these two side-chains was demonstrated by single-Ala substitutions (T328A and T369A), adversely affecting toxin activity against Aedes aegypti larvae. Unlike toxicity restoration of the inactive E417A/Y455A toxin mutated within another receptor-binding subdomain, defective bioactivity of T328A and T369A mutants cannot be restored by Cyt2Aa2 as also observed for β2-β3 (Y332A) and β4-β5 (F364A) loop-mutants. ELISA-based analysis further verified a loss in binding of all four bio-inactive mutants (T328A, Y332A, T369A and F364A) to the immobilized Cyt2Aa2. Protein-protein docking suggested that the two critical loop-residues (Tyr(332) and (364)) correspondingly located at β2-β3 and β4-β5 loops can clearly interact with four counterpart surface-exposed residues of Cyt2Aa2. Altogether, our present data demonstrate structural importance of (328) and (369) toward hydrogen-bonded stabilization of two receptor-binding hairpins (β2-β3 and β4-β5) for synergistic toxicity of Cry4Ba with Cyt2Aa2.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The amino acid consumption and necessary patterns of S. thermophilus T1C2 were investigated in the complete chemically defined medium. For amino acid consumption profiles throughout the growth of S. thermophilus T1C2, the most abundantly consumed amino acids were Gln and Arg, which accounted for 19 and 20% of total amino acids consumed, respectively. Asparagine, , Ser, Ala, Val, Met, Leu, and Lys, consumptions of which ranged from 3 to 10% of total amino acids consumed, were the second most intensively consumed amino acids. For necessary amino acid patterns, the amount of Cys, which counted for 11% of total amino acids needed, was significantly higher than the amounts required for other amino acids in growth of S. thermophilus T1C2. The necessary amounts of Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Arg, Ala, Met, and Tyr ranked second, ranging from 5 to 8% of total amino acids needed. Compared with necessary amounts, the consumption of Asn, , Ser, Gln, Arg, Ala, Val, Leu, Lys, His, and  exceeded the necessary amounts for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 remarkably. Consumption of Gly, Met, Ile, Trp, and Pro was slightly higher than the necessary amounts. Consumption of Asp, Glu, Tyr, and Cys was lower than the necessary amounts. The overall consumption of amino acids exceeded the required amount for growth of S. thermophilus T1C2 almost 2.43 times, which implied a significant nitrogen wasting.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a well-recognized drug target for various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis, was investigated in silico to design potential lead antibodies. Here, crystal structure of IL-6 along with monoclonal antibody olokizumab was explored to predict antigen-antibody (Ag - Ab)-interacting residues using DiscoTope, Paratome, and PyMOL. Tyr56, Tyr103 in heavy chain and Gly30, Ile31 in light chain of olokizumab were mutated with residues Ser, , Tyr, Trp, and . A set of 899 mutant macromolecules were designed, and binding affinity of these macromolecules to IL-6 was evaluated through Ag - Ab docking (ZDOCK, ClusPro, and Rosetta server), binding free-energy calculations using Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzman Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method, and interaction energy estimation. In comparison to olokizumab, eight newly designed theoretical antibodies demonstrated better result in all assessments. Therefore, these newly designed macromolecules were proposed as potential lead antibodies to serve as a therapeutics option for IL-6-mediated diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25886145>N-terminal acetylome analysis reveals the specificity of Naa50 (Nat5) and suggests a kinetic competition between N-terminal acetyltransferases and methionine aminopeptidases.</a></h1><p>Cotranslational N-terminal (Nt-) acetylation of nascent polypeptides is mediated by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). The very N-terminal amino acid sequence largely determines whether or not a given protein is Nt-acetylated. Currently, there are six distinct NATs characterized, NatA-NatF, in humans of which the in vivo substrate specificity of Naa50 (Nat5)/NatE, an alternative catalytic subunit of the human NatA, so far remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively compared the Nt-acetylomes of wild-type yeast S. cerevisiae expressing the endogenous yeast Naa50 (yNaa50), the congenic strain lacking yNaa50, and an otherwise identical strain expressing human Naa50 (hNaa50). Six canonical yeast NatA substrates were Nt-acetylated less in yeast lacking yNaa50 than in wild-type yeast. In contrast, the ectopically expressed hNaa50 resulted, predominantly, in the Nt-acetylation of N-terminal Met (iMet) starting N-termini, including iMet-Lys, iMet-Val, iMet-Ala, iMet-Tyr, iMet-, iMet-Leu, iMet-Ser, and iMet- N-termini. This identified hNaa50 as being similar, in its substrate specificity, to the previously characterized hNaa60/NatF. In addition, the identification, in yNaa50-lacking yeast expressing hNaa50, of Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue such as Ser, , Ala, or Val, revealed a kinetic competition between Naa50 and Met-aminopeptidases (MetAPs), and implied that Nt-acetylated iMet followed by a small residue cannot be removed by MetAPs, a deduction supported by our in vitro data. As such, Naa50-mediated Nt-acetylation may act to retain the iMet of proteins of otherwise MetAP susceptible N-termini and the fraction of retained and Nt-acetylated iMet (followed by a small residue) in such a setting would be expected to depend on the relative levels of ribosome-associated Naa50/NatA and MetAPs.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ARC1 and Exo70A1 function as the downstream targets of the S-locus receptor kinase and play conservative roles in Brassica SI signaling. Based on the sequence homology, Exo70A1 is divided into four subdomains: leucine zipper (Leu(128)-Leu(149)), hypervariable region (Ser(172)-Leu(197)), SUMO modification motif (Glu(260)-Ile(275)), and pfamExo70 domain (His(271)-(627)). ARC1 contains four domains as follows: leucine zipper (Leu(116)-Leu(137)), coiled-coil domain ((210)-Val(236)), U-box (Asp(282)-Trp(347)) motif, and ARM (Ala(415)-(611)) domain. Bioinformatics analysis, yeast two-hybrid screening and pull-down assays show that leucine zipper and coiled-coil motifs of ARC1116-236 are required for the interaction with Exo70A1, while the addition of ARM motif results in loss of the interaction with Exo70A1. Meanwhile, the N-terminal of Exo70A1 without any domains shows a weak interaction with ARC1, and the level of LacZ expression increases with addition of leucine zipper and reaches the maximum value with hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif, indicating that hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif of Exo70A1172-275 is mainly responsible for the binding with ARC1, whereas pfamExo70 domain has little affinity for ARC1. Lys(181) located in the Exo70A1 hypervariable region may be the ubiquitination site mediating the interaction between ARC1 and Exo70A1. Therefore, both the leucine zipper with coiled-coil structure of ARC1116-236, and the hypervariable region and SUMO modification motif of Exo70A1172-275 are the core interaction domains between ARC1 and Exo70A1. Any factors affecting these core domains would be the regulators of ARC1 mediating ubiquitin degradation in self-incompatible system.© The Author 2016.
