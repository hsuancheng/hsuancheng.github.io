Toxicity data included immune-related adverse events (irAEs), need for glucocorticoids, and hospitalization. The associations of toxicity with age, CCI, and ECOG  were evaluated using the exact χ test or Fisher exact test.We included 75 patients (median age: 74 y; range, 70-92 y); 53% had a CCI of 3 or higher; 49% had ECOG  of 2 or higher. Median OS for the whole cohort was 8.2 months (ECOG  -1 vs ≥2: 13.7 vs 3.8 mo; p < .01). Median TTF was 4.2 months (ECOG  -1 vs ≥2: 5.6 vs 2. mo; p = .02). Overall, 37% of patients experienced irAE of any grade (a total of 37 events); 8% were grade 3 or higher (no ICI-related deaths). Of those who discontinued ICIs (N = 64), % were due to irAEs. Of those who experienced irAEs, 64% required glucocorticoids. Hospitalizations during ICI treatment occurred in 72%. Toxicity generally did not differ by age, CCI, or ECOG .Outcomes in our cohort were driven by ECOG  rather than chronological age or comorbidities. The relatively high rates of ICI discontinuation, use of glucocorticoids, and hospitalization during ICI treatment in our study highlight the vulnerability of older adults with advanced NSCLC even in the  era.

As phase III trials include only selected patients, we here investigated the clinical factors associated with efficacy and safety of nivolumab in 'real life' patients with advanced NSCLC.Clinical and histological characteristics, therapies and survival data of all consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC included prospectively and treated by nivolumab in two French academic hospitals between February 2015 and December 2016 were examined.Sixty-seven patients were included, mostly male (69%), current or former smokers (87%) with  <2 (73%). Median age was 68.5 years and 42% were aged ≥70 years. According to uni- and multi-variate analyses, only  2 (OR = .17, 95% CI .03-.99, p = .049) and number of previous treatment lines (OR = .33, 95% CI .13-.85, p = .022) were significantly negatively associated with tumor control. Worse progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly associated with  2 (HR = 5.17, 95% CI 1.99-13.43, p = .001) and use of steroids (HR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.39-7.69, p = .006). Worse overall survival was associated with symptomatic brain metastasis (HR = 3., 95% CI 1.23-8.85, p = .029). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 patients (70%), symptomatic brain metastasis being significantly associated with Grade ≥3 toxicity (OR = 8.13, 95% CI 1.21-55.56, p = .031). Age and nutritional status were not associated with response, PFS, OS or toxicity.Our results suggest that nivolumab is not beneficial or safe for patients with  2 and symptomatic brain metastases.</p></html>
