In particular, we report model complexes of the general formula fac-[M(L)(CO)] (M = Re, Tc, Re) where L denotes NOTA-Pyr (1) or NODAGA-Pyr (2), which are derived from conjugation of NOTA/NODAGA with pyrrolidine (Pyr). Further, as proof-of-principle, we synthesized the peptide bioconjugate NODAGA-sst-ANT (3) and explored its complexation with the fac-[Re(CO)] and fac-[Tc][Tc(CO)] cores; sst-ANT denotes the somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist 4-NO-Phe-c(DCys--DTrp---Cys)-DTyr-NH. Rhenium complexes Re-1 through Re-3 were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically, and receptor binding affinity was demonstrated for Re-3 in SSTR-expressing cells (AR42J, IC = 91 nM). Radiolabeled complexes [Tc]Tc/[Re]Re-1/2 and [Tc]Tc-3 were prepared in high radiochemical yield (>90%, determined by radio-HPLC) by reacting [Tc]/[Re][Tc/Re(OH)(CO)] with 1-3 and correlated well with the respective Re-1 through Re-3 standards in comparative HPLC studies. All radiotracers remained intact through 24 h (Tc-labeled complexes) or 48 h (Re-labeled complexes) against 1 mM l-histidine and 1 mM l-cysteine (pH 7.4, 37 °C). Similarly, rat serum stability studies displayed no decomposition and low nonspecific binding of 9-24% through 4 h. Biodistribution of [Tc]Tc-3 in healthy CF-1 mice demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Rapid clearance was observed within 1 h post-injection, predominantly via the renal system (82% of the injected dose was excreted in urine by 1 h), with low kidney retention (% ID/g: 11 at 1 h, 5 at 4 h, and 1 at 24 h) and low nonspecific uptake in other organs/tissues. Our findings establish NOTA and NODAGA as outstanding BFCs for the fac-[M(CO)] core in the design and development of organometallic radiopharmaceuticals. Future in vivo studies of [Tc]Tc- and [Re]Re-tricarbonyl complexes of NODAGA/NOTA-biomolecule conjugates will further probe the potential of these chelates for nuclear medicine applications in diagnostic imaging and targeted radiotherapy, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668724>The somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 outperforms 64Cu-DOTA-TATE in a mouse xenograft model.</a></h2><p>Copper-64 is an attractive radionuclide for PET imaging and is frequently used in clinical applications. The aim of this study was to perform a side-by-side comparison of the in vitro and in vivo performance of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (NODAGA = 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid,4,7-acetic acid, JR11 = p-Cl-Phe-cyclo(D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(cbm)---Cys)D--NH2), a somatostatin receptor 2 antagonist, with the clinically used sst2 agonist 64Cu-DOTA-TATE ((TATE = D-Phe-cyclo(Cys--D-Trp---Cys)). In vitro studies demonstrated Kd values of 5.7±0.95 nM (Bmax = 4.1±0.18 nM) for the antagonist 64/natCu-NODAGA-JR11 and 20.1±4.4. nM (Bmax = 0.48±0.18 nM) for the agonist 64/natCu-DOTA-TATE. Cell uptake studies showed the expected differences between agonists and antagonists. Whereas 64Cu-DOTA-TATE (the agonist) showed very effective internalization in the cell culture assay (with 50% internalized at 4 hours post-peptide addition under the given experimental conditions), 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 (the antagonist) showed little internalization but strong receptor-mediated uptake at the cell membrane. Biodistribution studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 showed rapid blood clearance and tumor uptake with increasing tumor-to-relevant organ ratios within the first 4 hours and in some cases, 24 hours, respectively. The tumor washout was slow or non-existent in the first 4 hours, whereas the kidney washout was very efficient, leading to high and increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Specificity of tumor uptake was proven by co-injection of high excess of non-radiolabeled peptide, which led to >80% tumor blocking. 64Cu-DOTA-TATE showed less favorable pharmacokinetics, with the exception of lower kidney uptake. Blood clearance was distinctly slower and persistent higher blood values were found at 24 hours. Uptake in the liver and lung was relatively high and also persistent. The tumor uptake was specific and similar to that of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 at 1 h, but release from the tumor was very fast, particularly between 4 and 24 hours. Tumor-to-normal organ ratios were distinctly lower after 1 hour. This is indicative of insufficient in vivo stability. PET studies of 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 reflected the biodistribution data with nicely delineated tumor and low background. 64Cu-NODAGA-JR11 shows promising pharmacokinetic properties for further translation into the clinic.</p></html>
