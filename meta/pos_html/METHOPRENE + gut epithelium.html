A chitin synthase 1 (CfCHS1) cDNA was identified and cloned from the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana. The CfCHS1 cDNA is 5,300 bp in length and codes a 1,564-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 178 kDa. The deduced protein contains 16 transmembrane helixes in its domains A and C. The single copy CfCHS1 gene expressed during each of the larval molts from the 3rd to the 6th instar. The gene expressed highly and periodically in the epidermis during each of molts, whereas no transcripts were detected in the midgut and fat body. 20-hydroxyecdysone and the ecdysone agonist RH5992 suppressed CfCHS1 expression, whereas the juvenile hormone analog  induced CfCHS1 expression. These results implicate that CfCHS1 is involved in the chitin synthase and new chitin formation during molting in the insect.Â© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19072925>Molecular analysis of juvenile hormone analog action in controlling the metamorphosis of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.</a></h2><p>The juvenile hormone analogs (JHA) are known to disrupt insect development but the molecular mechanisms of their action have been studied only in a few model insects belonging to orders Diptera and Lepidoptera. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of JHA action in red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, belonging to the order Coleoptera. Application of JHA during penultimate and final instar larval stages blocked larval-pupal metamorphosis and induced supernumerary larval molts. When compared to the control insects undergoing larval-pupal molt, down-regulation of expression of transcription factor, Broad, and up-regulation of other genes involved in 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) action (FTZ-F1, E74) were observed in JHA-treated larvae undergoing supernumerary larval molts. The presence of JHA during the final instar larval stage blocked the midgut remodeling wherein programmed cell death (PCD) of larval cells and proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells to pupal   were impaired. The comparative analysis of 20E-induced gene expression in the midguts of JHA-treated and control insects revealed that JHA suppressed the expression of EcRA, EcRB, Broad, E74, E75A, and E75B, resulting in a block in PCD as well as proliferation and differentiation of imaginal cells.</p></html>
