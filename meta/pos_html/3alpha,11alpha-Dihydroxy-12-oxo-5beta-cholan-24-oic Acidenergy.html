These dyes capture the importance of (i) the effect and position of branched alkyl groups, (ii) mono- and di-anchoring groups containing dyes, and (iii) further appending the alkyl groups through the cyanoester vinyl unit on the central squaric  units of D-A-D-based cis-configured squaraine dyes. All the above factors govern the controlled self-assembly of the dyes on the TiO surface which helps to broaden the absorption profile of the dyes with an increased energy-harvesting process. With respect to the position of the branched alkyl groups, dye P11 with the sp-C and N-alkyl groups away from the TiO surface showed a better device efficiency of 5.98% ( J of 14.46 mA cm, V of 0.576 V, and ff of 71.8%) than its positional isomer P12 with 3.45% ( J of 8.78 mA cm, V of 0.554 V, and ff of 70.9%). However, with respect to the dyes containing mono- and di-anchoring groups, P13 with two anchoring units exhibited a superior device performance of 7.58% ( J of 17.12 mA cm, V of 0.618 V, and ff of 71.7%) in the presence of optically transparent co-adsorbent CDCA (3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic ) than dyes P11 and P12.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153348>Structure-activity relationships of 3-O-β-chacotriosyl oleanane-type triterpenoids as potential H5N1 entry inhibitors.</a></h1><p>A series of 3-O-β-chacotriosyl oleanolic  analogs have been designed, synthesized and evaluated as H5N1 entry inhibitors based on a small molecule inhibitor saponin 1 previously discovered by us. Detailed structure-activity relationships (SARs) studies on the aglycone of compound 1 indicated that the subtle modification of oleanolic  as an aglycon has key influences on the antiviral activity. These results suggested that either the introduction of a disubstituted amide structure at the 17-COOH of OA or alteration of the C-3 configuration of OA from 3β-to 3α-forms can significantly improve the selective index while maintaining their antiviral activities in vitro. Compound 8 was selected for further mechanistic study because of its distinguished inhibition activity and good selective index. Molecular simulation study and surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed that compound 8 stabilized HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin (HA) by binding with amino  residues LYS-26, ASN-53, ASN-27 and ASN-50, therefore may prevent HA from conformational rearranging, which is a critical step for viral entry.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herein, the FES of unbinding of the antagonist N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan (UniPR129) from its EphA2 receptor was reconstructed by META-D simulations. The characterization of the free- minima identified on this FES proposes a binding mode fully consistent with previously reported and new structure-activity relationship data. To validate this binding mode, new N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to displace ephrin-A1 from the EphA2 receptor. Among them, two antagonists, namely compounds 21 and 22, displayed high affinity versus the EphA2 receptor and resulted endowed with better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than the parent compound. These findings highlight the importance of free- calculations in drug design, confirming that META-D simulations can be used to successfully design novel bioactive compounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303744>Agonism for the bile  receptor GPBAR1 reverses  and vascular damage in a mouse model of steatohepatitis.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the  and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile -activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses  and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses  and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed  injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay.

However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different fat-to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of  and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different fat-to-sugar ratios can both cause  and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate lipid accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584465>Interleukin-4 Boosts Insulin-Induced Energy Deposits by Enhancing Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis in Hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis as the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia, is closely associated with chronic inflammation. We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free   uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the  were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651913>Structure-activity relationships of 3-O-β-chacotriosyl oleanic  derivatives as entry inhibitors for highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus.</a></h1><p>Highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (H5N1) entry is a key target for the development of novel anti-influenza agents with new mechanisms of action. In our continuing efforts to identify novel potential anti-H5N1 entry inhibitors, a series of 3-O-β-chacotriosyl oleanolic  analogs have been designed, synthesized and evaluated as H5N1 entry inhibitors based on two small molecule inhibitors 1 and 2 previously discovered by us. The anti-H5N1 entry activities were determined based on HA/HIV and VSVG/HIV entry assays. Compound 15 displayed the most promising anti-H5N1 entry activities with average IC values of 4.05μM and good selective index (22.9). Detailed structure-activity relationships (SARs) studies suggested that either the introduction of an additional oxo group to position 11 at OA or alteration of the C-3 configuration of OA from 3β- to 3α-forms can significantly enhance the selective index while maintaining their antiviral activities in vitro. Molecular simulation analysis confirmed that the compounds exert their inhibitory activity through binding tightly to hemagglutinin (HA2) protein near the fusion peptide and prevent virus entry.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, with few reported structural studies on PhK inhibitors, this hinders a structure based drug design approach. In this study, the inhibitory potential of 38 indirubin analogues have been investigated. 11 of these ligands had IC50 values in the range 0.170-0.360μM, with indirubin-3'-acetoxime (1c) the most potent. 7-Bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (13b), an antitumor compound which induces caspase-independent cell-death (Ribas et al., 2006 [20]) is revealed as a specific inhibitor of PhK (IC50=1.8μM). Binding assay experiments performed using both PhK-holo and PhK-γtrnc confirmed the inhibitory effects to arise from binding at the kinase domain (γ subunit). High level computations using QM/MM-PBSA binding free  calculations were in good agreement with experimental binding data, as determined using statistical analysis, and support binding at the ATP-binding site. The value of a QM description for the binding of halogenated ligands exhibiting σ-hole effects is highlighted. A new statistical metric, the 'sum of the modified logarithm of ranks' (SMLR), has been defined which measures performance of a model for both the "early recognition" (ranking earlier/higher) of active compounds and their relative ordering by potency. Through a detailed structure activity relationship analysis considering other kinases (CDK2, CDK5 and GSK-3α/β), 6'(Z) and 7(L) indirubin substitutions have been identified to achieve selective PhK inhibition. The key PhK binding site residues involved can also be targeted using other ligand scaffolds in future work.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The objective was to investigate the effect of postruminal Met supply during late pregnancy on 1-carbon, Met cycle, and transsulfuration pathways in the calf liver. During the last 28 d of pregnancy, cows were individually fed a control diet or the control diet plus rumen-protected dl-Met (MET; 0.09% dry matter intake). Liver samples obtained from calves (n = 14/group) at 4, 14, 28, and 50 d of age were used for metabolomics, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity analyses. Genes associated with 1-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation, and the cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine-choline pathway were analyzed via real-time PCR. Activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, cystathionine β-synthase, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) was analyzed using C isotopes. Data were analyzed using a mixed model that included the fixed effects of maternal treatment, day, and their interaction, and the random effect was calf within maternal diet. Calves born to dams offered MET tended to have greater birth body weight and had overall greater body weight during the first 9 wk of life. However, no differences were detected for daily feed intake and average daily gain between groups. Concentrations of betaine and choline, reflecting Met cycle activity, at d 14 through 28 were greater in MET calves. Transsulfuration pathway intermediates also were altered in MET calves, with concentrations of cysteine sulfinic  and hypotaurine (d 4 and 14) and taurine being greater (d 4, 14, 28, and 50). Despite the lack of differences in daily feed intake, the greater concentrations of the tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates fumarate and glutamate along with NAD/NADH in MET calves indicated enhanced rates of energy metabolism. Although activity of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was greater in MET calves at d 14, cystathionine β-synthase was lower and increased at d 14 and 28, where it was greater compared with the control diet. Activity of MTR was lower at d 4 and 50 in MET calves. Among gene targets measured, MET calves had greater overall expression of MTR, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and choline kinase α and β. An interaction of maternal diet by time was detected for mRNA abundance of DNA methyltransferase 3α (involved in de novo methylation) due to greater values at d 4 and 14 in MET calves. Overall, the data indicate that enhanced postruminal supply of Met to cows during late pregnancy may program hepatic metabolism of the calf in the context of maintaining Met homeostasis, phosphatidylcholine and taurine synthesis, DNA methylation, and energy metabolism. These alterations potentially result in better efficiency of nutrient use, hence conferring the calf a physiologic advantage during a period of rapid growth and development. The precise biologic mechanisms remain to be established.The Authors. Published by FASS Inc. and Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Dairy Science Association®.

Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile  metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile . Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to lithocholic  (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic  (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic ) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an  conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile  oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile  metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile  metabolism in the gut.</p></html>
