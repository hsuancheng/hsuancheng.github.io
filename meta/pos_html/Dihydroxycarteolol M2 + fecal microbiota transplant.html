<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924853>Effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics in overweight and obese adults: a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trials.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that modulation of the gut  may contribute to body weight control.This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference in overweight and obese adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/).Five electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library/CENTRAL, LILACS, and Web of Science-were searched from inception to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied.Randomized and quasi-randomized parallel trials that assessed the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics vs any other intervention but bariatric surgery or   in overweight or obese adults were selected.Three teams of 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Data were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.Nineteen randomized trials (28 publications, 1412 participants) were included. There were no differences in mean body weight change [mean difference (MD), -0.54 kg; 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) or mean BMI change (MD, -0.19 kg/; 95%CI, -0.43 to 0.04; I2 = 51%; low quality of evidence) between groups who received probiotics or synbiotics and control groups. Oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced mean waist circumference compared with control (MD, -0.82 cm; 95%CI, -1.43 to -0.21; I2 = 46%; low quality of evidence).The findings suggest that oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics has a small effect to reduce waist circumference but no effect on body weight or BMI, although the quality of evidence is low to moderate. Therefore, the current evidence is not definitive. Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice.PROSPERO registration number CRD42018075126.© The Author(s) 2019.

Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis. Deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal  and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal  was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier, gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal  from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited  phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal  transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover,  depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714029>Involvement of gut  in the association between gastrointestinal motility and 5‑HT expression/ macrophage abundance in the gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Serotonin (5‑hydroxytryptamine; 5‑HT) may be a key player in gastrointestinal (GI) motility and the GI immune system. In the present study, the effect of gut  on the association between GI motility, and 5‑HT expression and macrophage abundance in the GI tract was examined. Germ‑free (GF) mice (6 weeks old) were orally administered a fecal bacterial suspension prepared from specific pathogen‑free mice and their GI tissues were evaluated 4 weeks later. The expression of 5‑HT and mannose receptor (MR) was examined by immunohistochemistry, and GI transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red solution. The numbers of 5‑HT‑positive endocrine cells and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages were significantly increased in the upper GI and colon of GF mice subjected to fecal transplantation (FT) compared with control GF mice without FT. GITT was significantly decreased in GF mice subjected to FT compared with GF mice without FT, and negatively correlated with the numbers of 5‑HT‑positive cells in the upper GI and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages throughout the GI tract. The numbers of 5‑HT‑positive endocrine cells and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages were significantly correlated throughout the GI tract. The present results suggest that the gut  is involved in the association between accelerated GI motility and induction of the 5‑HT/muscularis MR‑positive macrophage axis in the GI tract.</p></html>
