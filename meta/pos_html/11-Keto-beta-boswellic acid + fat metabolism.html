Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), two enzymes involved in the oxygenation of the arachidonic acid, are upregulated in the central nervous system during aging and are associated with different aging-related brain pathologies. The present experiment was performed to study the effects of 5-LOX inhibitor, acetyl- (AKBA), nimesulide (preferential COX-2 inhibitor), and their combination on cognitive performance of young and aged mice, using elevated plus maze test. Chronic administration of AKBA (100 mg/kg, p.o.) and nimesulide (2.42 mg/kg, p.o.) for 15 days significantly reversed the aging-induced retention deficit in mice. Coadministration of AKBA and nimesulide enhanced the cognitive performance in aged mice when compared with that in per se treatment. The aging-related increase in oxidative damage (increased LPO and decreased GSH) was reversed by AKBA, nimesulide, and their combination. Further, per se COX and LOX inhibitors and their combination did not produce any alteration in gastrointestinal parameters; they also reversed the aging-induced motor dysfunction in the aged animals. On the basis of these observations, present findings indicated that the combination of COX and LOX inhibitors (dual inhibitors) may provide a new therapeutic innovation for the treatment of aging-related brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and different motor dysfunctions with adequate gastrointestinal tolerability.(c) 2005 Prous Science.

In vitro studies show concentration dependent linear association of radical scavenging activity of AK which is comparable to ascorbic acid taken as reference compound. For in vivo studies, the animals were divided randomly into five groups which included a) normal control, b) vehicle treated (olive oil), c) BaP treated, d) AK treated and e) AK + BaP (combined treated). BaP was administered at a dose of 50mg/kg in olive oil twice a week orally for 4 weeks and AK (50mg/kg) was given in olive oil thrice a week for 4 weeks before and after BaP exposure. BaP treated animals showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl contents (PCC) in hepatic tissue. Further, a significant increase (p < 0.001) in the liver marker enzymes as well as citrulline and nitric oxide levels in the hepatic tissue was also observed. Interestingly, AK when supplemented to BaP treated animals ameliorated the above said biochemical indices appreciately. The histopathological observations also showed appreciable improvement when BaP treated animals were supplemented with AK, thus emphasing the protective potential of AK.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to test whether B. serrata hydroalcoholic extract (BSE) and its active constituent 3-acetyl-1 1-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) could protect neurons against ischemic condition induced by oxygen, glucose and serum deprivation (OGSD). First, PC12 neural cells were incubated with BSE (0-400 pg/mL) or AKBA (0-40 pg/mL) for 24 h to find non-cytotoxic concentrations of BSE and AKBA. Then, the cells were pre- (for 2 h) and co-treated with 1.5-6 μg/mL BSE or 0.5-2.5 pg/mL AKBA, and then exposed to OGSD condition for 6 h. The IC50. values of BSE and AKBA were 95 and 12.2 μg/mL, respectively. BSE (3 and 6 pg/mL) and AKBA (1 and 2.5 pg/mL) significantly increased viability of ischemic cells, in a concertation-dependent manner. The levels of intracellular oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were also significantly and concentration-dependently decreased following treatment of ischemic cells with BSE or AKBA. Using HPLC analysis, the mount of AKBA in a sample of BSE was found to be 9.2%. In conclusion, B. sernata and AKBA reduce neuronal cell death induced by OGSD and this neuroprotective effect is mediated via attenuation of oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27305832>Nanoparticle formulation of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA): anti-inflammatory activity and in vivo pharmacokinetics.</a></h2><p>The oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia serrata Roxb. (Burseraceae) is widely used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Anti-inflammatory activity of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is impeded by poor oral bioavailability due to its high lipid solubility, rapid phase-1  and poor intestinal permeability.This study developed a poly-dl-lactide-co-glycolide-based nanoparticle formulation of KBA to improve its oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity.KBA was isolated from the oleo-gum resin of B. serrata, and its nanoparticle formulation (KBA-NPs) was prepared by the emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. Oral bioavailability of KBA and KBA-NPs was studied at 50 mg/kg p.o. dose in Sprague-Dawley rats, and further evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema assay at the same dose level.The prepared KBA-NPs had a particle size of 152.6 nm with polydispersity index of 0.194, 79.7% entrapment efficiency and a cumulative 61.5% release of KBA from KBA-NPs, at 72 h. KBA-NPs showed 60.8% inhibition of rat paw oedema at 5 h as compared to 34.9% as that of KBA. The results of oral bioavailability study and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity showed 7- and 1.7-fold increase in bioavailability and anti-inflammatory activity, respectively, of KBA in KBA-NPs as compared to KBA alone.The results of improved oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of KBA-NPs suggested successful development of KBA nanoparticle formulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27494534>Boswellia serrata Protects Against Glutamate-Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis in PC12 and N2a Cells.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to investigate whether the extract from Boswellia serrata oleo-gum resin (BSE) can protect against glutamate-induced oxidative damage and cytotoxicity in PC12 and N2a cell lines. Using a simple and reliable reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the amount of 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) in the BSE was found to be 18.5% w/w. The results confirmed that BSE and AKBA, at concentrations as high as 100 μg/mL or 10 μM, respectively, caused no significant cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Co- and pretreatment with BSE (25-100 μg/mL) or AKBA (5 μM) restored the viability of PC12 and N2a cells under glutamate toxicity (8 mM). Treatment with BSE and AKBA also attenuated the toxic effects of glutamate on intracellular reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and oxidative DNA damage compared with the untreated glutamate-injured cells. Furthermore, BSE and AKBA decreased the apoptotic cell population in the sub-G1 region and the rate of both early and late-stage apoptosis induced by glutamate in the cells. Our data suggest that the protective effects of Boswellia extract and AKBA against glutamate toxicity in PC12 and N2a cells may be mediated through the amelioration of the oxidative stress and the resultant apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17139192>Co-administration of acetyl-, a specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, potentiates the protective effect of COX-2 inhibitors in kainic acid-induced neurotoxicity in mice.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) are responsible for the  of arachidonic acid into inflammatory metabolites, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively. The upregulation of these enzymes in the central nervous system has been demonstrated to be responsible for the increased neuronal vulnerability to degeneration. Kainic acid, a glutamate receptor agonist and responsible for neuronal excitotoxicity and oxidative damage via different mechanisms, is capable of stimulating mRNA of both COX-2 and 5-LOX in the brain. The present study was designed to study the effects of COX inhibitors (indomethacin, nimesulide, rofecoxib) and a 5-LOX inhibitor (acetyl-; AKBA) and the combination of these inhibitors (dual inhibition) on kainic acid induced excitotoxicity and oxidative and nitrosative damage in mice. The results from the present study indicated that AKBA, indomethacin, and nimesulide per se did not produce any change in the behavioural parameters after kainic acid administration; however, rofecoxib per seproduced a significant increase in the latency of clonic (seizure-like) movement and a decrease in mortality rate as compared with kainic acid treated animals. In combination studies AKBA, rofecoxib, and nimesulide produced a more pronounced effect than either of these drugs alone. Further, the effect of AKBA combined with rofecoxib was significantly more marked when compared with AKBA combined with nimesulide. Besides this, identical results were found for the effect of these agents and their combination against oxidative damage induced by kainic acid. These findings indicate the potential role of COX-2 inhibitors and also their combination with the 5-LOX inhibitor in kainic acid induced excitotoxicity and oxidative damage by virtue of their antioxidant effect and suggest the need for the development of dual inhibitors for the treatment of neuronal excitotoxicity.Copyright (c) 2007 S.
