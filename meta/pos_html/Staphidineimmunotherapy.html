<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681606>The Controversial Role of PD-1 and Its Ligands in Gynecological Malignancies.</a></h1><p>The programmed death-1 (PD-1, CD279) receptor with its ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, B7-H1), and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2, CD273, B7-DC), are the key players of one of the immune checkpoint pathways inhibiting T-cell activation. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed in different cancer cells and their microenvironment, including infiltrating immune cells. However, their prognostic value is still debated and their role in the tumor microenvironment has not been fully elucidated yet. Considering the importance that cancer  with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies gained in several tumor types, in this review article we aim to discuss the role of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 axis in gynecological cancers. PD-1 ligands have been detected in ovarian, cervical, vulvar and uterine cancers, and correlation with prognosis seems dependent from their distribution. About PD-L2, very few reports are available so far in gynecological malignancies, and its role is still not completely understood. Clinical trials using anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, but not anti-PD-L2, are currently ongoing, in all types of gynecological cancers. They have shown good safety profiles in a certain cohort of patients, but response rates remain low and many aspects remain controversial. In this review, we propose possible solutions to enhance the clinical efficacy of PD-1 axis targeting therapies. Regarding PD-L2, it might be useful to better clarify its role in order to improve the efficiency of  in female malignancies.Copyright © 2019 Marinelli, Annibali, Aguzzi, Tuyaerts, Amant, Morelli, Santoni, Amantini, Maggi and Nabissi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671640>Transcutaneous Delivery of Immunomodulating Pollen Extract-Galactomannan Conjugate by Solid-in-Oil Nanodispersions for Pollinosis .</a></h1><p>Japanese cedar pollinosis is a type I allergic disease and has already become a major public health problem in Japan. Conventional subcutaneous  (SCIT) and sublingual  (SLIT) cannot meet patients' needs owing to the side effects caused by both the use of conventional whole antigen molecules in the pollen extract and the administration routes. To address these issues, a surface-modified antigen and transcutaneous administration route are introduced in this research. First, the pollen extract (PE) was conjugated to galactomannan (PE-GM) to mask immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding epitopes in the PE to avoid side effects. Second, as a safer alternative to SCIT and SLIT, transcutaneous  (TCIT) with a solid-in-oil (S/O) nanodispersion system carrying PE-GM was proposed. Hydrophilic PE-GM was efficiently delivered through mouse skin using S/O nanodispersions, reducing the antibody secretion and modifying the type 1 T helper (Th1)/ type 2 T helper (Th2) balance in the mouse model, thereby demonstrating the potential to alleviate Japanese cedar pollinosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679220>The Importance of Cancer Stem Cells in Gastrointestinal Cancers.</a></h1><p>Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are still an important cause of tumor-related deaths. Conventional therapeutic approaches like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are indispensable but insufficient. Despite the advances in  and other conventional treatment strategies, some might argue that we are still far from curing cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) might be to blame. Because sequencing technologies are moving fast in this precision-medicine era, molecular testing of tumors, circulating tumor cells, and CSCs have important implications for treatment decisions. Biomarkers offer prognostic values and targeted therapy availabilities as molecular predictive factors. CSCs are considered biomarkers of tumorigenesis development, metastasis, and recurrence. In this review, we summarize the important issues over CSCs and the development of new drugs that target GI CSCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680691>Anti-regulatory T cells are natural regulatory effector T cells.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h1><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive  75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of inflammation and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681766>Doxycycline Inducible Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Targeting CD147 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy.</a></h1><p>Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy to hematological malignancies has demonstrated tremendous clinical outcomes. However, the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells in solid tumors remains limited due to the scarcity of tumor-specific antigen targets and the poor infiltration of CAR-T cells into tumor tissue. In this study, we developed a novel inducible CAR-T cell system which targets CD147, a tumor-associated antigen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To minimize potential toxicities of CAR-T cell therapy, the Tet-On 3G system was introduced to induce CD147CAR expression in the right place at the right time. Specifically, Tet-CD147CAR lentiviral vector (LV-Tet-CD147CAR) was constructed, which comprised CD147CAR controlled by the Tet-On system. Tet-CD147CART cells were successfully generated from activated T cells by infection with LV-Tet-CD147CAR. Proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion of Tet-CD147CART cells were significantly increased against CD147-positive cancer cells in the presence of doxycycline (Dox) compared to Tet-CD147CART cells in the absence of Dox and PBMCs. Consistently,  studies indicated that the tumor growth in nude mice was significantly inhibited by (Dox+) Tet-CD147CART cells through multiple intratumoral administration. Taken together, our results indicated that the expression and activity of CD147CAR were controlled by Dox both  and , which facilitated decreased toxicity and adverse effects to CAR-T cell therapy. Moreover, this study provides viable evidence in support of the potential benefits and translation of this strategy of CAR-T cells targeting CD147 for the treatment of patients with HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Wei, Liu, Yong, Wei, Zhang, Lv, Zhang, Chen and Bian.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659324>The impact of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay on genetic disease, gene editing and cancer .</a></h1><p>Premature termination codons (PTCs) can result in the production of truncated proteins or the degradation of messenger RNAs by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Which of these outcomes occurs can alter the effect of a mutation, with the engagement of NMD being dependent on a series of rules. Here, by applying these rules genome-wide to obtain a resource called NMDetective, we explore the impact of NMD on genetic disease and approaches to therapy. First, human genetic diseases differ in whether NMD typically aggravates or alleviates the effects of PTCs. Second, failure to trigger NMD is a cause of ineffective gene inactivation by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Finally, NMD is a determinant of the efficacy of cancer , with only frameshifted transcripts that escape NMD predicting a response. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the rules of NMD into clinical decision-making. Moreover, they suggest that inhibiting NMD may be effective in enhancing cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683170>Potential role of microbiome in oncogenesis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targeting for head and neck cancer.</a></h1><p>In the last decade, human microbiome research is rapidly growing involving several fields of clinical medicine and population health. Although the microbiome seems to be linked to all sorts of diseases, cancer has the biggest potential to be investigated. Following the publication of the National Institute of Health - Human Microbiome Project (NIH-HMP), the link between Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and microbiome seems to be a fast-moving field in research area. However, robust evidence-based literature is still quite scarce. Nevertheless the relationship between oral microbiome and HNC could have important consequences for prevention and early detection of this type of tumors. The aims of the present review are: (i) to discuss current pre-clinical evidence of a role of oral microbiome in HNC; (ii) to report recent developments in understanding the human microbiome's relationship with HNC oncogenesis; (iii) to explore the issue of treatment response and treatment toxicity; (iv) to describe the role of microbiota as potentially modifiable factor suitable for targeting by therapeutics. Further studies are needed to better establish the causal relationship between oral microbiome and HNC oncogenesis. Future trials should continue to explore oral microbiome in order to build the scientific and clinical rationale of HNC preventative and ameliorate treatment outcome.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The management of recurrences remains unsettled and may entail repeat SBRT, conventionally fractionated external beam RT (EF-EBRT), chemotherapy or surgery. Most patients with local recurrences [within the initial planning target volume (PTV)] can be salvaged successfully with good cancer specific survival. Nonetheless, proximity of the initial SBRT delivery to organs at risk (ribs, blood vessels, airways) may make retreatment more difficult. With attention to detail and careful patient selection, both surgery and reirradiation can be performed safely and effectively. Strategies for management of regional (nodal) recurrences may require conventional therapies tailored to the patterns of failure. The role of  in salvage has not been elucidated as yet.

However, the clinical relevance of immune environment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. Here, the immune profile and its clinical response in HCC were investigated. The gene expression profiles of 569 HCCs from three cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA,  = 257; Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO,  = 170; International Cancer Genome Consortium, ICGC,  = 142) were used in the current study. Five gene expression subtypes (C1-C5) responsible for global immune genes were identified in HCCs at stage I/II. It was found that subtype C4 was associated with upregulation and subtype C5 was associated with downregulation of immune profiles in most metagenes. Immune-correlation analysis of the five subtypes demonstrated that C3 and C4 had higher immune score and better prognostic outcome, as compared with other subtypes. Moreover, the mutation frequencies of TP53, CTNNB1, and AXIN1 had significant difference in the five subgroups. Further, the expression of PDCD1, CD274, PDCD1LG2, CTLA4, CD86, and CD80 was higher in subtype C4 in comparison with the other subtypes. The WGCNA of immune-related genes in the five subtypes revealed that blue and turquoise modules were positively correlated with subtype C4 and were associated with 12 common pathways in the KEGG database. These results were validated in external cohorts from the NCI (National Cancer Institute) cohort (GSE14520) and the ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium) cohort. In summary, one immune-enhanced subtype and one immune-decreased subtype having different immune and clinical characteristics may provide guidance for developing novel treatment strategies for immune system malfunction-related cancer.Copyright © 2019 Li, Wang, Ma, Zhang, Ou-yang, Qi and Liu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659278>A multicenter analysis of genomic profiles and PD-L1 expression of primary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung.</a></h1><p>To understand the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis of pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma and explore potential therapeutic strategies, we investigated the genomic profiles and PD-L1 expression of 29 Chinese pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma patients at various stages. We performed capture-based targeted sequencing on tissue samples collected from 27 patients with sufficient samples using a panel consisting of 520 cancer-related genes, spanning 1.64 Mb of the human genome. We identified 184 somatic mutations in 109 genes from 26 patients. One patient had no mutations detected by this panel. Copy number variations were detected in 52% (14/27) of the patients, with a majority having advanced-stage disease (10/14). Except for the detection of ERBB2 amplification and KRAS mutation in two patients, no other classic lung cancer driver mutations were detected. Interestingly, 78% (21/27) of the patients had mutations in epigenetic regulators. Of the 184 mutations identified, 51 occurred in 29 epigenetics-related genes. Furthermore, we performed PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining using the Dako 22C3 assay and demonstrated that 69% (20/29) of the cohort had positive PD-L1 expression, of which three patients received and benefited from a PD-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, we elucidated a distinct genomic landscape associated with pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma with no classic lung cancer driver mutation but an enrichment of mutations in epigenetic regulators. The detection of high PD-L1 expression and lack of any canonical druggable driver mutations raises the potential of checkpoint  for pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681613>Targeting the Immune Microenvironment in the Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly aggressive solid tumor, with a 5-year mortality rate of ~50%. The development of immunotherapies has improved the survival of patients with HNSCC, but, the long-term prognosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC remains poor. HNSCC is characterized by intratumoral infiltration of regulatory T cells, dysfunctional natural killer cells, an elevated Treg/CD8 T cell ratio, and increased programmed cell death ligand 1 protein on tumor cells. This leads to an immunocompromised niche in favor of the proliferation and treatment resistance of cancer cells. To achieve an improved treatment response, several potential combination strategies, such as increasing the neoantigens for antigen presentation and therapeutic agents targeting components of the tumor microenvironment, have been explored and have shown promising results in preclinical studies. In addition, large-scale bioinformatic studies have also identified possible predictive biomarkers of HNSCC. As  has shown survival benefits in recent HNSCC clinical trials, a comprehensive investigation of immune cells and immune-related factors/cytokines and the immune profiling of tumor cells during the development of HNSCC may provide more insights into the complex immune microenvironment and thus, facilitate the development of novel immunotherapeutic agents.Copyright © 2019 Wang, Chan and Cho.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672770>Pan-Tumor Pathologic Scoring of Response to PD-(L)1 Blockade.</a></h1><p>Pathologic response assessment of tumor specimens from patients receiving systemic treatment provide an early indication of therapeutic efficacy and predict long-term survival. Grading systems for pathologic response were first developed for chemotherapy in select tumor types. Immunotherapeutic agents have a mechanism of action distinct from chemotherapy and are being used across a broad array of tumor types. A standardized, universal scoring system for pathologic response that encompasses features characteristic for  and spans tumor types is needed.Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from neoadjuvant surgical resections and on-treatment biopsies were assessed for features of immune-related pathologic response (irPR). 258 specimens from patients with 11 tumor types as part of ongoing clinical trials for anti-PD-1 were evaluated. An additional 98 specimens from patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 in combination with other treatments were also reviewed, including those from three additional tumor types.Common irPR features (immune activation, cell death, tissue repair, regression bed) were present in all tumor types reviewed, including melanoma, non-small cell lung, head and neck squamous cell, Merkel cell, and renal cell carcinoma, amongst others. Features were consistent across primary tumors, lymph nodes, and distant metastases. Specimens from patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 in combination with another agent also exhibited irPR features.irPR features are consistent across tumor types and treatment settings. Standardized, pan-tumor immune-mediated pathologic response criteria (irPRC) are defined and associated specimen-handling considerations are described.

Although cancer cells contain supra-normal concentrations of cytoplasmic DNA, they rarely produce type I IFN spontaneously. This suggests that defects in the DNA-sensing pathway may serve as an immune escape mechanism. We find that cancer cells produce cGAMP that is transferred via gap junctions to tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which respond by producing type I IFN in situ. Cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS, but not STING, promotes infiltration by effector CD8 T cells and consequently results in prolonged survival. Furthermore, cGAS-expressing cancers respond better to genotoxic treatments and . Thus, cancer-cell-derived cGAMP is crucial to protective anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity. Consequently, cancer-cell-intrinsic expression of cGAS determines tumor immunogenicity and makes tumors hot.

NLRP3 inflammasome provides a first-line defense in viral infections, and, accordingly, gain-of-function variants in NLRP3 have been associated with protection against HIV-1. Despite antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV+ patients continue to present systemic inflammation with a heterogeneous prognosis. As NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in several chronic diseases by amplifying "sterile" inflammation, its role in chronic phase of HIV infection has been postulated. Little is known about inflammasome genetics in HIV+ patients and whether it may play a role in the different clinical outcomes. Therefore, we questioned whether NLRP3 inflammasome genetics could affect the clinical course of HIV-1 infection as it does in host/virus interaction. For this purpose, we analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ART-treated HIV+ patients (n = 300), in Long Term Non-Progressors/Elite Controllers and progressors (n = 133), and in HIV+ individuals submitted to dendritic cell (DC)-based  (n = 19). SNPs leading to increased activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are beneficial for patients, while SNPs that negatively affect NLRP3 activation or IL-18 production, detrimental. In contrast, gain-of-function variant in IL1B is also detrimental for patients, suggesting that while IL-1ß possible contributes to immune exhaustion, the axis NLRP3-inflammasome/IL-18 could act positively in chronic infection. Functional assays supported genetic results: NLRP3 variants associated with good quality HIV+ DC, and IL1B -511C > T with a poor one. Loss-of-function SNPs affect HIV+ T cells proliferation. These findings proposed for the first time that NLRP3 inflammasome, mainly through IL-18, play a protective role in chronic HIV infection.Copyright © 2018.

While their mechanism of action is still not fully elucidated, vesicles secreted by MSCs are believed to recapitulate their therapeutic potentials to some extent. Microvesicles (MVs), also called as microparticles or ectosome, are among secreted vesicles that could transfer cytoplasmic cargo, including RNA and proteins, from emitting (source) cells to recipient cells. Given the importance of MVs, we here attempted to establish a method to isolate and characterize MVs secreted from unmodified human bone marrow derived MSCs (referred to as native MSCs, and their microvesicles as Native-MVs) and IFNγ stimulated MSCs (referred to as IFNγ-MSCs, and their microvesicles as IFNγ-MVs). We first describe an ultracentrifugation technique to isolate MVs from the conditioned cell culture media of MSCs. Next, we describe characterization and quality control steps to analyze the protein and RNA content of MVs. Finally, we examined the potential of MVs to exert immunomodulatory effects through induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs).

Herein, a hydrogen bond/electrostatic-assisted co-assembly strategy was smartly exploited to uniformly incorporate polymer-coated CD into ordered mesoporous silica framework (CD@MSN). The obtained CD@MSN were not only biodegradable via the framework-incorporated CD-induced swelling, but also capable of gathering dispersive CD with enhanced photothermal effect and elevated targeting accumulation, which therefore can achieve photothermal imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) in vitro and in vivo. Much interestingly, benefiting from the biodegraded debris, it was found that CD@MSN-mediated PTT can synergistically achieve immune-mediated inhibition of tumor metastasis via stimulating the proliferation and activation of NK cells and macrophages, and simultaneously up-regulating the secretion of corresponding cytokines (IFN-γ and Granzyme B).

In this study we examined clinical parameters  that may impact cell therapy efficacy.MAPC were infused through varying gauged needles and catheters with and without chlorhexidine, and their viability tested with trypan blue exclusion. MAPC were co-cultured with phenytoin and celecoxib at relevant clinical concentrations for 1 h and 24 h. Anti-inflammatory potency was tested using a stimulated rat splenocyte co-culture and ELISA for TNF-α production. MAPC were cultured under different osmolar concentrations and stained with propidium iodide for viability. Anti-inflammatory potency was tested by co-culture of MAPC with naïve lymphocytes activated by CD3/CD28 beads, and Click-iT® Plus EdU was used to quantify proliferation by flow cytometry.The mean viability of the MAPC infused via needles was 95 ± 1%; no difference was seen with varying flow rate, but viability was notably reduced by chlorhexidine. MAPC function was not impaired by co-culture with phenytoin, celecoxib, or combination with both. Co-culture with phenytoin showed a decrease in TNF-α production as compared to the MAPC control. MAPC cultured at varying osmolar concentrations all had viabilities greater than 90% with no statistical difference between them.

Immune "checkpoint inhibition" provides promise for prolonged disease-free patient survival. Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer has coincided with the onset of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are caused by a break in host self-tolerance, which can be deadly. Acute management of irAEs is complicated by difficulty making a prompt clinical diagnosis. The goal is to maximize anticancer benefit while minimizing irAE risk. We currently lack diagnostic tools to assess pretreatment irAE risk and facilitate diagnosis. Current immunologic understanding of irAEs is discussed with an emphasis on how patients with congenital syndromes of T-cell activation may inform this understanding.

Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report 2 patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response.

Most recently the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) resulted in improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Recent randomized studies examining both consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ES-SCLC have impacted the utilization of these interventions. The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the front-line setting may also further impact the role of radiotherapy in this disease. In this article, we review the current evidence supporting thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC and discuss the promising therapeutic implications of thoracic radiation in light of the inclusion of ICIs.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing  and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells.

We assessed correlation between HCV-cAg and HCV RNA in serum samples with low viral loads and analyzed the performance of HCV-cAg assay in determining diagnosis and treatment outcomes in chronic hepatitis C patients. Both HCV RNA and HCV-cAg were detected for 2298 serum samples. Correlation analysis was performed between the two tests. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to assess value of HCV-cAg test in determining diagnosis and response outcomes at the different HCV RNA thresholds. The two tests were correlated very well, and moreover, correlation in the low viral load group was higher than that in the high viral load group (r value: 0.901 and 0.517). Positive agreement of HCV-cAg ≥ 3 fmol/L was as high as 97.0% for HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL, and its negative agreement for HCV RNA < 15 IU/mL was up to 98.9% in all samples. Area under ROCs ranged from 0.939 to 0.992, regardless of HCV RNA thresholds. When lower limit of detection of HCV RNA was 15, 100 or 1000 IU/mL, positive predictive value of HCV-cAg was 96.8%, 98.8% or 92.4%, and its negative predictive value was 87.0%, 89.9% or 98.3%, respectively, on the basis of different cutoff values.

The principal site where cell-cell adhesion occurs, encompasses a Trp2 found at the N-terminal region of the protein. Herein, we employed the naturally exposed highly conserved peptide Asp1-Trp2-Val3-Ile4-Pro5-Pro6-Ile7, as epitope to prepare synthetic antibodies based on molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (MIP-NPs), to recognize cadherins. Since these highly selective 47 nm-sized particles target exactly the site responsible for adhesion, they were more potent than commercially available therapeutic antibodies, for inhibiting cell-cell adhesion in cell aggregation assays, and for completely disrupting three-dimensional tumor spheroids as well as inhibiting invasion of human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells.

Increasing antibiotic resistance has severely limited treatment options. A mechanism that Neisseria gonorrhoeae uses to evade complement attack is binding of the complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein (C4BP). We screened 107 PorB1a and 83 PorB1b clinical isolates randomly selected from a Swedish strain collection over the last 10 years and noted that 96/107 (89.7%) PorB1a and 16/83 (19.3%) PorB1b bound C4BP; C4BP binding significantly correlated with the ability to evade complement-dependent killing (r = 0.78; p<0.0001). We designed two chimeric proteins that fused C4BP domains to the backbone of immunoglobulins IgG or IgM (C4BP-IgG; C4BP-IgM) with the aim of enhancing complement activation and killing of gonococci. Both proteins bound gonococci (Kd C4BP-IgM = 2.4 nM; Kd C4BP-IgG 981 nM), but only hexameric C4BP-IgM efficiently out-competed heptameric C4BP from bacterial surface resulting in enhanced complement deposition and bacterial killing. Furthermore, C4BP-IgM significantly attenuated the duration and burden of colonization of two C4BP-binding gonococcal isolates, but not a C4BP non-binding strain in the mouse vaginal colonization model using human factor H/C4BP transgenic mice.

Management of patients with anti-NMDAr encephalitis is based on etiologic treatment with  and removal of the associated tumor, if any. However, these catatonic patients may have variable responses to etiologic treatment, sometimes with refractory catatonic symptoms, which attests to the necessary urgency to know how to manage these patients. In the clinical setting, physicians appear to be using guidelines originally created to the management of catatonia due to primary psychiatric conditions.

Recently, a lot of effort has been put into assessing the potential of gram-positive strains such as lactic acid bacteria for new applications in the production of heterologous proteins. Ama r 2 is a respiratory allergen from Amaranthus retroflexus, whose recombinant production in the probiotic host could be introduced as a specific and effective way to rapid diagnosis and  of this allergy. Consequently, the production of this recombinant protein using the prokaryotic system, requires a suitable SP to protect disulfide bonds and to prevent misfolding. This study was designed to predict the best SPs for the expression of Ama r 2 protein in Lactococcus lactis as the host. In this study, 42 signal sequences were selected from SP databases and the most important features of them were evaluated. First, n, h and c regions of the SPs and their probabilities were investigated by signalP software version 4.1. Then, their physicochemical properties were evaluated by Portparam and SOLpro.

These small vesicles are considered to be novel cross-talk circuits established by tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Previous studies have shown certain biological influence of exosomal programmed cell-death ligand 1 (Exo-PD-L1) on immune suppression and dysfunction. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of Exo-PD-L1 and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and explore the concordance between Exo-PD-L1 and PD-L1 expression in matched tumor tissues in NSCLC patients.85 consecutive patients from April 2017 to December 2017 at General Hospital of Eastern Command Theatre who were primarily diagnosed with NSCLC and 27 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of whole blood samples were collected from each participant and further centrifuged. Exosomes were derived from serum using the commercial kit (Total Exosome Isolation Kit), which was further identified by Western blotting analysis (CD63/TSG101), transmission electron microscope analysis (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Exosomes were next solubilized for Exo-PD-L1 detection by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). PD-L1 expression in matched tissue were assessed by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) (clone 28-8) assay. Tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% was deemed as "positive" in this study and TPS < 1% was deemed as "negative". Written informed consent were obtained before acquisition of all data and biological sample. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and Graphpad Prism 5 software. Chi square test was conducted to estimate the correlation between Exo-PD-L1 levels, sPD-L1 levels, PD-L1 IHC profiles and clinicopathological features. For all analysis, a two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant statistically.Exo-PD-L1 levels were higher in NSCLC patients with advanced tumor stage, larger tumor size (> 2.5 cm) (p < 0.001), positive lymph node status (p < 0.05) and distant metastasis (p < 0.05). In contrast, sPD-L1 levels were not different between NSCLC patients and healthy donors, it was not correlated with any clinicopathologic features except for tumor size (> 2.5 cm) (p < 0.05). In addition, Exo-PD-L1 levels showed slight correlation with sPD-L1 levels (Spearman's correlation at r = 0.3, p = 0.0027) while no correlation with PD-L1 IHC profiles was detected.In conclusion, Exo-PD-L1, but not sPD-L1, was correlated with NSCLC disease progression, including tumor size, lymph node status, metastasis and TNM stage.

However, immune checkpoint blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more immune modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T cell to respond to the anti-PD-1 . Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T-cell reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T-cell inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676276>Establishment of a simple and efficient platform for car-t cell generation and expansion: from lentiviral production to in vivo studies.</a></h1><p>Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has shown impressive response rates for the treatment of CD19 + B-cell malignancies in numerous clinical trials.

However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.84-2.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675543>The clinical significance of soluble PD-1 and PD-L1 in lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Soluble PD-1 and PD-L1 are detected in the serum and plasma of lung cancer patients.

There is a need to better understand how cytokines like IL-27, IL-30, and IL-35 interact with one another, and how a developing tumor can exploit these interactions to enhance immune suppression. Current cytokine-based immunotherapies are associated with cytotoxic side effects which limits the success of treatment. In addition to this toxicity, understanding the complex interactions between immune and cancer cells may be one of the greatest challenges to developing a successful . In this review, we bring forth IL-27, IL-30, and IL-35, "sister cytokines," along with more recent additions to the IL-12 family, which serve distinct purposes despite sharing structural similarities. We highlight how these cytokines function in the tumor microenvironment by examining their direct effects on cancer cells as well their indirect actions via regulatory functions of immune cells that act to either instigate or inhibit tumor progression. Understanding the context dependent immunomodulatory outcomes of these sister cytokines, as well as their regulation within the tumor microenvironment, may shed light onto novel cancer therapeutic treatments or targets.Copyright © 2019 Kourko, Seaver, Odoardi, Basta and Gee.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663296>Helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases.</a></h1><p>Despite advances in chemotherapy, curing multiple liver metastases is quite rare. Even when response is obtained, regrowth of the tumors is almost inevitable. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases.Forty-five patients with chemo-refractory multiple (3-10) liver metastases after standard systemic chemotherapy entered the single-institutional prospective study. Liver metastases were the major disease; however, 31 also had uncontrolled primary lesions and/or other metastases. The prescribed dose was 55 Gy in 25 fractions. The median planning target volume (PTV) and normal liver volume (NLV) of first treatment were 128 cm and 1175 cm , respectively. The median of V , V , and mean dose to NLV were 45%, 23%, and 19.4 Gy, respectively.Forty-two patients (93%) completed the planned treatment. Median survival time (MST) for all patients was 8 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 29%. The median local control (LC) period was 5 months and the 6-month control rate of irradiated tumors was 33%. A ≥30% decrease in tumor markers was observed in 31%. The most common grade 3 toxicity was lymphocytopenia (40%), followed by fatigue (6%). Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) was not observed. Pancreatic cancer as the primary tumor, distant metastases outside the liver, low pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and low pretreatment monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were associated with poorer prognoses.Helical tomotherapy for chemo-refractory multiple liver metastases is a feasible and potentially effective treatment. Incorporating tomotherapy into the first-line treatment in combination with systemic chemotherapy should be considered.CROG 12005.© 2019 The Authors.

Oncoproteins are up-regulated under various stress conditions and promote cell survival. Oncoproteins and their immunogenic domains could serve well as tumour vaccines and prime the hosts' active anti-tumour immunity.Proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify potential tumour associated antigens (TAAs). Then, peptides derived from CD151 were designed and synthesized according to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I binding and immunogenicity. Cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging were performed to assess the active anti-tumour immunity triggered by CD151 peptides in H22 primary hepatoma and experimental 4T1 breast cancer lung metastasis models.CD151 was identified as an ideal TAA based on proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. CD151 peptides as tumour vaccines triggered active anti-tumour immunity against H22 hepatoma and the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer in two mouse models through the activation of CD8IFNγ lymphocytes and the subsequent targeted cytotoxicity. Further, the peptides suppressed the negative regulators, myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Survival was prolonged for mice with lung metastases from CD151 peptide-immunised groups.The up-regulated oncoproteins in 8 Gy-irradiated tumour cells are good candidates for designing immunogenic peptides as tumour vaccines. Anti-tumour active immunity primed by peptides from CD151 may be an effective and safe approach to suppress cancer progression.Copyright © 2019.

Targeting an appropriate B cell epitope in pathological tau could in theory produce an effective reduction of pathology without disrupting the function of normal native tau. Recent data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tau (aa 2-18), termed the "phosphatase activation domain (PAD)", is hidden within native Tau in a 'paperclip'-like conformation. Conversely, PAD is exposed in pathological tau and plays an essential role in the inhibition of fast axonal transport and tau polymerization. Thus, we hypothesized that anti-tau2-18 antibodies may safely and specifically reduce pathological tau and prevent further aggregation, which in turn would neutralize tau toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of our MultiTEP platform-based vaccine targeting tau2-18 formulated with Advax adjuvant (AV-1980R/A) in PS19 tau transgenic mice. The AV-1980R/A induced extremely high antibody responses and the resulting sera recognized neurofibrillary tangles and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites in AD brain sections. In addition, under non-denaturing conditions AV-1980R/A sera preferentially recognized AD-associated tau. Importantly, vaccination also prevented age-related motor and cognitive deficits in PS19 mice and significantly reduced insoluble total and phosphorylated tau species. Taken together, these findings suggest that predominantly targeting misfolded tau with AV-1980R/A could represent an effective strategy for AD .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673523>Changing equipoise in the landscape of radiation for oligometastatic lung cancer.</a></h1><p>There is growing interest in exploring use of local therapies in the management of oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to provide durable local and distant disease control. Prospective phase II studies have incorporated local therapy (predominantly stereotactic ablative radiotherapy or SABR) to both primary and metastatic sites. For patients who received these treatments, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) exceeded that of historical controls treated with systemic therapy alone (9.7-23.5 and 13.5-41.2 months, respectively). Additionally, three trials randomized oligometastatic NSCLC patients to standard of care systemic therapy regimens  local consolidative therapy (LCT) plus standard of care systemic therapy (or observation) and all demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS, with two showing OS benefits to date. Notably, a majority of these trials selected patients with at least stable disease after completion of systemic therapy for local therapy and defined the oligometastatic state as one with no more than five metastatic sites spread across three organs. For patients with oligometastatic NSCLC, there are many important factors that should drive use and timing of local therapy, including metastatic presentation sequence (synchronous  metachronous), extent of disease (number and distribution of sites), and quality of life goals. The referenced clinical trials accrued patients prior to the approval of  for metastatic NSCLC, so the benefits of any local therapy in this setting remain uncertain. To ultimately clarify the role of local therapy in oligometastatic NSCLC in the era of improving systemic therapy efficacy (i.e.,  and targeted therapy combinations with cytotoxics), we recommend enrollment in in phase III studies with OS endpoints (i.e., NRG LU 002 and SARON) whenever possible. These and other important issues associated with local therapy for oligometastatic NSCLC are reviewed in this paper.2019 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

This has been shown to increase screening duration and increase screen failure rates. It was important to corroborate these results in other centers.  This study is a non-randomized retrospective analysis of patients in one subset of patients seen by research nurses who operated in the standard head/neck and lung team not including patients in the phase 1 program. All patients were enrolled in clinical trials from January 16, 2013 to May 28, 2018 at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Institute in Los Angeles. Patients who were required to give fresh research biopsies prior to intervention were part of the research biopsy group.  In total, 76 patients were analyzed in this study. Thirty-three patients were in the research biopsygroup and 43 patients were in the no biopsy group. Trials that required a fresh biopsy had a longer median screening duration (30 vs. 14 days) than trials that did not require a biopsy ( < 0.0001).  Our study shows that requiring biopsies prior to clinical trial treatment results in a statistically significant delay in treatment. The informed consent forms that were part of clinical trials involving mandatory research biopsies did not reflect this delay in treatment. However, these delays did not result in a statistically significant decrease in number of days on trial or days until progression of disease.Copyright © 2019 Cheng, Tiulim, Zhou, El-Khoueiry and Nieva.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674884>Expression of PD-1/PD-L1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and its clinical significance.</a></h1><p>To investigate the role of programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and P16 in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).A total of 95 paraffin-embedded samples of tumorous tissue of HNSCC were collected. Expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, and P16 were determined by immunohistochemistry.A significantly higher proportion of PD-1 among patients infected with the human papillomavirus was found. PD-L1 expression is closely associated with the primary site of the tumor, postoperative recurrence, survival, PD-1 expression and P16 expression. Univariable analysis indicated that T stage, N stage, tumor node metastasis stage, tumor differentiation, and PD-L1 expression were all shown to be prognostic variables for overall survival in patients with HNSCC. In the multivariate analysis, only N stage ( = 0.010) and PD-L1 expression ( = 0.001) were found to be independent prognostic variables for overall survival. In addition, for disease recurrence, multivariate analysis showed that only PD-L1 expression was the associated independent risk factor. For the patients with negative PD-L1 expression, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that they had significantly worse outcomes in terms of overall survival ( = 0.001). Similarly, compared with the patients with positive PD-L1 expression, those with negative PD-L1 expression had a higher probability of recurrence ( = 0.026).The expression of PD-L1, PD-1, and P16 in HNSCC is significantly correlated. Human papillomavirus infection (P16 positive) is negatively related to postoperative recurrence. HNSCC patients with positive PD-L1/PD-1 expression tend to have better overall survival outcomes and lower probability of recurrence, providing more evidence for the PD-l-targeted  of HNSCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668739>Signalling molecules and epigenetic targeting in cancer  - Comments on "Epigenetic modulation enhances  for hepatocellular carcinoma".</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661975>Single Cell Sequencing of Mouse Heart Immune Infiltrate in Pressure Overload-Driven Heart Failure Reveals Extent of Immune Activation.</a></h1><p> Inflammation is a key component of cardiac disease, with macrophages and T lymphocytes mediating essential roles in the progression to heart failure (HF). Nonetheless, little insight exists on other immune subsets involved in the cardiotoxic response.  Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cardiac immune composition in the standard murine non-ischemic, pressure-overload HF model. By focusing our analysis on CD45 cells, we obtained a higher resolution identification of the immune cell subsets in the heart, at early and late stages of disease and in controls. We then integrated our findings using multi-parameter flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and tissue clarification immunofluorescence, in mouse and human.  We found that most major immune cell subpopulations, including macrophages, B cells, T cells and regulatory T cells (Treg), dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells are present in both healthy and diseased hearts. Most cell subsets are found within the myocardium, whilst mast cells are found also in the epicardium. Upon induction of pressure overload, immune activation occurs across the entire range of immune cell types. Activation led to upregulation of key subset-specific molecules, such as Osm in pro-inflammatory macrophages and PD-1 in Treg, that may help explain clinical findings such as the refractivity of HF patients to anti-TNF therapy and cardiac toxicity during anti-PD-1 cancer , respectively.  Despite the absence of infectious agents or an autoimmune trigger, induction of disease leads to immune activation that involves far more cell types than previously thought, including neutrophils, B cells, NK cells and mast cells. This opens up the field of cardio-immunology to further investigation using toolkits that have already been developed to study the immune subsets above. The subset-specific molecules that mediate their activation may thus become useful targets for diagnostics or therapy of HF.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668206> and Radiation: Charting a Path Forward Together.</a></h1><p>Preclinical studies combining  and radiation therapy have suggested promising synergy, prompting translation into clinical trials.

Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with  to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion. To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect  was observed.  experiments demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT . Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the checkpoint gene PD-L1 that mediates the immune resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the immune system.  The combination treatment strategy has great potential to be developed as a new and robust method for enhanced PDT therapy with high efficiency and a powerful antitumor immune response based on PD-L1 blockade.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680369>Control of graft-versus-host disease with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, rituximab, and bortezomib in TCRαβ/CD19-depleted graft transplantation for leukemia in children: a single-center retrospective analysis of two GVHD-prophylaxis regimens.</a></h1><p>Both acute GVHD and chronic GVHD remain the leading cause of morbidity and death after allogeneic HSCT. We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing two GVHD-prophylaxis regimens: 35 patients received "Regimen 1" (horse ATG, tacrolimus, and methotrexate) and 46 "Regimen 2" (rabbit ATG, rituximab, and peritransplant bortezomib). All 81 patients with a median age of 9 (0.6-23) years with ALL (n = 31) or AML (n = 50) in complete remission received TCRαβ/CD19-depleted transplants between May 2012 and October 2016, from 40 HLA-matched unrelated and 41 haploidentical donors.

However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity.Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features was assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check-point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, LAR and Mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in chromosome 5q and 15q regions including genomic loss of MHC-related genes showed reduced cytotoxic activity, as a plausible immune escape mechanism.Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of  in TNBC patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

One objective is assessing antigen-induced T cell activation because only functionally active T cells are capable of killing the desired targets. Autofluorescence imaging can distinguish T cell activity states in a non-destructive manner by detecting endogenous changes in metabolic co-enzymes such as NAD(P)H. However, recognizing robust activity patterns is computationally challenging in the absence of exogenous labels. We demonstrate machine learning methods that can accurately classify T cell activity across human donors from NAD(P)H intensity images. Using 8,260 cropped single-cell images from six donors, we evaluate classifiers ranging from traditional models that use previously-extracted image features to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on general non-biological images. Adapting pre-trained CNNs for the T cell activity classification task provides substantially better performance than traditional models or a simple CNN trained with the autofluorescence images alone. Visualizing the images with dimension reduction provides intuition into why the CNNs achieve higher accuracy than other approaches.

Current treatment modalities used in colorectal cancer have a narrow therapeutic index with a side effects profile that decreases tolerance to these treatments and adversely affects treatment outcome. Harnessing the gut microbiota ability to modify oncotherapeutic drugs metabolism and hence efficacy, could be potentially used to improve treatment outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. This review will shed lights on important findings from recent microbiome interaction studies which would hopefully serve as a useful tool to guide future translative colorectal cancer research.Recent advances in microbiome studies have revealed an interesting aspect of gut microbes carcinogenic properties in dysbiotic gut environment. Microbiota niche in colorectal cancer can also modify efficacy and toxicity profile of different oncotherapeutic treatment modalities from chemoradiotherapy to . Conversely, each of these treatment modalities has numerous effects on the gastrointestinal flora, causing changes in the gut microbial community that affects host morbidity and mortality.Symbiotic gut microbiota is an incredible functioning organ that maintains essential aspects of our homeostasis and immunity.

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The immune system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial immune system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant immune-mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of  in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning  in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block, immune checkpoint inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

Herein, we focus on the safety and efficacy of approved and promising cancer vaccines alone or combined with ICIs in the treatment of several malignancies. Generally, the majority of clinical trials support the concept of synergy that combination therapy of vaccines and ICIs holds maximized potential to improve clinical outcomes. Importantly, the combination has acceptable safety and minimal additional toxicity compared with single-agent vaccines or ICIs. Additionally, the potential strategies of combining personalized tumor vaccines with ICIs will become priority option and future direction of vaccine development and application and the urgent need to develop effective biomarkers to screen appropriate patient populations and predict response to combination therapy.Copyright © 2019 Zhao, Chen, Ding and Liu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682423>Injectable Polymer-Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Local Immune Cell Recruitment.</a></h1><p>The ability to engineer immune function has transformed modern medicine, highlighted by the success of vaccinations and recent efforts in cancer .

PEG--PLA NPs with the longer PEG brush exhibited improved gel formation following self-assembly and faster recovery after shear-thinning. In all cases, model protein therapeutics were released via Fickian diffusion in vitro, and minor differences in the release rate between the gel formulations were observed. PNP hydrogels were loaded with the DC cytokine CCL21 and injected subcutaneously in a murine model. CCL21-loaded PNP hydrogels recruited DCs preferentially to the site of injection in vivo relative to non-CCL21-loaded hydrogels.

However, we are still far from the identification of the correct setting, and sequence, where these drugs might be used in clinical practice, and their actual applicability in real-life is unknown. This review focuses on HCC immunobiology and on the potential of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for this tumour, with a critical evaluation of the available trials on immune checkpoint blocking antibodies treatment for HCC. Moreover, it assesses the potential applicability of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the real-life setting, by analysing a large, multicentre cohort of Italian patients with HCC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665735>Comparison of Six Different Allergen Extracts for Subcutaneous Specific  in Children: An Open-Labelled, Prospective, Controlled Observational Trial.</a></h1><p>Numerous products are available for subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual allergen-specific , but there are no information about the direct comparability regarding efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the different extracts.The aim of this open-labelled, prospective, controlled observational trial was to test the feasibility of a comparison of different products for SCIT in children.Pediatrician practices recruited patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) with or without asthma and an allergic sensitization against grass pollen allergen. Every patient was offered SCIT with one out of six allergen extracts: ALK SQ Depot, ALK Avanz, Allergovit, Depigoid, Purethal, Pollinex Quattro. Scores for symptoms and medications were calculated and the difference between treatment years and baseline were recorded.In total, 284 were recruited and 255 children (89.8%; mean age 10.4, SD 3.54 years; 65% males) participated in this trial. Overall, 49,649 patient days were recorded in the electronic database (mean 183.2 days/patient). There was no significant difference in the AR and asthma symptom score or the medication score between the six different SCIT preparations. Similarly, no differences were observed in terms of safety and tolerability.The comparison of different SCIT products using an online tool is feasible. Based on our preliminary data, all extracts indicated efficacy; however, larger groups would be necessary to demonstrate superiority or non-inferiority of one specific SCIT product.© 2019 S.

Recently, a new global transcriptomic immune classification of solid tumours has identified six immune subtypes (ISs) (C1-C6). Our aim was to specifically characterise ISs in colorectal cancer (CRC) and assess their interplay with the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs).Clinical and molecular information, including CMSs and ISs, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (N = 625). Immune cell populations, differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to characterise ISs in the global CRC population by using CMSs.Only 5 ISs were identified in CRC, predominantly C1 wound healing (77%) and C2 IFN-γ dominant (17%). CMS1 showed the highest proportion of C2 (53%), whereas C1 was particularly dominant in CMS2 (91%). CMS3 had the highest representation of C3 inflammatory (7%) and C4 lymphocyte depleted ISs (4%), whereas all C6 TGF-β dominant cases belonged to CMS4 (2.3%). Prognostic relevance of ISs in CRC substantially differed from that reported for the global TCGA, and ISs had a greater ability to stratify the prognosis of CRC patients than CMS classification. C2 had higher densities of CD8, CD4 activated, follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells and neutrophils and the highest M1/M2 polarisation. C2 had a heightened activation of pathways related to the immune system, apoptosis and DNA repair, mTOR signalling and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas C1 was more dependent of metabolic pathways.The correlation of IS and CMS allows a more precise categorisation of patients with relevant clinical and biological implications, which may be valuable tools to improve tailored therapeutic interventions in CRC patients.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

To date, a large number of clinical trials involving DC-based vaccines have been conducted with a view to treating tumors of different histological origins. However, DC-based vaccines had several drawbacks, including problems with targeted delivery of tumor antigens to DCs and prolong storage of cellular vaccines. Therefore, the development of other immunotherapeutic approaches capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of existing DC-based vaccines or directly triggering anti-tumor immune responses is of great interest. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by almost all types of eukaryotic cells for paracrine signaling. EVs can interact with target cells and change their functional activity by delivering different signaling molecules including mRNA, non-coding RNA, proteins, and lipids. EVs have potential benefits as natural vectors for the delivery of RNA and other therapeutic molecules targeted to DCs, T-lymphocytes, and tumor cells; therefore, EVs are a promising entity for the development of novel cell-free anti-tumor vaccines that may be a favourable alternative to DC-based vaccines. In the present review, we discuss the anti-tumor potential of EVs derived from DCs, tumors, and other cells. Methods of EV isolation are systematized, and key molecules carried by EVs that are necessary for the activation of a DC-mediated anti-tumor immune response are analyzed with a focus on the RNA component of EVs. Characteristics of anti-tumor immune responses induced by EVs  and  are reviewed. Finally, perspectives and challenges with the use of EVs for the development of anti-tumor cell-free vaccines are considered.Copyright © 2019 Markov, Oshchepkova and Mironova.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671191>An umbrella study of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer: a Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group study (KGOG 3045), AMBITION.</a></h1><p>A pilot study of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer has been started in Korea.

Diverse types and etiologies of NORSE are reported in various groups. Limbic encephalitis (LE) is reported as one of etiologies of NORSE. In this study, we investigated whether there were any intersections between NORSE and limbic encephalitis, as well as the presence of prognostic factors in intersection patients.We retrospectively analyzed patients who met both the definition of NORSE and diagnostic criteria of LE at the initial presentation from our database. Clinical characteristics and blood test, cerebrospinal fluid, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging results were reviewed. Prognosis was recorded as ICU admission stay, total length of hospitalization, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge. In particular, we determined which factors were associated with patients' prognosis.Thirteen patients were selected. Nine of the 13 patients had myalgia and 8 patients had fever in the prodromal period. Twelve of the 13 patients had acute memory impairment or confusion before SE development. In addition, 46.2% of the patients showed leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Median body temperature at hospital arrival was 37.6 °C. Nine patients showed generalized tonic-clonic SE. All patients were treated with  and 11 of the 13 patients achieved burst suppression through induced coma therapy. Ten patients showed lesion extension on follow-up imaging. The most common extension site was the claustrum. Patients with more lesion extension showed poorer outcomes than those without lesion extension.Subsequent extratemporal lesion extension was closely associated with poor prognosis in NORSE-LE patients.

However, copy number alteration (CNA)-driven dysregulated genes and their functions in CC are still rarely investigated. In the present study, we conducted integrative analysis of CNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cervical cancer to identify dysregulated genes triggered by CNAs. The integration of copy number status and RNA expression revealed 763 amplified and 1,391 deleted genes significantly dysregulated by the CNAs (P-value < 1e-8). Among these CNA genes, five driver genes, including PI3KCA, PI3KCB, DVL3, WWTR1, and ERBB2, exhibited a strong association with immune cell infiltration, suggesting that the pathways that they participate in may be involved in regulating immune cell infiltration. Moreover, we also observed that the genes of immunotherapeutic targets were abundantly expressed in the wild-type samples, suggesting that  based on these immunotherapeutic targets may be applied to wild-type samples. In addition, the two CNA driver genes, DVL3 and ERBB2, might be sensitive and resistant biomarkers for examining the tumor's response to chemoradiotherapy, respectively. Particularly, the expression of ERBB2 was also observed to be higher in responders of chemotherapy than non-responders. Furthermore, a subset of CNA genes was identified to predict the prognosis of cervical cancer. In summary, our systematic data analysis of these CNA genes not only improved our understanding of the veiled mechanism behind immune cell infiltration, but also provided the potential clinical application of these CNA genes in cervical cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We developed a microfluidics-based CTC platform to explore CTC profiling utility in CII-treated patients with melanoma using a melanoma messenger RNA (mRNA)/DNA biomarker panel.Blood samples (n = 213) were collected prospectively from 75 American Joint Committee on Cancer-staged III/IV melanoma patients during CII treatment and those enriched for CTCs. CTC profiling was performed using 5 known melanoma mRNA biomarkers and BRAF V600E DNA mutation. CTC biomarker status associations with clinical outcomes were assessed.CTCs were detected in 88% of blood samples from patients with melanoma. CTC-derived biomarkers and clinical variables analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis revealed that a combination of lactate dehydrogenase, CTC-mRNA biomarkers, and tumor BRAF-mutation status was indicative of clinical outcomes for patients with stage IV melanoma (n = 52). The panel stratified low-risk and high-risk patients, whereby the latter had poor disease-free ( = 0.03) and overall survival ( = 0.02). Incorporation of a DNA biomarker with mRNA profiling increased overall CTC-detection capability by 57% compared to mRNA profiling only. RNA sequencing of isolated CTCs identified significant catenin beta 1 () overexpression ( <0.01) compared to nondisease donor blood. CTC- was associated with progressive disease/stable disease compared to complete-responder patient status ( = 0.02).

Additional strategies are necessary to improve these agents' efficacy.Patients with stable disease for at least 4 months on TKI or checkpoint inhibitors were included. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered to an organ with comparable lesions, where one lesion was in the treatment target and the other one was intentionally left untreated (control lesion). Response in both lesions was scored using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1 criteria 2 months after completion of SBRT. The primary endpoint was the rate of SBRT adverse events, and the secondary endpoints included the rate of reduction in target lesion size.17 patients were enrolled (14 men and 3 women, median age: 54.5 years old). SBRT was delivered to the lungs (n=5), bones (n=4), lymph nodes (n=4), liver (n=1), primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n=1) and locally recurrent RCC (n=2). The equivalent dose in 2 Gy with an alpha to beta ratio of 2.6 was 114 Gy. With a median follow-up of 8 months, the cumulative rate of SBRT-related toxicity (grade 1) was 12% (n=2), consisting of oesophagitis and skin erythema. No grade 2 or higher toxicity was detected. Radiographic response in the target lesion was seen in 13 patients (76%), with complete response in 5 (29%) patients and partial response in 8 (47%), including abscopal effect in 1 patient. Control lesions remained stable in 16 patients. The difference between response in the target and control lesions as judged by the mean sizes of these lesions before and at 2 months after SBRT was statistically significant (p<0.01).

These structures can be covered by filter-like diaphragms. A transmembrane PLVAP (plasmalemma vesicle associated protein) protein has been shown to be necessary for the formation of diaphragms. The expression, subcellular localization and fenestra-forming role of PLVAP in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) have remained controversial. Here we show that fenestrations in LSEC contain PLVAP-diaphragms during the fetal angiogenesis, but they lose the diaphragms at birth. Although it is thought that PLVAP only localizes to diaphragms, we found luminal localization of PLVAP in adult LSEC using several imaging techniques. Plvap-deficient mice revealed that the absence of PLVAP and diaphragms did not affect the morphology, the number of fenestrations or the overall vascular architecture in the liver sinusoids. Nevertheless, PLVAP in fetal LSEC (fenestrations with diaphragms) associated with LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1), neuropilin-1 and VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), whereas in the adult LSEC (fenestrations without diaphragms) these complexes disappeared. Collectively, our data show that PLVAP can be expressed on endothelial cells without diaphragms, contradict the prevailing concept that biogenesis of fenestrae would be PLVAP-dependent, and reveal previously unknown PLVAP-dependent molecular complexes in LSEC during angiogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679251>T Cell Receptors for Gene Transfer in Adoptive T Cell Therapy.</a></h1><p>The past decade has seen enormous progress in cancer . Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of  that act to recruit endogenous T cells of a patient's immune system against cancer-associated peptide- MHC antigens. In this process, mutated antigenic peptides referred to as neoantigens often serve as the target on cancer cells that are recognized by the T cell receptor (TCR) on endogenous T cells. Another successful  has involved adoptive T cell therapy, where therapeutic doses of T cells expressing a gene for an anti-cancer receptor are delivered to a patient. This approach has been used primarily against hematopoietic cancers using synthetic receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs typically contain an antibody fragment (single-chain Fv, scFv) against a cancer cell surface antigen such as the B cell molecule CD19. While therapeutic CARs (and full antibodies) target antigens expressed on cell surfaces, TCRs can target a much larger array of intracellular proteins by binding to any cellular peptide associated with an MHC product. These cancer targets include self-peptides from aberrantly expressed/overexpressed proteins or neoantigens. In this review, we discuss the use of TCRs in adoptive T cell therapy and their target antigens. We focus on two properties that impact sensitivity, potency, and possible toxic cross-reactivity of TCR-mediated therapy: (1) the affinity of the TCR for the target antigen, and (2) the density of the target antigen.

Effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade in bladder adenocarcinoma is unknown due to lack of clinical trials. Due to the disease rarity, the rate of PD-L1 expression and DNA mismatch repair deficiency is largely unknown. In this study, we examined PD-L1 expression in 56 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma and mismatch repair protein expression in 42 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. Mismatch repair protein expression was uniformly intact in all cases of bladder adenocarcinoma, in comparison with 19% of advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma being mismatch repair deficient. This finding indicates that mismatch repair proteins may be combined with β-catenin and GATA-3 to create an immunostaining panel which, in addition to clinical studies, can aid in distinguishing bladder adenocarcinoma from secondary involvement by colorectal carcinoma. 4% of cases were found to overexpress PD-L1 in tumor cells while approximately a third of cases were found to display PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. These results indicate hypermutators are likely rare in bladder adenocarcinoma, yet 20-30% of the patients may be eligible for immune checkpoint blockade therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Herein, a multifunctional cascade bioreactor based on hollow mesoporous Cu MoS (CMS) loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) is constructed for synergetic cancer therapy by chemo-dynamic therapy (CDT)/starvation therapy/phototherapy/. The CMS harboring multivalent elements (Cu , Mo ) exhibit Fenton-like, glutathione (GSH) peroxidase-like and catalase-like activity. Once internalized into the tumor, CMS could generate ·OH for CDT via Fenton-like reaction and deplete overexpressed GSH in TME to alleviate antioxidant capability of the tumors. Moreover, under hypoxia TME, the catalase-like CMS could react with endogenous H O to generate O for activating the catalyzed oxidation of glucose by GOx for starvation therapy accompanied with the regeneration of H O . The regenerated H O can devote to Fenton-like reaction for realizing GOx-catalysis-enhanced CDT. Meanwhile, the CMS under 1064 nm laser irradiation shows remarkable tumor-killing ability by phototherapy due to its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 63.3%) and cytotoxic superoxide anion (·O  ) generation performance. More importantly, the PEGylated CMS@GOx-based synergistic therapy combined with checkpoint blockade therapy could elicit robust immune responses for both effectively ablating primary tumors and inhibiting cancer metastasis.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, there are two main challenges in successfully utilizing macrophages for . First, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) secreted by cancer cells binds to colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1-R) on macrophages and in turn activates the downstream signaling pathway responsible for polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Second, ligation of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on myeloid cells to CD47, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on cancer cells, activates the Src homology region 2 (SH2) domain -phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in macrophages. This results in activation of "eat-me-not" signaling pathway and inhibition of phagocytosis. Here, it is reported that self-assembled dual-inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles (DNTs) target M2 macrophages and simultaneously inhibit CSF1R and SHP2 pathways. This results in efficient repolarization of M2 macrophages to an active M1 phenotype, and superior phagocytic capabilities as compared to individual drug treatments. Furthermore, suboptimal dose administration of DNTs in highly aggressive breast cancer and melanoma mouse models show enhanced anti-tumor efficacy without any toxicity.

We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis B background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme B, IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these immune cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients. Thus, XCL1-GPC3 might be a promising cancer vaccine to compensate for the deficiency of the checkpoint blockades in HCC .Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674166>Tumor Immune Response and  in Gastric Cancer.</a></h1><p>The remarkable development of immuno-oncology has changed the landscape of gastric cancer (GC) treatment.

However, the clinical symptoms (psychiatric disorders, cognitive decline) and signs (consciousness disturbance) at onset and after follow-up were not significantly different (P > 0.05). In 71.4% of the patients, anti-GABABR antibody serum levels were higher than those in the cerebrospinal fluid (especially in patients with lung cancer). Magnetic resonance imaging in 71.4% of patients indicated that the marginal lobe demonstrated encephalitis lesions. The average modified Rankin Scale score (2.0 ± 2.31) at follow-up was significantly better than that (3.86 ± 0.90) at the time of admission (P < 0.05).The clinical characteristics of anti-GABABR encephalitis were refractory epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment. Multiple antiepileptic drugs are crucial for the treatment of intractable epilepsy. Clinicians should eliminate the possibility of small-cell lung cancer in patients with high anti-GABABR antibody levels.

Nearly 10 years after the approval of cetuximab, anti-PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are the first drugs that have shown any survival benefit for the treatment on platinum-refractory recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC. Furthermore, checkpoint inhibitors are better tolerated than chemotherapy. The state of the art in the treatment of R/M HNSCC is changing, thanks to improved results for checkpoint inhibitors. Results for these treatments are also awaited in curative settings and for locally advanced HNSCC. Unfortunately, the response rate of  is low. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to anti-PD1/PD-L1 is a key point for better selecting patients that would benefit the most from . Furthermore, the combination of checkpoint inhibitors with various agents is being currently evaluated to improve the response rate, prolong response duration, and even increase the chances for a cure.

Thus, its natural history is not well defined and treatment recommendations come from small retrospective studies. Data on managing PTFL with radiation therapy alone is particularly sparse. Here, we describe a 17 year-old male who presented in June 2017 with a slowly enlarging right-sided cervical neck mass. An initial core biopsy was performed which showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Four months later, the mass had enlarged significantly and an excision biopsy again showed reactive follicular hyperplasia. Further excision of five cervical lymph-nodes revealed expanded follicles with attenuated mantle-zones. Follicles were composed of medium sized atypical lymphoid cells; centroblasts were increased. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated follicles with cells expressing CD20, CD10, PAX-5, OCT-2, BOB-1 and BCL-6; Cyclin D1 was negative. MIB-1 was greater than 90% in follicles. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a clonal B-cell profile. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization did not detect t(14;18), BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement and breaks in IRF-4/DUSP22 and MYC were not detected. These findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of PTFL. PET/CT imaging confirmed disease isolated to the right neck, but unfortunately unresectable due to anatomic location. The patient declined treatment with chemo- and was thus treated with local radiotherapy, which was well tolerated. He achieved a complete response and remains in remission six months later. In our experience, radiation therapy is a suitable treatment for PTFL when excision and/or CIT is not possible.This article is protected by copyright.

It is an overwhelming task to discover drug-like inhibitors of glycosyl transferases that block the synthesis of specific branching processes in cancer cells, killing tumor cells selectively. It has long been known that -glycan biosynthesis can be inhibited by disruption of the first committed enzyme, dolichyl-phosphate -acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1). Selective DPAGT1 inhibitors have the promising therapeutic potential for certain solid cancers that require increased branching of -linked glycans in their growth progressions. Recently, we discovered that an anti- molecule, aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide (APPB) showed DPAGT1 inhibitory activity with the IC value of 0.25 μM. It was confirmed that APPB inhibits -glycosylation of β-catenin at 2.5 nM concentration. A sharp difference between APPB and tunicamycin was that the hemolytic activity of APPB is significantly attenuated (IC > 200 μM RBC). Water solubility of APPB is >350-times greater than that of tunicamycin (78.8 mg/mL for APPB, <0.2 mg/mL for tunicamycin). A novel DPAGT1 inhibitor, APPB selectively inhibits growth of the solid tumors (. KB, LoVo, SK-OV-3, MDA-MB-432S, HCT116, Panc-1, and AsPC-1) at low μM concentrations, but does not inhibit growth of a leukemia cell (L1210) and the healthy cells (Vero and HPNE) at these concentrations.  metabolic stability using rat liver microsomes indicated that a half-life ( ) of APPB is sufficiently long (>60 min) for  studies (PK/PD, safety profiles, and  efficacy) using animal models. We have refined all steps in the previously reported synthesis for APPB for larger-scale. This article summarizes protocols of gram-scale synthesis of APPB and its physicochemical data, and a convenient DPAGT1 assay. •Remember that the abstract is what readers see first in electronic abstracting & indexing services.•This is the advertisement of your article.

In contrast to T cells, NK cells elicit rapid anti-tumor responses based on signals from activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors. They also lyse target cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, a critical mode of action of several therapeutic antibodies used to treat cancer. A body of evidence shows that NK cells can exhibit potent anti-tumor activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, disease-associated mechanisms often restrain the proper functions of endogenous NK cells, leading to inadequate tumor control and risk for disease progression. Although allogeneic NK cells can prevent leukemia relapse in certain settings of stem cell transplantation, not all patients are eligible for this type of therapy. Moreover, remissions induced by adoptively infused NK cells are only transient and require subsequent therapy to maintain durable responses. Hence, new strategies are needed to trigger full and durable anti-leukemia responses by NK cells in patients with myeloid malignancies. To achieve this, we need to better understand the interplay between the malignant cells, their microenvironment, and the NK cells. This review focuses on mechanisms that are involved in suppressing NK cells in patients with myeloid leukemia and MDS, and means to restore their full anti-tumor potential. It also discusses novel molecular targets and approaches, such as bi- and tri-specific antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to redirect and/or unleash the NK cells against the leukemic cells.Copyright © 2019 Carlsten and Järås.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663034>Re-engineering anti-CTLA-4 antibodies for enhancing cancer  efficacy and safety.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669518>PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in oesophago-gastric cancers.</a></h1><p>Oesophago-gastric cancers (OGCs) are aggressive tumours. While better peri-operative strategies, increased number of cytotoxic agents and availability of targeted therapies have improved survival, there remains an unmet need for novel treatment approaches. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have marked a new era in cancer management with unprecedented results in several malignancies. Although OGC lagged behind other solid tumours, evidence has increasingly accumulated supporting the contention that modulation of the anti-cancer host immune response may be beneficial for at least some patients. Many trials have been completed in Eastern and Western countries, some of these leading to the approval of ICIs in the refractory setting, and favorable opinion from regulatory agencies is expected also in treatment-naïve, advanced OGC. Furthermore, studies are evaluating ICIs in the early stage setting and exploring the potential of combination treatments. In this article we discuss the biological bases underlying the successful development of ICIs in OGC and review the available data on PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in this disease.

Despite advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of fibrosis, it remains uncured. Fibrogenic processes share conserved core cellular and molecular pathways across organs. In this study, we aimed to elucidate shared and organ-specific features of fibrosis using murine precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS) prepared from small intestine, liver and kidneys. PCTS displayed substantial differences in their baseline gene expression profiles: 70% of the extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes were differentially expressed across the organs. Culture for 48 h induced significant changes in ECM regulation and triggered the onset of fibrogenesis in all PCTS in organ-specific manner. TGFβ signalling was activated during 48 h culture in all PCTS. However, the degree of its involvement varied: both canonical and non-canonical TGFβ pathways were activated in liver and kidney slices, while only canonical, Smad-dependent, cascade was involved in intestinal slices. The treatment with galunisertib blocked the TGFβRI/SMAD2 signalling in all PCTS, but attenuated culture-induced dysregulation of ECM homeostasis and mitigated the onset of fibrogenesis with organ-specificity. In conclusion, regardless the many common features in pathophysiology of organ fibrosis, PCTS displayed diversity in culture-induced responses and in response to the treatment with TGFβRI kinase inhibitor galunisertib, even though it targets a core fibrosis pathway. A clear understanding of the common and organ-specific features of fibrosis is the basis for developing novel antifibrotic therapies.Copyright © 2019.

The combination of quercetin (Q) and alantolactone (A) was found to induce synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD) at a molar ratio of 1:4 (Q:A). To achieve ratiometric loading and delivery, the micellar delivery of Q and A (QA-M) was developed with high entrapment efficiency and drug loading at an optimal ratio. QA-M achieved prolonged blood circulation and increased tumor accumulation for both drugs. More importantly, QA-M retained the desired drug ratio (molar ratio of Q to A = 1:4) in tumors at 2 and 4 h after intravenous injection for synergistic . Tumor growth was significantly inhibited in murine orthotopic CRC by the treatment of QA-M compared to PBS and the combination of free drugs ( < 0.005). The combination of nanotherapy stimulated the host immune response to induce long-term tumor destruction and induced memory tumor surveillance with a 1.3-fold increase in survival median time compared to PBS ( < 0.0001) and a combination of free drugs ( < 0.0005). The synergistic therapeutic effect induced by codelivery of Q and A is capable of reactivating antitumor immunity by inducing ICD, causing cell toxicity and modulating the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment.

PD-L1 CTCs were reported to associate with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. However, whether or not aneuploid circulating tumor endothelial cells (CTECs) express PD-L1, then serve as a surrogate biomarker to evaluate  efficacy remains unknown.

TAMs are predominantly polarized to a pro-tumorigenic M2-phenotype through macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (MCSF) cytokines that bind to the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a class III receptor tyrosine kinase. This MCSF-CSF1R interaction results in autophosphorylation of CSF1R and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway leading to proliferation, survival and functional activity of M2 TAMs. Therapeutic inhibition of CSF1R and MAPK signaling could effectively re-polarize M2 macrophages to an anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype; however, this is challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that concurrent and sustained inhibition of the CSF1R and MAPK signaling pathways using dual-kinase inhibitor-loaded supramolecular nanoparticles (DSNs) enhance repolarization of pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages to the anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype. The supramolecular nanoparticles exhibited physical stability of over 7 days during storage conditions at 4 °C and over 24 h in human serum, released the inhibitors in a sustained manner and showed significantly higher internalization and accumulation of inhibitors in the M2 macrophages even at longer time points. When tested in a highly aggressive 4T1 breast cancer model, the supramolecular nanoparticles accumulated in TAMs at a significantly higher concentration, increased M1-like phenotype at significantly higher proportion and improved anti-tumor efficacy as compared to combination of single-inhibitor nanoparticles or the small molecule inhibitors. Our data suggests that concurrent, vertical inhibition of multiple intracellular kinase signaling pathways is important for repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, and by utilizing dual-inhibitor loaded supramolecular nanoparticles, further increase the ability to produce more M1 macrophages as compared to M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. This results in enhanced tumor growth inhibition and reduced toxicity. Therefore, vertical, co-inhibition of CSF1R and downstream signaling pathways like MAPK could be a promising macrophage  strategy for aggressive cancers.Copyright © 2019.

However, most protocols developed to expand T cells require relatively long periods of time in culture, potentially leading to progression toward populations of terminally differentiated effector memory cells. Here, we describe in detail a 9-day protocol for CAR gene transduction and expansion of primary rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells produced and expanded with this method show high levels of viability, high levels of co-expression of two transduced genes, retention of the central memory phenotype, and sufficient quantity for immunotherapeutic infusion of 1-2 × 10 cells/kg in a 10 kg rhesus macaque.

The success of checkpoint blockade therapy has demonstrated the potentially curative value of preexisting tumor-primed T cells in cancer treatment. Given the results from checkpoint blockade therapy, we hypothesized that endogenous T cells contribute to long-term survival following ACT. Here, we describe a therapeutic approach combining ACT with an oncolytic vaccine that allows simultaneous analysis of antitumor immunity mediated by transferred and endogenous T cells. We found that, in addition to promoting the expansion and tumor infiltration of the transferred T cells, oncolytic vaccines boosted tumor-primed host T cells. We determined that transferred T cells contributed to rapid destruction of large tumor masses while endogenous T cells concurrently prevented the emergence of antigen-loss variants. Moreover, while transferred T cells disappeared shortly after tumor regression, endogenous T cells secured long-term memory with a broad repertoire of antigen specificity. Our findings suggest that this combination strategy may exploit the full potential of ACT and tumor-primed host T cells to eliminate the primary tumor, prevent immune escape, and provide long-term protective memory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670092>Traf6 inhibitor boosts antitumor immunity by impeding regulatory T cell migration in Hepa1-6 tumor model.</a></h1><p>Tumors escape immune attacks via various mechanisms, among which activation of regulatory pathways in effector immune cells and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells are usually employed. Traf6 is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and involved in many signaling pathways. While it plays important roles in both tumor biology and immune system, the potential therapeutic role of Traf6 in tumor  hasn't ever been assessed. Here, we confirmed the anti-tumor effect of Traf6 inhibitor in Hepa1-6 tumor model. Flow cytometry-based analysis revealed that T cell-mediated antitumor immunity was provoked and the infiltration of Treg cells was restrained when treated with Traf6 inhibitor. Via an in vivo migration assay, we found that Traf6 inhibitor decreased the population of intratumor Tregs by impeding the migration of Tregs towards tumor. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of Traf6 inhibitor and PD-1 blockade could receive a better antitumor efficiency. These results implicated that Traf6 inhibitor could serve as a supplement for immune checkpoint therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is only in recent years that research on NK cell exhaustion and potential checkpoints impacting NK cells has become popular. NK cells, as the major player in innate immunity, are critical for immune surveillance, particularly the control of metastasis and hematological cancers. The balance between activating and inhibitory signals fine tunes the activation and effector functions of NK cells, and transformed cells modulate NK cells by upregulating negative signaling that "exhausts" NK cells. Exhausted NK cells with excessive expression of inhibitory receptors (checkpoint molecules) are impaired in the recognition of tumor cells as well as antitumor cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Therefore, an understanding of the potential checkpoint molecules involved in NK cell exhaustion is particularly important in terms of NK cell-targeted cancer . In this review, we summarize recent advances in NK cell checkpoint inhibitors and their progress in clinical trials. Moreover, we highlight some of the latest findings in fundamental NK cell receptor biology and propose potential NK cell checkpoint molecules for future immunotherapeutic applications.Copyright © 2019 Sun and Sun.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660068>Tailored Black Phosphorus for Erythrocyte Membrane Nanocloaking with Interleukin-1 siRNA and Paclitaxel for Targeted, Durable, and Mild Combination Cancer Therapy.</a></h1><p>Several therapeutic nanosystems have been engineered to remedy the shortcomings of cancer monotherapies, including  (stimulating the host immune system to eradicate cancer), to improve therapeutic efficacy with minimizing off-target effects and tumor-induced immunosuppression. Light-activated components in nanosystems confer additional phototherapeutic effects as combinatorial modalities; however, systemic and thermal toxicities with unfavorable accumulation and excretion of nanoystem components now hamper their practical applications. Thus, there remains a need for optimal multifunctional nanosystems to enhance targeted, durable, and mild combination therapies for efficient cancer treatment without notable side effects.  A nanosystem constructed with a base core (poly-L-histidine [H]-grafted black phosphorus [BP]) and a shell (erythrocyte membrane [EM]) is developed to offer a mild photoresponsive (near-infrared) activity with erythrocyte mimicry. In-flight electrostatic tailoring to extract uniform BP nanoparticles maintains a hydrodynamic size of <200 nm (enabling enhanced permeability and retention) after EM cloaking and enhances their biocompatibility.  Ephrin-A2 receptor-specific peptide (YSA, targeting cancer cells), interleukin-1α silencing small interfering RNA (ILsi, restricting regulatory T cell trafficking), and paclitaxel (X, inducing durable chemotherapeutics) are incorporated within the base core@shell constructs to create BP-H-ILsi-X@EM-YSA architectures, which provide a more intelligent nanosystem for combination cancer therapies.  The in-flight tailoring of BP particles provides a promising base core for fabricating <200 nm EM-mimicking multifunctional nanosystems, which could be beneficial for constructing smarter nanoarchitectures to use in combination cancer therapies.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664622>Preferences for  in Melanoma: A Systematic Review.</a></h1><p> improves overall survival for patients with metatstatic melanoma and improves recurrence-free survival in the adjuvant setting, but is costly and has adverse effects.

Findings were tabulated and summarized, and study reporting was assessed against recommended checklists.This investigation identified eight studies assessing preferences for melanoma treatment; four studies regarding nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or ipilimumab; and four studies regarding interferon conducted in the United States, Germany, and Australia. The following 10 factors were important to decision-making: overall survival, recurrence-free survival, treatment side effects, dosing regimen, patient or payer cost, patient age, clinician or family/friend treatment recommendation, quality of life, and psychosocial effects. Overall survival was the most important factor for all respondents. The patients judged severe toxicities to be tolerable for small survival gains. The description of information about treatment harms and benefits was limited in most studies.Overall survival was of primary importance to patients and clinicians considering . Impaired quality of life due to adverse effects appeared to be a second-order consideration.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have become the most promising type of treatment in oncology in general, and significantly so in NSCLC. Limited data is available about mechanisms of primary resistance. Data is lacking about mechanisms involved in acquired resistance or mixed responses in NSCLC. We aimed to identify mechanisms of resistance by studying biopsies taken from sites of secondary progression.We identified all cases of NSCLC that have received ICI for advanced disease in our institute. Of these cases, those that have demonstrated acquired resistance or mixed responses, and have underwent a biopsy from a progressive lesion were analyzed. Selected specimens were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS; Oncomine™ Solid Tumour Fusion Transcript Kit).Out of 664 lung cancer cases, 249 were NSCLC that have received ICI. Of these, eight cases matched our search criteria. Two of them demonstrated transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC; 2/8, 25%). NGS verified a common origin to a matched pre-treatment NSCLC specimen and an on-treatment progressive SCLC specimen. In two cases no tumor cells were found and in the remaining four the pathology was similar to the initial biopsy. In one of the cases of SCLC transformation platinum-etoposide chemotherapy was administered, with short-term benefit only and further disease progression.Mechanisms of acquired resistance to ICI include SCLC transformation. Repeat biopsies of progressing lesions after initial response or in cases of mixed response can shed light on mechanisms of resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of  according to patient gender in advanced kidney cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

In this study, we showed that Lachnum polysaccharide (LEP) could work as an immunomodulator to reset TAMs from pro-tumor M2 to anti-tumor M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, LEP promoted Th1 polarization and the secretion of IFN-γ, which played a key role in M1 phenotype polarization. In parallel, LEP might directly activate M1 macrophages via TLR4 mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, LEP also resulted in the accumulation of anti-tumor immune cells and decrease the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Treg cells, thereby potentiating anti-tumor immunity. In summary, these results revealed a novel mechanism of the anti-tumor effect of LEP and provided a potential new avenue targeting TAMs and cancer .Copyright © 2019.

Targeting interleukin-2 (IL2) receptors on activated T-cells using positron emission tomography (PET) with N-(4-[F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([F]FB-IL2) could be such a strategy. This paper describes the challenging translation of the partly manual labeling of [F]FB-IL2 for preclinical studies into an automated procedure following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), resulting in a radiopharmaceutical suitable for clinical use.The preclinical synthesis of [F]FB-IL2 was the starting point for translation to a clinical production method. To overcome several challenges, major adaptations in the production process were executed. The final analytical methods and production method were validated and documented. All data with regards to the quality and safety of the final drug product were documented in an investigational medicinal product dossier.Restrictions in the [F]FB-IL2 production were imposed by hardware configuration of the automated synthesis equipment and by use of disposable cassettes. Critical steps in the [F]FB-IL2 production comprised the purification method, stability of recombinant human IL2 and the final formulation. With the GMP compliant production method, [F]FB-IL2 could reliably be produced with consistent quality complying to all specifications.To enable the use of [F]FB-IL2 in clinical studies, a fully automated GMP compliant production process was developed.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) also shows favorable outcomes. Although the immunological environment of RC has been thoroughly discussed, the effect of NAC on it is less clear. Here, we investigated the immunological microenvironment, including T-cell infiltration, activation, and topological distribution, of resected RC tissue after neoadjuvant therapies and evaluated the correlation between T-cell subsets and patient prognosis. RC patients (n = 188) were enrolled and categorized into three groups, namely CRT (n = 41), NAC (n = 46), and control (surgery alone; n = 101) groups. Characterization of residual carcinoma cells and T-cell subsets in resected tissues was performed using multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. The densities of total and activated (Ki67 ) T-cells in tissues after NAC, but not CRT, were higher than in control. In both CRT and NAC groups, patients presenting with higher treatment effects showed aggressive infiltration of T-cell subsets into carcinomas. Multivariate analyses of pathological and immunological features and prognosis revealed that carcinoma Ki67 CD4 T-cells after CRT and stromal Ki67 CD8 T-cells after NAC are important prognostic factors, respectively. Our results suggest that evaluation of T-cell activation with Ki67 expression and its tumor localization can be used to determine the prognosis of advanced RC after neoadjuvant therapies.© 2019 The Authors.

Acidic extracellular pH is a major attribute of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes immune evasion and tumor progression. Therefore, antagonizing tumor acidity can be a powerful approach in cancer . Here, Pluronic F-127 is used as a NaHCO releasing carrier to focally alleviate extracellular tumor acidity. In a mouse tumor model, intratumoral treatment with pH modulating injectable gel (pH-MIG) generates immune-favorable TME, as evidenced by the decrease of immune-suppressive cells and increase of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T cells. The combination of pH-MIG with immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies, increases intratumoral T cell function, which leads to tumor clearance. Mechanistically, extracellular acidity was shown to upregulate co-inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and inhibit mTOR signaling pathways in memory CD8 + T cells, which impaired effector functions. Furthermore, an acidic pH environment increased the expression and engagement of TIGIT and its ligand CD155, which suggested that the extracellular pH can regulate the suppressive function of TIGIT pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that pH-MIG holds potential as a new TME modulator for effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.Copyright © 2019.

While many patients enjoy remarkable responses to checkpoint inhibitors, a majority show adverse effects. Understanding how checkpoint inhibitors may augment established chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimens or other immunotherapies like oncolytic viruses may lead to better clinical outcomes measured by improved efficacy with reduced toxicity. Here, we assess how Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an oncolytic virus in clinical testing, may interact with radiotherapy to enhance checkpoint inhibitor blockade.An immunocompetent B16-F10 murine melanoma model, generally considered to be a poorly immunogenic or "cold" tumour, was utilised to query whether combining localised radiotherapy with NDV may be more effective than either therapy alone in controlling tumours in mice treated with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibodies. We also investigated whether localised administration of a checkpoint inhibitor through an intratumoural injection of NDV that expresses anti-CTLA4 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is comparable to systemic administration of anti-CTLA4 when combined with radiation in mediating its anti-tumour efficacy. Response rates were characterised by measuring tumour size over time, observation of complete tumour regression, and overall survival.Our results show that combining NDV plus radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (PD1 or CTLA4 targeted mAbs) results in significantly better complete tumour regression rates with an abscopal effect in a murine model of melanoma than either single therapy combined with checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, we also show that localised administration of a recombinant NDV expressing anti-CTLA4 plus radiation is comparable to systemic anti-CTLA4 plus radiation in mediating its anti-tumour effect as assayed by survival benefit.Our results show that oncolytic NDV plus radiotherapy work together with checkpoint inhibitors to enhance tumour clearance of murine melanoma. NDV is an effective radiotherapy dose-sparing and immunotherapeutic agent capable of transgenic, in vivo expression of an anti-CTLA4 targeted scFv antibody with the potential to spare systemic exposure.The National Institutes of Health grant HHSN272201400008C supported the work.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we reported a nanovaccine, which was produced by encapsulating OVA (ovalbumin, a model antigen) chemically modified with MPGΔNLS (MPGΔNLS-OVA conjugate) into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles. We hypothesized that after the uptake of the nanovaccine into immune cells, MPGΔNLS, a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), would assist the escape of the antigens from lysosomes into the cytosol, increase the amount of antigens processed in the cytosol and subsequently enhance antigen cross-presentation via MHC-I molecules to elicit cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. The results of the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs not only elevated the release of OVA into the cytosol of dendritic cells (BMDCs), but also promoted the maturation and activation of BMDCs. It was also observed in mice vaccinated with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs that the MPGΔNLS modification could stimulate the expansion of OVA-specific T-cells, generation of OVA-specific IgG antibodies and proliferation of OVA-specific memory T cells. Moreover, the treatment of E·G7-OVA tumor-bearing mice with MPGΔNLS-OVA-loaded PLGA NPs resulted in significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival periods of the mice compared to the treatment with unmodified OVA-PLGA NPs or free OVA. In summary, cell-penetrating peptides linked with antigens encapsulated in nanovaccines can spatiotemporally affect the intracellular localization of antigens, promote antigen cross-presentation and stimulate antigen-specific immune responses, especially CTL responses. Therefore, the CPP modification on antigens is an innovative approach to enhance the efficacy of nanovaccines for cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675248>Assessment of Adverse Events and Their Ability to Discriminate Response to Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Antibody .</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677477>The Landscape of Tumor Fusion Neoantigens: A Pan-Cancer Analysis.</a></h1><p>Compared with SNV&indel-based neoantigens, fusion-based neoantigens are not well characterized.

Absence of hormonal receptors on breast cancer cells necessitates the chemotherapy as the only treatment regime. High propensity to metastasize and relapse in addition to poor prognosis and survival motivated the oncologist, nano-medical scientist to develop novel and efficient nanotherapies to solve such a big TNBC challenge.

These smart nano-carriers carrying all the necessary arsenals (drugs, tracking probe, and ligand) designed in such a way that specifically targets the TNBC cells at site. Articulating the targeted delivery system with multifunctional molecules for high specificity, tracking, diagnosis, and treatment emerged as theranostic approach.

The specificity, which includes the recognition of post-translational modifications, and capacity for engineering that characterize these antibody fragments can be especially well-focused when the genes encoding only the binding sites of the antibody are expressed intracellularly. Multifunctional constructs use fusions with peptides that can re-target antigen-antibody complexes to enhance both pharmacodynamic activity and intracellular solubility simultaneously. Fusions with proteolytic targeting signals, such as the PEST degron, greatly enhance potency in some cases. Stem cell transplants can be protected from exogenous misfolded proteins by stable transfection with intrabodies. Tandem expression to target two or more misfolding proteins in one treatment may be especially valuable for proteostatic disruptions due to genetic, aging, or toxic triggers. Advances in bioinformatics, screening protocols, and especially gene therapy are showing great promise for intrabody/ nanobody treatments of a full range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and related tau dementias, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body diseases, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, among others.Copyright © 2018.

Quality evaluation of included studies was performed, and meta-analyses with regards to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 11.A total of 12 eligible studies with 1340 cancer patients were included. Combined results showed that elevated PLR was a negative factor affecting the efficacy of ICIs in cancer patients.

In particular, it remains unexplored how driver mutations could be associated with distinct TIBs signatures and their role in tumor microenvironment.Here we analyzed associations of immunoglobulin isotypes and clonality with survival in TCGA RNA-Seq data for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), stratifying patients into 12 driver mutation and phenotypic tumor subgroups.We revealed several unexpected associations between TIBs behavior and prognosis. Abundance and high proportion of IgG1 isotype, and low proportion of IgA among all intratumorally produced immunoglobulins were specifically associated with improved overall survival for KRAS but not KRAS LUAD, revealing the first link between a driver mutation and B-cell response. We found specific IgG1 signature associated with long survival, which suggests that particular specificities of IgG1+ TIBs could be beneficial in KRAS LUAD. In contrast to our previous observations for melanoma, highly clonal IgG1 production by plasma cells had no meaningful effect on prognosis, suggesting that IgG1+ TIBs may exert a beneficial effect in KRAS cases in an alternative way, such as efficient presentation of cognate antigens or direct B cell attack on tumor cells. Notably, a high proportion of the IgG1 isotype is positively correlated with the non-silent mutation burden both in the general LUAD cohort and in most patient subgroups, supporting a role for IgG1 TIBs in antigen presentation. Complementing the recent finding that the presence of stromal IgG4-producing cells is associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with stage I squamous cell carcinoma, we show that the abundance of IgG4-producing TIBs likewise has a strong positive effect on overall survival in STK11 and proximal proliferative subgroups of LUAD patients. We hypothesize that the positive role of IgG4 antibodies in some of the lung cancer subtypes could be associated with reported inability of IgG4 isotype to form immune complexes, thus preventing immunosuppression via activation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) phenotype.We discover prominent and distinct associations between TIBs antibody isotypes and survival in lung adenocarcinoma carrying specific driver mutations. These findings indicate that particular types of tumor-immunity relations could be beneficial in particular driver mutation context, which should be taken into account in developing strategies of cancer  and combination therapies. Specificity of protective B cell populations in specific cancer subgroups could become a clue to efficient targeted immunotherapies for appropriate cohorts of patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682438>Development of rice-seed based oral allergy vaccines containing hypoallergenic Japanese cedar pollen allergen derivatives for .</a></h1><p>Allergen-specific  is only available curative treatment for IgE-mediated allergen diseases.

Failure of immune response to clear the oncogenic infection can facilitate cancer progression. The aim of the present study was to analyze early and late activation of T-lymphocytes related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection by the expression of markers of activation (CD69, CD25) on the surface of T-lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) in patients bearing laryngeal cancer according to absence/presence immunoglobulin G antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA1).Thirty-three patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LC) and 20 volunteers without cancer (control group) were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood samples were collected from every individual. The markers of activation of T-lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry, whereas commercial immunoenzymatic assay kits were used for detection of anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, anti-VCA IgG, and anti-EBNA1 IgG.Increased early activation of CD8 and CD4 T-lymphocytes was found in patients with LC. There was a significantly higher proportion of CD4 and CD8T-lymphocytes expressing CD69 antigen in patients with LC compared to the control group. The proportion of CD4 CD25 T-lymphocytes in patients with LC positive for anti-EBNA1 IgG and anti-VCA IgM was lower compared to patients without antibodies to VCA IgM.The dysfunction of immune response in larynx cancer patients could be associated with EBV infection.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Conventional treatment options include postoperative (adjuvant) and preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although these treatment modalities have shown to decrease tumor burden, a major limitation to chemothearpy/radiotherapy is the high recurrence rate in patients. Immune-modulation strategies have emerged as a promising new therapeutic avenue to reduce this recurrence rate while minimizing undesirable systemic side effects. This review will focus specifically on the mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies: immune checkpoint inhibitors and cytokines, as well as current drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and new clinical/pre-clinical trials.

Nevertheless, the relevant clinical analyses are still lacking in China. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine common food allergens in pediatric patients with asthma in Chongqing, Southwest China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 8393 asthmatic patients from Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (CHCMU) were enrolled in this retrospective study between October 2014 and July 2017. All patients underwent skin prick test (SPT) with 10 food allergens and recorded history of clinical reactivity. The correlations among the positive rates, categories of allergens, gender, age, and living environment were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 2544 patients (30.31%) had a positive SPT, while the prevalence of food allergy was 8%. Sea crab, peanut, and sea shrimp were the most common food allergens found in the studied population. The frequent food allergies were sea crab, peanuts, and sea shrimp.

Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell immunity, but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including B cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces B regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral immunity, and B cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor immunity in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 . Together these data indicate that MEK inhibition may reduce Bregs while sparing anti-tumor B cell function, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667924>Current management of patients with melanoma who are found to be sentinel node-positive.</a></h1><p>The results of the DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II studies, published in 2016 and mid-2017, indicated no survival benefit from completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in melanoma patients with positive sentinel nodes (SNs). Subsequently, several studies have been published reporting a benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with stage III melanoma. The current study assessed how these findings influenced management of SN-positive patients in a dedicated melanoma treatment centre.SN-positive patients treated at Melanoma Institute Australia between July 2017 and December 2018 were prospectively identified. Surgeons completed a questionnaire documenting the management of each patient. Information on patients, primary tumours, SNs, further treatment and follow-up was collected from patient files, the institutional research database and pathology reports.During the 18-month study period, 483 patients underwent SN biopsy. A positive SN was found in 61 (13%). Two patients (3%) requested CLND because of anxiety about observation in view of unfavourable primary tumour and SN characteristics. The other 59 patients (97%) were followed with a four-monthly ultrasound examination of the relevant lymph node field(s). Two of them (3%) developed an isolated nodal recurrence after 4 and 11 months of follow-up. Fifty-seven patients (93%) were seen following the publication of the first two adjuvant systemic therapy studies in November 2017; 46 (81%) were referred to a medical oncologist to discuss adjuvant systemic therapy, which 32 (70%) chose to receive.At Melanoma Institute Australia most patients with an involved SN are now managed without CLND. The majority are referred to a medical oncologist and receive adjuvant systemic therapy.© 2019 The Authors ANZ Journal of Surgery published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677920>The B7x Immune Checkpoint Pathway: From Discovery to Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>B7x (B7 homolog x, also known as B7-H4, B7S1, and VTCN1) was discovered by ourselves and others in 2003 as the seventh member of the B7 family.

Neu5Gc synthesis starts from the N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) precursor modified by an hydroxylic group addition catalyzed by CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase enzyme (CMAH). In humans, CMAH was inactivated by a 92 bp deletion occurred 2-3 million years ago. Few other mammals do not synthetize Neu5Gc, however livestock species used for food production and as a source of biological materials for medical applications carry Neu5Gc. Trace amounts of Neu5Gc are up taken through the diet and incorporated into various tissues including epithelia and endothelia cells. Humans carry "natural," diet-induced Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies and when undertaking medical treatments or receiving transplants or devices that contain animal derived products they can cause immunological reaction affecting pharmacology, immune tolerance, and severe side effect like serum sickness disease (SSD). Neu5Gc null mice have been the main experimental model to study such phenotype. With the recent advances in genome editing, pigs and cattle KO for Neu5Gc have been generated always in association with the αGal KO. These large animals are normal and fertile and provide additional experimental models to study such mutation.

Current treatment options are associated with significant side effects including therapy with immune check point inhibitors (ICI). ICI therapy induced side effects are due to excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). At the same time, production of appropriate amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α are needed to eliminate tumor cells. Hence, methods are needed that can selectively eliminate tumor cells and tone down the side effects of cytokine storm. Studies showed that IL-6 and TNF-α activate phospholipases to induce the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from the cell membrane phospholipid pool. PUFAs form precursors to pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and are capable of suppressing IL-6 and TNF-α excess production. PUFAs are endowed with capacity to selectively kill tumor cells by augmenting free radical generation and accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides in tumor but not normal cells. NK cells, TILs (tumor infiltrating cells) and γδ T cells release toxic granules (also called as cytolytic granules) that contain unsaturated fatty acids localized between the granule delimiting membrane and the granule core. Thus, lipids are a universal component of cytolytic granules and play an important role in their cytotoxic actions. Based on this evidence, it is suggested that a combination of ICI/TILs and PUFAs may form a novel method of eliminating cancer with few side effects.Copyright © 2019 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A detailed assessment of the response dynamics of individual metastasis could provide insight to the systemic and local features that mediate response and resistance to .Patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) carcinoma treated with PD-1 monotherapy were evaluated independently. Absolute and percent change of each target lesion were quantified at each computed tomography scan using RECIST. Patterns of progression were predefined as systemic or mixed and were correlated with clinical outcomes.A total of 761 individual lesions from 214 patients with NSCLC and 290 lesions from 78 patients with MMRD carcinoma were examined. Individual target lesion responses aligned with best overall response of each patient (85% NSCLC and 93% MMRD lesions responded in patients with partial response/complete response). In responding patients, timing of response was uniform (73% NSCLC and 76% MMRD lesions responded synchronously), and deeper responses were associated with prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival. By contrast, at progression, mixed progression was common (45% of NSCLC and 53% of MMRD) and associated with improved survival compared with those who experienced systemic progression (NSCLC hazard ratio [HR], 0.58;  = .001; MMRD HR, 0.40;  = .07). Organ sites had differential responses, with lymph node and liver metastasis among the most and least responsive, respectively.Temporal-spatial patterns of response across individual metastases tend to be uniform, favoring the role of peripheral, clonally directed antitumor immunity as a key mediator of response to PD-1 blockade.

We describe the clinical course of a 70-year-old female diagnosed with primary leptomeningeal melanoma (LMN) whose case represents the diagnostic and management challenges of this tumor. Targeted genomic sequencing of 315 genes from this tumor revealed GNAQ Q209L mutation and low (4 mutations/Megabase) tumor mutation burden (TMB). Wildtype NRAS, KIT, and BRAF were also observed. A cohort of 4,787 melanomas was subsequently analyzed to identify additional primary central nervous system melanomas, of which 10 additional tumors met pathologic criteria (0.21% of total melanoma cohort). These tumors were genomically assessed according to the same targeted sequencing panel, and 6 of the tumors were also found to harbor a GNAQ mutation. All 10 tumors had low (less than or equal to 2 mutations/Megabase) TMB indicating a potential trend between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) alterations and low TMB in LMNs.

We previously identified a nephritogenic epitope, P14 (3), that could induce crescentic nephritis in WKY rats, and defined its core motif. Designing a modified peptide, replacing critical pathogenic residues with nonpathogenic ones (on the basis of homologous regions in 1NC1 chain of type IV collagen, known to be nonpathogenic), might provide a therapeutic option for anti-GBM GN.We synthesized a modified peptide, replacing a single amino acid, and injected it into 3-P14-immunized rats from day 0 (the early-treatment group) or a later-treatment group (from days 17 to 21). A scrambled peptide administrated with the same protocol served as a control.The modified peptide, but not the scrambled peptide, attenuated anti-GBM GN in both treatment groups, and halted further crescent formation even after disease onset. Kidneys from the modified peptide-treated rats exhibited reductions in IgG deposits, complement activation, and infiltration by T cells and macrophages. Treatment also resulted in an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile versus a proinflammatory profile for animals not receiving the modified peptide; it also reduced 3-P14-specific T cell activation, modulated T cell differentiation by decreasing Th17 cells and enhancing the ratio of Treg/Th17 cells, and inhibited binding of 3-P14 to antibodies and MHC II molecules.A modified peptide involving alteration of a critical motif in a nephritogenic T cell epitope alleviated anti-GBM GN in a rat model.

To explain this heterogeneity, we sought to identify a composite signature predictive of insulin secretion, using a collaborative assay evaluation and analysis pipeline that incorporated multiple cellular and serum measures reflecting beta cell health and immune system activity. The ability to predict decline in insulin secretion would be useful for patient stratification for clinical trial enrollment or therapeutic selection. Analytes from 12 qualified assays were measured in shared samples from subjects newly diagnosed with T1D. We developed a computational tool to identify a composite panel associated with decline in insulin secretion over 2 years after diagnosis. The tool employs multiple filtering steps to reduce data dimensionality, incorporates error-estimation techniques including cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, and is flexible to assay type, clinical outcome and disease setting. Using this novel analytical tool, we identified a panel of immune markers that, in combination, are highly associated with loss of insulin secretion.

We developed a series of small-molecule MYC inhibitors that engage MYC inside cells, disrupt MYC/MAX dimers, and impair MYC-driven gene expression. The compounds enhance MYC phosphorylation on threonine-58, consequently increasing proteasome-mediated MYC degradation. The initial lead, MYC inhibitor 361 (MYCi361), suppressed in vivo tumor growth in mice, increased tumor immune cell infiltration, upregulated PD-L1 on tumors, and sensitized tumors to anti-PD1 . However, 361 demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index. An improved analog, MYCi975 showed better tolerability.

At the cellular level, these tumours are composed of a mixture of neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells, including tumour-associated macrophages and endothelial cells. Cerebral oedema is a near-universal occurrence in patients afflicted with glioblastoma and it is almost exclusively managed with the corticosteroid dexamethasone despite significant drawbacks associated with its use. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks interleukin-1 production in both bone marrow-derived and brain resident macrophage populations following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon gamma. Additionally, dexamethasone is shown to inhibit downstream effectors of interleukin-1 signalling in both macrophage populations. Co-culture of bone marrow-derived macrophages with organotypic tumour slices results in an upregulation of interleukin-1 cytokines, an effect that is absent in co-cultured microglia. Genetic ablation of interleukin-1 ligands or receptor in mice bearing RCAS/tv-a-induced platelet-derived growth factor B-overexpressing glioblastoma results in reduced oedema and partial restoration of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, respectively; similar to results obtained with vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization. We establish that tumours from dexamethasone-treated mice exhibit reduced infiltration of cells of the myeloid and lymphoid compartments, an effect that should be considered during clinical trials for  in glioblastoma patients. Additionally, we emphasize that caution should be used when immune profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing data are interpreted from fresh glioblastoma patient samples, as nearly all patients receive dexamethasone after diagnosis. Collectively, this evidence suggests that interleukin-1 signalling inhibition and dexamethasone treatment share therapeutic efficacies and establishes interleukin-1 signalling as an attractive and specific therapeutic target for the management of glioblastoma-associated cerebral oedema.© The Author(s) (2019).

The goal of this study was to evaluate transcriptional signatures previously reported in the literature in an independent cohort of NSCLC patients receiving ICB.This retrospective study analyzed transcriptional profiles from pre-treatment tumor samples of 52 chemotherapy-refractory advanced NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. Gene signatures based on published reports were created and examined for their association with response to therapy and progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS).Two signatures predicting response and outcomes were identified. One reflected the degree of immune infiltration and upregulation of interferon-gamma-induced genes. A second reflected the EMT status. Compared to those not responding to therapy, patients whose tumors responded to ICB had higher scores in an inflammatory gene signature (6.0 ± 2.9 vs -5.5 ± 3.4, p = 0.014) or a more epithelial phenotype (-1.7 ± 1.0 vs 2.1 ± 1.2, p = 0.016). Both signatures demonstrated a satisfactory predictive accuracy for response: AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.84) for the inflammatory and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.85) for EMT signatures, respectively. A weighted score combining EMT and inflammatory signatures showed increased predictive value with AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Kaplan-Meier curves for patients above and below the median combined score showed a significant separation for PFS and OS (all p < 0.01, log rank test).The EMT/Inflammation signature score may be useful in directing checkpoint inhibitor therapy in lung cancer and suggests that reversal of EMT might augment efficacy of ICB.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent professional antigen-presenting cells and are involved in the induction and regulation of antitumor immune responses. DC-based  has been used in clinical trials for PC. Although safety, efficacy, and immune activation were reported in patients with PC, DC vaccines have not yet fulfilled their promise. Additional strategies for combinatorial approaches aimed to augment and sustain the antitumor specific immune response elicited by DC vaccines are currently being investigated. Here, we will discuss DC vaccination immunotherapies that are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation and potential combination approaches for treating and improving the survival of PC patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor immunity with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor immunity produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors. Overall, U3-1402 is a promising candidate as a partner of  for such patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h1><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with  were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to . Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

How myeloid cells acquire the protumoral properties during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. We report here that the polarity protein TIPE2 (tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8-like 2) mediates the functional polarization of murine and human MDSCs by specifying their pro- and antitumoral properties. Tumor cells induced the expression of TIPE2 in Gr1CD11b cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS). TIPE2 in turn increased the expression of protumoral mediators such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β while inhibiting the expression of antitumoral mediators. Consequently, tumor growth in TIPE2-deficient mice was significantly diminished, and TIPE2-deficient MDSCs markedly inhibited tumor growth upon adoptive transfer. Pharmaceutical blockade of ROS inhibited TIPE2 expression in MDSCs and reduced tumor growth in mice. These findings indicate that TIPE2 plays a key role in the functional polarization of MDSCs and represents a new therapeutic target for cancer .© 2019 Yan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672626>Cationic Synthetic Long Peptides-Loaded Nanogels: An Efficient Therapeutic Vaccine formulation for induction of T-cell Responses.</a></h1><p>Recent studies have shown a high potency of protein-based vaccines for cell-mediated cancer . However, due to their poor cellular uptake, efficient immune responses with soluble protein antigens are often not observed. As a result of superior cellular uptake, nanogels loaded with antigenic peptides were investigated in this study as carrier systems for cancer . Different synthetic long peptides (SLPs) containing the CTL and CD4 T-helper (Help) epitopes were synthesized and covalently conjugated via disulfide bonds to the polymeric network of cationic dextran nanogels. Cationic nanogels with a size of 210 nm, positive zeta potential (+24 mV) and high peptide loading content (15%) showed triggered release of the loaded peptides under reducing conditions. An in vitro study demonstrated the capability of cationic nanogels to maturate dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, covalently SLP-loaded nanogels adjuvanted with poly(I:C) showed superior CD8 T cell responses compared to soluble peptides and nanogel formulations with physically loaded peptides both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, covalently SLPs-loaded cationic nanogels are a promising system to provoke immune responses for therapeutic cancer vaccination.Copyright © 2019.

Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor immunity by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious  for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681619>Possible Abscopal Effect Observed in Frontal Meningioma After Localized IMRT on Posterior Meningioma Resection Cavity Without Adjuvant .</a></h1><p> Localized radiation therapy (RT) is known to infrequently cause off-target or "abscopal" effects at distant metastatic lesions. The mechanism through which abscopal effects occur remains unknown, but is thought to be caused by a humoral immune response to tumor-specific antigens generated by RT. Combination treatment regimens involving RT and  to boost the humoral immune response have demonstrated synergistic effects in promoting and accelerating abscopal effects in metastatic cancer. Nevertheless, abscopal effects, particularly after RT alone, remain exceedingly rare.  We report the case of an 84-year-old man with an atypical meningioma, who demonstrated a radiographically significant response to an untreated second intracranial lesion, likely also a meningioma, after intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to a separate, detatched resection cavity. Serial annual MRI imaging starting at 2- to 3.5-year (most recent) post-IMRT follow-up demonstrated a persistent decrease in both tumor size and surrounding edema in the untreated second lesion, suggestive of a possible abscopal effect.  We describe here the first report of a potential abscopal effect in meningioma, summarize the limited literature on the topic of abscopal effects in cancer, and detail the existing hypothesis on how this phenomenon may occur and possibly relate to the development of future treatments for patients with metastatic disease.Copyright © 2019 Golub, Kwan, Knisely and Schulder.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672020>Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Omalizumab in the Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670623>Non-Ige Mediated Food Allergy.</a></h1><p>Food allergies, defined as an immune response to food proteins, affect as many as 8% of young children and 2% of adults in westernized countries, and their prevalence appears to be rising like all allergic diseases. In addition to well-recognized urticaria and anaphylaxis triggered by IgE antibody-mediated immune responses, there is an increasing recognition of cell-mediated disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis and food protein-induced enterocolitis. Non-IgE-Mediated gastrointestinal food allergies are an heterogeneous group of food allergies in which there is an immune reaction against food but the primary pathogenesis is not a production of IgE and activation of mastcells and basophils. Those diseases tend to affect mainly the gastrointestinal tract and can present as acute (FPIES) or chronic reaction such as Celiac disease, Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), Food Protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP). The role of food allergy in Non-EoE gastrointestinal Eosinophilc disorders (Non-EoE EGID) is poorly defined. In some diseases like Celiac Disease and possibly EoE T cell seems to play a major role in initiating the immunological reaction against food, however in FPIES and FPIAP the mechanism of sensitization is not clear. Diagnosis require food challenges and/or endoscopies in most of the patients. Celiac disease have some validated biomarkers but none of the other Non-IgE mediated food allergies have such biomarkers that can be used for monitoring or diagnosis of the diseases. Treatment of Non-IgE food allergy rely on diet (FPIES, Celiac disease and EoE) and/or use of drugs (i.e steroids, PPI) in EoE and Non-EoE EGID.

However, the efficacy and safety of anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody have not been fully elucidated in Chinese melanoma patients, who show high frequency of mucosal and acral melanoma subtypes; besides, the factors influencing the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody have not been evaluated broadly.Patients with advanced melanoma treated with regimens containing anti-PD-1 antibody from June 2016 to January 2019 were evaluated. Baseline characteristics and blood parameters were assessed, and outcome and adverse events were evaluated according to different regimens. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.A total of 51 patients with advanced melanoma were included in this study. The overall objective response rate (ORR) was 17.6%, the disease control rate was 58.5%, and the median time to progression was 5.2 months. The ORR of patients with PD-1 blockade-based combination therapy, without liver metastases and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) before PD-1 blockade, is higher than that of those not. Univariate analysis based on clinical features showed that ECOG scores, liver metastasis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CRP levels were the factors affecting time to progression (TTP). Multivariate analysis showed that elevated CRP before PD-1 blockade was an independent predictive factor for ORR of PD-1 blockade therapy (=0.009), while only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was an independent predictor for TTP (=0.032). The treatment was well tolerated in these cohort patients, and there was no treatment-related death.Anti-PD-1 antibody-containing regimen was safe and effective in Chinese patients with advanced melanoma, and elevated CRP and ECOG score were independent factors predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.Copyright © 2019 Lingdi Zhao et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658961>Therapeutic breast reconstruction using gene therapy delivered IFN-gamma .</a></h1><p>After mastectomy, breast reconstruction is increasingly performed using autologous tissue with the aim of improving quality of life. During this procedure, autologous tissue is excised, relocated, and reattached using vascular anastomoses at the site of the extirpated breast. The period during which the tissue is ex vivo may allow genetic modification without any systemic exposure to the vector. Could such access be used to deliver therapeutic agents using the tissue flap as a vehicle? Such delivery may be more efficient than systemic treatment, in terms of oncological outcomes. The cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) has antitumor effects, but systemic toxicity that could be circumvented if its effect can be localized by delivery of the IFNγ gene via gene therapy to autologous tissue used for breast reconstruction, which then releases IFNγ and exerts anti-tumor effects. In a rat model of loco-regional recurrence (LRR) using both MADB-106-Luc and MAD-MB-231-Luc breast cancer cells, autologous tissue was transduced ex vivo with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding IFNγ. The therapeutic reconstruction released IFNγ at the LRR site and eliminated cancer cells, significantly decreased tumor burden (P<0.05), and increased survival by 33% (P<0.05) compared to sham reconstruction. Mechanistically, localized IFNγ  stimulated M1 macrophages to target cancer cells within the regional confines of the modified tumor environment.

Treg accumulation in the leukemic hematopoietic microenvironment (LHME) has adverse impacts on patient outcomes. The mechanism and effective methods of disrupting Treg accumulation in the LHME have not been well established. Here, we studied the distribution and characteristics of Tregs in the LHME, investigated the effects of Treg ablation on leukemia progression, explored the mechanisms leading to Treg accumulation, and studied whether blocking Treg migration to the LHME delayed leukemia progression in MLL-AF9-induced mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models using wildtype (WT) and Foxp3 mice. Increased accumulation of more activated Tregs was detected in the LHME. Inducible Treg ablation prolonged the survival of AML mice by promoting the antileukemic effects of CD8 T cells. Furthermore, both local expansion and migration accounted for Treg accumulation in the LHME. Moreover, blocking the CCL3-CCR1/CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 axes inhibited Treg accumulation in the LHME and delayed leukemia progression.

We tested the performance of pTuneos on the melanoma cancer vaccine cohort data and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-recognized neopeptide data. pTuneos is able to predict the MHC presentation and T cell recognition ability of the candidate neoantigens, and the actual immunogenicity of single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based neopeptides considering their natural processing and presentation, surpassing the existing tools with a comprehensive and quantitative benchmark of their neoantigen prioritization performance and running time. pTuneos was further tested on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort data as well as the melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort data undergoing checkpoint blockade . The overall neoantigen immunogenicity score proposed by pTuneos is demonstrated to be a powerful and pan-cancer marker for survival prediction compared to traditional well-established biomarkers.In summary, pTuneos provides the state-of-the-art one-stop and user-friendly solution for prioritizing SNV-based candidate neoepitopes, which could help to advance research on next-generation cancer immunotherapies and personalized cancer vaccines. pTuneos is available at https://github.com/bm2-lab/pTuneos , with a Docker version for quick deployment at https://cloud.docker.com/u/bm2lab/repository/docker/bm2lab/ptuneos .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668486>Automated Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant generation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells from a complete apheresis product using a hollow-fiber bioreactor system overcomes a major hurdle in the manufacture of dendritic cells for cancer vaccines.</a></h1><p>Although dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer vaccines represent a promising treatment strategy, its exploration in the clinic is hampered due to the need for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facilities and associated trained staff for the generation of large numbers of DCs.

Dose-intensified chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation failed to improve the prognosis of patients with ATL; however, we first revealed that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) might improve their prognosis. We showed that reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation using peripheral blood was feasible for elderly patients. Further, the prognosis of patients in remission, who receive cord blood transplantation, has been recently improved and is equivalent to that of patients who receive transplants from other stem cell sources. As for the timing of HCT, the patients who underwent transplantation early showed better outcomes than those who underwent transplantation late. Based on the analysis of patients with aggressive ATL, including those who received transplants, we identified five prognostic factors for poor outcomes: acute-type ATL, poor performance status, high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, hypercalcemia, and high C-reactive protein level. Next, we developed a new prognostic index: the modified ATL-PI. The overall survival (OS) rates were significantly higher in patients who underwent allo-HCT than those who did not in the intermediate and high-risk groups stratified using the modified ATL-PI.

However, a retrospective analysis that the risk of severe, acute, and corticosteroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease was higher in patients who received mogamulizumab before allo-HCT, and that mogamulizumab might increase the transplant-related mortality (TRM) rates and decrease the OS rates compared to those of patients who did not receive mogamulizumab. However, our recent study showed that administration of mogamulizumab before allo-HCT tended to improve the survival of patients with ATL. In conclusion, allo-HCT procedures for patients with aggressive ATL have considerably progressed and have helped improve the prognosis of these patients; however, many concerns still remain to be resolved. Further development of allo-HCT by using new molecular targeting agents is required for the improvement of cure rates in patients with ATL.Copyright © 2019 Utsunomiya.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667366>Identification of a monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1 in a manner requiring PD-1 Asn58 glycosylation.</a></h1><p>Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is inhibitory receptor and immune checkpoint protein. Blocking the interaction of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/ L2 is able to active T-cell-mediated antitumor response. Monoclonal antibody-based drugs targeting PD-1 pathway have exhibited great promise in cancer therapy. Here we show that MW11-h317, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, displays high affinity for PD-1 and blocks PD-1 interactions with PD-L1/L2. MW11-h317 can effectively induce T-cell-mediated immune response and inhibit tumor growth in mouse model. Crystal structure of PD-1/MW11-h317 Fab complex reveals that both the loops and glycosylation of PD-1 are involved in recognition and binding, in which Asn58 glycosylation plays a critical role. The unique glycan epitope in PD-1 to MW11-h317 is different from the first two approved clinical PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab. These results suggest MW11-h317 as a therapeutic monoclonal antibody of PD-1 glycosylation-targeting which may become efficient alternative for cancer therapy.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682868>Galectin-3 modulation of T-cell activation: mechanisms of membrane remodelling.</a></h1><p>Galectin-3 (Gal3) is a multifaceted protein which belongs to a family of lectins and binds β-galactosides. Gal3 expression is altered in many types of cancer, with increased expression generally associated with poor prognosis. Although the mechanisms remain unknown, Gal3 has been implicated in several biological processes involved in cancer progression, including suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses. Extracellular Gal3 binding to the plasma membrane of T cells alters membrane organization and the formation of an immunological synapse. Its multivalent capacity allows Gal3 to interact specifically with different membrane proteins and lipids, influencing endocytosis, trafficking and T cell receptor signalling. The ability of Gal3 to inhibit T cell responses may provide a mechanism by which Gal3 aids in cancer progression. In this review, we seek to give an overview of the mechanisms by which Gal3 alters the spatial organization of cell membranes and how these processes impact on T cell activation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating inflammation and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors. In addition, we discuss the prospects for the application of IL-33 and ST2 as diagnostic biomarkers and targets for cancer .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659103>The FOXC2 Transcription Factor Promotes Melanoma Outgrowth and Regulates Expression of Genes Associated With Drug Resistance and Interferon Responsiveness.</a></h1><p>The FOXC2 transcription factor promotes the progression of several cancer types, but has not been investigated in the context of melanoma cells. To study FOXC2's influence on melanoma progression, we generated a FOXC2-deficient murine melanoma cell line and evaluated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient datasets.We compared tumor growth kinetics and RNA-seq/qRT-PCR gene expression profiles from wild-type versus FOXC2-deficient murine melanomas. We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of TCGA data to assess the influence of FOXC2 gene expression on melanoma patients' response to chemotherapy and .FOXC2 promotes melanoma progression and regulates the expression of genes associated with multiple oncogenic pathways, including the oxidative stress response, xenobiotic metabolism, and interferon responsiveness. FOXC2 expression in melanoma correlates negatively with patient response to chemotherapy and .FOXC2 drives a tumor-promoting gene expression program in melanoma and is a prognostic indicator of patient response to multiple cancer therapies.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.2-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16.2 months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting. Our data support its use in clinical practice for pretreated non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with older age or CNS metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two of these phase III randomized trials showed that the anti-PD1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab were superior to investigators' choice chemotherapy in second-line platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. Recently, a third phase III randomized trial, KEYNOTE-048, showed that pembrolizumab with chemotherapy was superior to the EXTREME regimen (cis- or carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cetuximab) in all patients, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was superior in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in first-line R/M HNSCC. Pembrolizumab is now approved as monotherapy in PD-L1 expressing disease (combined positive score ≥1) or in combination with chemotherapy for all patients with R/M HNSCC. Thus, PD-L1 biomarker testing will be routinely used in R/M HNSCC, and this employs a scoring system that incorporates immune cell staining, referred to as the combined positive score (CPS). Additionally, for the 85% of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, clinical judgment will guide the choice of pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, until more detailed clinical data are forthcoming to better inform this decision. In this article we discuss the clinical trials leading to these therapeutic advances and we will review initial results from clinical trials in previously untreated, locally advanced disease, and those using novel combinations of checkpoint inhibitors, co-stimulatory agonists, and therapeutic vaccines.Copyright © 2019.

An understanding of alterations in the host immunity with advancing age is, therefore, important for designing immune therapy for elderly cancer patients. In this context, not much is known about age-associated alterations in the immune system in oral cancer.To evaluate age-associated alterations in the immune system, which might affect anti-tumor immune responses in oral cancer, we performed a comparative analysis of the proportion of different immune cells, the proliferative capacity of T cell compartment, and the response against immune therapies targeting immune check point molecules between young and aged oral cancer-bearing mice.The proportion of immune regulatory cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, was significantly increased in aged mice compared to that in young mice. Moreover, the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on both CD4 and CD8 T cells was elevated in aged mice compared to that in young mice, and the proliferative abilities of CD4 and CD8 T cells derived from aged mice were significantly reduced following stimulation of T-cell receptors. Moreover, tumor growth was significantly enhanced in aged mice compared to that in young mice. However, immunotherapies targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, and PD-L1 resulted in faster tumor regression in aged mice than in young mice.Together, our results indicate that age-associated alterations in the immune system are directly associated with the impairment of anti-tumor immunity in aged mice bearing oral cancer, and might facilitate the progression of the tumor.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

By definition, these patients are at increased risk of a positive resection margin, however, controversy exists with regards to necessity of radical surgery and optimum pathways with no consensus on definitive treatment. A surgery first approach is possible though outcomes vary but patients can have an efficient pathway to surgery, particularly if biliary drainage is avoided which limits overall complications. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is emerging as a widely used strategy to improve oncological outcomes, including resection margin status. However, some patients progress on NAT whilst others suffer major complications whilst elderly patients are unlikely to be offered effective NAT limiting the widespread applicability of this therapy. In this article an overview of the entire pathway is presented along with assimilation of current best evidence to determine optimal routes to surgery for BRPC with venous involvement.Copyright © 2019 Pandé and Roberts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677604>Engineered Jurkat Cells for Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen on Prostate Cancer Cells by Nanobody-Based Chimeric Antigen Receptor</a></h1><p>Recently, modification of T cells with CAR has been an attractive approach for adoptive  of cancers. Typically, CARs contain a scFv. Most often, scfvs are derived from a monoclonal antibody of murine origin and may be a trigger for host immune system that leads to the T-cell clearance. Nanobody is a specific antigen-binding fragment derived from camelid that has great homology to human VH and low immunogenic potential. Therefore, in this study, nanobody was employed instead of scFv in CAR construct.In this study, a CAR was constructed based on a nanobody against PSMA (NBPII-CAR). At first, Jurkat cells were electroporated with NBPII-CAR, and then flow cytometry was performed for NBPII-CAR expression. For functional analysis, CAR T cells were co-cultured with prostate cancer cells and analyzed for IL-2 secretion, CD25 expression, and cell proliferation.Flow cytometry results confirmed the expression of NBPII-CAR on the transfected Jurkat cells. Our data showed the specificity of engineered Jurkat cells against prostate cancer cells by not only increasing the IL-2 cytokine (about 370 pg/ml) but also expressing the T-cell activation marker CD25 (about 30%). In addition, proliferation of engineered Jurkat cells increased nearly 60% when co-cultured with LNCaP (PSMA+), as compared with DU145 (PSMA-).Here, we describe the ability of nanobody-based CAR to recognize PSMA that leads to the activation of Jurkat cells. This construct might be used as a promising candidate for clinical applications in prostate cancer therapy.</p></html>
