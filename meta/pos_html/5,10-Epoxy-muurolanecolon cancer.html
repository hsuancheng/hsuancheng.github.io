In this study, we explored the mechanism of -FU resistance by bioinformatics analysis of the NCBI public dataset series GSE81005. Fifteen hub genes were screened out of 582 different expressed genes. Modules of the hub genes in protein-protein interaction networks gathered to TOP2 showed a decrease in HCT-8 cells but an increase in -FU-resistant HCT-8/-FU cells with -FU exposure. Downregulation of TOP2 with siRNA or miR-494 transfection resulted in an increase of cytotoxicity and decrease of cell colonies to -FU for HCT-8/-FU cells. Moreover, we found that an ethanol extract of Spica Prunellae (EESP), which is a traditional Chinese medicine with clinically beneficial effects in various cancers, was able to enhance the sensitivity of -FU in HCT-8/-FU cells and partly reverse the -FU resistance effect. It significantly helped suppress cell growth and induced cell apoptosis in HCT-8/-FU cells with the expression of TOP2 being significantly suppressed, which increased by -FU. Consistently, miR-494, which reportedly regulates TOP2, exhibited reverse trends in EESP/-FU combination treatment. These results suggested that Spica Prunellae may be beneficial in the treatment of -FU-resistant CRC patients.Copyright © 2019 Yi Fang et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567930>Definitive Chemoradiation for Rectal : Is There a Role for Dose Escalation? A National  Database Study.</a></h1><p>Surgery remains the standard of care in rectal . Select patients will not undergo surgery for reasons such as medical inoperability or a watch-and-wait approach and instead are managed with definitive chemoradiation.We used the National  Database to identify overall survival and predictors thereof in the nonoperative management of patients with rectal .This was a retrospective review.This study used deidentified data from the National  Database.We queried the national  database from 2004 to 2014 for stage 1 to 3 rectal adenocarcinoma treated with only chemotherapy and radiation to definitive doses. Dose escalated therapy was defined as >54 Gy.Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify sociodemographic, treatment, and tumor characteristics predictive of dose escalation and overall survival. Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias.Among the 6311 patients eligible for the study, 11% were treated with doses >54 Gy. Earlier stage and increased age/comorbidity patients were more likely to receive dose escalation, and patients with more recent treatment and treatment at an academic facility were less likely. The median follow-up time was 31 months (range, 2-154 mo). Three- and -year overall survival rates for all patients were 60% and 46%. Patients treated with dose escalation had a median survival of 33 months compared with 56 months for those treated with ≤54 Gy (p < 0.0001).The main limitation is the inherent selection bias present in National  Database studies. Important treatment details and outcomes as they relate to a definitive chemoradiation approach in rectal  are lacking. Salvage therapy was also not recorded, which in this population could be surgery.In this analysis, dose escalation in the nonoperative management of rectal  was associated with a lower overall survival compared with more conventional doses. Careful patient selection and enrollment on appropriate clinical trials may be warranted in the nonoperative setting. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B15. LA QUIMIORRADIACIÓN DEFINITIVA PARA EL CÁNCER RECTAL: ¿HAY LUGAR PARA EL AUMENTO DE LA DOSIS? UN ESTUDIO DE BASE DE DATOS NACIONAL DEL CÁNCER:: La cirugía sigue siendo el estándar en el tratamiento del cáncer rectal. Algunos pacientes no son quirúrgicos por razones como, no ser operables o con el enfoque de ver y esperar, y en su lugar son tratados con la quimiorradiación definitiva.Utilizamos la base de datos nacional del cáncer para identificar la supervivencia general y los factores predictivos de la misma, en el tratamiento no quirúrgico de pacientes con cáncer rectal.Esta fue una revisión retrospectiva.Utilizamos los datos identificados en la base de datos nacional del cáncer.Se consultó la base de datos nacional del cáncer del 2004-2014, para adenocarcinoma rectal en estadio 1-3, tratada únicamente con quimioterapia y radiación hasta la dosis definitiva. La terapia de aumento de la dosis se definió como >54 Gy.Se realizaron análisis univariables y multivariables para identificar características sociodemográficas, de tratamiento y predictivas del aumento de la dosis y supervivencia en general. Los índices de riesgo proporcionales de Cox ajustados a la propensión para la supervivencia, se utilizaron para tener en cuenta el sesgo de indicación.Entre los 6311 pacientes elegibles para el estudio, el 11% fue tratado con dosis >54 Gy. Los pacientes en estadios tempranos y con mayor edad/comorbilidad, tenían más probabilidades de recibir aumento de la dosis, y menos propensos los pacientes con tratamientos recientes y de centros académicos. El tiempo medio de seguimiento fue de 31 meses (2-154 meses). Las tasas de supervivencia global de tres y cinco años para todos los pacientes, fueron respectivamente del 60% y 46%. Los pacientes tratados con aumento de la dosis, tuvieron una supervivencia media de 33 meses, en comparación con los 56 meses para los pacientes tratados con ≤54 Gy (p < 0,0001).La principal limitación es el inherente sesgo en la selección, presente en los estudios de la base de datos nacional del cáncer. Faltan los detalles importantes del tratamiento y los resultados en relación con el enfoque definitivo de quimiorradiación en cáncer rectal. Tampoco se registró la terapia de rescate, que en esta población podría ser la cirugía.En este análisis, el aumento de la dosis en el manejo no quirúrgico del cáncer rectal, se asoció con una menor supervivencia global, en comparación con la dosis más convencional. La cuidadosa selección del paciente y la inscripción en los apropiados ensayos clínicos, pueden estar justificados en el entorno no quirúrgico.

Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty acids, mainly oleic acid and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that oleic acid (1-100 μM) but not elaidic acid induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by -lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic acid (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by oleic acid. These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic acid that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the arachidonic acid cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action. In conclusion, oleic acid and oleic acid in the presence of olive oil representative minor components have opposite effects, suggesting that the consumption of seed oils, high oleic acid seed oils, or olive oil will probably have different effects on CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592007>Reliability of Contrast CT and Positron Emission Tomography in Post-Surgical Colorectal  and Its Association with Obesity.</a></h1><p>Post-surgical recurrence of   occurs in one-third of patients within the first two years, so early detection is important. The assessment of the therapeutic response is important to change protocol strategy. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT, a valuable tool gives both metabolic and anatomic information for whole-body regions. Obesity is an important risk factor for colorectal .To evaluate post-surgical and therapeutic colorectal  by PET/CT and study obesity association to its prognosis.This was a prospective study involved 93 patients with, post-surgical colorectal  examined by PET/CT, then follow up after 4-6 months.There was a statistically significant difference between PET/CT and contrast CT. The sensitivity& the specificity were (96.4%-100% & 92.3%-98.2%) for PET/CT and (84.2%-90.2% & 76.%-85.4%) for contrast CT respectively. Post-therapeutic follow up showed; progressive course (24.%), stationary course (26.4%), partial regression (28.3%) and complete regression course (20.8%). Obesity is a risk factor for progression with highly statistically significant to treatment response. Obese patients had a progressive or stationary course of the disease. Also, there was a highly statistically significant association between total abdominal fat & visceral abdominal fat areas with good response of treatment.PET/CT is the most appropriate imaging technique to detect any recurrence or metastases in post-surgical colorectal  with high sensitivity and specificity comparing to CT. Obesity is a predictor risk factor for prognosis of the disease, as generally and abdominally (total & visceral fat) had an association with therapeutic response.Copyright: © 2019 Safenaz Y.

It is important to establish practical guidelines wherein preoperative diagnosis of colorectal neoplasia and selection of endoscopic treatment procedures are appropriately outlined and to ensure that actual endoscopic treatment is useful and safe in general hospitals when performed in accordance with guidelines. In cooperation with the Japanese Society for  of the  and Rectum, the Japanese Society of Coloproctology, and the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology, the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society compiled colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)/endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) guidelines by using evidence-based methods in 2014.

We sought to determine if completeness of preoperative care was associated with pathologic specimen quality and postoperative morbidity.Clinical stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent elective low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection were identified from the 2016-2017 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database. The 3 preoperative NSQIP variables (colonoscopy, stoma marking, and neoadjuvant chemoradiation) were used to divide patients into 2 cohorts: complete vs incomplete preoperative care. The primary outcome was a composite higher pathologic specimen quality score (>12 lymph nodes, negative circumferential, and negative distal margins). The secondary outcome was 30-day morbidity. Preoperative characteristics were compared with ANOVAs and chi-square tests. Outcomes measures were evaluated with logistic regression.We identified 1,125 patients: 591 (52.%) complete and 534 (47.%) incomplete. The complete group was younger, had more women, lower-third rectal tumors, clinical stage III disease, and neoadjuvant treatment. The complete group had higher odds of better pathologic specimen quality after adjusting for age, sex, tumor location, stage, and neoadjuvant therapy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.75, p = 0.001). The complete group had decreased rates of transfusions (odds ratio [OR] 0.47, p < 0.001), postoperative ileus (OR 0.67, p = 0.01), sepsis (OR 0.32, p = 0.01), and readmissions (OR 0.60, p = 0.003). Other complications did not statistically differ between groups.Complete preoperative care in rectal adenocarcinoma is associated with higher pathologic specimen quality and reduced postoperative morbidity.

In the CME group, the distances between the tumor and the high vascular tie (HVT; 12.6 cm), and between the closest bowel wall and HVT (10.4±0.9 cm) was significantly greater than that of the CRR group (11. cm and 9.3±1.0 cm, respectively; <0.001). In the CME group, the number of retrieved lymph nodes (23.2) was significantly higher, and the volume of intraoperative bleeding (108.4 mL) was less than that of the CRR (14.0 and 128.7 mL; <0.001). The length of resected bowel in the 2 groups was similar (25.8±0.7 cm and 25.±2.1 cm; =0.106), as was the operative time, postoperative hospitalization, time of first bowel movement, and complications. The 3-year recurrence rate of the CME group (8.4%) was significantly lower than that of the CRR (20.0%), the 3-year overall survival was significantly higher (93.% cf. 85.0%), and the survival rates of T4 stage, N1 stage, pTNM stage II, pTNM stage III and lympho vascular invasion were significantly higher (<0.05).

However, national database analyses demonstrate that laparotomy is still performed for this indication. This study aims to assess the route of hysterectomy performed by gynecologic surgeons who manage endometrial  in the state of Florida.All patients in Florida who were diagnosed with endometrial  (both ICD-9 Code 182.0 and ICD-10 Code C54.10), and who received a related surgical procedure from 2014 to 2016 were included. Eligible patients were identified using the Florida Inpatient Discharge Dataset, the Florida Ambulatory and Emergency Discharge Dataset, the Hospital Compare dataset, and the Healthcare Cost Report Information System. The primary surgeon was identified using their national provider identifier (NPI) number. Each surgeon's overall operative volume, MIS volume, and percentage of MIS procedures were collected.Hysterectomy for endometrial  was performed in 6086 patients; 4959 (81.%) underwent MIS and 1127 (18.%) had an abdominal approach. Hysterectomy for endometrial  was performed by 368 providers in Florida (range of 2-244 surgeries). The percentage of MIS to total hysterectomies for providers who performed 1-10 cases was 72.1%; 11-25 cases was 40.9%; 26-100 cases was 80.1%; and more than 100 cases was 86.1%. Variation in operative route exists amongst low- and high-volume providers.Statewide databases can be used to identify surgical trends for policy purposes. These findings support the referral of patients with endometrial  to surgeons with high MIS volumes.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567919>Age at Diagnosis and Sex Are Associated With Long-term Deficits in Disease-Specific Health-Related Quality of Life of Survivors of  and Rectal : A Population-Based Study.</a></h1><p>Despite the increasing number of younger individuals diagnosed with  and rectal , research on the long-term disease-specific health-related quality of life of younger (<50 years) survivors of  and rectal  is scarce.Our study aimed to compare disease-specific functional deficits and symptoms of survivors of  and rectal   to 16 years postdiagnosis, stratified by age at diagnosis and by sex.This is a cross-sectional study.We used data from the population-based  Survivorship-A multi-Regional study in collaboration with  population-based German  registries.Survivors of  and rectal  were included in the study.Respondents completed the disease-specific European Organization for Research and Treatment of  Quality of Life colorectal  module.

A -fluorouracil (-FU)-related cytotoxicity is attenuated in MSH3-deficient  cells. Reported here is the predictive value of EMAST in CRCs with Stage II or III disease treated with -FU-based chemotherapy.EMAST status was analyzed in 157 patients with CRC with Stage II or III disease and MSH3 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The patients treated with -FU-based chemotherapy were studied in terms of the links of EMAST status with MSH3 expression, clinicopathological features, and overall survival (OS).A total of 63 patients (40.1%) had EMAST positive (EMAST ) CRC and 77 patients (49.0%) had low MSH3 expression. EMAST tumors were associated with advanced TNM stage and poor and moderately differentiated tumor. EMAST CRC was more frequently observed in tumors with low expression of MSH3 in the nucleus (n = 53; 84.1%, p < .001). On multivariate analysis, patients with EMAST status had a worse OS (hazard ratio: 2.489, 95% confidence interval [1.149-.394], and p = .021). Worse OS in EMAST patients who received -FU-based chemotherapy was significantly more common compared with EMAST CRCs.There is a link between EMAST and reduced nuclear expression of MSH3. There is worse survival in patients with EMAST CRC after -FU-based chemotherapy. According to our findings, adjuvant -FU-based chemotherapy might not be advantageous in EMAST CRCs with Stage II or III disease.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567925>Differential Survival Benefits of -Fluorouracil-Based Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Patients With Microsatellite-Stable Stage III Colorectal  According to the Tumor Budding Status: A Retrospective Analysis.</a></h1><p>Recent research has established tumor budding as a prognostic factor and a possible histomorphologic reflection of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal , highlighting the ability of  cells exhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition to resist chemotherapy.This study aimed to investigate the clinical benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy according to the tumor budding status in microsatellite-stable stage III colorectal .This was a retrospective study of 2 cohorts.The study was conducted at the National Defense Medical College in Japan.We reviewed 2 data sets of patients with microsatellite-stable stage III colorectal  with curatively intended surgery (R0) from 1999 to 2005 (first cohort; n = 203) and 2006 to 2012 (second cohort; n = 346).

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of levoketoconazole in patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome.SONICS is a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, single-arm study in which we recruited adults (≥18 years) with confirmed Cushing's syndrome and a mean 24-h urinary free cortisol (mUFC) of at least 1· times the upper limit of normal from 60 hospital and community sites in 19 countries (15 countries in Europe, and Canada, Israel, Turkey, and the USA). Patients were treated with oral levoketoconazole in a 2-21 week incremental dose-titration phase starting at 150 mg twice daily (150 mg increments until mUFC normalisation, maximum 600 mg twice daily) and a 6-month maintenance phase. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with mUFC normalisation at end of maintenance, without dose increase during the maintenance phase (in the intention-to-treat population). Prespecified adverse events of special interest were potential liver toxicity, corrected QT prolongation, and adrenal insufficiency. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, .Between July 30, 2014, and June 30, 2017, 201 individuals were screened and 94 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication. Of the 94 patients, 80 (85%) had pituitary Cushing's syndrome. Mean mUFC at baseline was 671·4 nmol/24 h (243·3 μg/24 h), which is 4·9 times the upper limit of normal. Of the 77 patients who advanced to the maintenance phase, 62 (81%) had mUFC normalisation by end-of-dose titration. At the end of the 6-month maintenance phase, 29 (31%) of 94 patients were responders; the least-squares mean estimate of the proportion of responders was 0·30 (95% CI 0·21-0·40; p=0·0154 vs null hypothesis of ≤0·20). The most common adverse events in the 94 patients were nausea (30 [32%]) and headache (26 [28%]). Adverse events led to study discontinuation in 12 (13%) of 94 patients. Two patients had a QT interval (Fridericia corrected) of more than 500 ms, and three patients had suspected adrenal insufficiency. Alanine aminotransferase reversibly increased to more than three times the upper limit of normal in ten (11%) patients. Four patients had serious adverse events that were considered probably or definitely related to the study drug: abnormal liver function test results (n=1), prolonged QT interval (n=2), and adrenal insufficiency (n=1). One person died from  carcinoma unrelated to study medication.Twice-daily oral levoketoconazole treatment led to sustained improvements in urinary free cortisol, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Levoketoconazole might represent a useful therapeutic option for the medical treatment of Cushing's syndrome.Strongbridge Biopharma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of  (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations.The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses.CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10-7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, , 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X 10-4.In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612509>Risk factors for survival following recurrence after first liver resection for colorectal  liver metastases.</a></h1><p>Management of recurrence following liver resection for colorectal  metastases is a topic of debate. We determined risk factors for survival following recurrence after liver resection.Long-term follow-up of patients in the PETCAM trial who had recurrence following liver resection. Risk groups were created according to their survival risk. Differences in overall survival (OS) between groups were estimated. Disease-free survival (DFS), patterns of disease recurrence and management were determined. Cox proportional hazard models, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test were used.Among 368 patients who underwent liver resection, 264 (72%) experienced disease recurrence (51% lung and 41% liver). Following liver resection, DFS: 17 months (95% CI, 14-19); OS: 57 months (95% CI, 46-70). In those who recurred, 120 (45%) received chemotherapy only, and 112 (42%) underwent second surgical resection. Among patients who experienced recurrence (n = 264), the high-risk group (more than one site of recurrence or disease-free duration <  months and node-positive disease) had median OS: 19 months (95% CI, 15-23) vs 36 months (95% CI, 30-48) for patients in the low-risk group (HR = 2.9, 95% CI, 2.2-3.9).Recurrence following liver resection is common.

We investigated whether infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associates with development and severity of colitis in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.We performed a retrospective analysis of fixed  tissues from 16 patients (12 men, 4 women, median age, 69. y) with colitis after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (9 patients treated with anti-CTLA4, 3 patients treated with anti-PD1, and 4 patients received a combination). Ten tissue samples were biopsies and 6 were collected during resection (4 surgeries for  perforation). Patients were treated between 2010 and 2018 in the United Kingdom. The tissues were analyzed by pathology, in situ hybridization (to detect EBV-encoded small RNAs [EBERs]), and immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were also collected. tissues from 4 of the 13 patients who received anti-CTLA4 (alone or in combination, 4 with  perforation) had EBV-positive lymphoproliferations that manifested as florid ulcers associated with polymorphous infiltrates containing EBV-positive blasts (CD30+ or CD30-negative, CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+), plasma cells (CD138+, CD20-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), and small B cells (CD20+, CD3-negative, and EBER+ or EBER-negative), consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs). In analyses of biopsies collected from 2 patients with EBVMCUs over multiple time points, we found that earlier biopsies had no or only a few EBV-positive cells, whereas 1 later biopsy had EBVMCU and co-infection with cytomegalovirus. EBVMCUs were associated with steroid-refractory colitis (100% of EBV-positive patients vs 12.% of EBV-negative patients; P=.008) and  perforation (100% of EBV-positive patients vs no EBV-negative patients; P=.001).We found that  tissues from 4/13 patients with colitis after anti-CTLA4 therapy (4/6 patients who underwent resection and 4/4 patients with  perforation) contained EBVMCUs. EBVMCUs seem to arise secondarily in areas of inflamed  due to immunosuppressive treatment for colitis.

This study revealed that I3M promotes the expression of death receptor  (DR5) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in HCT116 p53 cells, resulting in caspase-mediated apoptosis. However, this study demonstrated that HCT116 p53 cells were insensitive to I3M-mediated apoptosis, indicating that I3M-induced apoptosis depends on the p53 status of HCT116 cells. Additionally, in HCT116 p53 cells, I3M significantly increased Ras expression, while in HCT116 p53 cells, it reduced Ras expression. Furthermore, I3M remarkably increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were reduced in transient  knockdown, indicating that I3M-mediated apoptosis was promoted by p53-mediated ROS production. Our results also showed that I3M enhanced transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, resulted in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated DR5 expression, which was upregulated by ROS production in HCT116 p53 cells. Moreover, co-treatment with I3M and TRAIL enhanced DR5 expression, thereby triggering TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HCT116 p53 cells, which was interfered by a DR5-specific blocking chimeric antibody. In summary, I3M potently enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating DR5 expression via p53-mediated ROS production in HCT116 p53 cells. However, HCT116 p53 cells were less sensitive to I3M-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that I3M could be a promising anti- candidate against TRAIL-resistant p53  cells. Additionally, this study also revealed that I3M sensitizes colorectal  cells such as HT29 and SW480 to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547375>Effect of Juice and Extracts from  Root on the  Cells Caco-2.</a></h1><p>Colorectal  ranks 3rd in terms of  incidence.

The objective of the research was to analyze the effect of  juice and extracts on the viability, membrane integrity and types of cell death of Caco-2 cells. Juice and extracts were analyzed using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and in respect of the presence of antioxidants, total carbohydrates, protein, fat and polyphenols. The contents of cimifugin β-D-glucopyranoside, cimifugin, 4'-O-glucopyranosyl--O-methylvisamminol, imperatorin and protein were the highest in juice. 50% Hydroethanolic extract had the greatest antioxidant potential, concentration of polyphenols and fat. Water extract was characterized by the highest content of glutathione. Juice and 75% hydroethanolic extract contained the most carbohydrates. After the application of juice, 50% extract and the juice fraction containing the molecules with molecular weights >50 kDa, a decrease of the cell viability was noted.

Patients were stratified into two groups: early-onset CC (< 50 years old) and late-onset CC (≥ 50 years old). Outcome measures were hospital length of stay, 30-day complications, mortality, and readmission.We included a total of 15,957 patients in the analysis. Mean age was 65 ± 13 years, and 52% were male. Overall 10% of the patients had early-onset CC. Patients with early-onset CC were more likely to be black (11% vs 7%, p = 0.04) and Hispanic (8% vs 4%, p = 0.02). Additionally, they presented with a more aggressive tumor and higher TNM staging. Patients with early onset CC had lower 30-day complications (18% vs 22%, p = 0.02), shorter hospital length of stay (6[3-8] vs 8[-11], p = 0.03) and lower 30-day mortality (0.4% vs 1.8%, p = 0.04) compared to their counterparts. However, there was no difference between the two groups regarding 30-day readmission. On regression analysis, there was no difference between the two groups regarding study outcomes.Racial disparity does exist in the incidence of  in the young with higher incidence in blacks.

Deficiency in FECH was associated with many diseases, including protoporphyria. Correlation studies showed that variations of FECH expression was detected in human carcinomas and more specifically in . Nevertheless, the potential role of FECH in  carcinogenesis  was not depicted yet.A small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown FECH in human Caco-2  cells. The effect of FECH down-regulation on the cellular proliferation, the migration and the expression of target genes was assessed in  cells and compared to human normal fibroblasts.Following FECH down-regulation, our results demonstrated that the proliferation of Caco-2 cells was not affected. Furthermore, the migration of  and normal cells was affected, only when an additional stress factor (HO) was applied to the medium. The expression of twist, snail, hypoxia induced factor (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was reduced in Caco-2 cells. Conversely, VEGF and HIF-1α expression were upregulated by up to 2 folds in control fibroblasts. Interestingly, the pro-carcinogenic long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) H19 was 70% down-regulated in Caco-2 cells upon FECH down regulation whereas no effect was observed in normal fibroblasts.In conclusion, we showed that loss of FECH is protective against  tumorigenesis  and this effect could possibly be mediated through inhibition of H19.2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

Preoperative radiotherapy was administered to 89 patients (51.1%) in the biological mesh group and 20 patients (37.0%) in the primary closure group. The biological mesh group had significantly lower rates of perineal wound infection (11.% vs 22.2%; p = 0.047), perineal hernia (3.4% vs 13.0%; p = 0.022), wound dehiscence (0.6% vs .6%; p = 0.042), and total perineal wound complications (14.9% vs 35.2%; p = 0.001) compared with the primary closure group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed preoperative radiotherapy (p < 0.001), conventional primary closure (p < 0.001), and intraoperative bowel perforation (p = 0.001) to be significantly associated with perineal procedure-related complications.This was a single-center retrospective study.Although perineal wound repair with biological mesh prolongs the operative time of perineal portion, the perineal drainage retention time, and the length of hospital stay, it may reduce perineal procedure-related complications and improve wound healing. Preoperative radiotherapy and intraoperative bowel perforation appear to be independent predictors of perineal complications.

Hence, investigating the detailed roles of miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in cervical  and the underlying molecular mechanisms is essential for early diagnosis and effective therapeutic approaches. miRNA-877 (miR-877) was found to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, and function as a tumor-suppressive miRNA. However, how miR-877 exerts an effect in cervical  progression and its underlying molecular mechanisms remains to be elucidated. In the current study, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to determine miR-877 expression in cervical  tissues and cell lines. The effects of miR-877 overexpression on cervical  cell proliferation and invasion were evaluated using MTT and Transwell cell invasion assays. In the present study, miR-877 was significantly downregulated in cervical  tissues and cell lines, and the decreased expression levels of miR-877 were significantly associated with increased International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetric stage as well as increased lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical . Upregulation of miR-877 using miR-877 mimics resulted in the decreased proliferation and invasion of cervical  cells. Metastasis-associated in -1 (MACC1) was assessed using bioinformatics analyses to determine whether it could be a potential target gene of miR-877, and the results were confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, MACC1 was markedly upregulated in cervical  tissues, and its level was negatively correlated with the miR-877 level. Overexpression of miR-877 resulted in decreased expression levels of MACC1 in cervical  cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the functional effects of MACC1 knockdown were similar to those induced by upregulated miR-877 in cervical  cells. MACC1 restored miR-877 overexpression-mediated suppression of cervical  cell proliferation and invasion. In conclusion, miR-877 may play an antitumor role in cervical  by directly targeting MACC1, which suggests that this miRNA may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with such an aggressive gynecological .Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648389>Establishment and characterization of a novel neuroendocrine carcinoma cell line derived from a human ascending  tumor.</a></h1><p>The incidence of rare neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is rapidly increasing. Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a NET with poorly differentiated histological features, high proliferative properties and associated poor prognoses. Since these carcinomas are so rare, and thus, affect only a small number of patients allowing for few cell lines to be derived from patient biopsies, the histological, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics associated with colorectal NEC and NECs in other organs, have yet to be clearly defined. Herein, we describe the establishment of a novel NEC cell line (SS-2) derived from a tumor resection of the ascending  from a 59-year-old Japanese woman. The histological, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features of chromogranin A (CgA) as well as the confirmation of synaptophysin positivity in this tumor were typical of those commonly observed in surgically resected colorectal NECs. Further, the Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumor was > 20 %, and thus, the tumor was diagnosed as an NEC of the ascending . The SS-2 cell line maintained characteristic features to those of the resected tumor, which were further retained following implantation into the subcutaneous tissues of nude mice. Additionally, when SS-2 cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment plates they formed spheres that expressed higher levels of the  stem cell (CSC) marker CD133 compared to SS-2 cells cultured under adherent conditions. SS-2 cells may, therefore, contribute to the current knowledge on midgut NEC biological behaviors, while providing a novel platform for examining the effects of colorectal NEC drugs, including CSC.© 2019 The Authors.

Hydrogen sulfide (HS), mainly produced by cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), has been reported to promote the proliferation and migration of  cells. In this study, the effect of inhibiting HS synthesis on the sensitivity of  cell lines to -FU was investigated. Increased expression of CBS was validated in online database and tissue microarrays. Inhibiting HS synthesis significantly sensitized  cell lines to -FU both in vitro and in vivo. Decreasing HS synthesis utilizing shRNA lentiviruses significantly reversed the acquired resistance to -FU. MicroRNA sequencing was performed and miR-215-5p was revealed as one of the miRNAs with most significantly altered expression levels after CBS knock down. Epiregulin (EREG) and thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) were predicted to be potential targets of miR-215-5p. Decreasing HS synthesis significantly decreased the expression of EREG and TYMS.

The four isolated dimers all have the same constitutions and identical absolute configurations at the four stereogenic centers, but differ by their axial chirality. They belong to the extremely small class of Dioncophyllaceae-type naphthylisoquinoline dimers, i.e., being devoid of oxygen functions at C-6 and bearing the -configuration at C-3 in their isoquinoline portions. Besides these dimers, the plant produces predominantly typical Ancistrocladaceae-type monomeric compounds, i.e., with the -configuration at C-3 and an oxygen function at C-6, such as the new ancistrobrevines K () and L (). Furthermore, a new hybrid-type (i.e., mixed Ancistrocladaceae/Dioncophyllaceae-type) alkaloid was identified, named ancistrobrevine M (), which is 3-configured and 6-oxygenated. Remarkable was the discovery of its "inverse hybrid-type" counterpart, dioncoline A (). It is the as yet only known 3-configured naphthylisoquinoline lacking an -functionality at C-6. The new jozibrevines A-C (-) exhibited pronounced antiplasmodial activities in the submicromolar range, with  being the most potent compound (IC, 0.012 μM). Furthermore, jozimine A () showed cytotoxicity against human  carcinoma (HT-29), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and multiple myeloma (MM.1S)  cells, displaying IC values of 12.0, 9.0, and .0 μM, respectively, whereas jozibrevines A () and B () were nontoxic in this concentration range.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541073>Selective eradication of human non-small cell lung  cells using aptamer-decorated nanoparticles harboring a cytotoxic drug cargo.</a></h1><p>Targeted  therapy is currently the leading modality to enhance treatment selectivity and efficacy, as well as to minimize untoward toxicity to healthy tissues. Herein, we devised and studied nanoparticles (NPs) composed of the biocompatible block-copolymer PEG-PCL entrapping the hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX), which are targeted to human non-small cell lung  (NSCLC) cells. To achieve selective NSCLC targeting, these NPs were decorated with single-stranded oligonucleotide-based S15 aptamers (S15-APTs), which we have recently shown to serve as efficient tumor cell targeting ligands. Prepared without using surfactants, these 15 nm PEG-PCL/PTX NPs entered NSCLC cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These NPs demonstrated efficient encapsulation of PTX, high selectivity to- and potent eradication of human A549 NSCLC cells, with a remarkable half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC) of 0.03 μM PTX. In contrast, very high IC values of 1.7, 4.2, 43, 87, and 980 µM PTX were obtained towards normal human bronchial epithelial BEAS2B, cervical carcinoma HeLa,  adenocarcinoma CaCo-2, neonatal foreskin fibroblast FSE, and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells, respectively. These results demonstrate 2- orders of magnitude difference in the selective cytotoxicity towards NSCLCs, reflecting a potentially outstanding therapeutic window. Moreover, the dual utility of aptamer-decorated NPs for both drug stabilization and selective tumor targeting was studied by increasing APT concentrations during NP "decoration". The optimal aptamer density on the surface of NPs for selective targeting, for high fluorescence diagnostic signal and for maintaining small particle size to enable endocytosis, was achieved by using 30 nM APTs during NP decoration. Collectively, our findings suggest that these APT-decorated NPs hold great preclinical promise in selective targeting and eradication of human NSCLC cells without harming normal tissues.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627372>Isolation of Phytochemicals from  L. Bark and Their In Vitro Antioxidant and Cytotoxic Potential.</a></h1><p>Plants have been the basis of traditional medicine since the dawn of civilizations. Different plant parts possess various phytochemicals, playing important roles in preventing and curing diseases. Scientists, through extensive experimental studies, are playing an important part in establishing the use of phytochemicals in medicine. However, there are still a large number of medicinal plants which need to be studied for their phytochemical profile. In this study, the objective was to isolate phytochemicals from bark of  L. and to study them for their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The bark was extracted with methanol, followed by column chromatography and thus isolating kaempferol, stigmasterol, protocatechuic acid-methyl ester (PCA-ME) and protocatechuic acid (PCA). 2,2-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2, 2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) radical scavenging assays were utilized for assessment of antioxidant activity, and 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay was used to determine cytotoxic activity against C-6 glioma rat brain, MCF-7 breast , and HCT-15  cell lines. The compounds were found to have significant antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. Since there is a considerable increase in characterizing novel chemical compounds from plant parts, the present study might be helpful for chemotaxonomic determinations, for understanding of medicinal properties as well as for the quality assessment of herbal supplements containing  bark, thus establishing its use in traditional medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632958>Characterization of an Amphiphilic Phosphonated Calixarene Carrier Loaded With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel: A Preliminary Study to Treat   and .</a></h1><p>The inadequacy of available detection methods and a naturally aggressive progression have made  the third most common type of , accounting for ~10% of all  cases. The heterogeneity and genomic instability of  tumors make current treatments unsatisfactory. This study evaluated a novel nanoscale delivery platform comprising phosphonated calixarenes (P4C6) co-loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) and carboplatin (CPT). The nanoparticles showed average hydrodynamic sizes of 84 ± 8 nm for empty P4C6 nanoparticle and 119 ± 13 nm for PTX-CPT-P4C6. The corresponding zeta potentials were -40.8 ± 8.8 and -35.4 ± 4.2 mV. The optimal CPT:PTX ratio was .22:1, and PTX-CPT-P4C6 with this ratio was more cytotoxic against HT-29 cells than against Caco-2 cells (IC, 0.4 ± 0.02 vs. 2.1 ± 0.3 μM), and it induced higher apoptosis in HT-29 cells (56.6 ± 4. vs. 44.9 ± 3.44%). PTX-CPT-P4C6 inhibited the invasion and migration of HT-29 cells more strongly than the free drugs. It also inhibited the growth of HT-29 tumors in mice to the greatest extent of all formulations, with negligible side effects. This research demonstrates the potential of P4C6 to deliver two chemotherapeutic agents to  tumors to provide synergistic efficacy than single drug administration.Copyright © 2019 Li, Mao, Chen, Li, Wang and Mo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664934>Severe colitis after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients: potential role of Th1-dominant immune response in immune-related adverse events: two case reports.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor specific to the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report 2 patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the  showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response.

Genetic studies evaluating  mutational status are important in the personalized therapy era to understand disease heterogeneity, disease behaviors, and treatment outcomes.This multicenter retrospective study evaluated 360 patients with mCRC treated at three oncology centers in Saudi Arabia and Egypt between February 2011 and December 2015. Patients were treated with bevacizumab and cetuximab according to guidelines. Therapy outcome, time to progression, and disease-associated death were assessed.  mutational status was evaluated by testing exons 12 and 13.Approximately 220 (61.1%) cases were of wild-type , whereas  mutation was noted in 38.9%.  mutation was common in the descending , whereas a low incidence of the  mutation was observed in the ascending  (P<0.001). Among patients with  mutation, 64.3% initially presented as emergency cases with obstruction/perforation (P=0.002), and 62.9% had hepatic or pulmonary metastasis. The progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.7 months. Cases without  mutation showed a higher PFS than did those with  mutation (mean PFS: 11.  9.6 months, P=0.001). The overall survival was 23.2 months. The survival varied considerably according to  type: patients without mutation survived for 25.0 months and those with mutation survived for 19.6 months (P<0.001). Disease-related death occurred in 132 (36.7%) cases, approximately 57.1% of them (80 cases) had  mutations (P=0.001).A major association between  mutational status and both disease behavior and treatment outcomes was found in this study.

Few epidemiological studies have assessed the relationship between mtDNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and risk of colorectal  (CRC), with inconsistent findings. In this study, we examined the association between pre-diagnostic leukocyte mtDNAcn and CRC risk in a case-control study of 324 female cases and 658 matched controls nested within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). Relative mtDNAcn in peripheral blood leukocytes was measured by quantitative PCR-based assay. Conditional logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association of interest. Results showed lower log-mtDNAcn was significantly associated with increased risk of CRC, in a dose-dependent relationship (P for trend < 0.0001). Compared to the 4th quartile, multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.10 (0.69, 1.76) for the 3rd quartile, 1.40 (0.89, 2.19) for the 2nd quartile, and 2.19 (1.43, 3.35) for the 1st quartile. In analysis by anatomic subsite of CRC, we found a significant inverse association for proximal  [lowest vs. highest quartile, multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) = 3.31 (1.70, 6.45), P for trend = 0.0003]. Additionally, stratified analysis according to the follow-up time since blood collection showed that the inverse association between mtDNAcn and CRC remained significant among individuals with ≥  years' follow-up, and marginally significant among those with ≥ 10 years' follow-up since mtDNAcn testing, suggesting that mtDNAcn may serve as a long-term predictor for risk of CRC. In conclusion, pre-diagnostic leukocyte mtDNAcn was inversely associated with CRC risk. Further basic experimental studies are needed to explore the underlying biological mechanisms linking mtDNAcn to CRC carcinogenesis.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Therefore, we examined the structure-activity relationships of isoflavones and isomeric flavone and flavanones as AhR ligands on the basis of their induction of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 gene expression in  Caco2 cells and young adult mouse colonocyte (YAMC) cells. Caco2 cells were significantly more Ah-responsive than YAMC cells, and this was due, in part, to flavonoid-induced cytotoxicity in the latter cell lines. The structure-activity relationships for the flavonoids were complex and both response and cell context specific; however, there was significant variability in the AhR activities of the isomeric substituted isoflavones and flavones. For example, 4',,7-trihydroxyisoflavone (genistein) was AhR-inactive whereas 4',,7-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin) induced CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 in Caco2 cells. In contrast, both ,7-dihydroxy-4-methoxy substituted isoflavone (biochanin A) and flavone (acacetin) induced all three AhR-responsive genes; 4',,7-trimethoxyisoflavone was a potent AhR agonist, and the isomeric flavone was AhR-inactive. These results coupled with simulation studies modeling flavonoid interaction within the AhR binding pocket demonstrate that the orientation of the substituted phenyl ring at C-2 (flavones) or C-3 (isoflavones) on the common 4--chromen-4-one ring strongly influences the activities of isoflavones and flavones as AhR agonists.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596728>A molecular sub-cluster of  cells with low VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment.</a></h1><p>Gene expression based consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) sub-clusters are robust  classification systems. Although, the molecular features are clear,  subgroups based interventions are limited. To address this problem, we analyze the CMS and NMF subgroup guided drug sensitivity in  cell lines. CMS3 subtype cells are sensitive to -Fluorouracil, while, CMS4 subtype cells are sensitive to cisplatin treatment. In NMF classification, a sub-cluster is specifically sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors, PI3K-mTOR inhibitors and NOTCH inhibitor treatment. This sub-cluster has low frequency of TP53, POLE, PIK3CA and BRAF mutation. Transcriptional analysis demonstrates low NOTCH signaling activity, low CDX2 and VDR expression in this sub-cluster. CDX2 and VDR are significantly associated with the sensitivity of chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors. Moreover, a positive correlation between VDR and CDX2 is identified. VDR and CDX2 mediated regulatory networks are constructed. At last, three or four sub-clusters classification is validated in  patients. Overall, our results suggest a molecular sub-cluster of  cells with low CDX2 and VDR expression is sensitive to chemotherapy, BRAF inhibitors and PI3K-mTOR inhibitors treatment and provide an example of translation of  classification to subgroup guided therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597436>RAS mutation: site of disease and recurrence pattern in colorectal .</a></h1><p>Somatic mutation status in metastatic colorectal  (CRC), and namely mutational activation of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) oncogene, is becoming more and more relevant in clinical practice. In this review, we describe the current data about the importance of associations between the mutational activation status of the KRAS oncogene and clinical outcomes, prognosis and metastatic patterns of CRC. The presence of a KRAS mutation is detected in approximately 30-50% of CRC and represents a powerful predictor of oncologic outcomes. It is associated with low response to systemic chemotherapy and for insensitivity to the anti-EGFR antibodies in the preoperative setting. It is more frequently associated with right . In non-metastatic patients, KRAS mutation leads to more aggressive disease with shorter recurrence free survival (RFS) and more lung recurrences. After resection of CRC liver metastases (LiM), KRAS mutation is directly associated with increased risk of recurrence, worse overall survival (OS), and a distinct metastatic pattern with more invasive intrahepatic recurrence and increased recurrence outside of the liver, particularly in the lung, the peritoneum, and even in uncommon metastatic sites such as the brain and bones. As metastasectomy with curative intent is increasingly considered, a comprehensive approach of tumor biology is required to face the specific challenge of patients with metastatic CRCs. Thus, as it represents one of the strongest predictors of oncologic outcomes, integrating the KRAS mutational status at all the different stages of patient care appears crucial in order to adapt both medical and surgical strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618803>Syndromes associated with multiple pilomatricomas: When should clinicians be concerned?</a></h1><p>Multiple pilomatricomas have been linked to various syndromes. However, these associations are poorly defined, leaving practitioners conflicted on management of these patients.To perform a comprehensive review to clarify the strength of these relationships and identify which patients may benefit from additional screening and/or genetic screening.A literature search was performed using the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases. Syndromic, familial, and sporadic cases of multiple pilomatricomas were stratified based on number of pilomatricomas. This information was graphed for visual comparison.Sixty-six syndromic cases from 52 publications were identified, with the majority (54) of cases representing myotonic dystrophy, familial adenomatous polyposis-related syndromes (including Gardner syndrome), Turner syndrome, or Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome. Twenty-five of the 54 cases (46.3%) had six or more pilomatricomas. Of sporadic cases, 128 out of 134 (95.%) had five or less pilomatricomas.Most articles were case reports and series, which are vulnerable to publication bias. Specific details were not explicitly noted in some original articles, and incomplete data could not always be included in analysis. Syndromes may have been missed in sporadic cases.The presence of six or more pilomatricomas is highly suggestive of an underlying syndrome (>95% specificity). These patients should undergo additional screening. Patients with less than six pilomatricomas and family history of myotonic dystrophy, first-degree relative with  or FAP-related syndrome, or family history of pilomatricomas should also undergo further screening.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550814>[Efficacy and safety of Anlotinib as a third-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal ].</a></h1><p> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib as a third-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal .

Since, this clinically applied enzyme was derived from Mycobacterium spp, thus, searching for ADI from eukaryotic microbes "especially thermophilic fungi" could have a novel biochemical, conformational and catalytic properties. Aspergillus nidulans ADI was purified with .3 folds, with molecular subunit structure 48 kDa and entire molecular mass 120 kDa, ensuring its homotrimeric identity. The peptide fingerprinting analysis revealing the domain Glu-Gly-Gly as the conserved active site of A. nidulans ADI, with higher proximity to Mycobacterium ADI clade IV. In an endeavor to fortify the structural stability and anticancer activity of A. nidulans ADI, the enzyme was chemically modified with dextran. The optimal activity of Dextran-ADI conjugates was determined at 0.08:20 M ratio of ADI: Dextran, with an overall increase to ADI molecular subunit mass to ˜100 kDa. ADI was conjugated with dextran via the ε-amino groups interaction of surface lysine residues of ADI. The resistance of Dextran-ADI conjugate to proteolysis had been increased by 2. folds to proteinase K and trypsin, suggesting the shielding of >50% of ADI surface proteolytic recognition sites. The native and Dextran-ADI conjugates have the same optimum reaction temperature (37 °C), reaction pH and pH stability (7.0-8.0) with dependency on K ions as a cofactor. Dextran-ADI conjugates exhibited a higher thermal stability by ˜ 2 folds for all the tested temperatures, ensuring the acquired structural and catalytic stability upon dextran conjugation. Dextran conjugation slightly protect the reactive amino and thiols groups of surface amino acids of ADI from amino acids suicide inhibitors. The affinity of ADI was increased by .3 folds to free L-arginine with a dramatic reduction in citrullination of peptidylarginine residues upon dextran conjugation. The anticancer activity of ADI to breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG-2) and  (HCT8, HT29, DLD1 and LS174 T)  cell lines was increased by 1.7 folds with dextran conjugation in vitro. Pharmacokinetically, the half-life time of ADI was increased by 1.7 folds upon dextran conjugation, in vivo. From the biochemical and hematological parameters, ADIs had no signs of toxicity to the experimental animals. In addition to the dramatic reduction of L-arginine in serum, citrulline level was increased by 2. folds upon dextran conjugation of ADI.

CD44CD133 high-expressing and other populations of human DLD-1  cells were separately isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The sphere-forming activity of each population and the anti-sphere-forming effects of FTD and fluorouracil (-FU) on CD44CD133 cells were then measured. CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells formed substantially more spheres than other cells. Moreover, treating CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells with subtoxic concentrations of FTD (1 µM) inhibited sphere formation, and this was superior to the effect of subtoxic concentrations (1 µM) of -FU. The associated inhibition rates for FTD and -FU were 58.2% and 26.1%, respectively. Further, CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells expressed higher levels of thymidine kinase 1, which is responsible for FTD phosphorylation, than DLD-1 cells, and FTD was incorporated into the DNA of CD44CD133 DLD-1 cells.

SEM image implied that NPs were spherical in shape and the results of DSC, TGA and FT-IR suggest that -FU was encapsulated into NPs. The obtained results revealed that -FU loaded PHBV/PLGA NPs induced significant higher cell death at concentration much lower than free -FU. Results of hemolysis assay indicated that the NPs were hemo-compatible anti-tumor studies showed that -FU loaded NPs reduced tumor volume significantly in comparison with free -FU. As the first example of using PHBV/PLGA as nano-drug delivery system with enhanced anti-tumor activities, this study establishes PHBV/PLGA as a novel promising drug delivery platform for treatment of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632027>Photoluminescent And Self-Assembled Hyaluronic Acid-Zinc Oxide-Ginsenoside Rh2 Nanoparticles And Their Potential Caspase-9 Apoptotic Mechanism Towards  Cell Lines.</a></h1><p>Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are used in modern  therapy based on their specific target, efficacy, low toxicity and biocompatibility. The photocatalytic performance of Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites with hyaluronic acid (HA) was used to study anticancer properties against various human  cell lines.Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites functionalized by hyaluronic acid (HA) were prepared by a co-precipitation method (HA-ZnONcs). The submicron-flower-shaped nanocomposites were further functionalized with ginsenoside Rh2 by a cleavable ester bond via carbodiimide chemistry to form Rh2HAZnO. The physicochemical behaviors of the synthesized ZnO nanocomposites were characterized by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques. We carried out 3-(4, -dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to evaluate the toxicity of Rh2HAZnO in various human  cells (A549, MCF-7, and HT29). Furthermore, to confirm the apoptotic effects of Rh2HAZnO and to determine the role of the Caspase-9/p38 MAPK pathways by various molecular techniques such as RT-PCR and Western blotting. Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes of these cell lines, mainly intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed by ROS staining and nucleus by Hoechst staining.We confirmed that Rh2HAZnO exhibits the anti- effects on A549 lung , HT29 , and MCF7 breast  cells. Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in three  cell lines. Rh2HAZnO induced apoptotic process through p53-mediated pathway by upregulating p53 and BAX and downregulating BCL2. Specifically, Rh2HAZnO induced activation of cleaved PARP (Asp214) in A549 lung  cells and upregulated Caspase-9/phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in other cell lines (HT29 and MCF-7). Furthermore, Rh2HAZnO induced morphological changes in the nucleus of these cell lines.These results suggest that the potential anticancer activity of novel Rh2HAZnO nanoparticles might be linked to induction of apoptosis through the generation of ROS by activation of the Caspase-9/p38 MAPK pathway.© 2019 Kim et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643033>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Pyridostigmine Bromide Attenuates Gut Pathology and Bacterial Dysbiosis in a Murine Model of Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a Th2 inflammatory bowel disease characterized by increased IL- and IL-13 expression, eosinophilic/neutrophilic infiltration, decreased mucus production, impaired epithelial barrier, and bacterial dysbiosis of the . Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on  tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut microbiota were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine  architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609648>Association of Carcinoembryonic Antigen with Mortality in an Insurance Applicant Population.</a></h1><p> To quantify the mortality risks associated with elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).  Carcinoembryonic antigen is cell surface glycoprotein and has been associated with the presence of high grade or metastatic cancers of the  as well as other malignant and non-malignant disease. Prior publications have demonstrated the utility of CEA levels in the determination of mortality risk in life insurance applicants. The aim of this paper is to further characterize this risk with a larger set of data containing additional person-years of follow-up, more outcomes, and additional variables potentially associated with occult malignancy.  By use of the Social Security Death Index, mortality was examined in 321,574 insurance applicants age 50 years and older, who submitted blood samples to Clinical Reference Laboratories for testing including CEA. Results were stratified by age group and by CEA level (< ng/mL,  to 9.9 ng/mL, 10+ ng/mL), though other thresholds were tested. Mortality comparisons were carried out using Cox models and tabular methods with the 2015 smoker-distinct Valuation Basic Tables as a comparator.  Relative mortality is increased at CEA levels above 4.0 ng/mL in both smokers and non-smokers. This association is persistent in Cox models when albumin, BMI and cholesterol are included as covariates. The strongest association with mortality risk occurred in the first 3-4 durations. The 3-year cumulative mortality ratio when using the 2015 VBT as baseline was 6.51 when comparing the group with CEA levels of 10+ ng/mL, compared to those with levels below .0 ng/mL.  This study shows that CEA is strongly associated with the risk of early excess mortality in life insurance applicants, and this risk appears not to be mitigated by consideration of other markers thought to be associated with occult malignancy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549217>JOIN trial: treatment outcome and recovery status of peripheral sensory neuropathy during a 3-year follow-up in patients receiving modified FOLFOX6 as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III .</a></h1><p>Adjuvant FOLFOX therapy is an established standard-of-care for resected . Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) is regarded as the major toxicity issue related to FOLFOX therapy. There have been a few reports on the recovery status from PSN thereafter. JOIN trial investigated the tolerability and efficacy of adjuvant modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) in Japanese patients with stage II/III .Twelve cycles of mFOLFOX6 were given to patients with stage II/III curatively resected . Treatment outcomes, including disease-free survival (DFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and recovery status of PSN during 3-year follow-up, were investigated.Of the 882 patients enrolled from 2010 to 2012, 864 were eligible for the efficacy analyses. Three-year DFS, RFS, and OS were favorable in 92.1, 92.8, and 97.4% of stage II patients; 76.4, 77.9, and 93.8% of stage IIIA/B; and 61.6, 62.7, and 85.9% of stage IIIC, respectively. The cumulative incidence of PSN during treatment was 47.8% in grade 1 (G1), 30.3% in G2, and .8% in G3. For those with G3 PSN during treatment, there was gradual recovery in 1.1% of patients at 12 months after enrollment, 0.% at 24 months, and 0.2% at 36 months. However, G1 or G2 residual PSN after 3 years was observed in 21.0% (18.7%, G1; 2.3%, G2).Adjuvant mFOLFOX6 therapy was effective and well tolerated in patients with stage II/III .

However, the role and molecular mechanisms of CCAT1 in the cell proliferation and chemoresistance of esophageal  are largely unknown. The correlation between CCAT1 expression and drug resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells was analyzed using 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. CCAT1 knockdown and miR-143 overexpression or inhibition were used to verify the effects on proliferation and drug resistance via MTT, western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. qRT-PCR and western blotting were applied to detect the potential regulatory relationship among CCAT1, miR-143, PLK1, and BUBR1. A xenograft tumor assay was performed to validate the role of CCAT1 in vivo. The expression of CCAT1 was positively correlated with drug resistance in several ESCC cell lines. CCAT1 knockdown and miR-143 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and CDDP drug resistance. Moreover, the downstream target of CCAT1 was found to be miR-143, which can regulate the expression of PLK1 and BUBR1. In vivo assays showed that CCAT1 knockdown suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the sensitivity of tumors to CDDP in nude mice. Taken together, we discovered a novel mechanism by which CCAT1 promotes cell proliferation and enhances drug resistance by regulating the miR-143/PLK1/BUBR1 signaling axis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings further suggest that lncRNA CCAT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in esophageal .© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31589543>Multidisciplinary  Management of Colorectal  in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.</a></h1><p>Multidisciplinary  care is currently considered worldwide as standard for the management of patients with . It improves patient diagnostic and staging accuracy and provides patients the benefit of having physicians of various specialties participating in their treatment plan. The purpose of this study was to describe the profile of patients discussed in the Tikur Anbessa Multidisciplinary Tumor Board (MTB) and the potential benefits brought by multidisciplinary care.The study involved the retrospective assessment of all patient cases presented to the Tikur Anbessa Hospital colorectal cancers MTB between March 2016 and November 2017. The data were collected from the MTB medical summary documents and were analyzed using SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).Of 147 patients with colorectal , 96 (65%) were men. The median age at presentation was 46 years (range, 17-78 years). The predominant  was rectal (n = 101; 69%), followed by  (n = 24; 16%). Of these, 68 (45%) and 22 (15%) had stage III and IV disease, respectively, on presentation to the MTB. The oncology department presented the majority of the patients for discussion. Most patients had undergone surgery before the MTB discussion but had no proper preoperative clinical staging information. The majority of patients with rectal  treated before the MTB discussion had undergone surgery upfront; however, most of the patients who were treatment naive before MTB received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before surgery.Decisions made by tumor boards are more likely to conform to evidence-based guidelines than are those made by individual clinicians. Therefore, early referral of patients to MTB before any treatment should be encouraged. Finally, other hospitals in Ethiopia should take a lesson from the Tikur Anbessa Hospital colorectal cancers MTB and adopt multidisciplinary  management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625110> Metastasis Within a NIFTP: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.</a></h1><p>The thyroid is an unusual site for metastasis, and metastases in a preexisting primary thyroid tumor are exceedingly rare. We report the first case of a patient with  who was diagnosed with a thyroid metastasis in a noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). A 55-year-old male patient presented with a 19 mm thyroid nodule in the inferior left lobe. It was EU-TIRADS  on echography and suspicious of papillary thyroid carcinoma (Bethesda V) on cytology. Macroscopically, the nodule was fleshy and completely encapsulated. At frozen section examination, it demonstrated follicular architecture with mild atypia. Inside the nodule was a focus of tumor with glandular architecture, marked cellular atypia, and necrosis. These findings suggested a secondary malignancy. The patient's medical history was significant for metastatic . The definitive histology showed features of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma within a NIFTP. Immunohistochemical studies were confirmatory with expression of CDX2 and CK20 localized to the metastatic focus. PAX8, TG, and TTF were negative in the metastasis but expressed in the surrounding NIFTP lesion. The possibility of a metastasis to the thyroid may be considered in patients presenting with a solitary thyroid nodule with a previous history of . Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma occurring in a NIFTP has never been reported before now, although metastases to the thyroid are documented in the literature.

Individuals with this disorder may occasionally have multiple primary carcinomas. Regardless of tumor type, pembrolizumab was approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic mismatch repair deficient tumors, which may be an optional therapeutic method for patients with LS with multiple primary carcinomas. This case study is of a MSH2-deficient patient with LS with metachronous urothelial and , who received pembrolizumab treatment for 8 months. The responses of the two primary sites to immunotherapy differed. Based on the changes of tumor markers and tumor size illustrated by imageological examinations, no response was observed in the sigmoid  lesion, whereas an immune-associated phenomenon known as pseudoprogression was detected in the ureteral lesion. Immunotherapy was innovatively applied to the patient with multiple primary carcinomas. This case proposes a novel concept in which immunotherapy may potentially control the  growth in patients with LS and multiple primary carcinomas. However, further large-scale investigations are required.

We aimed to examine the discrepancies between these two types of  cancers to identify potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, three gene expression profiles (GSE44076, GSE31595, GSE26906) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded and further analyzed. A PPI (protein‑protein interaction) network of the differentially‑expressed genes (DEGs) of GSE44076 between tumor and normal was established with the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. Then, the DEGs of these two  cancers (left, right) samples were identified.

Towards this, here we focus on γ-Mangostin, a bioactive compound present in the Mangosteen () fruit. γ-Mangostin suppressed proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of  cell lines. Further, γ-Mangostin inhibited colonosphere formation. Molecular docking and CETSA (Cellular thermal shift assay) binding assays demonstrated that γ-Mangostin interacts with transcription factor TCF4 (T-Cell Factor 4) at the β-catenin binding domain with the binding energy of -. Kcal/mol. Moreover, γ-Mangostin treatment decreased TCF4 expression and reduced TCF reporter activity. The compound also suppressed the expression of Wnt signaling target proteins cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and stem cell markers such as LGR5, DCLK1 and CD44. To determine the effect of γ-Mangostin on tumor growth , we administered nude mice harboring HCT116 tumor xenografts with  mg/Kg of γ-Mangostin intraperitoneally for 21 days. γ-Mangostin treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth, with notably lowered tumor volume and weight. In addition, western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of TCF4 and its downstream targets such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc.

We sought to determine the feasibility of a high GLV dietary intervention in adults with an increased risk of CC () via a 12-week randomized controlled crossover trial. Participants were randomized to immediate or delayed (post-4-week washout) intervention groups. During the 4-week intervention period, participants were given frozen GLVs and counseled to consume one cooked cup equivalent daily. The primary outcomes were: accrual-recruiting 50 adults in 9 months; retention-retaining 80% of participants at completion; and adherence-meeting GLV intake goals on 90% of days. Adherence data were collected twice weekly and 24-h dietary recalls at each time point provided nutrient and food group measures. The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) was completed to determine acceptability. On each of the four study visits, anthropometrics, stool, saliva, and blood were obtained. Fifty adults were recruited in 44 days. Participants were 48 ± 13 years of age, 62% female, and 80% Caucasian, with an average BMI at screening of 35.9 ± .1. Forty-eight (96%) participants were retained and completed the study. During the intervention phase, participants consumed GLVs on 88.8% of days; the adherence goal of one cup was met on 73.2% of days.

The biological functions of miR-552 have been well documented in ; however, the role of miR-552 in HCC remains unclear. The present study evaluated the effects of miR-552 in HCC physiology, using HCC cell lines as model. An miR-552 inhibitor was transfected into HCC cell lines to knock down the expression of miR-552. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of miR-552 and Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), respectively. MTT assay was used to analyze cell viability, whilst Transwell and wound-healing assay were used to investigate cell migration. Flow cytometry was performed to measure cell apoptosis. The direct association between RUNX3 and miR-552 was evaluated using dual luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-552 was significantly elevated in HCC tumor tissues compared with the adjacent healthy samples. Additionally, transfection with the miR-552 inhibitor decreased cell viability and migration. miR-552 knockdown also increased HCC cell apoptosis .

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to use cohorts of patients from Guangxi Medical University and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to investigate and validate CXCL3 for the diagnosis and prognosis of CC, and to explore its prospective molecular mechanism. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) analysis of 38 paired tumor and non‑tumor tissues, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 212 tumor and 46 non‑tumor tissues was conducted to explore the expression of CXCL3 and its diagnostic and prognostic significance in the Guangxi Medical University CC cohort. A GEO dataset, GSE40967, was used to validate the prognostic significance of CXCL3. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was also conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CXCL3 in CC. The RT‑qPCR results indicated that CXCL3 expression was significantly higher in  tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that it may have high diagnostic value for CC. Multivariate Cox analysis based on the IHC results suggested that there was no appreciable association between CXCL3 positivity and the overall survival (OS) time of CC. However, a stratified analysis revealed that high expression of CXCL3 was associated with considerably increased mortality in the subgroup of CC patients with tumor size < cm (adjusted P=0.042, adjusted HR=2.298, 95% CI=1.030‑.126) and with tumor thrombus (adjusted P=0.019, adjusted HR=.096, 95% CI=1.306‑19.886). In the GSE40967 dataset, high expression of CXCL3 was closely associated with poor OS in CC (adjusted P=0.049, adjusted HR=1.416, 95% CI=1.002‑2.003). Furthermore, GSEA indicated that the high expression of CXCL3 was closely associated with DNA repair, cell cycle process, cell apoptosis process and the P53 regulation pathway.

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is an indicator of overall body metabolism and may be a proxy for the impact of a specific metabolic profile on  risk. Therefore, we investigated the association of estimated BMR with incidence of 13 obesity-related cancers in the European Prospective Investigation into  and Nutrition. Estimated BMR at baseline was calculated using the WHO/FAO/UNU equations and the relationships between BMR and  risk were investigated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 141,295 men and 317,613 women, with a mean follow-up of 14 years were included in the analysis. Overall, higher BMR was associated with a greater risk for most cancers that have been linked with obesity. However, among normal weight participants, higher BMR was associated with elevated risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Hazard Ratio per 1-standard deviation change in BMR [HR ]: 2.46; 95%CI 1.20; .03), and distal  (HR : 1.33; 95%CI 1.001; 1.77) among men, and with proximal  (HR : 1.16; 95%CI 1.01; 1.35), pancreatic (HR : 1.37; 95%CI 1.13; 1.66), thyroid (HR : 1.65; 95%CI 1.33; 2.05), postmenopausal breast (HR : 1.17; 95%CI 1.11; 1.22), and endometrial (HR : 1.20; 95%CI 1.03; 1.40) cancers in women. These results indicate that higher BMR may be an indicator of a metabolic phenotype associated with risk of certain  types, and may be a useful predictor of  risk independent of body fatness.

Although surgical management has been the treatment of choice for intestinal intussusception in adults, because most frequent causes for adult intussusception are malignant in origin, the importance of the roles of preoperative colonoscopic evaluation has recently been emerging.We report an extremely rare case of adult colo- intussusception caused by  anisakiasis and successfully treated by endoscopic removal of the Anisakis body. A 59-year-old man visited the emergency department due to 1 day of lower abdominal colicky pain. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) revealed the presence of mid-transverse  intussusception without definite necrosis, which was possibly related with colorectal . Because there was no evidence of necrosis at the intussusception site, a colonoscopy was performed to target the  lesion and obtain tissue for a histopathological diagnosis.

In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an IBD mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = , PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of -morphology as assessed by -length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, another kind of marker has been developed: sterile carbon particle suspension (SCPS). No comparison between these two markers has yet been made. The aim of the present study was to compare the pyrogenic, inflammatory and intraperitoneal effect of these two markers.From September 2015 to December 2018, adult patients who were candidates for elective laparoscopic  resection were randomized to the SCPS or conventional India ink injection group using computer-based randomization. The primary endpoint of the study was the presence of intraoperative adhesions related to the endoscopic tattoo. Secondary endpoints were differences in white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels as well as, abdominal pain and body temperature at baseline (before endoscopic tattooing) and 6 and 24 h after colonoscopy. Finally, the visibility of the tattoo during the minimally invasive intervention was assessed.Ninety-four patients were included in the study, 47 for each arm. There were 45/94 females (47.9%) and 49/94 males (52.1%), with a median age of 67.85 ± 9.22 years. No differences were found between groups in WBC, fibrinogen levels, body temperature or VAS scores, but we documented significantly higher CRP values at 6 and 24 h after endoscopic tattooing with India ink injection. There were significantly fewer adhesions in the SCPS Endoscopic Marker group. All the endoscopic tattoos were clearly visible.SCPS is an effective method for tattooing  lesions and has a better safety profile than traditional India ink in terms of post-procedure inflammatory response and intraoperative bowel adhesions.clinicaltrials.gov (ID: ).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674837>A new -terphenyl derivative from the fruiting bodies of  (L.)

The objective of this study was to identify the association between AXIN2 rs2240308 with hypodontia and CRC.This study consisted of 50 individuals with hypodontia, 50 individuals with CRC, and 155 healthy individuals from Colombia. SNP genotyping assays of rs2240308 were performed and family history of  in individuals with hypodontia was documented In silico analysis was implemented to define the genomic profile of the AXIN2 gene associated with CRC. Multivariate analysis, chi square, odd ratio tests, and R software were used for statistical analysis.AXIN2 rs2240308 showed association with CRC (OR = .4 CI: 2.7-10.4;  < 0.001) and with other familial  in individuals with hypodontia ( < 0.005 OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-6.91). In silico analysis showed that variations in AXIN2 found in CRC patients, were more frequently in earlier stages of tumor and patients who carry variations in the AXIN2 gene have a worse prognosis ( < 0.05). The association between AXIN2 rs2240308 with hypodontia was not significant.These results suggest that AXIN2 rs2240308 polymorphism is associated with CRC and AXIN2 could be a risk marker for predisposition and prognosis of CRC.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659152>Truncated PPM1D impairs stem cell response to genotoxic stress and promotes growth of APC-deficient tumors in the mouse .</a></h1><p>Protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1 delta (PPM1D) terminates cell response to genotoxic stress by negatively regulating the tumor suppressor p53 and other targets at chromatin. Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1D allele to  tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in  stem cells harboring PPM1D resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the  in Apc mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from  of the ApcPpm1d mice were less sensitive to -fluorouracil when compared to ApcPpm1dand the sensitivity to -fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal  patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of  adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair. In summary, we provide the first in vivo evidence that truncated PPM1D can promote tumor growth and modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626792>Sevoflurane induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth and motility of  in vitro and in vivo via inactivating Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling.</a></h1><p>To investigate the effects of sevoflurane on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of  cell line SW480, and to explore its possible mechanism.SW480 and SW620 cells were treated with a mixture of 95% O+% CO containing different concentrations of sevoflurane (1.7% SAV, 3.4% SAV and .1% SAV) for 6 h. Meanwhile, we performed a rescue experiment by treating cells with the ERK pathway activator LM22B-10 prior to treatment of cells with .1% sevoflurane。 KEY FINDINGS: High concentration (.1%) of sevoflurane significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of cells, causing G0/G1 phase arrest and promoted apoptosis and autophagy. .1% sevoflurane can participate in the regulation of EMT by regulating the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin and N-cadherin proteins. LM22B-10 promoted proliferation and invasion of  cells and inhibited apoptosis and autophagy, while .1% sevoflurane could reverse the effect of LM22B-10 on the biological characteristics of cells. Sevoflurane can significantly inhibit tumor growth in SW480 cells transplanted nude mice. Moreover, .1% sevoflurane significantly increased the expression of p-Raf, p-MEK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 in SW480 cells and tumor tissues without affecting p-JNK and p-p38 proteins, meanwhile, .1% sevoflurane can inhibit the activation of ERK signaling pathway by LM22B-10 in vitro and in vivo.Sevoflurane can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of  cells, induce apoptosis and autophagy, and participate in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which may be related to its inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019.

This study aimed to present the clinicopathologic features of GNET, including treatment information. We included 19 patients with GNET with a mean tumor size of 4.2 cm. The most common site of tumor origin was the small intestine (57.9%), followed by the stomach (15.8%),  (10.%), ileocecal junction (.3%), lower esophagus (.3%), and anal canal (.3%). Microscopically, the tumors were composed of epithelioid cells with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm arranged in nest, sheet-like, papillary, or pseudoalveolar patterns and/or spindle tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in a fascicular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells stained positively for S100 (19/19,100%), SOX10 (14/15, 93.3%), vimentin (17/17, 100%), synaptophysin (Syn) (7/17, 41.2%), CD56 (4/13, 30.8%), CD99 (1/, 20%), and CD117 (1/15, 6.7%), and negatively for HMB45, Melan A, DOG1, CD34, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, chromogranin A, smooth muscle actin, and desmin. In total, 14/15 (93.3%) cases showed split Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1) signals consistent with a chromosomal translocation involving EWSR1. Within a mean follow-up of 29.7 months (range: 3 to 63 mo), 2/15 (13.3%) patients died of disease,  (33.3%) were alive with disease, and 8 (53.3%) had no evidence of disease. Two and 1 patients showed partial response to apatinib and anlotinib, respectively. In conclusion, GNET has distinctive morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic features and should be distinguished from other gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Apatinib and anlotinib might be effective for the treatment of advanced GNET and could prolong patient survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621980>miR-4709 overexpression facilitates  proliferation and invasion via downregulating NR3C2 and is an unfavorable prognosis factor in  adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>To date, microRNA-4709 (miR-4709) has not been studied in  adenocarcinoma (COAD) on the basis of experiments. In our study, we aimed to investigate the biological roles and clinical significance of miR-4709 in COAD. The expression difference between miR-4709 and NR3C2 was measured based on The  Genome Atlas database and cells. Kaplan-Meier and logrank tests were applied to determine the overall survival (OS) differences according to the miR-4709 and NR3C2 expression levels. To measure whether the miR-4709 level was associated with COAD cell growth, migration, and invasion, we respectively conducted 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, wound healing, and transwell assays. A luciferase reporter assay was applied to confirm the relationship between miR-4709 and its predicted target. High expression of miR-4709 was found in COAD tissues and cells. The OS rate in the miR-4709 low expression group was significantly higher than that in the miR-4709 high expression group. Univariate and multivariate analyses exhibited that miR-4709 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor. Exogenous miR-4709 overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of LOVO and SW480 cells. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-4709 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region of NR3C2. NR3C2 was lowly expressed in COAD and high expression of NR3C2 had a better prognosis compared with that in the low expression of NR3C2. Correlation analysis showed that there is a close association between the level of expression of NR3C2 and miR-4709. Accordingly, miR-4709 may function as an oncogene in COAD and provide a preclinical proof for candidate management to target new miR-4709-NR3C2 signaling for COAD therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545474>The oncogenic role of NKAP in the growth and invasion of  cells.</a></h1><p>It has been reported that NF‑κB activating protein (NKAP) is a transcriptional repressor of the Notch signaling pathway and is involved in the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells.

The results of immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis showed that NKAP was upregulated in  tissues, and its expression was associated with  stages. CCK‑8, colony formation, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays were used to demonstrate that NKAP knockdown significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of HCT116 and HT‑29 cells, and also induced apoptosis and autophagy. By contrast, NKAP overexpression markedly promoted the proliferation and invasion of HCT‑15 cells, and inhibited cell apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, we observed that NKAP knockdown inhibited the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HCT116 and HT‑29 cells, while NKAP overexpression promoted EMT in HCT‑15 cells. Furthermore, NKAP knockdown inhibited activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by downregulating the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, as well as their downstream proteins, whereas NKAP overexpression promoted the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

The aims of this study were to elucidate the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) for PALN metastasis from left-sided colorectal .A total of 108 patients who underwent radical surgery including PALN dissection were included. Size and morphology of PALN were evaluated using CT, and presence of higher FDG uptake was evaluated using PET. Findings of CT and PET were compared with pathological status.The largest major axis ≥11 mm and heterogeneous internal density were predictive factors on multivariate analysis. Eighty five percent of the PALNs ≥11 mm with heterogeneous internal density were pathologically metastatic, whereas 94.1% without them were not metastatic. PET had an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.7%, 66.7%, and 94.1%, respectively. In patients with PALNs <11 mm without heterogeneous internal density, the accuracy and specificity of PET improved to 93.8% and 96.6%, respectively. Conversely, in patients with some predictive CT findings, although the positive predictive value of PET increased from 83.3% to 88.9%, the accuracy and sensitivity remained at 70.6% and 66.7%, respectively, and 50.0% were false-negatives.CT had high NPV and relatively high PPV. PET had high specificity but low sensitivity. The addition of PET could be useful to confirm no PALN metastasis in patients with no predictive CT findings.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and role of cervical carcinoma expressed PCNA regulatory (CCEPR) lncRNA in colorectal  progression. The results demonstrated that CCEPR expression was significantly higher in colorectal  tissues when compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. In addition, CCEPR expression was significantly higher in patients with advanced colorectal  (stage III/IV) than those with early-stage colorectal  (stage I/II). High CCEPR expression was significantly associated with poor differentiation, advanced clinical stage, positive lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Of particular note, patients with colorectal  exhibiting high CCEPR expression levels had shorter survival rates when compared with patients with low CCEPR expression.  experiments demonstrated that the expression of CCEPR was increased in colorectal  cell lines when compared with a normal  cell line. Knockdown of CCEPR significantly inhibited colorectal  cell proliferation, colony formation and cell cycle progression, as well as cell migration and invasion. Finally, silencing of CCEPR downregulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal  cells.

There is even evidence that microRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Although microRNA expression profiles have been characterized in colorectal carcinoma, their precise physiological functions are largely unknown. It has become clear that the activated KRAS Proto‑Oncogene, GTPase (KRAS) oncogene plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the present study, it was found that the level of mature miR‑143 was lower in colorectal carcinoma tissues compared with that observed in normal adjacent tissues. A lack of miR‑143 was detected in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, SW480, LoVo and HT‑29, compared to the high expression observed in normal  epithelial cell line NCM460. pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 and its mutant were successfully constructed and transfected into colorectal carcinoma cells. Increased accumulation of mature miR‑143 was observed in the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143‑transfected cells. In SW480 cells, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 resulted in a 35 and 47% reduction in cell growth after incubation for 4 and  days, respectively, compared with transfection of the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 mutant; while in LoVo cells, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 resulted in a 33 and 46% reduction in cell growth respectively. In contrast, transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 had no significantly effects on HT‑29 cell growth. We also found that transfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 had no effect on levels of KRAS mRNA, but resulted in a 58% decrease in the KRAS protein level in the transfected SW480 cells, while an approximate 54 and 43% KRAS protein reduction in LoVo and HT‑29 cells, respectively, compared with the pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 mutant. Two fragments containing the putative complementary site were cloned into the pGL3 vector, constructing the luciferase reporter pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2. Cotransfection of pcDNA3.1‑pri‑miR‑143 with pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2 respectively resulted in 4.6‑ and 3.3‑fold inhibition of luciferase activity in the SW480 cells, while a 4.0‑ and 3.2‑fold inhibition of luciferase activity in the LoVo cells, 3.7‑ and 3.1‑fold inhibition in the HT‑29 cells. Differences in pGL3‑KRAS‑CS1 and pGL3‑KRAS‑CS2 activity were not significant. Our results revealed that increased accumulation of miR‑143 is likely to modulate levels of KRAS protein expression at the post‑transcriptional level by interacting specifically with the complementary site, and consequently inhibiting proliferation of the transfected cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620912>Population-based analysis on predictors for lymph node metastasis in T1 .</a></h1><p>In this study, we aimed to identify independent predictive factors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) in T1 .Data of 8056 eligible patients were retrospectively collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database during 2004-2012.

However, the chemopreventive activity has not yet been elucidated in preclinical animal models. This study was designed to determine whether dietary tricin exerts inflammation-associated  carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Male Crj: CD-1 mice were initiated with a single i.p. injection of AOM (10 mg/kg bw) and followed by a 1-week exposure to DSS (1.%, w/v) in drinking water to induce . They were then given the experimental diet containing 50 or 250 ppm tricin. The experiment was terminated at week 18 to determine the chemopreventive efficacy of tricin. The effects of dietary tricin on the expression of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, were also assayed. Feeding with tricin at both doses significantly inhibited the development of  tumors. Dietary tricin also significantly reduced the proliferation index and the numbers of mitoses/anaphase bridging of adenocarcinoma cells. Tricin feeding significantly suppressed the TNF-α expression in the normal appearing crypts. Our findings may suggest a potential use of tricin for clinical trials of colorectal  chemoprevention in the inflamed .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629705>Endoscopic submucosal dissection: Italian national survey on current practices, training and outcomes.</a></h1><p>Most of the evidence supporting endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) comes from Asia. European data are primarily reported by specialized referral centers and thus may not be representative of common European ESD practice. The aim of this study is to understand the current state of ESD practice across Italian endoscopy centers.All Italian endoscopists who were known to perform ESD were invited to complete a structured questionnaire including: operator features and competencies, ESD training details and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.Twenty-nine operators from 23 centers (69% response rate) completed the questionnaire: 18 (62%) were <50 years old; 7 (24%) were female; 16 (70%) were located in Northern Italy. Overall ESD volume was <40 cases in 9 (31%) operators, 40-80 in 8 (27.%), 80-150 in 4 (13.8%) and >150 in 8 (27.%). Colorectal ESD was predominant for operators with an experience >80 cases. En-bloc resection rates ranged from 77.2 to 97.2% depending on the anatomic location with an R0 resection rate range of 75.3-93.6%. ESD perforation rates in the  and rectum were significantly lower when experience was >150 compared to 80-150 cases (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006 for  and rectum, respectively).ESD in Italy is performed by a significant number of operators. Overall, Italian endoscopists performing ESD have achieved a good competence level. However, there is much variability in training protocols, initial supervision of procedures, practice settings, case mix and procedural volume/year that are likely responsible for some of the suboptimal resectional outcomes and increased perforation risk, mainly in the .

Here, in this study, comparison of SILS and TLS with long-term follow-up was evaluated by a meta-analysis method.All studies about SILS and TLS for right hemicolectomy from 2010 to 2018 were searched from databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Wanfang. Operation index, recovery, and midterm follow-up data were evaluated by fixed-effects models, random-effects models, and Begg test.We collected 22 studies with 2218 patients. SILS groups contained 1038 (46.7%) patients, and 1180 (53.3%) patients were observed in the TLS group. Patients' baseline data were similar in the 2 groups. Compared with TLS, SILS had shorter operation duration [standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.61 to -0.08, P<0.001, χ=49.40], shorter hospitalization time (SMD: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.16, P<0.001, χ=9.17), slightly less blood loss (SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.36 to -0.10; P<0.001; χ=.36), and smaller incision length (SMD: -2.19, 95% CI: -3.66 to -0.71, P<0.001; χ=316.1).

The preferred initial and most widely used pharmacological agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is metformin, which in parallel reduces the risk of CRC and improves patient prognosis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to be tightly associated with the beneficial metabolic effects of metformin, serving as a cellular energy sensor activated in response to a variety of conditions that deplete cellular energy levels. Such conditions include nutrient starvation (particularly glucose), hypoxia and exposure to toxins that inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of metformin on CRC cell lines, with different levels of anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) expression, exposed to -fluorouracil (-FU) and oxaliplatin, alone or in combination with metformin. AGR2 has recently emerged as a factor involved in  carcinogenesis. In -knockout cells, markedly higher levels of phosphorylated-AMPK were observed in comparison with control cells transfected with -scrambled guide RNA, which indicated that the presence of AGR2 may interfere with the metformin-dependent activation of AMPK. In addition, metformin in combination with -FU and oxaliplatin induced ROS production and attenuated autophagy. This effect was enhanced in -knockout cells.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651125>Incidence of second primary malignancies in patients with thyroid  in the Turkish population</a></h1><p>Thyroid    is  the  most  common  endocrine  malignancy.

Remnant synchronous lesions require additional colonoscopy procedures or surgery.To investigate factors of preoperative colonoscopy potentially affecting the detection of missed lesions in patients subjected to colorectal  surgery.Of 1147 colorectal  patients subjected to curative open or laparoscopic colectomy and colonoscopy at the Chungnam National University Hospital from January 2012 to December 2016, 518 patients underwent pre- and postoperative colonoscopy. The index colonoscopy was defined as the last preoperative endoscopy performed. We analyzed pre- and postoperative medical charts for colonoscopy and pathological data. The effects of patient, procedure, and tumor factors on the postoperative adenoma detection rate, advanced adenoma detection rate, and adenoma miss rate (AMR) were analyzed.The overall AMR was 25.7% (95% confidence interval, 22.2-29.8%). Comparing optimal and non-optimal bowel preparation groups, the latter had greater postoperative polyp missed rate (PMR), AMR (p < 0.01), and AAMR (p = 0.272). The optimal preparation group allowed identification of more synchronous adenomas than in the fair (OR .72) and poor (OR 11.39) preparation groups. On univariate analysis, patient age and left-sided colectomy (p < 0.01) influenced AMR. Multivariate analysis showed that age, preoperative bowel preparation, and left  resection influenced postoperative AMR.A better quality of index colonoscopy had a positive effect on lowering the detection rate of postoperative adenoma. Older age and suboptimal bowel preparation at the index colonoscopy and left-sided colectomy had negative effects on lowering the postoperative AMR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550095>Tumour budding predicts increased recurrence after curative resection for T2N0 colorectal </a></h1><p>Tumour budding is defined as the presence of a cluster of fewer than  cells along the invasive margin. It may confer a worse prognosis in colorectal , but its importance in pT2N0 colorectal  is unknown. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of tumour budding in pT2N0 colorectal .This was a retrospective cohort study with prospective assessment of tumour budding by 2 pathologists. We included all patients who underwent elective curative resection for pT2N0 colorectal  except those with hereditary colorectal  syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease or positive resection margins, those who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and those who died within 90 days of operation. Patients were classified as having high-grade tumour budding (≥ 10 budding foci per high-power field) or low-grade tumour budding (< 9 budding foci per high-power field). The main outcome measure was locoregional or distant recurrence.Of 85 patients, 36 had high-grade tumour budding and 49 had low-grade tumour budding. The overall recurrence rate was 11% (9/85) and median follow-up was 41.0 months (interquartile range 22.0–68.0). Interrater reliability for tumour budding assessment was excellent (κ = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.96). There were more recurrences in patients with high-grade tumour budding (7/36, 19.4% v. 2/49, 4.1%; p = 0.020). On multivariate analysis, after we adjusted for confounders, the presence of high-grade tumour budding was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio .11, 95% CI 1.01–25.9).Tumour budding was independently associated with increased recurrence after pT2N0 colorectal  resection.

Emergency presentation represents about 30% of cases, with increased morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study is to compare the perioperative outcome between elderly and non-elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery.We retrospectively analysed CRC patients that underwent emergency surgery at the Departments of Surgery of the Sapienza University Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, and at San Donato Hospital in Arezzo, between June 2012 and June 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: non-elderly (< 65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years). Variables analysed were sex, onset symptoms, associated disease, ASA score, tumor site and TNM stage, surgical procedures and approach, and morbidity and mortality.Of a total of 123 patients, 29 patients were non-elderly and 94 patients were elderly. No significant differences were observed in sex, onset symptoms and tumor site between the two groups. Comorbidities were significantly higher in elderly patients (73.4% vs 41.4%, p<0.001). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in surgical approach and the rate of one-stage procedures. Elderly patients were more frequently treated by Hartmann's procedure compared to non-elderly patients (20.2% vs 6.9%). Left colorectal resection with protective ileostomy was most frequent in the non-elderly group (27.6% vs 11.7%). No significant differences were found in the pT and pN categories of the TNM system between the two groups. However, a higher number of T3 in non-elderly patients was observed. A consistent number of non-oncologically adequate resections were observed in the elderly (21.3% vs 3.%; p<0.03). The morbidity rate was significantly higher in the elderly group (31.9 % vs 3.4%, p<0.001). No significant difference was found in the mortality rate between the two groups, being 13.8% in the elderly and 6.9% in the non-elderly.Emergency colorectal surgery for  still presents significant morbidity and mortality rates, especially in elderly patients.

Ropivacaine has been widely used in perioperative period as a long acting local anesthetic. An early event during recurrence or metastasis of carcinoma is the adhesion of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) to endothelial cells (ECs) through binding adhesion molecules that are up-regulated on inflamed endothelium during the perioperative period or other periods. This study was to explore the impact of ropivacaine on the adhesion of tumour cells, providing evidences of its influence on the prognosis of carcinoma.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were pre-treated with ropivacaine (10-10 M; 30 min) prior to treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (10 ng ml; 1, 4 and 8 h). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), endothelial-selectin (CD62E) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA levels were detected via quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To clarify the underlying action mechanism, p65, p-p65, IκBα, p-IκBα, IKKα/β and p-IKKα/β protein levels were evaluated via western blotting. Cell viability and tumour cell adhesion assays were also assessed.The clinically usage concentration of ropivacaine (10 M) produced a significant decrease in CD62E expression compared with that produced by TNFα only (p < 0.001). Moreover, adhesion assays showed that ropivacaine effectively inhibited the adhesion of hepatoma cells (p < 0.01), human  cells (p < 0.01) and human leukemic monocyte (p < 0.01). Western blot results showed that pre-treatment with ropivacaine inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 (p < 0.05), IκBα (p < 0.001) and IKKα/β (p < 0.01).Ropivacaine decreased the adhesion of tumour cells. Ropivacaine modulated CD62E expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB. These results might provide new insight into the issue whether anaesthesia has an impact on the prognosis of carcinoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31553833>Ustekinumab as Induction and Maintenance Therapy for Ulcerative Colitis.</a></h1><p>The efficacy of ustekinumab, an antagonist of the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, as induction and maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis is unknown.We evaluated ustekinumab as 8-week induction therapy and 44-week maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. A total of 961 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous induction dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg [320 patients] or a weight-range-based dose that approximated 6 mg per kilogram of body weight [322]) or placebo (319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy 8 weeks after administration of intravenous ustekinumab were randomly assigned again to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 12 weeks [172 patients] or every 8 weeks [176]) or placebo (175). The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤2 on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo.

The extent to which total mesorectal excision has been adopted in the United States is unknown.We sought to assess trends in total mesorectal excision performance and grading in Michigan hospitals.This is a retrospective cohort study from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative. Trends in total mesorectal excision performance and grade assignment were analyzed by using χ tests and linear regression.Participating hospitals (initially 14 hospitals, now 38) abstracted medical records data for rectal  cases from 2007 to 2016.Patients who underwent rectal  resection were included.The main outcome measures were surgeon-documented total mesorectal excision performance and pathologist-reported total mesorectal excision grade.Of 510 rectal  cases, 367 (72.0%) had surgeon-reported total mesorectal excision performance and 78 (15.3%) had pathologist-reported total mesorectal excision grade. Between-hospital variability in total mesorectal excision performance ranged from 0% to 97% and total mesorectal excision grading ranged from 0% to 90%. Total mesorectal excision grading was associated with a higher likelihood of also having adequate lymph node assessment (88.% versus 71.9%, p = 0.002). There has been a statistically significant trend toward an increase in total mesorectal excision grading in the original 14 hospitals (p = 0.001), but not in the complete cohort of all hospitals (p = 0.057).This is a retrospective cohort design with sampled rectal  cases. In addition, there is insufficient granularity to capture all factors associated with total mesorectal excision performance or grade assignment.The rates of total mesorectal excision performance and grade assignment are widely variable throughout the state of Michigan. Overall, grade assignment remains very low. This suggests an opportunity for quality improvement projects to increase total mesorectal excision performance and grading, involving both the surgeons and pathologists for effective implementation.

We assessed the association of level of ligation with each outcome by fitting individual univariable and multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for surgical approach, tumor location, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and Charlson comorbidity index.We included 158 patients treated with high ligation and 123 patients treated with low ligation. Overall, 12 patients had an anastomotic leak requiring intervention within 30 days:  in the high ligation group (3.2%, 95% CI 1.4-7.2%) and 7 in the low ligation group (.7%, 95% CI 2.8-11.3%). There was no association between the level of ligation and anastomotic leak (unadjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.58-6.38; adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16-2.55).

Increased WNT2 expression is detectable in many carcinomas and participates in tumor progression. In human colorectal  (CRC), WNT2 is selectively elevated in -associated fibroblasts (CAFs), leading to increased invasion and metastasis. However, if there is a role for WNT2 in , angiogenesis was not addressed so far. We demonstrate that WNT2 enhances EC migration/invasion, while it induces canonical WNT signaling in a small subset of cells. Knockdown of WNT2 in CAFs significantly reduced angiogenesis in a physiologically relevant assay, which allows precise assessment of key angiogenic properties. In line with these results, expression of WNT2 in otherwise WNT2-devoid skin fibroblasts led to increased angiogenesis. In CRC xenografts, WNT2 overexpression resulted in enhanced vessel density and tumor volume. Moreover, WNT2 expression correlates with vessel markers in human CRC. Secretome profiling of CAFs by mass spectrometry and cytokine arrays revealed that proteins associated with pro-angiogenic functions are elevated by WNT2. These included extracellular matrix molecules, ANG-2, IL-6, G-CSF, and PGF. The latter three increased angiogenesis. Thus, stromal-derived WNT2 elevates angiogenesis in CRC by shifting the balance towards pro-angiogenic signals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567189> Adenocarcinomas Harboring NTRK Fusion Genes: A Clinicopathologic and Molecular Genetic Study of 16 Cases and Review of the Literature.</a></h1><p>This study was undertaken to determine the frequency, and the clinicopathologic and genetic features, of  cancers driven by neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusions. Of the 7008 tumors screened for NTRK expression using a pan-Trk antibody, 16 (0.23%) had Trk immunoreactivity. ArcherDx assay detected TPM3-NTRK1 (n=9), LMNA-NTRK1 (n=3), TPR-NTRK1 (n=2) and EML4-NTRK3 (n=1) fusion transcripts in 15 cases with sufficient RNA quality. Patients were predominantly women (median age: 63 y). The tumors involved the right (n=12) and left  unequally and were either stage T3 (n=12) or T4. Local lymph node and distant metastases were seen at presentation in 6 and 1 patients, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion was present in all cases.

DNA mismatch repair-deficient phenotype was seen in 13 cases. Tumor-infiltrating CD4/CD8 lymphocytes were prominent in 9 cases. Programmed death-ligand 1 positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells and focal tumor cell positivity were seen in the majority of cases. CDX2 expression and loss of CK20 and MUC2 expression were frequent. CK7 was expressed in  cases. No mutations in BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA were identified. However, other genes of the PI3K-AKT/MTOR pathway were mutated. In several cases, components of Wnt/β-catenin (APC, AMER1, CTNNB1), p53, and TGFβ (ACVR2A, TGFBR2) pathways were mutated.

To evaluate the role of newly developed CXCR4 antagonists (PCT/IB2011/000120/ EP2528936B1/US2013/0079292A1) in potentiating anti-PD-1 efficacy two syngeneic murine models, the MC38  and the B16 melanoma-human CXCR4-transduced, were employed.Mice were subcutaneously injected with MC38 (1 × 10) or B16-hCXCR4 ( × 10). After two weeks, tumors bearing mice were intraperitoneally (ip) treated with murine anti-PD-1 [RMP1-14] ( mg/kg, twice week for 2 weeks), Pep R (2 mg/kg,  days per week for 2 weeks), or both agents. The TME was evaluated through immunohistochemistry and flow-cytometry. In addition, the effects of the human-anti-PD-1 nivolumab and/or Peptide-R54 (Pep R54), were evaluated on human melanoma PES43 cells and xenografts treated.The combined treatment, Pep R plus anti-PD-1, reduced the MC38 Relative Tumor Volume (RTV) by 2.67 fold (p = 0.038) while nor anti-PD-1, neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. Significant higher number of Granzyme B (GZMB) positive cells was detected in MC38 tumors from mice treated with the combined treatment (p = 0.016) while anti-PD-1 determined a modest but significant increase of tumor-infiltrating GZMB positive cells (p = 0.035). Also, a lower number of FoxP3 positive cells was detected (p = 0.022). In the B16-hCXCR4 tumors, two weeks of combined treatment reduced tumor volume by 2.27 fold while nor anti-PD-1 neither Pep R significantly impacted on tumor growth. A significant higher number of GRZB positive cells was observed in B16-hCXCR4 tumors treated with combined treatment (p = 0,0015) as compared to anti-PD-1 (p = 0.028). The combined treatment reduced CXCR4, CXCL12 and PD-L1 expression in MC38 tumors. In addition, flow cytometry on fresh B16-hCXCR4 tumors showed significantly higher Tregs number following anti-PD-1 partially reversed by the combined treatment Pep R and anti-PD-1. Combined treatment determined an increase of CD8/Tregs and CD8/MDSC ratio. To dissect the effect of anti-PD-1 and CXCR4 targeting on PD-1 expressed by human  cells, PES43 human melanoma xenograft model was employed. In vitro human anti-PD-1 nivolumab or pembrolizumab (10 μM) reduced PES43 cells growth while nivolumab (10 μM) inhibited pERK1/2, P38 MAPK, pAKT and p4EBP. PES43 xenograft mice were treated with Pep R54, a newly developed Pep R derivative (AcHN-Arg-Ala-[DCys-Arg- Nal(2')-His-Pen]- COOH), plus nivolumab. After 3 weeks of combined treatment a significant reduction in tumor growth was shown (p = 0.038). PES43 lung disseminated tumor cells (DTC) were detected in fresh lung tissues as melanoma positive MCSP-APC cells. Although not statistically significant, DTC-PES43 cells were reduced in mice lungs treated with combined treatment while nivolumab or Pep R54 did not affect DTC number.Combined treatment with the new developed CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R, plus anti-PD-1, reduced tumor-growth in two syngeneic murine models, anti-PD-1 sensitive and resistant, potentiating Granzyme and reducing Foxp3 cells infiltration. In addition, the human specific CXCR4 antagonist, Pep R54, cooperated with nivolumab in inhibiting the growth of the PD-1 expressing human PES43 melanoma xenograft. This evidence sheds light on PD-1 targeting mechanisms and paves the way for CXCR4/PD-1 targeting combination therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588431>An Integrated Approach for Efficient Multi-Omics Joint Analysis.</a></h1><p>The challenges associated with multi-omics analysis, e.g. DNA-seq, RNA-seq, metabolomics, methylomics and microbiomics domains, include: (1) increased high-dimensionality, as all -omics domains include ten thousands to hundreds of thousands of variables each; (2) increased complexity in analyzing domain-domain interactions, quadratic for pairwise correlation, and exponential for higher-order interactions; (3) variable heterogeneity, with highly skewed distributions in different units and scales for methylation and microbiome. Here, we developed an efficient strategy for joint-domain analysis, applying it to an analysis of correlations between  epithelium methylomics and fecal microbiomics data with colorectal  risk as estimated by colorectal polyp prevalence. First, we applied domain-specific standard pipelines for quality assessment, cleaning, batch-effect removal, et cetera. Second, we performed variable homogenization for both the methylation and microbiome data sets, using domain-specific normalization and dimension reduction, obtaining scale-free variables that could be compared across the two domains. Finally, we implemented a joint-domain network analysis to identify relevant microbial-methylation island patterns. The network analysis considered all possible species-island pairs, thus being quadratic in its complexity. However, we were able to pre-select the unpaired variables by performing a preliminary association analysis on the outcome polyp prevalence. All results from association and interaction analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Although the limited sample size did not provide good power (80% to detect medium to large effect sizes with % alpha error), a number of potentially significant association (dozens in the uncorrected analysis, reducing to just a few in the corrected one) were identified As a last step, we linked the network patterns identified by our approach to the KEGG functional ontology, showing that the method can generate new mechanistic hypotheses for the biological causes of polyp development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545494>KRAS and BRAF mutations induce anoikis resistance and characteristic 3D phenotypes in Caco‑2 cells.</a></h1><p>In a number of types of , anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by loss of extracellular matrix (ECM) attachment, is disturbed. Anoikis resistance is essential in the formation of metastases. A recent study identified carcinoma cell subpopulations surviving without ECM contact in pathological specimens of colorectal . The occurrence of these subpopulations indicated anoikis resistance. In the present study, it is demonstrated that KRAS and BRAF mutations induce anoikis resistance in  (Caco‑2) cells. In 3D cultures, Caco‑2 cells transfected with mutated KRAS or BRAF formed multicellular structures analogous to anoikis‑resistant subpopulations in actual carcinomas, and serve as an in vitro model for anoikis resistance. Caco‑2 cell lines were constructed, with KRAS or BRAF mutations, using retroviral delivery. The current study investigated anoikis resistance using an Annexin V apoptosis test from suspension cultures. 3D in vitro cultures, which were generated in collagen‑matrigel mixtures, were assessed using confocal microscopy. 3D cultures embedded in paraffin were analyzed using conventional histopathology. In suspension cultures, Caco‑2 cells with KRAS or BRAF mutations indicated a significantly lower proportion of Annexin positivity than the native Caco‑2 cells, indicating that these mutations induce anoikis resistance in Caco‑2 cells. 3D cultures displayed native Caco‑2 cells forming polarized cysts with a single layer thick epithelium, whereas Caco‑2 cells with KRAS or BRAF mutations formed partially filled cystic structures or solid round structures where only the outermost layer was in contact with the ECM. Additionally, KRAS mutations induced reversed polarity to Caco‑2 cells along with the emergence of solid growth. The present study demonstrated that KRAS and BRAF mutations induce anoikis resistance in Caco‑2 colorectal  cells. The growth patterns generated from the KRAS and BRAF mutated cells in 3D cultures revealed a resemblance to the putative anoikis‑resistant subpopulations in actual carcinomas, including micropapillary structures and solid tumor cell islands. Additionally, KRAS mutation induced the emergence of inverted polarity. In conclusion, 3D cultures with modified Caco‑2 cells serve as a valid in vitro model for anoikis resistance and inverted polarity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31547283>Modified  Leakage Score to Predict Anastomotic Leakage in Patients Who Underwent Left-Sided Colorectal Surgery.</a></h1><p> leakage score (CLS) was introduced as a clinical tool to predict anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients who underwent left-sided colorectal surgery, but its clinical validity has not been widely studied. We evaluated the clinical utility of CLS and developed a modified CLS (m-CLS). In total, 566 patients who underwent left-sided colorectal surgery were enrolled and categorized into training ( = 396) and validation ( = 170) sets via random sampling. Using CLS variables, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied for variable selection and predictive signature building in the training set. The model's performance was validated in the validation set. The predictive powers of m-CLS and CLS were compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the overall group. Twenty-three AL events (4.1%) were noted. The AL group had a significantly higher mean CLS than the No Leakage group (12. vs. 9.6,  = 0.001). Five clinical variables were selected and used to generate m-CLS. The predictive performance of m-CLS was similar in training and validation sets (AUROC 0.838 vs. 0.803,  = 0.724). In the overall set, m-CLS was significantly predictive of AL and performed better than CLS (AUROC 0.831 vs. 0.701,  = 0.008). In conclusion, LASSO-model-generated m-CLS could predict AL more accurately than CLS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551581>Systemic MEK inhibition enhances the efficacy of -aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy.</a></h1><p>Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) gets accumulated preferentially in -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA)-treated  cells. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilises the accumulated PpIX to trigger cell death by light-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We previously demonstrated that oncogenic Ras/MEK decreases PpIX accumulation in  cells. Here, we investigated whether combined therapy with a MEK inhibitor would improve -ALA-PDT efficacy. cells and mice models of  were treated with -ALA-PDT, MEK inhibitor or both MEK inhibitor and -ALA-PDT, and treatment efficacies were evaluated.Ras/MEK negatively regulates the cellular sensitivity to -ALA-PDT as  cells pre-treated with a MEK inhibitor were killed more efficiently by -ALA-PDT. MEK inhibition promoted -ALA-PDT-induced ROS generation and programmed cell death. Furthermore, the combination of -ALA-PDT and a systemic MEK inhibitor significantly suppressed tumour growth compared with either monotherapy in mouse models of . Remarkably, 44% of mice bearing human  tumours showed a complete response with the combined treatment.We demonstrate a novel strategy to promote -ALA-PDT efficacy by targeting a cell signalling pathway regulating its sensitivity. This preclinical study provides a strong basis for utilising MEK inhibitors, which are approved for treating cancers, to enhance -ALA-PDT efficacy in the clinic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636762>Survival by  stage and screening interval in Lynch syndrome: a prospective Lynch syndrome database report.</a></h1><p>We previously reported that in pathogenic mismatch repair () variant carriers, the incidence of colorectal  (CRC) was not reduced when colonoscopy was undertaken more frequently than once every 3 years, and that CRC stage and interval since last colonoscopy were not correlated.The Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD) that records outcomes of surveillance was examined to determine survival after  in relation to the time since previous colonoscopy and pathological stage. Only  variants scored by the InSiGHT variant database as class 4 or  (clinically actionable) were included in the analysis.Ninety-nine  carriers had no  prior to or at first colonoscopy, but subsequently developed . Among these, 96 were 65 years of age or younger at diagnosis, and included 77 , 17  and 2  carriers. The number of cancers detected within < 1., 1.-2., 2.-3. and at > 3. years after previous colonoscopy were 9, 43, 31 and 13, respectively. Of these, 2, 8, 4 and 3 were stage III, respectively, and only one stage IV (interval 2.-3. years) disease. Ten-year crude survival after  were 93, 94 and 82% for stage I, II and III disease, respectively ( < 0.001). Ten-year crude survival when the last colonoscopy had been < 1., 1.-2., 2.-3. or > 3. years before diagnosis, was 89, 90, 90 and 92%, respectively ( = 0.91).In  and  carriers, more advanced  stage was associated with poorer survival, whereas time since previous colonoscopy was not. Although the numbers are limited, together with our previously reported findings, these results may be in conflict with the view that follow-up of  variant carriers with colonoscopy intervals of less than 3 years provides significant benefit.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630307>Disparities in surgery for early-stage : the impact of refusal.</a></h1><p>For early-stage  surgery is often curative, yet refusal of recommended surgical interventions may be contributing to disparities in patient treatment. This study aims to assess predictors of early-stage cancers surgery refusal, and the impact on survival.Patients recommended surgery with primary stage I and II lung, prostate, breast, and  cancers, diagnosed between 2007-2014, were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (n = 498,927). Surgery refusal was reported for ,757 (1.2%) patients. Associations between sociodemographic variables and surgery refusal by  type were assessed in adjusted multivariable logistic regression models. The impact of refusal on survival was investigated using adjusted Cox-Proportional Hazard regression in a propensity score-matched cohort.Increasing age (p < 0.0001 for all four  types), non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.68-2.39; OR 3.04, 95% CI 2.17-4.26; OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.77-2.71; OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.86-2.20; vs non-Hispanic White), insurance status (uninsured: OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.89-3.99; OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.72-2.56; vs insured), marital status (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.85-2.51; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.10; OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.80-2.47; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.81-2.09), and stage (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.70-2.22; OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.18; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96) were all associated with refusal; patients refusing surgery were at increased risk of death compared to patients who underwent surgery.More vulnerable patients are at higher risk of refusing recommended surgery, and this decision negatively impacts their survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621801>Circulating Tumor DNA Analyses as Markers of Recurrence Risk and Benefit of Adjuvant Therapy for Stage III .</a></h1><p>Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III  prevents recurrence by eradicating minimal residual disease. However, which patients remain at high risk of recurrence after completing standard adjuvant treatment cannot currently be determined. Postsurgical circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis can detect minimal residual disease and is associated with recurrence in colorectal cancers.To determine whether serial postsurgical and postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis could provide a real-time indication of adjuvant therapy efficacy in stage III .This multicenter, Australian, population-based cohort biomarker study recruited 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed stage III  planned for 24 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy from November 1, 2014, through May 31, 2017. Patients with another malignant neoplasm diagnosed within the last 3 years were excluded. Median duration of follow-up was 28.9 months (range, 11.6-46.4 months). Physicians were blinded to ctDNA results. Data were analyzed from December 10, 2018, through June 23, 2019.Serial plasma samples were collected after surgery and after chemotherapy. Somatic mutations in individual patients' tumors were identified via massively parallel sequencing of 15 genes commonly mutated in colorectal . Personalized assays were designed to quantify ctDNA.Detection of ctDNA and recurrence-free interval (RFI).After 4 exclusions, 96 eligible patients were eligible; median patient age was 64 years (range, 26-82 years); 49 (51%) were men. At least 1 somatic mutation was identified in the tumor tissue of all 96 evaluable patients. Circulating tumor DNA was detectable in 20 of 96 (21%) postsurgical samples and was associated with inferior recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; 95% CI, 2.4-21.0; P < .001). Circulating tumor DNA was detectable in 15 of 88 (17%) postchemotherapy samples. The estimated 3-year RFI was 30% when ctDNA was detectable after chemotherapy and 77% when ctDNA was undetectable (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 11.0-157.0; P < .001). Postsurgical ctDNA status remained independently associated with RFI after adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk factors (HR, 7.; 95% CI, 3.-16.1; P < .001).Results suggest that ctDNA analysis after surgery is a promising prognostic marker in stage III . Postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis may define a patient subset that remains at high risk of recurrence despite completing standard adjuvant treatment. This high-risk population presents a unique opportunity to explore additional therapeutic approaches.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562764>Targeted next-generation sequencing of circulating-tumor DNA for tracking minimal residual disease in localized .</a></h1><p>A high percentage of patients diagnosed with localized  (CC) will relapse after curative treatment. Although pathological staging currently guides our treatment decisions, there are no biomarkers determining minimal residual disease (MRD) and patients are at risk of being undertreated or even overtreated with chemotherapy in this setting. Circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) can to be a useful tool to better detect risk of relapse.One hundred and fifty patients diagnosed with localized CC were prospectively enrolled in our study. Tumor tissue from those patients was sequenced by a custom-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to characterize somatic mutations. A minimum variant allele frequency (VAF) of % was applied for variant filtering. Orthogonal droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) validation was carried out. We selected known variants with higher VAF to track ctDNA in the plasma samples by ddPCR.NGS found known pathological mutations in 132 (88%) primary tumors. ddPCR showed high concordance with NGS (r = 0.77) for VAF in primary tumors. Detection of ctDNA after surgery and in serial plasma samples during follow-up were associated with poorer disease-free survival (DFS) [hazard ratio (HR), 17.56; log-rank P = 0.0014 and HR, 11.33; log-rank P = 0.0001, respectively]. Tracking at least two variants in plasma increased the ability to identify MRD to 87.%. ctDNA was the only significantly independent predictor of DFS in multivariable analysis. In patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, presence of ctDNA after therapy was associated with early relapse (HR 10.02; log-rank P < 0.0001). Detection of ctDNA at follow-up preceded radiological recurrence with a median lead time of 11. months.Plasma postoperative ctDNA detected MRD and identified patients at high risk of relapse in localized CC. Mutation tracking with more than one variant in serial plasma samples improved our accuracy in predicting MRD.© The Author(s) 2019.

Its etiology and treatment have not been well established. The aim of this systematic literature review was to try to characterize cMALToma and analyze the risk factors for treatment failure with various therapeutic strategies.We retrospectively reviewed 50 case reports from 1993 to 2017 through a PubMed search of English medical literature, describing cMALToma. We included 67 patients from previous case reports and we added 6 patients treated for cMALToma in our multicenter institutes. Risk factor analysis was done for treatment failure, defined as remission failure and recurrence.Of 73 patients diagnosed with cMALToma, tumors were located in 54 patients (74.0%) in the rectum, in 10 patients (13.6%) in the right , in 3 patients (4.1%) in the transverse , and in 6 patients (8.2%) in the sigmoid . In first-line treatment, patients achieved complete remission (CR) with surgery (18/19 cases), local resection (18/19 cases), chemotherapy (12/13 cases), radiation therapy (4/ cases), antibiotics therapy including  eradication (12/15 cases), and no treatment (1/2 cases). Among these, eight cases (10.9%) needed second-line treatment, and there was overall remission failure in 3 cases (4.1%). Of the remaining 70 patients with CR, the tumor recurred in  patients (6.8%). The multivariable analysis showed that male sex, multiple tumors, and first-line treatment failure were significantly related to treatment failure (=0.03, =0.05, =0.03, respectively).CR of primary cMALToma was achieved using various therapeutic strategies. First-line treatment failure and multiple tumors were associated with treatment failure, although the numbers of cases that failed are too small to draw definitive conclusions.© 2019 Won et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597260>Bio-Mediated Synthesis and Characterisation of Silver Nanocarrier, and Its Potent Anticancer Action.</a></h1><p>Discovery of a potent drug nanocarrier is crucial for  therapy in which drugs often face challenges in penetrating efficiently into solid tumours.

The best condition for AgNPs synthesis was with 0. g of peel extract, 7. mM silver nitrate at 45 °C, ~pH 4 for 16 h. The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and 32.7 ± .7 nm in size. To test its efficiency to be used as drug carrier, plant-based drug, protocatechuic acid (PCA) was used as a test drug. AgNPs loaded with PCA (AgPCA) resulted in 80% of inhibition at 15.6 µg/mL as compared to AgNPs which only killed % of HCT116 colorectal cells at same concentration. The IC of AgNPs and AgPCA for HCT116 were 40.2 and 10.7 µg/mL, respectively. At 15.6 µg/mL, AgPCA was not toxic to the tested  normal cells, CCD112. Ag-based drug carrier could also potentially reduce the toxicity of loaded drug as the IC of PCA alone (148.1 µg/mL) was higher than IC of AgPCA (10.7 µg/mL) against HCT116. Further, 24-h treatment of 15.6 µg/mL AgPCA resulted in loss of membrane potential in the mitochondria of HCT116 cells and increased level of reaction oxygen species (ROS). These could be the cellular killing mechanisms of AgPCA. Collectively, our findings show the synergistic anticancer activity of AgNPs and PCA, and its potential to be used as a potent anticancer drug nanocarrier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545454>Downregulated IGFBP7 facilitates liver metastasis by modulating epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in .</a></h1><p>Distant metastasis is a major cause of ‑associated mortality in patients with .

As the prevalence of thyroid  increases worldwide, thyroid  survivorship is associated with increasing personal and cumulative costs. Few studies have examined the psychological and material economic costs experienced by thyroid  survivors. We seek to estimate the comparative prevalence of financial and psychological hardship among thyroid  and non-thyroid  patients in the United States.The 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Experiences with  databank was queried to identify thyroid and non-thyroid (, breast, lung, prostate)  survivors. This survey includes assessments of financial stress, material hardship, and psychological financial hardship.  incidence-based weighted estimates of responses were compared between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. Independent predictors of material and psychological financial burden were identified through separate multivariate regression models.Thyroid  survivors more frequently reported psychological financial burden compared to non-thyroid  (46.1% vs 24.0%, P = .04). Material financial hardship (28.1% vs 19.9%, P = .37) and concurrent material and psychological hardship (25.1% vs 12.%, P = .09) were noted at similar frequencies between thyroid and non-thyroid  survivors. However, on multivariate analysis, only younger age and lack of health insurance coverage were independently associated with psychological financial hardship.Thyroid  survivors report greater psychological financial hardship than non-thyroid  survivors. Because this financial burden may be underrecognized in the medical community, further studies should be conducted to aid physicians in better understanding the impact of a thyroid  diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a  model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of  patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to -related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities of pectinase-treated Prunus mume fruit concentrate (PC) and its phenolic components. PC treatment (250 to 1,000 µg/mL) resulted in decreased proliferation of SW480 human colorectal  cells through S-phase cell cycle arrest; however, equivalent concentrations of PC did not show toxicity toward CRL-1539  normal cells. Furthermore, PC-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in SW480 cells, which was characterized by accumulation of apoptotic cell population, cell shrinkage, formation of apoptotic bodies, upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, cleaved PARP, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Antiangiogenesis effects of PC were assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that PC did not inhibit HUVECs proliferation at concentrations of 500 to 1,500 µg/mL. In addition, treatment with PC at nontoxic concentrations (500 to 1,000 µg/mL) blocked vascular endothelial growth factor induced cell migration, invasion, capillary-like tube formation, and angiogenesis from rat aortic rings. HPLC-PDA analysis showed that there were at least four different phenolics including -HMF, neochlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and syringic acid. Taken together, these results indicated that PC could be used as a good source of phenolic compounds with selective anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Pectinases are one of the well-known enzyme used in the part of food processing. Treatment of pectinase is a useful strategy to reduce viscosity, turbidity, and pulp particles in the production of fruit juice, extract, and concentrate. In the present study, we found that pectinase-treated P. mume fruit concentrate significantly suppresses colorectal  proliferation and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The significance of our findings is that pectinase-treated P. mume concentrate may be used as a commercial functional food material to inhibit colorectal  and angiogenesis.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626200>[Differential diagnostic value of the expression of the transcription factor PDX-1 in neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and other organs].</a></h1><p>An important role in the differentiation of tissues in different organs is played by transforming factors (TFs); pancreatic and duodenal homebox 1 (PDX-1) is one of the earliest factors for pancreatic cells. Many malignant tumors, including neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), are similar in structure, and therefore the actual problem of oncomorphology is to search for narrow-specific markers and TFs.to comparatively analyze and assess the value of the expression of the TF PDX-1 in NETs and non-NETs of different localization and histogenetic origin.Anti-PDX-1 antibodies were used to study 528 tumors divided into 3 groups: Group 1 included 394 NETs, among them there were those of the pancreas (n=173), stomach (n=46), bowel (n=65), lung (n=40), thymus (n=8), kidney (n=6), Merkel's cell carcinomas (n=14), NETs of the breast (n=3), larynx (n=2), trachea (n=2), bladder (n=1), and metastatic NETs (n=34) of unknown primary site; Group 2 consisted of 16 tumors, of them there were paragangliomas (n=6), medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (n=6) and adrenal pheochromocytomas (APCC) (n=4); Group 3 comprised 118 non-NETs, among them there were tumors of the pancreas (n=54), stomach (n=26), bowel (n=17), lung (n=11), breast (n=3), kidney (n=4), adrenal glands (n=2), and bladder (n=1).PDX-1 was positive in 75.1% (130/173) of pancreatic NETs, all insulinomas (50/50), gastrinomas (11/11), somatostatinomas (3/3), ACTH-producing tumors (2/2); PDX-1 was positive in the non-functioning pancreatic NETs, all PPomas (19/19), 76.1% (35/46) of NETs without the hormone detected, 50% (2/4) of calcitoninomas, and 21.1% (8/38) of silent glucagonomas. PDX-1 was positive in 32.4% (11/34) of carcinoids and 50% (6/12) of neuroendocrine carcinomas, all duodenal NETs (18/18), 90% (9/10) of rectal carcinoids and 30.8% (4/13)  carcinoids, 37.% (3/8) of thymic/mediastinal carcinoids, 66.7% (4/6) of kidney carcinoids, and 37.% (9/24) of metastatic NETs of unknown primary site. PDX-1 was negative in all carcinoids of the  and sigmoid (0/), ileum and jejunum (0/24), lung (0/40), trachea (0/2), larynx (0/2), Merkel's cell carcinoma (0/14), breast (0/3), bladder (0/1), as well as MTC (0/6), APCC (0/4), and paragangliomas (0/6). PDX-1-positive non-NETs included 81.8% (18/22) of adenocarcinomas (AC) and all serous cystic, mucinous cystic, intraductal and acinar cell tumors of the pancreas (4/4, 3/3, 2/2, and 3/3), 57.1% of AC (8/14) and 83.3% of signet ring cell carcinomas of the stomach (10/12), 56.2% AC of the bowel (9/17), bladder  (1/1).

Pancreatic ductal and acinar cell tumors and gastric signet ring cell carcinomas are most commonly PDX-1-positive. Most tumors that do not originate from the digestive tract have a PDX-1 negative immunophenotype.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572428>Inferring Latent Disease-lncRNA Associations by Faster Matrix Completion on a Heterogeneous Network.</a></h1><p>Current studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in a variety of fundamental biological processes related to complex human diseases. The prediction of latent disease-lncRNA associations can help to understand the pathogenesis of complex human diseases at the level of lncRNA, which also contributes to the detection of disease biomarkers, and the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging and urgent task to accurately identify latent disease-lncRNA association. Discovering latent links on the basis of biological experiments is time-consuming and wasteful, necessitating the development of computational prediction models. In this study, a computational prediction model has been remodeled as a matrix completion framework of the recommendation system by completing the unknown items in the rating matrix. A novel method named faster randomized matrix completion for latent disease-lncRNA association prediction (FRMCLDA) has been proposed by virtue of improved randomized partial SVD (rSVD-BKI) on a heterogeneous bilayer network. First, the correlated data source and experimentally validated information of diseases and lncRNAs are integrated to construct a heterogeneous bilayer network. Next, the integrated heterogeneous bilayer network can be formalized as a comprehensive adjacency matrix which includes lncRNA similarity matrix, disease similarity matrix, and disease-lncRNA association matrix where the uncertain disease-lncRNA associations are referred to as blank items. Then, a matrix approximate to the original adjacency matrix has been designed with predicted scores to retrieve the blank items. The construction of the approximate matrix could be equivalently resolved by the nuclear norm minimization. Finally, a faster singular value thresholding algorithm with a randomized partial SVD combing a new sub-space reuse technique has been utilized to complete the adjacency matrix. The results of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) experiments and -fold cross-validation (-fold CV) experiments on three different benchmark databases have confirmed the availability and adaptability of FRMCLDA in inferring latent relationships of disease-lncRNA pairs, and in inferring lncRNAs correlated with novel diseases without any prior interaction information. Additionally, case studies have shown that FRMCLDA is able to effectively predict latent lncRNAs correlated with three widespread malignancies: prostate , , and gastric .Copyright © 2019 Li, Wang, Xu, Mao, Tian and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571860>3,,4'-trimethoxy-trans-stilbene loaded PEG-PE micelles for the treatment of .</a></h1><p>3,,4'-trimethoxy-trans-stilbene (BTM) is a methylated derivative of resveratrol.

PEG-PE micelles facilitated BTM entering to the CT26 cells and BTM@PEG-PE micelles exerted enhanced anti- efficacy against CT26 cells. BTM@PEG-PE micelles showed prolonged half-life and increased bioavailability. More importantly, BTM@PEG-PE micelles treatment suppressed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice and prolonged survival with minimal damage to normal tissues.Altogether, the BTM@PEG-PE micelles might be a promising strategy to enhance the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic potentials of BTM for  therapy.© 2019 Wu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614098>The modulatory effects of exercise on the inflammatory and apoptotic markers in rats with 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine- induced colorectal .</a></h1><p>This study was aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms in anti-tumorigenesis effects of exercise through evaluation of inflammation and apoptosis. Twenty-four Wistar rats were divided into Control, Exercise, 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and DMH + Exercise. After a week, rats in DMH group were given DMH twice a week for two weeks. Animals in exercise groups performed exercise on a treadmill  days/week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of training, levels of COX-2, PCNA, Bax, Bcl-2 and procaspase-3/cleaved caspase-3 were assessed. Histological changes, number of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were also analyzed. ACF number was significantly decreased following exercise program. Protein levels of COX-2, PCNA and serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly elevated in the rats receiving DMH and downregulated after performing exercise program (P<0.05). Exercise upregulated apoptosis, which was evident from the increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio and enhanced the expression levels of activated caspase-3, as compared to DMH group. The  architecture was improved in DMH + Exercise. Exercise can effectively attenuate DMH-induced increase of inflammatory markers. Exercise induces apoptosis at the downstream of inflammatory response.

Measures included any use, incident use, regular use (use ≥ 45 days in a 91-day quarter), and average daily dose (converted to morphine milligram equivalent, MME). We also assessed temporal trends of opioid use.Of 2,039  patients, 11-15% received opioids in the four pre-diagnosis quarters, 68% in the first quarter after diagnosis, and 15-17% in each subsequent 19 quarters. Regular opioid use increased from 3 to % pre-diagnosis to -7% post diagnosis. Average dose increased from 15 to 17 MME/day pre-diagnosis to 14-22 MME/day post diagnosis (excluding the quarter in which  was diagnosed). Among post-diagnosis opioid users, 73-95% were on a low dose (< 20 MME/day). Over years, regular use of opioids increased in survivorship with no change in dosage.Opioid use slightly increased following a  diagnosis, but high-dose use was rare.

Although some potential biochemical targets have been identified, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. We found that N6-isopentenyladenosine affects colorectal  proliferation in in vitro models carrying different mutational status of  and  genes, and in HCT116 xenografts in SCID mice, by increasing the expression of the well-established tumor suppressor FBXW7, a component of the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that promotes degradation of various oncoproteins and transcription factors, such as c-Myc, SREBP and Mcl1. Corroborating our previous studies, we identified for the first time the FBXW7/SREBP/FDPS axis as a target of the compound. Pull down of ubiquitinated proteins, immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, reveal that through the increase of FBXW7/c-Myc binding, N6-isopentenyladenosine induces the ubiquitination of c-Myc, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Moreover, in - and -wild type cells, N6-isopentenyladenosine strongly synergizes with -Fluorouracil to inhibit  growth in vitro. Our results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of N6-isopentenyladenosine, revealing its multi-targeting antitumor action, in vitro and in vivo. Restoring of FBXW7 tumor-suppressor represents a valid therapeutic tool, enabling N6-isopentenyladenosine as optimizable compound for patient-personalized therapies in colorectal .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629719>Accuracy of  capsule for advanced neoplasia.</a></h1><p>Promising accuracy of  capsule endoscopy (CCE-2) has been shown for overall neoplasia. Advanced neoplasia (AN) represents the main target of colorectal  screening programs. Our aim was to assess CCE-2 diagnostic accuracy for the detection of AN in FIT+ screenees.Subjects aged 50 to 69, with a positive FIT in 4 population screening programs in Italy and Spain were enrolled. Screenees were asked to perform CCE-2, followed by traditional colonoscopy (TC). TC was performed the same day or the following morning. Bowel preparation included a split PEG-based regimen and sodium phosphate (NaP) with gastografin as boosters. CCE-2 video was read by an endoscopist blinded to the results of TC. The main outcomes were CCE-2 accuracy in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for AN when using 2 different-sized thresholds for TC referral (ie, >6 or >10 mm polyp).Two hundred twenty-two subjects were enrolled, and 178 patients completed both CCE-2 and TC examination (87.7%). Overall, 59 cases of AN were detected at TC. Overall, CCE-2 sensitivity was 90%, specificity was 66.1%, PPV was 57.4%, and NPV was 92.9% for AN when using a 6 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 52.8%) and 76.7%, 90.7%, 80.7%, 88.4% when using 10 mm cut-off (TC referral rate: 32%), respectively. CCE-2 detected that 8 out of 9 already developed CRC. Among the 41 false-positives at 6-mm cut-off, 34 (82.9%) presented with a nonadvanced adenoma at TC. Mean transit time was 4:04 hours and >70% of patients excreted CCE within  hours.In an enriched-disease setting, we showed the high sensitivity of CCE-2 for advanced neoplasia at 6 mm cut-off. The apparently low CCE-2 specificity is related to the choice of AN as the main outcome.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Various factors have been studied to identify patients at risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), including T4 tumors. The objectives were to assess the incidence of synchronous and metachronous PC, explore potential risk factors for developing PC as the only site of metastasis, and identify which patients might be candidates for prophylactic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).We conducted a retrospective analysis of 125 patients with pT4  who underwent surgery in a single center between January 2010 and December 2014.Of the 947  patients who underwent surgery, 125 (13.2%) were diagnosed with pT4a or b  carcinoma.

Demographic and clinical data were extracted from records when available. The exposure was either curative operation, palliative operation, or no operation. The primary outcome was survival at  years, assessed with Cox proportional hazard analysis after propensity-score matching for age, sex, tumor site, time period, and stage.One hundred and sixty-five patients were identified on chart review. Survival information was available for 150 patients with a median follow-up of 319 days. Fifty-two percent had  and 48% had rectal . At diagnosis, the mean age was 55.4 years (SD: 16.7) and the male to female ratio was 1.1:1. Thirty-nine percent underwent curative operations, 25% palliative operations, and 36% no operations. One-year survival was estimated to be 98% for curative surgery, 73% for palliative surgery, and 83% for no surgery (p = 0.0005). On crude analysis, -year survival improved with curative operation in comparison to no operation with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (CI: 0.14-0.64) (p = 0.002). After propensity matching, the hazard ratio for curative operation versus no operation remained significant, 0.34 (CI: 0.14-0.80) (p = 0.01).Curative surgery improves survival in our resource-limited environment. Although various factors contribute to the use of surgical treatment, the survival advantage persists after adjusted analysis. Barriers exist for access to prompt surgical evaluation and treatment.

Our study objectives were to characterize medical oncologists' perspectives toward the results of the IDEA collaboration and to evaluate how IDEA impacted prescribing patterns of adjuvant FOLFOX and CAPOX in .A list of questions developed by four medical oncologists regarding IDEA results were formulated and distributed online to gastrointestinal medical oncologists globally. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to summarize information.Of 174 responses, 145 were complete and analyzed. Responses were obtained globally from South America (53%); the U.S. and Canada (28%); Europe, Australia, and New Zealand (12%); and Asia (7%). Most clinicians (98%) were aware of the IDEA study. Prior to IDEA, clinicians preferred FOLFOX over CAPOX (81% vs. 19%). Subsequent to IDEA, 55% of clinicians preferred CAPOX over FOLFOX (odds ratio, .0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-8.;  < .01 compared with pre-IDEA). Two thirds (68%) of responders tailored duration of adjuvant therapy based on risk stratification. Most oncologists (76%) were more willing to discontinue oxaliplatin early if toxicities develop after the results of IDEA. Half of responders (50%) found that IDEA increased their confidence in decision making for adjuvant treatment; 36% were unchanged, and 15% indicated decreased confidence. Less than half (48%) were comfortable communicating the study results and the concept of a noninferiority trial with patients.IDEA appears to have shifted clinician preference from FOLFOX to CAPOX for adjuvant therapy, and most clinicians now use a risk-stratified approach in determining duration of adjuvant therapy. Patient education resources may facilitate better communication of IDEA results to patients.This global survey illustrates that most gastrointestinal medical oncologists now use a risk-stratified approach for determining the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III . Clinicians are five times more likely to choose CAPOX over FOLFOX after the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration results.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550854>[Clinical application of fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in total laparoscopic radical resection for right ].</a></h1><p> This study aims to explore the clinical value of fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (FIGFI) in total laparoscopic radical resection for right .

The selected binder clones displayed several mutations in the loop regions of the FN3 domain. One unique clone (FN3hPD-L1-01) with a 6x His-tag at the C-terminus had a protein yield of > mg/L and a protein mass of 12 kDa. In vitro binding assays on six different human  cell lines (MDA-MB-231, DLD1, U87, 293 T, Raji and Jurkat) and murine CT26  carcinoma cells stably expressing hPD-L1 showed that CT26/hPD-L1 cells had the highest expression of hPD-L1 in both basal and IFN-γ-induced states, with a binding affinity of 2.38 ± 0.26 nM for FN3hPD-L1-01. The binding ability of FN3hPD-L1-01 was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on ex vivo CT26/hPD-L1 tumors sections. The FN3hPD-L1-01 binder represents a novel, small, high-affinity binder for imaging hPD-L1 expression on tumor cells and would aid in earlier imaging of tumors. Future clinical validation studies of the labeled FN3hPD-L1 binder(s) have the potential to monitor immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy and predict responders.© The Author(s) 2019.

Flavokawain B is one of chalcones found in kava plant. In our studies, we focused on the anticancer activity of flavokawain B in colorectal  cells LoVo and its resistant to doxorubicin subline-LoVo/Dx. Strong cytotoxic activity of flavokawain B and its ability to inhibit the proliferation in both cell lines was detected. These effects accompanied with induction cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and the presence of SubG1 fraction. Flavokawain B at low concentration led to increase of caspase-3 activity. The chalcone-induced apoptosis was also confirmed by DNA fragmentation. In our work, the conversion of flavokawain B to corresponding flavanone-,7-dimetoxyflavanone-was shown to be more extensive in  than in non- cells. We found that the cyclization of the chalcone was related to the significant decrease in the cytotoxicity. Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were not impaired significantly in the studied  cells incubated with ,7-dimethoxyflavanone. We did not observe apoptosis in the cells incubated with flavanone.

The alterations of KIF22 are associated with a series of tumors; however, its possible role in the progression of  is still unclear.  This retrospective research collected 82 paired tissues with . KIF22 protein and mRNA expression levels were detected by immunohistochemistry assays and Immunoblot assays, respectively. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids were used to suppress the expression of KIF22 in HCT116 and HT29 cells, and the silencing efficiencies of shRNA plasmids targeted KIF22 were detected by quantitative PCR assays and immunoblot assays.

The liver is a common site for metastases from colorectal , and patients with hepatic metastases have generally much shorter survival, raising a need to develop and implement novel strategies for targeting metastatic disease. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a meshwork of highly crosslinked, insoluble high-molecular-mass proteins maintaining tissue integrity and establishing cell-cell interactions. Emerging evidence identifies the importance of the ECM in  cell migration, invasion, intravasation, and metastasis. Here, we isolated the ECM from MC38 mouse liver metastases using our optimized method of mild detergent solubilization followed by biochemical enrichment. The matrices were subjected to label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, revealing proteins highly abundant in the metastatic matrisome. The resulting list of proteins upregulated in the ECM significantly predicted survival in patients with colorectal  but not other cancers with strong involvement of the ECM component. One of the proteins upregulated in liver metastatic ECM, annexin A1, was not previously studied in the context of -associated matrisome. Here, we show that annexin A1 was markedly upregulated in  cell lines compared with  cells of other origin and also over-represented in human primary colorectal lesions, as well as hepatic metastases, compared with their adjacent healthy tissue counterparts. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive ECM characterization of MC38 experimental liver metastases and proposes annexin A1 as a putative target for this disease. Here, the authors provide an extensive proteomics characterization of murine colorectal  liver metastasis matrisome (the ensemble of all extracellular matrix molecules). The findings presented in this study may enable identification of therapeutic targets or biomarkers of hepatic metastases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611737>Fibroblast growth factor-10 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal .</a></h1><p>As an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) has a role in cell proliferation and differentiation in the embryo in addition to invasion and metastasis during carcinogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the FGF-10 gene expression in tumor tissues based on the pathological feature of tumor related to EMT and metastasis. 62 tumors were obtained from 62 colorectal  patients during surgery. The pathological characteristics of the patients were carefully collected and classified by Iran National Tumor Bank. To quantify FGF-10 gene expression, RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR were respectively performed. In addition, three colorectal  cell lines including LS174T, SW-948 and SW-480 were collected and cultured for further molecular analysis. Consequently, FGF-10 gene expression showed increased expression level in LS174T and SW-948 while it displayed decreased level in SW-480. Considering the tumor samples, we found an upregulation of FGF-10 gene expression in 52.1 % of all tumors in stage III and only in 9.09 % of all tumors in stage I. Also, there were an upregulation of FGF-10 gene expression in 50 % of all positive lymph invasion patients. Besides, FGF-10 gene upregulation was observed in 50 % of all tumors with a size larger than  cm (P value < 0.05) and 69 % of all tumors located in the  (P value < 0.05).

Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 83 colorectal cancers (46% males) operated in Abidjan and from 343 colorectal cancers (53% males) from Brussels.Colorectal  was occuring at a younger age in Côte d'Ivoire compared to Belgium (median age: 53 versus 66). MMR deficiency was detected in 11,7% of Belgian cases and in 13,3% of Ivorian cases. Whereas MMR deficient cancers in Brussels were mainly found in women (24/40 i.e. 60%), in Abidjan only 3/11 (27%) were female. Moreover, the predominant location of MMR deficient tumours was different between both series: in Brussels, mainly located in the right  (24/40 i.e. 60%) whereas in Abidjan predominantly (10/11 i.e. 91%) in the left . In Brussels we observed in the majority of cases (67,%) loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2, in Abidjan loss of expression of MSH2 and MSH6 (54,%).Our pilot study reveals differences in presentation of MMR deficient colorectal  between the two geographic regions suggesting differences in epidemiology and biology of colorectal  in native Africans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Cross-linked CS-Qu nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by ionotropic gelation method. Physicochemical characterization of NPs was performed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), in vitro drug release, and drug loading efficiency (LE). 1, 2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) were applied to induce adenocarcinoma tumors on inbred male Wistar rats' .

Differences in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle, invasion, and migration were measured between groups using MTT, flow cytometry, transwell and wound-healing assays, respectively. Western blotting was used to analyze relative protein expression levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), P21, and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and -9 between groups. Compared with the NC group, GA (low, middle and high) inhibited SW620 cell proliferation, invasion and migration (all P<0.05). Furthermore, there were significant differences in proliferation, invasion and migration between groups administered with different doses of GA (all P<0.05).

As LCI does not decrease luminal brightness, it may improve the detection of . However, the extent to which LCI improves the visibility of  polyps has not yet been determined. Between December 2016 and May 2017, patients who received total colonoscopy were consecutively recruited into this retrospective, single-center study. For each polyp identified, images obtained from white light (WL) imaging, blue laser imaging (BLI), and LCI of the same lesion and its surrounding mucosa were evaluated. The color differences (ΔE) between each lesion and its surrounding mucosa in non-magnified images were computed quantitatively using the CIELAB color space, which defines color perception according to colorimetric values, and compared among WL, BLI, LCI, and chromoendoscopy. The ΔE between the vessel and non-vessel areas in magnified images was also assessed. Of the 64 patients who were incorporated into this study, non-magnified and magnified (×80) images from 113 and 95 polyps, respectively, were assessed. The ΔE was intensified by LCI and chromoendoscopy compared with WL and BLI. The ΔE of neoplastic lesions was also intensified by LCI. In magnified images, BLI and LCI significantly increased the ΔE between the vessel and non-vessel areas compared with WL. Luminal brightness, indicated by L*, was not impaired by LCI; however, was reduced by BLI compared with WL and LCI. These results suggest that LCI enhanced the detection of  without impairing luminal brightness. We propose the routine use of LCI for  polyp detection and BLI for magnifying observations of  polyps detected by LCI.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616981>Interobserver, intraobserver, and interlaboratory variability in reporting pT4a .</a></h1><p>Clinical significance of the pT4 category in  is increasing with several therapeutic implications. The aim of this study was to evaluate variability in diagnosing pT4a . Twelve pathologists classified 66 preselected scanned Hematoxylin/Eosin-stained slides with tumor cells at a distance of 25-1500 μm (n = 22), 0-25 μm (n = 22), or on (n = 22) the peritoneal surface. Inter- and intraobserver variability were calculated using Kappa statistics. For interlaboratory variability, pathology reports of pT3 and pT4a  were extracted from the Dutch Pathology Registry between 2012 and 2015. The proportion of pT4a (pT4a/(pT3+pT4a)) was compared between 33 laboratories. Potential risk of understaging was assessed by determining the average number of blocks taken from pT3 and pT4a N0-2M0 tumors with metachronous peritoneal metastasis. Interobserver variability among 12 pathologists was 0.50 (95%CI 0.41-0.60; moderate agreement). Intraobserver variability (8 pathologists) was 0.71 (substantial agreement). A total of 7745 reports with pT3 or pT4aN0-2M0  from 33 laboratories were included for interlaboratory analysis. Median percentage of pT4a was 15.% (range 3.2-24.6%). After adjustment for case mix, 8 labs diagnosed pT4a significantly less or more frequently than the median lab. Metachronous peritoneal metastases were histologically verified in 170 of 6629 pT3 and in 129 of 1116 pT4a tumors, with a mean number of blocks of 4.03(SD 1.51) and 4.78 (SD 1.76) taken from the primary tumors, respectively (p < 0.001).

Its longstanding use in China to treat gastrointestinal tract and rheumatologic disorders is generally regarded as safe, supporting initial investigations in an at-risk population, such as individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the safety of berberine in this population is not established. Individuals living in China with biopsy-proven UC, ≤ grade 2 dysplasia, and with a UC disease activity index (UCDAI) score ≤ 1 on mesalamine, were randomized 3:1 in a double-blind phase I trial to berberine 900 mg/day or placebo for 3 months, with the primary objective of assessing safety. Blood samples and biopsies of the colorectum, from prespecified locations, were collected prior to and following therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in UCDAI score, and in tissue and plasma markers of inflammation. Of toxicities at least possibly related, one episode of grade 3 elevation in transaminases and one episode of grade 1 nausea were observed among 12 individuals on berberine, and none were observed among 4 on placebo. The mean plasma berberine concentration was 3. nM after berberine treatment, significantly higher than 0. nM with placebo. Berberine significantly decreased the Geboes grade in  tissue, but had a nonsignificant effect on other tissue or blood biomarkers related to cell growth and inflammation.

These results were then validated in a cohort of patients with similar inclusion criteria selected from the National  Database (NCDB) between 2006 and 2014.Three hundred and seventy patients met the inclusion criteria in the trial cohort; 48% were LN-negative. Of 153,945 patients in the NCDB, 57% were LN-negative. The probability of TNN when 12 LNs were examined was 68% for right and 64% for left CC in the trial cohort and 77% and 72% in the NCDB. The number of LNs needed to achieve any given probability of TNN was significantly different between right and left CC in both the trial (P<0.001) and the NCDB (P<0.001).In both a prospective multicenter trial and the NCDB, sidedness influences the number of LNs needed to predict nodal negativity in CC. Current guidelines regarding the minimum number of LNs needed to accurately stage patients with T3N0 CC may need to be re-evaluated by taking into consideration the tumor sidedness.2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

The fluctuations may induce variations in anticancer drugs sensitivity to  cells. We aimed to clarify the variations in sensitivity of SN-38 to  patients with ESKD and investigate this mechanism, by human  cells exposed to uremic serum residue. LS180 cells were exposed to normal or uremic serum residue (LS/NSR or LS/USR cells) for a month. IC values of SN-38 in LS/NSR or LS/USR cells were calculated from viability of each cells treated SN-38. mRNA expression and intracellular SN-38 accumulation was evaluated by RT-PCR and HPLC-fluorescence methods, respectively. The IC value in LS/USR cells was higher than that in LS/NSR cells. Organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 2B1 mRNA expression was lower in LS/USR cells than in LS/NSR cells, and SN-38 accumulation in LS/USR cells was lower than that in LS/NSR cells. Only co-treatment baicalin, which is OATP2B1 inhibitor, almost negated the difference in SN-38 accumulation between LS/NSR and LS/USR. Anticancer effects of substrates of OATP2B1, such as SN-38, were reduced in ESKD patients at the same plasma substrate concentration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617095> splenic flexure carcinoma: is laparoscopic segmental resection a safe enough oncological approach?</a></h1><p>The surgical approach to the  splenic flexure  (SFC) is yet to be technically standardized. The aim of this study has been to retrospectively evaluate the oncologic long-term results of our cases comparing our data with other authors' experiences.Clinical data of patients with SFC operated on at our institute were retrospectively analyzed. The laparoscopic approach was used in the whole series, with limited resection distally and proximally to splenic flexure and the origin ligation of left colic artery and left branch of middle colic artery. Data on the oncological long-term safety were compared to our laparoscopic series of extended right colectomy for proximal two-third transverse  and high anterior resections for sigmoid-high rectal  and to the main evidences in the literature, found after a comprehensive review.From March 2008 to May 2018, we completed 53 laparoscopic splenic flexure resections (26 female and 27 male, age 71. ± 15.4 years). The conversion rate was 3.8%. Most of the cases were stage II (pT3 73.%, the mean number of lymph nodes harvested was 19.1, with positivity for malignancy in 45.3%). During the FU (43. months), 2 patients dropped out. Out of the 51 residual cases, 37 were alive (72.%) and 14 are deceased (27.%).Compared to the literature, our survival rate does not show significant differences. The other oncological outcomes seem to be comparable with the data evaluated.More extended resections seem not to confer an increase of the overall survival rate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596902>Sugar-sweetened beverages and colorectal  risk in the California Teachers Study.</a></h1><p>The association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and colorectal  (CRC) risk remains unclear and published data are limited.The analytic cohort included 99,798 women, free of  at baseline, from the California Teachers Study, a longitudinal cohort comprised of 133,477 female teachers and administrators who were active or recently retired members of the California State Teachers Retirement System in 1995. SSB consumption constituted caloric soft drinks, sweetened bottled waters and teas, and fruit drinks, derived from a self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Consumption was divided into four categories: Rare or never, >rare/never to <1 serving/week, ≥1 serving/week to <1 serving/day, and ≥1 serving/day. CRC endpoints were based on annual linkage with California  Registry, defined as first diagnosis of CRC, and classified following the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program coding system. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for assessing the association between SSB consumption and incident CRC.A total of 1,318 incident CRC cases were identified over 20 years of follow-up (54.% proximal  and 45.% distal colorectum). Compared with rare/never consumers, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1.14 (0.86, 1.53) for total CRC; 1.11 (0.73, 1.68) for proximal ; and 1.22 (0.80, 1.86) for distal colorectum cancers among women consuming ≥ 1 serving/day of SSBs.SSBs were not significantly associated with CRC risk. The biological effects of high SSB consumption make it important to continue to evaluate whether SSBs are associated with CRC.

This study aimed to determine the survival effect of TB and TSR in elderly stage I CC patients.We evaluated these parameters in eighty-eight stage I CC patients who underwent surgical treatment alone between 1998 and 2015. The relationship between these parameters and age was investigated. Model A was used for methodology.In elderly patients (≥68), these parameters obtained more successful results for following analysis: relationship between prognostic factors [lymphatic invasion (BD, p = 0.003; TSR, p = 0.003), perineural invasion (BD, p = 0.016; TSR, p = 0.004), tumour deposites (BD, p = 0.005; TSR, p = 0.033), MSI (BD, p=0.031; TSR, p=0.012), etc.], correlation of estimates (BD, r=0.724; TSR, r=0.703), and reproducibility of study (BD [Kappa (ĸ)]=0.53-0.75; TSR (ĸ) =0.56-0.71). Also, the cut-off values were useful for BD (area of under ROC (AUC)=0.816 [0.707-0.925]) and TSR (AUC=0.810 [0.697-0.924]). In univariate analysis, in elderly patients, these parameters had a poor -year survival for RFS (p<0.001[BD], p=0.001[TSR]), OS (p<0.001[BD], p=0.005[TSR]), and LR (p=0.008[BD], p=0.034[TSR]). Multivariate analysis confirmed that these parameters are independent worse predictors for RFS (BD: 1.42[HR], p=0.002; TSR: 1.50[HR], p=0.001), OS (BD: 1.38[HR], p=0.014; TSR: 1.42[HR], p=0.005), and LR (BD: 1.61[HR], p=0.034) in elderly patients.Our results confirm that BD and TSR are reliable indexes for poor survival in elderly stage I CC patients.

However, its significance in the elderly population is uncertain. The study aimed to determine whether surveillance colonoscopy should be discontinued in the elderly population.We enrolled 105 patients who underwent baseline colonoscopy between January 2004 and December 2009 and were subsequently followed-up over  years in our institution. All had diminutive colorectal polyps and were aged <80 years at baseline colonoscopy and ≥80 years at follow-up in May 2018. Patients who had undergone colectomy or who had inflammatory bowel disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome, and no diminutive polyps were excluded. The cumulative incidence of the target lesion was evaluated. Histopathological diagnoses included low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and carcinoma.The target lesion was detected in 15% (16/105) of the patients. There was no invasive carcinoma; however, two HGDs were detected. There were three lesions that had increased from previously detected diminutive lesions, all of which were LGDs. There were no target lesions detected after 84 years of age, and the cumulative incidence was 0.20. The cumulative incidence was significantly higher in the group with HGD than in the group with no target lesions at baseline colonoscopy. There was no HGD after age 79 years, and the cumulative incidence was 0.019.Surveillance colonoscopy for patients with diminutive polyps may be discontinued after age 79 years.Copyright © 2019 by The Japan Society of Coloproctology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607696>Management of  at a tertiary referral center in India - Patterns of presentation, treatment, and survival outcomes.</a></h1><p>To define the patterns of disease presentation, treatment strategies, and outcomes for patients with  at a tertiary referral center in India over 1 year period.This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database.

These include directional motility (including galvanotaxis), pH balance, extracellular proteolysis, and invasion. Contrary to the substantial in vitro data, however, evidence for VGSC involvement in the  process in vivo is limited. Here, we critically assess, for the first time, the available in vivo evidence, hierarchically from mRNA level to emerging clinical aspects, including protein-level studies, electrolyte content, animal tests, and clinical imaging. The evidence strongly suggests that different VGSC subtypes (mainly Nav1. and Nav1.7) are expressed de novo in human carcinoma tissues and generally parallel the situation in vitro. Consistent with this, tissue electrolyte (sodium) levels, quantified by clinical imaging, are significantly higher in  vs. matched non- tissues. These are early events in the acquisition of metastatic potential by the  cells. Taken together, the multi-faceted evidence suggests that the VGSC expression has clinical (diagnostic and therapeutic) potential as a prognostic marker, as well as an anti-metastatic target. The distinct advantages offered by the VGSC include especially (1) its embryonic nature, demonstrated most clearly for the predominant neonatal Nav1. expression in breast and , and (2) the specifically druggable persistent current that VGSCs develop under hypoxic conditions, as in growing tumours, which promotes invasiveness and metastasis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31563625>Colorectal  Incidence and Mortality After Removal of Adenomas During Screening Colonoscopies.</a></h1><p>Recommendation of surveillance colonoscopy should be based on risk of colorectal  and death after adenoma removal. We aimed to develop risk classification system based on colorectal  incidence and mortality following adenoma removal.We performed a multicenter population-based cohort study of 236,089 individuals (median patient age, 56 years; 37.8% male) undergoing screening colonoscopies with adequate bowel cleansing and cecum intubation at 132 centers in the Polish National Colorectal  Screening Program, from 2000 through 2011. Subjects were followed for a median 7.1 years and information was collected on colorectal  development and death. We used recursive partitioning and multivariable Cox models to identify associations between colorectal  risk and patient and adenoma characteristics (diameter, growth pattern, grade of dysplasia and number of adenomas). We developed a risk classification system based on standardized incidence ratios, using data from the Polish population for comparison. The primary endpoints were colorectal  incidence and colorectal  death.We identified 130 colorectal cancers in individuals who had adenomas removed at screening (46. per 100,000 person-years) vs 309 in individuals without adenomas (22.2 per 100,000 person-years). Compared with individuals without adenomas, adenomas ≥20 mm in diameter and high-grade dysplasia were associated with increased risk of colorectal  (adjusted hazard ratios, 9.25; 95% CI, 6.39-13.39 and 3.58; 95% CI, 1.96-6.54, respectively). Compared with the general population, colorectal  risk was higher or comparable only for individuals with adenomas ≥20 mm in diameter (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.40-2.93) or with high-grade dysplasia (SIR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.39-1.41), whereas for individuals with other adenoma characteristics the risk was lower (SIR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28-0.44). We developed a high-risk classification based on adenoma size ≥20 mm or high-grade dysplasia (instead of the current high-risk classification cutoff of ≥3 adenomas or any adenoma with villous growth pattern, high-grade dysplasia, or ≥10 mm in diameter). Our classification system would reduce the number of individuals classified as high-risk and requiring intensive surveillance from 15,242 (36.%) to 3980 (9.%), without increasing risk of colorectal  in patients with adenomas (risk difference per 100,000 person-years, .6; 95% CI, -10.7 to 22.0).Using data from the Polish National Colorectal  Screening Program, we developed a risk classification system that would reduce the number of individuals classified as high risk and require intensive surveillance more than 3-fold, without increasing risk of colorectal  in patients with adenomas. This system could optimize the use of surveillance colonoscopy.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite positive evidence for this therapy, IDDS remains underutilized to treat  pain. Real-world registry data augment existing safety and effectiveness data and are presented here to broaden awareness of this therapeutic option, needed for adequate -related pain treatment, and as a viable tool addressing concerns with systemic opioid use.This prospective, long-term, multicenter (United States, Western Europe, and Latin America) registry started in 2003 to monitor the performance of SynchroMed Infusion Systems. Patient-reported outcomes were added in 2013. Before data acquisition, all sites obtained Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approval and written patient consent. The study was registered ( at clinicaltrials.gov) before patients were enrolled. Patients who provided informed consent were enrolled in the registry at initial IDDS implant or replacement.Through July 2017, 1403 patients with  pain were enrolled and implanted. The average (minimum/maximum) age of patients was 59 years (13/93 years), with 56.6% female. The most frequent  types were lung, breast, /rectal, pancreatic, and prostate. The majority of patients whose registry follow-up ended (87%; 1141/1311) were followed through death, with 4.3% (n = 57) exiting due to device explant or therapy discontinuation; the remaining 113 (8.6%) discontinued for reasons such as transfer of care, lost to follow-up, and site closure. Pain scores within the cohort of patients providing baseline and follow-up data improved significantly at 6 (P = .0007; n = 103) and 12 (P = .0026; n = 55) months compared to baseline, with EuroQol with  dimensions (EuroQol-5D) scores showing significant improvement at 6 months (P = .0016; n = 41).

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal  (CRC) by regulating the gut microbiota and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate,  length, inflammatory cytokines, gut microbiota, and  epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated  damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and . Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health.

We estimated net survival by stage up to  years after diagnosis, controlling for background mortality with life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population by single year of age, sex, and calendar period. Survival estimates were age-standardised using the International  Survival Standard (ICSS) weights.Only 14.2% of patients were diagnosed at a localised stage and 38.9% at the regional stage. The proportion of patients with known stage was 88.9% during 2000-2004 but fell to 59.4% during 2010-2013. During 2005-2009, 1- and -year survival for , rectal, breast, cervical, and prostate  was about 90% or higher for patients diagnosed at the localised stage. During 2004-2009, the proportion of patients diagnosed at a localised stage was lower in Kuwait than in the US for , breast, and lung . Age-standardised -year net survival for all stages combined was lower in Kuwait than the US for , lung, and breast , but stage-specific survival was similar.Since stage-specific survival is similar in Kuwait and the US, late stage at diagnosis is likely to be a major contributing factor to the overall lower survival in Kuwait than in the US. Increasing public awareness of  risk factors and symptoms and investment in early detection will be vital to reduce the proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage and to improve survival.Copyright © 2019 E.

Faced with the dilemma of whether major resection is required or whether polypectomy has been sufficient treatment, the clinician relies on high- and low-risk histologic parameters to guide decision-making.The purpose of this study was to review current practice and evaluate multidisciplinary team decision-making across a United Kingdom Regional  Network to establish the efficacy of previously set guidance from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (2013).This was a retrospective cohort study.The study was conducted at a United Kingdom Regional  Network composed of 4 separate National Health Service Hospital Trusts, covering an overall population of 1. million.All patients with malignant colorectal polyps who presented to the colorectal multidisciplinary team over a 3-year period (January 4, 2012 to January 4, 2015) were included.Rate of residual disease after major resection, recurrence of  after polypectomy and surveillance alone, reporting of histologic features, adherence to endoscopic surveillance guidelines, and outcomes of surveillance cross-sectional imaging were measured.A total of173 patients (median age = 69 y) with a malignant colorectal polyp were identified during the study period, with a median of 2.7 years of follow-up. Thirty-seven patients (21.4%) underwent primary surgical resection with a residual disease rate of 43% (16/37). The remaining 136 patients (76.8%) were managed conservatively with recurrence in 6 cases (4.4%). Endoscopic follow-up at 3 months occurred in 61% of cases. Histologic reporting was varied, with tumor differentiation and resection margin being reported in 84% of cases and lymphovascular invasion and depth of invasion in 71% and 59% of cases.This was an observational retrospective study.The residual disease rate in patients treated surgically was higher than previously reported (43.2%). Incidence of recurrence in patients treated conservatively was low (4.4%). Areas of improvements have been identified in adherence to endoscopic follow-up, histopathologic reporting, and potential overuse of radiologic surveillance.

Immunoassay has been a powerful tool for this purpose, in which antibodies or their mimics particularly molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are used for specific recognition. Epitope and glycan are two structure features of a glycoprotein. However, immunoassays based on simultaneous recognition towards the two characteristics have been scarcely explored so far. Herein we present a new strategy called orthogonal dual molecularly imprinted polymer-based plasmonic immunosandwich assay (odMIP-PISA). It relies on double recognition towards a target glycoprotein by two different types of MIPs, using epitope-imprinted gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-coated slide as capturing substrate to recognize the peptide epitope and glycans-imprinted Raman-active silver nanoparticles as labeling nanotags to recognize the glycans. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a routinely used marker for , was used as a test glycoprotein. The orthogonal double recognition apparently improved the specificity, reducing the maximum cross-reactivity from 14.4% for epitope recognition and 15.2% for glycan recognition to 8.2% for double recognition. Meanwhile, the plasmonic nanostructure-based Raman detection provided ultrahigh sensitivity, yielding a limit of detection of .56 × 10 M (S/N = 10). Through measuring the CEA level in human serum, this method permitted differentiation of  patient from healthy individual. Compared with the traditional immunoassay, odMIP-PISA exhibited multiple advantages, including simplified procedure (6 steps), speed (30 min), reduced cost, and so on. Therefore, this new approach holds great promise in many applications particularly clinical diagnosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, a subset of CRC patients who have defective mismatch repair (dMMR) pathway show resistance to -FU. Here, we demonstrate that the efficacy of -FU in dMMR CRC cells is largely dependent on the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. Downregulation of APE1, a key enzyme in BER pathway, decreases IC50 of -FU in dMMR CRC cells by 10-fold. Furthermore, we discover that Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex facilitates -FU repair in DNA via promoting the recruitment and acetylation of APE1 (AcAPE1) to damage sites in chromatin. Downregulation of FACT affects -FU damage repair in DNA and sensitizes dMMR CRC cells to -FU. Targeting FACT complex with curaxins, a class of small molecules, significantly improves -FU efficacy in dMMR CRC in vitro (~50-fold decrease in IC50) and in vivo xenograft models. We show that primary tumor tissues of CRC patients have higher FACT and AcAPE1 levels compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Additionally, there is a strong clinical correlation of FACT and AcAPE1 levels with CRC patients' response to chemotherapy. Together, our study demonstrates that targeting FACT with curaxins is a promising strategy to overcome -FU resistance in dMMR CRC patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for  Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545230>FAM83H-AS1 is upregulated and predicts poor prognosis in .</a></h1><p>Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been proven to participate in many principal pathways during  mucosa tumourigenesis. FAM83H-AS1 has been identified as one of the LncRNAs that is dysregulated in multi-type cancers. Here, our purpose was to determine the expression pattern and clinical significance of FAM83H-AS1 and further analyse its prognostic value in . FAM83H-AS1 expression was examined in 90 patients with  by RNAscope in situhybridization, and the expression levels were analysed with the overall survival (OS) rates for patients with . TCGA datasets derived from  (COAD) were used to further validate the main findings. We demonstrated that the expression of FAM83H-AS1 was significantly higher in  tissues than in paired normal mucosa from  patients (P < 0.001). The prognostic analysis indicated that the OS rates for  patients with high levels of FAM83H-AS1 were significantly lower than those for patients with low levels of FAM83H-AS1 (P = 0.013). The higher levels of FAM83H-AS1 were found to be associated with a lower expression of SMAD1//9, which is involved in TGF-β signalling in  tissues (P = 0.0174). In HCT116 and SW480 cell lines, the down regulation of FAM83H-AS1 promoted the expression of SMAD1. Our investigations suggest that the upregulation of FAM83H-AS1 serves as a promising predictor and might be conducive for clinicians to estimate OS time.

Effective screening, surveillance, and prevention can decrease its incidence, mortality and burden. This meta-analysis aims to provide a pooled estimation of -year survival rate for colorectal  based on topography codes and treatment in Iranian population. A systematic search for literature was done in international and national databases up to July 2018. Twenty-seven studies from 4929 articles met the eligible criteria. The overall pooled -year survival rate of colorectal , , rectal and sigmoid were estimated 56% (95% CI: 49, 63), 53% (95% CI: 41, 65), 52% (95% CI: 41, 62), and 38% (95% CI: 22, 55), respectively. In addition, -year survival rate of colorectal  after surgery was estimated: 64% (95%CI: 50, 78). Subgroup analysis by type of data source showed significantly higher rate of survival in oncology center (29%) than hospital-based (P = 0.005). As a conclusion, low survival rate of colorectal  in Iran necessitates effective screening and surveillance strategies to find precancerous polyps and detect early-stage cases with lower stage risk of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612065>Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 promotes proliferation and metastasis in human .</a></h1><p> is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world; however, the mechanism underlying the progression of  remains unclear. In the present study, the expression of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) in paraffin sections of human  tissues and normal  tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry. The human  cell lines HCT116 and HT29 were used for USP22 knockdown experiments, and functional assays were performed. The results demonstrated that compared with normal  tissues, human  tissues exhibited upregulated expression of USP22 and this was associated with tumor lymph node metastasis and tumor stage in  tissues. In addition, upregulated expression of USP22 was significantly correlated with both lower relapse-free survival and lower overall survival rates in patients with . When USP22 was silenced in  cell lines, this resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation and metastatic behaviors. Furthermore, Bmi-1 and Cyclin D2 were found to be positively regulated by USP22, which may have mediated the tumorigenic effects of USP22 in human . The results of the present study may have significant implications for examining the underlying mechanisms of  development and the potential development of  therapeutics.Copyright: © Yuan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621322>Structurally Modified Cyclopenta[]benzofuran Analogues Isolated from .</a></h1><p>Four new cyclopenta[]benzofuran derivatives based on an unprecedented carbon skeleton (-), with a dihydrofuran ring fused to dioxanyl and aryl rings, along with a new structural analogue () of ‴-episilvestrol (episilvestrol, ), were isolated from an aqueous extract of a large-scale re-collection of the roots of  collected in Vietnam.

We have designed and synthesized a series of dual agents as both Eg5 inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, bearing a 4-aryldihydropyrimidine core. Compound  (aryl: 3-nitrophenyl) was selected as potential dual agent due to displaying both activities: it is a vasorelaxant agent (>90% relaxation at 10 M in KCl-precontracted aorta rings), it decreases the response to calcium and it is cytotoxic to MCF-7 (breast), HCT-116 () and A-549 (lung)  cell lines. The dual mechanism of action was confirmed by blocking (-)-BAY K8644-induced vascular contraction and production of monopolar spindles, typical of Eg5 inhibition.

Hypomagnesemia is a comparatively frequent adverse event of this drug, which is likely overlooked because it occurs later in treatment without symptoms. Furthermore, hypomagnesemia and hypomagnesemia-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation may lead to loss of consciousness (LOC), the onset of which is not generally considered associated with the treatment of anti-EGFR antibody because of its rare occurrence. Here, we present a colorectal  patient treated with anti-EGFR antibody, who suffered LOC during treatment while severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation was not observed.A 69-year-old man with metastatic  was treated with cetuximab (anti-EGFR antibody) plus irinotecan as third-line chemotherapy. His serum magnesium level gradually decreased, and grade 2 hypomagnesemia (a serum magnesium level of 0.9 mg/dL) was observed at the 12th administration of cetuximab. In light of this development, intravenous supplementation of 20 mEq magnesium sulfate began with careful blood monitoring despite the lack of clinical symptoms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed prolonged QT or corrected QT (QTc) intervals (grade 1). His serum magnesium level remained at 0.9 mg/dL, and no hypomagnesemia symptoms were observed by the 17th administration of cetuximab. After the treatment, however, he suddenly lost consciousness without symptoms related to infusion or allergic reactions. Circulatory collapse following dermatological reactions and respiratory events were not evident. Intravenous supplementation of magnesium sulfate was administered again. He awakened 2 min after the onset of temporary LOC without any other symptoms related to hypomagnesemia, such as lethargy, tremor, tetany, and seizures. No other etiology outside of the low level of serum magnesium was confirmed in further examinations. Cetuximab was discontinued, and his serum magnesium level returned to a level within the normal range after 6 weeks. Because of tumor progression, regorafenib and TAS-102 (trifluridine tipiracil hydrochloride) were introduced sequentially for 6 months. Five months after the final treatment of TAS-102, he died of his primary disease, which reflected a survival period of 4 years and 6 months since the beginning of treatment.This case report reminds clinicians that LOC can be induced without severe hypomagnesemia or QTc prolongation, during anti-EGFR antibody treatment for metastatic colorectal  even while under carefully monitored magnesium supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636470>Role of ion channels in gastrointestinal .</a></h1><p>In their seminal papers Hanahan and Weinberg described oncogenic processes a normal cell undergoes to be transformed into a  cell. The functions of ion channels in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract influence a variety of cellular processes, many of which overlap with these hallmarks of . In this review we focus on the roles of the calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl) and zinc (Zn) transporters in GI , with a special emphasis on the roles of the KCNQ1 K channel and CFTR Cl channel in colorectal  (CRC). Ca is a ubiquitous second messenger, serving as a signaling molecule for a variety of cellular processes such as control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration. Various members of the TRP superfamily, including TRPM8, TRPM7, TRPM6 and TRPM2, have been implicated in GI cancers, especially through overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and down-regulation in . Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are classically associated with the initiation and conduction of action potentials in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells. The VGSC Na1. is abundantly expressed in human colorectal CRC cell lines as well as being highly expressed in primary CRC samples. Studies have demonstrated that conductance through Na1. contributes significantly to CRC cell invasiveness and  progression. Zn transporters of the ZIP/SLC39A and ZnT/SLC30A families are dysregulated in all major GI organ cancers, in particular, ZIP4 up-regulation in pancreatic  (PC). More than 70 K channel genes, clustered in four families, are found expressed in the GI tract, where they regulate a range of cellular processes, including gastrin secretion in the stomach and anion secretion and fluid balance in the intestinal tract. Several distinct types of K channels are found dysregulated in the GI tract. Notable are hERG1 upregulation in PC, gastric  (GC) and CRC, leading to enhanced  angiogenesis and invasion, and KCNQ1 down-regulation in CRC, where KCNQ1 expression is associated with enhanced disease-free survival in stage II, III, and IV disease. Cl channels are critical for a range of cellular and tissue processes in the GI tract, especially fluid balance in the . Most notable is CFTR, whose deficiency leads to mucus blockage, microbial dysbiosis and inflammation in the intestinal tract. CFTR is a tumor suppressor in several GI cancers. Cystic fibrosis patients are at a significant risk for CRC and low levels of CFTR expression are associated with poor overall disease-free survival in sporadic CRC. Two other classes of chloride channels that are dysregulated in GI cancers are the chloride intracellular channels (CLIC1, 3 & 4) and the chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCA1,2,4). CLIC1 & 4 are upregulated in PC, GC, gallbladder , and CRC, while the CLCA proteins have been reported to be down-regulated in CRC. In summary, it is clear, from the diverse influences of ion channels, that their aberrant expression and/or activity can contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression. Further, because ion channels are often localized to the plasma membrane and subject to multiple layers of regulation, they represent promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention including the repurposing of current drugs.©The Author(s) 2019.

A previous study focused on its antioxidant mechanism, whereas in this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of a series of 28 analogues and the mechanism of apoptosis of the most cytotoxic compound against wild-type (HCT-116) and p53 mutant (HT-29) colorectal  cell lines. The series of analogues comprise of different families, namely hydrazone, oxadiazole, thiosemicarbazides and triazoles. In the initial cytotoxicity screening, N-(3,4,-trimethoxybenzylidene)-4-(3,4,-trimethoxybenzyloxy) benzohydrazide, henceforth known as, P5H, was found to be most cytotoxic against human colorectal  cell lines (IC for HCT-116 = 11.79 μM and HT-29 = 18.52 μM). Additionally, P5H was found to have some degree of selectivity towards  cells compared to normal human  cells (CCD-112 CoN). Subsequent investigation had brought insight on P5H ability to induce apoptosis in both HCT-116 and HT-29 cell lines. Cell cycle analysis showed both cell lines were arrested at the G2/M phase upon treatment. Our study concluded that P5H induced the death receptor, DR5 in HCT-116 and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway in HT-29.

Median follow-up time was .9 years. The risk of developing colorectal adenocarcinoma was 18.% for patients with anal Paget's disease. Eighty percent of colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnoses were synchronous (within 2 mo) to anal Paget's diagnoses, whereas metachronous tumors occurred at a median time of 2.4 years. Of patients with anal Paget's disease, 8.3% developed an anal adenocarcinoma or nonsmall cell . In male patients with genital Paget's, the risk of proximal genitourinary malignancy was 9.7%, scrotal or testicular adenocarcinoma was 0.4%, and penile or scrotal squamous carcinoma was 1.7%. In female patients with genital Paget's, the risk of proximal genitourinary malignancy was 3.0%, vaginal or vulvar adenocarcinoma was 1.4%, and vaginal or vulvar squamous neoplasm was 1.0%. Five-year overall survival was 59.7%, 73.%, and 80.7% in patients with anal, male genital, and female genital Paget's (p < 0.001).The registry did not record surveillance schedule, provider specialty, or nonprocedural therapies for extramammary Paget's disease.In the largest published cohort of patients with extramammary Paget's disease, patients with anal Paget's had a much higher risk of both proximal and local  as compared with patients with genital Paget's.

Understanding Serrated Polyposis Syndrome.</a></h1><p>To present the current understanding of the diagnosis, management, and potential genetic causes of serrated polyposis syndrome.The clinical criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome was recently updated and now includes individuals with five or more serrated polyps proximal to the rectum that are  mm in size or greater and at least two that are 10 mm in size of greater as well as individuals with 20 or more serrated polyps throughout the  with at least five proximal to the rectum. There is a significant risk for  in first-degree relatives of individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome. However, less than 3% of serrated polyposis syndrome cases are explained by identifiable germline mutations, with mutations in RNF43 being the only currently validated genetic cause. Serrated polyposis syndrome is rarely explained by identifiable germline mutations, but there remains an increased risk for colorectal  in first-degree relatives. Referral for genetic counseling and testing is recommended for individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome and a personal history of coexisting adenomatous polyposis or with a concerning family history and can be considered for all individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome. Close endoscopic surveillance of those with serrated polyposis syndrome and their first-degree relatives is recommended. Continued efforts at identifying hereditary causes of serrated polyposis are needed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666482>Consumption of Low-Dose of Ethanol Suppresses  Tumorigenesis in 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine-Treated Rats.</a></h1><p>The effect of low-dose of ethanol consumption on the development of  is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose ethanol (0.%, 1%, and 2% [v/v] ethanol in drinking water) for 28 wk on  tumor incidence in rats injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Body weight, fluid and food consumption, and the total numbers of  adenomas (mild-, moderate-, and severe-grade dysplasia) per rat were unaffected by ethanol consumption. However, the numbers of severe-grade dysplasia were significantly reduced by 1% ethanol compared with the control (0% ethanol; -93%) but not by 0.% and 2% ethanol. Although the numbers of total adenocarcinomas were unaffected, those of total of adenomas and adenocarcinomas together were significantly reduced by 0.% and 1% ethanol (-39% and -41%, respectively). Intriguingly, real-time PCR assay indicated the abundance of cecal Clostridium leptum (a putative immunosuppressor) was the least in rats received 1% ethanol. Furthermore, 1% ethanol markedly increased  mRNA of IL-6, a putative suppressor of regulatory T-cells and cytoprotector. This study provides the first evidence for the potential of 1% ethanol, but not 2% ethanol, to prevent  tumorigenesis in rats, supporting the J-curve hypothesis of the effect of low-dose alcohol on health. Further, the modulation of C. leptum and expression of IL-6, potentially linking to carcinogenesis, by 1% ethanol may provide an insight into the underlying mechanisms of the anti- tumor effect.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572473>Introduction of complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation as standardized surgical treatment for  in Greece. Results of a pilot study and bi-institutional cooperation.</a></h1><p>Complete mesocolic excision (CME) is generally accepted as state of the art in  surgery. However, the long-term impact of CME has not been systematically examined. Therefore cohort studies might be a possible way to clarify any differences between conventional resections and CME. Following bilateral cooperation between the Department of Surgery/University Hospital of Erlangen and the 1 Surgical Department of the General Hospital of Nikaia/Piraeus, including teaching activities for introduction of CME, a cohort study was performed, considering surgical quality criteria and clinical outcome.All patients with  carcinomas (CME group,  = 31) referred to the 1 Surgical Department of General Hospital, Nikaia/Piraeus, Greece for surgery from January 2012 to December 2013 were prospectively analyzed and compared with patients who underwent conventional surgery for  between January 2008 and December 2011 (non-CME group,  = 35). Patients' follow-up was at least 48 months.There were significantly better results in terms of lymph node yield (CME group: 29.6 vs. non-CME group: 17.85;  < 0.001) and lymph node ratio (LNR) (CME group: 0.12 vs. non-CME group: 0.24;  < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival in favor of the CME group (CME group:  = 0 vs. non-CME group:  = ) without any increase in surgical morbidity (CME group:  = 6 vs. non-CME group:  = 11;  = 0.10).Complete mesocolic excision appears to offer a superior oncological result without any increase of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, CME represents a surgical technique which can be established in a surgical department after previous teaching without increasing the postoperative complication rate.Copyright: © 2018 Termedia & Banach.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587439>Adjuvant therapy with γ-tocopherol-induce apoptosis in HT-29  via cyclin-dependent cell cycle arrest mechanism.</a></h1><p>Resistance to chemotherapy with -fluorouracil (-FU) in patients with colorectal  (CRC) is the major obstacle to reach the maximum efficiency of CRC treatment. Combination therapy has emerged as a novel anticancer strategy. The present study evaluates the cotreatment of γ-tocopherol and -FU in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy against HT-29  cells. Cytotoxic effect of this combination was examined using the 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and a synergistic effect was evaluated by a combination index technique. Nuclear morphology was studied via 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and flow cytometric assays were conducted to identify molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. We investigated the expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, Bax, and Bcl-2 by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The IC values for -FU and γ-tocopherol were 21.8  ± 2. and 14.4 ± 2.6 μM, respectively, and also this combination therapeutic increased the percentage of apoptotic cells from 35% ± 2% to 40% ±  4% (P  <  .05). Furthermore, incubation HT-29  cells with combined concentrations of two drugs caused significant accumulation of cells in the subGsubG1 phase.

For CC + SMA group, our surgical method was to isolate the mesocolon using a caudal-to-cranial pathway and ligate blood vessels along the midline of the SMA.The baseline data was not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.05). The mean operation time and intraoperative blood loss in the CC + SMA and the MA + SMV groups were 170.04 ± 43.10 versus 172.33 ± 41.84 min and 91.07 ± 55.12 versus 77.38 ± 40.21 ml, respectively, which has no significant difference (p > 0.05).

A propensity score matching (PSM; 1:2) was performed and compared patients with clinical tumor (cT) 4  who were treated with neoadjuvant CT to patients with cT4  treated with adjuvant CT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">1</xref>).A total of 192 patients treated with neoadjuvant CT were compared to 1,954 patients that received adjuvant CT. After PSM, 149 patients in the neoadjuvant group were compared to 298 patients in the control group. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics after PSM. After neoadjuvant CT, a significant response was observed in 13 (9%) patients with  (4%) patients showing a complete response. Complete resection margins (R0) were achieved in 77% in the neoadjuvant group versus 86% in the adjuvant treated group (p = 0.037). Significantly less tumor positive lymph nodes were found in the neoadjuvant group (median 0 vs. 2, p < 0.001). Major complication rates and -year overall survival did not differ between both groups (67-65%, p = 0.87).Neoadjuvant CT seems safe and feasible with similar long-term survival compared to patients who are treated with adjuvant CT.© 2019 The Author(s) Published by S.

Markers of murine cardiac and hepatic oxidative status were determined to provide additional insights into the benefit of co-encapsulating CURC and DOX in LCL over DOX-induced adverse effects in these organs. The current study demonstrated that the liposomal association of CURC and DOX effectively improved the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of DOX, limiting its side effects, via CURC-dependent antioxidant effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672637>Characterization, bioactivities, and rheological properties of exopolysaccharide produced by novel probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum C70 isolated from camel milk.</a></h1><p>Various industries highly regard the functionalities and bioactivities of bacterial polysaccharides. We aimed to characterize the exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by novel probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum C70 (accession number KX881779) isolated from camel milk and to investigate its bioactivities and rheological properties. EPS-C70 had a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 3.8 × 10 Da. Arabinose (13.3%), mannose (7.1%), glucose (74.6%), and galactose (.0%) were the major monosaccharides constituents. EPS-C70 had two endothermic peaks at 76.95°C and 158.76°C corresponding to glass transition (T) and melting point (T), respectively. Zeta potential and particle size of EPS-C70 were -330.71 mV and 525. nm, respectively. DPPH and ABTS of EPS-C70 were 75.91% and 49.42% at 10 mg/mL concentration, respectively. The cytotoxic activities against  and breast  lines were 88.1% and 73.1% at concentration 10 mg/mL, respectively. EPS-C70 exhibited shear-thinning behaviour. Salts and pH values had a significant impact on the rheological properties of EPS-C70.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.Over 15 years of follow-up, screening individuals aged 50-79 at 3% risk of colorectal  with annual FIT or single colonoscopy reduced colorectal  mortality by 6 per 1000 individuals. Single sigmoidoscopy and biennial FIT reduced it by  per 1000 individuals. Colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and annual FIT reduced colorectal  incidence by 10, 8, and 4 per 1000 individuals, respectively. The estimated incidence reduction for biennial FIT was 1 per 1000 individuals. Serious harms were estimated to be between 3 per 1000 (biennial FIT) and  per 1000 individuals (colonoscopy); harms increased with older age. The absolute benefits of screening increased with increasing colorectal  risk, while harms were less affected by baseline risk. Results were sensitive to the setting defined by the guideline panel. Because of uncertainty associated with modelling assumptions, we applied a GRADE rating of low certainty evidence to all estimates.Over a 15 year period, all screening strategies may reduce colorectal  mortality to a similar extent. Colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy may also reduce colorectal  incidence, while FIT shows a smaller incidence reduction. Harms are rare and of similar magnitude for all screening strategies.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Enrolled participants fulfilled the CRC screening population criteria if they were asymptomatic, were older than 50, and had no personal or familial history of colorectal neoplasia. The primary outcome was accuracy for the detection of polyps ≥ 6 mm. Secondary outcomes were accuracy for all polyps, polyps ≥ 10 mm, adenomas ≥ 10 mm, and cancers, the quality of bowel cleansing, safety, and CCE2 acceptability by the screening population.A total of 236 individuals were examined; 11 patients (%) were excluded. Therefore, 225 subjects (95%) were considered in the intention-to-screen (ITS) group. A total of 201 patients (89%) completed both examinations successfully (per protocol group). In the ITS group, polyps were diagnosed during CC in 114 subjects (51%); polyps ≥ 6 mm, polyps ≥ 10 mm, and adenomas ≥ 10 mm were diagnosed in 34 (15%), 16 (7%), and 11 (%) patients, respectively. The sensitivity of CCE2 for polyps ≥ 6 mm, polyps ≥ 10 mm, and adenomas ≥ 10 mm was 79% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62-91%), 88% (95% CI: 62-98%), and 100% (95% CI: 72-100%), respectively.Second-generation capsule colonoscopy is a safe, noninvasive, and sensitive method for colorectal neoplasia detection although CC remains the preferred method for considerable proportion of subjects. CCE2 may therefore be accepted as the primary screening test for colorectal  screening.Copyright © 2019 Michal Voska et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600666>Analysis of racial disparities in the treatment and outcomes of colorectal  in young adults.</a></h1><p>The incidence of colorectal  (CRC) in young adults is increasing. Minority populations with CRC are known to have worse survival outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate adults under age 50 years with CRC by race and ethnicity.Data were obtained from all US hospitals that contributed to the National  Database (NCDB) between 2004 and 2013. Univariate and multivariable testing was done to identify factors associated with patient outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used for association between patient characteristics and survival.A total of 83,449 patients between 18 and 50 years of age were identified. Median age was 45 years (SD ± 6), with male preponderance (53.9%). 72% were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), Blacks (AA) were 15.1% and Hispanics (who did not identify as Blacks) were 8.3% of the study population. Distribution across stages IIV was 15.6%, 22.4%, 33.9% and 27% consecutively. 41.8% of NHW and 28.4% of AA had rectal cancers (p < 0.001). Despite equally receiving standard of care (SOC) as per national guidelines, AA had significantly lower -year survival rates (58.8%) compared to Hispanics (64.8%) and NHW (66.9%; HR 1.42; 1.38-1.46; p < 0.001). Furthermore, NHW (HR 0.85; 0.81-0.88; p < 0.001) and Hispanics (HR 0.75; 0.70-0.79; p < 0.001) were more likely to benefit from chemotherapy compared to AA. SOC utilization was associated with improved survival across all racial groups, especially in AA (HR 0.64; 0.60-0.69; p < 0.001).Despite comparable rates of SOC utilization, AA young adults had worse survival outcomes compared to other races.

The experience among taTME surgeons beyond their learning curve is limited.A retrospective analysis of all taTME cases performed for rectal  at two tertiary care hospitals from 2014 to 2019 was conducted. Transanal surgeons had previously performed > 50 taTME cases. Demographic, perioperative, and short-term outcomes were analyzed.Among 54 taTME patients, 74.1% were male and 27.8% had a BMI ≥ 30. Tumors were stage I (8), II (13), III (29), and IV (4). Complex cases included 4 local recurrences, 4 prior liver resections, and 2 with prior prostate . Thirty tumors were located ≤ 6 cm from the anal verge. On staging MRI, 12 had a positive predicted circumferential radial margin (+CRM), and 4 had internal anal sphincter involvement (+IAS). Forty-seven patients received neoadjuvant therapy. A 2-team approach was used in 51 patients with laparoscopic (83.3%) or robotic (16.7%) abdominal assistance with a 9.2% conversion rate. Low anterior resection with sphincter salvage was achieved in 87% with 8 patients requiring intersphincteric resection. Anastomoses were hand-sewn in 57.4% and all patients were diverted. Median LOS was  days with a 42.6% 30-day morbidity rate and 3 postoperative mortalities (ARDS, pulmonary embolism and pseudomembranous colitis). Complete and near complete TME grade was achieved in 94.4% with a 3.7% rate of +CRM. At a median follow-up of 28 months, local and distant recurrence rates were 3.9% and 17.6%, respectively, with no -related mortality.Indications for taTME at experienced centers have expanded to include complex reoperative cases, local recurrences, metastatic , and tumors with threatened CRM or IAS with evidence of post-treatment tumor regression. In the latter cases, taTME achieves good short-term outcomes and may facilitate R0 resection.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567928>Factors Predicting Operative Difficulty of Laparoscopic Total Mesorectal Excision.</a></h1><p>Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision is a challenging procedure requiring high-quality surgery for optimal outcomes. Patient, tumor, and pelvic factors are believed to determine difficulty, but previous studies were limited to postoperative data.This study aimed to report factors predicting laparoscopic total mesorectal excision performance by using objective intraoperative assessment.Data from a multicenter laparoscopic total mesorectal excision randomized trial (ISRCTN59485808) were reviewed.This study was conducted at 4 centers in the United Kingdom.A total of 71 patients underwent elective laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal adenocarcinoma with curative intent: 53% were men, mean age was 69 years, body mass index was 27.7, tumor height was 8. cm, 24% underwent neoadjuvant therapy, and 25% had previous surgery.Surgical performance was assessed through the identification of intraoperative adverse events by using observational clinical human reliability analysis. Univariate analysis and multivariate binomial regression were performed to establish factors predicting the number of intraoperative errors, surgeon-reported case difficulty, and short-term clinical and histopathological outcomes.A total of 1331 intraoperative errors were identified from 365 hours of surgery (median, 18 per case; interquartile range, 16-22; and range, 9-49). No patient, tumor, or bony pelvimetry measurement correlated with total or pelvic error count, surgeon-reported case difficulty, cognitive load, operative data, specimen quality, number or severity of 30-day morbidity events and length of stay (all r not exceeding ±0.26, p > 0.05). Mesorectal area was associated with major intraoperative adverse events (OR, 1.09; 95%CI, 1.01-1.16; p = 0.015) and postoperative morbidity (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.01-1.2; p = 0.033). Obese men were subjectively reported as harder cases (24 vs 36 mm, p = 0.042), but no detrimental effects on performance or outcomes were seen.Our sample size is modest, risking type II errors and overfitting of the statistical models.Patient, tumor, and bony pelvic anatomical characteristics are not seen to influence laparoscopic total mesorectal excision operative difficulty. Mesorectal area is identified as a risk factor for intraoperative and postoperative morbidity.

Five radiologists independently assessed the longitudinal diameter of  as well as T- and N-categories. The five image-based criteria (T3cd/T4, T3/T4, T3/T4 or N+, T3cd/T4 or N2, and T3/T4 with ≥ 4 cm) were evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy, interreader agreement, and overtreatment risk using pooled receiver-operating curve and Fleiss kappa analyses. Pathologic high-risk stage II or III was used as a reference standard for assessment of overtreatment risk.The diagnostic accuracy of multireaders was in the acceptable range (pooled area under curve (AUC): 0.751-0.829). T3/T4 showed the highest AUC (0.829) in terms of diagnostic accuracy. T3/T4 with ≥ 4 cm showed the highest kappa value (κ = 0.695) followed by T3/T4 (κ = 0.623), indicating substantial agreement. The other three criteria revealed moderate agreement (κ = 0.558-0.577). In terms of overtreatment ratio, T3cd/T4 and T3cd/T4 or N2 showed relatively lower ratios (T3cd/T4, 2.2%; T3cd/T4 or N2, 2.9%), whereas T3/T4 and T3/T4 or N+ revealed higher ratios (T3/T4, 8.7%; T3/T4 or N+, 9.%).T3/T4 was the best criterion in terms of diagnostic accuracy.

Meanwhile HER2 amplification reportedly denoted CTX-resistant mCRC tumors. We investigated whether monitoring of HER2 amplification in circulating DNA allowed early detection of mCRC progression and CTX resistance.We analyzed HER2 amplification in circulating DNA at 8-week intervals using ddPCR from 36 patients with RAS/BRAF mCRC, who progressed after CTX treatments between July 2015 and January 2018.Of the 36 patients,  (13.9%) exhibited dynamic fluctuations of HER2 amplification in plasma in the course of CTX treatment, of whom 2 were positive for HER2 amplification in matched tumor specimens at baseline (per FISH). All  primary sites were left side: 3 rectums and 2 descending . HER2 ratio fluctuations in circulating DNA not only reflected changes in tumor volume, but their obvious increases presaged CT-documented progress by an average lead time of 2 months. Interestingly, progression-free survival did not significantly differ between these  patients and those without HER2 amplification (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.40-2.77, P = 0.909).Plasma HER2 amplification detected by ddPCR changed over time and predicted resistance to CTX, by an average lead time of 2 months.

While the overall incidence is declining, it is rising alarmingly in young patients (EOCC). CC in young patients tends to be more aggressive and often diagnosed at more advanced stages and portend poorer prognosis. Our recently published data showed that EOCC is a distinct disease with unique molecular features compared to late-onset CC (LOCC). The Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) was shown to be significantly upregulated in EOCC and correlated with poor survival. However, the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis, especially in young patients, is not well understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis by modulating COMP levels in vitro and test how it affects proliferation. Then, patient samples were evaluated by testing the levels of proliferation marker Ki67. In addition, this study investigates whether higher transcriptional mRNA levels of COMP seen in more aggressive early-onset CC correlate with protein levels compared to late-onset CC.COMP mRNA levels in fresh frozen  tumors (young: n = ; old: n = ) were assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, CC cell lines were profiled for COMP expression to choose an in vitro model to study the role of COMP in CC tumorigenesis. HT-29 (low COMP expression) and CaCo-2 (high COMP expression) cells were used for in vitro proliferation studies. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted to assess COMP and Ki67 protein levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)  tumors.Significantly higher COMP expression levels were observed in fresh frozen EOCC compared to LOCC tumors. This observation confirmed our previously reported results from NanoString gene expression assay using FFPE samples. Cell proliferation was significantly increased in HT-29 and CaCo-2 cells upon treatment with human recombinant COMP protein after 48 and 72 h (P < 0.05). This increase was more profound in HT-29 cells. Staining for COMP and Ki67 revealed high COMP protein levels in EOCC compared to LOCC patients.COMP mRNA and protein levels are significantly higher in EOCC patients. Higher COMP levels correlate with increased proliferation suggesting a role in CC tumorigenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602339>Successful -fluorouracil (-FU) infusion re-challenge in a metastatic colorectal  patient with coronary artery disease who experienced symptoms consistent with coronary vasospasm during first -FU infusion.</a></h1><p>-fluorouracil (-FU) is an important component of chemotherapy for metastatic  and can be administered as an intravenous infusion or bolus. Coronary vasospasm is a known complication of infusional and bolus -FU administration. In patients who experience coronary vasospasm, -FU is often discontinued. Several cases of successful re-challenge with bolus -FU, utilizing calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and nitrates to prophylaxis against coronary vasospasm recurrence, have been reported in the literature. However, since there is increased variability of time to symptom onset with infusional -FU, re-challenge with infusional -FU has not been widely studied. Given potential differences in the toxicity profile and exposure time, infusional may be more appropriate than bolus for some patients. Here we report successful re-challenge with infusional -FU, following coronary vasospasm during the first cycle of -FU plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy, in a patient with metastatic  and coronary artery disease (CAD).

TaTME has gained popularity and becomes the center of attention among colorectal surgeons globally. The present review aims to update the literature, clarify the current status and perspectives of TaTME. Complete TaTME specimens were obtained in 85-97.1% of the case; the reported circumferential resection margin (CRM) ranged from 1.% to 8.1%, whereas and distal resection margin (DRM) positive rates ranged from 0% to 3.2%. The conversion rate of TaTME occurred from 0 to 15%, and there was no difference between TaTME and laparoscopic or robotic TME. Intraoperative complications occurred in -6% of the case, which compared favorably to laparoscopic TME. The most serious intraoperative complication with this approach was urethral injury, although only small numbers were reported, which was possibly due to under-reporting. Clavien-Dindo I or II postoperative complications occurred in 22-24% of the case, and III or IV in 10-11% of the case, which did not differ between TaTME and laparoscopic or robotic TME. TaTME may be technically easier and more beneficial than laparoscopic, robotic or open TME in male patients with a narrow pelvis; in obese patients with a bulky tumor. At present two randomized controlled trials, COLOR III and GRECCAR, and comparing TaTME with laparoscopic TME are being conducted and their outcomes are awaited. TaTME is a complex procedure, but proved to be feasible, oncologically safe, and effective in difficult cases. Before this new technique is adopted, proper training with Proctor/mentorship is strongly advised. Careful case selection and audit of data are mandatory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661884>Fingerprinting, Antimicrobial, Antioxidant, Anticancer, Cyclooxygenase and Metabolic Enzymes Inhibitory Characteristic Evaluations of  Boiss.

Surgical guidelines recommend transanal excision of early rectal neoplasia up to 8 cm from the anal verge. A retrospective review of two novel approaches for transanal robotic local excision with R0 resections of rectal cancers which was, on average, higher than 8 cm. Twenty-one cases of robotic assisted transanal surgery for early stage disease (T0-T1, N0) were reviewed. The first 10 cases performed with the da Vinci Si robotic platform between 2013 and 2016, and the first 11 cases performed using the Flex Medrobotics platform between August 2017 and August 2018. The average distance from the anal verge was 11.1 cm and 9. cm for the da Vinci Si and Flex Colorectal Drive, respectively. The average operative time was 167.6 min for the da Vinci Si and 110.1 min for the Flex Colorectal Drive; the average EBL was 37. cc and 9.1 cc for the da Vinci Si and Flex Colorectal Drive. In the da Vinci series, four cases required intraoperative conversion. In the Flex series, one case was aborted due to unfavorable robotic positioning. All margins were histologically negative when surgically complete with no recurrences to date.

Among 109 patients with CRC causing incomplete colonoscopy who underwent CTC with IV contrast enhancement after cathartic purgation, fecal tagging, and  distention, 70 (mean age, 70 years) for whom reference standards (surgical reports, first surveillance colonoscopy) were available were evaluated. Per-patient and per-lesion sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of CTC in the diagnosis of synchronous  lesions measuring 6 mm or larger were assessed.  Twenty-seven of the 70 patients (39%) had at least one 6-mm or larger synchronous lesion, and four patients (6%) had a total of five synchronous CRCs. Per-patient sensitivity in diagnosing synchronous CRC was 1.00 (4/4). There were 59 lesions: 20 with a diameter of 10 mm or greater; 30, 6-9 mm; and nine,  mm or less. The overall per-patient CTC sensitivity in detecting synchronous lesions 6 mm or larger was 0.93 (25/27); specificity, 0.98 (42/43); PPV, 0.96; and NPV, 0.95. Per-patient sensitivity for the diagnosis of synchronous advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma and colorectal cancers) was 0.94 (15/16).

We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients (32 men and 19 women) with a solitary PJP and analyzed the sex, age at diagnosis, endoscopic features, and outcomes in this patient group. The STK11/LKB1 germline mutation was not investigated in any of the patients.The mean age of the 51 patients was 66.1 years. The polyp was found in the duodenum ( = 10), jejunum ( = 2), cecum ( = 2), transverse  ( = ), sigmoid  ( = 21), or rectum ( = 11). Most of the polyps presented as a pedunculated lesion ( = 40), followed by semipedunculated ( = 9) and sessile ( = 2) morphologies. The mean size of a solitary PJP was 15.6 mm (range:  to 33 mm). During a mean endoscopic follow-up period of 4. years (range: 0.1 to 16.1 years), no recurrence was identified. Eighteen of the enrolled patients had a history of  or concomitant . Five patients died due to non-gastrointestinal-related causes. No additional  or death directly related to solitary PJP was observed.Solitary PJPs did not recur in this study.

The present study investigated the effect of PLAC8 on the proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and their sensitivity to gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). It was found that the inhibition of PLAC8 expression in PC-9 cells resulted in significantly decreased proliferation, whereas overexpression of PLAC8 significantly increased the proliferation (P<0.05) of PC-9 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLAC8 expression resulted in decreased activity of the ERK signaling pathway, while PLAC8 overexpression increased activity of this pathway. Inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway with U0126 reversed the effects induced by inhibiting or overexpressing PLAC8 on cell proliferation. In addition, overexpression of PLAC8 significantly decreased the sensitivity of PC-9 cells to gefitinib, and this effect was reversed by U0126. Overall, these results suggest that PLAC8 is involved in the regulation of proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells and impacts their sensitivity to an EGFR-TKI. Thus, PLAC8 is a potential novel target in lung adenocarcinoma for future studies.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p></html>
