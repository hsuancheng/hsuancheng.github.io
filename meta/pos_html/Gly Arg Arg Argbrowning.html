Thus, how 4-MeI forms in a D-glucose (Glu) amino acids (AA) model system is important, as it is how  is affected. An aqueous solution of Glu was mixed individually in equimolar amounts at 3 concentrations (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 M) with aqueous solutions of L-Alanine (Ala), L-Arginine (), Glycine (), L-Lysine (Lys), and L-Serine (Ser). The Glu-AA mixtures were reacted at 60, 120, and 160 °C for 1 h. The 4-MeI levels were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after derivatization with isobutylchloroformate. No 4-MeI was formed at 60 °C for any treatment combination; however, at 120 °C and 0.05 M, Glu- and Glu-Lys produced 0.13 and 0.14 mg/kg of 4-MeI. At 160 °C and 0.05 M all treatment combinations formed 4-MeI. At 160 °C and 0.15 M, the observed levels of Glu-Ala, Glu-, Glu-, Glu-Lys, and Glu-Ser were 0.21, 1.00, 0.15, 0.22, and 0.16 mg/kg. The AA type, reactant concentrations, and temperature significantly affected (P < 0.001) formation of 4-MeI as well as . Glu-Lys treatment in all combinations produced the most , but Glu- produced the most 4-MeI. This method showed that foods processed using low temperatures may have reduced levels of 4-MeI.© 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670192>The effect of amino acids on non-enzymatic  of glucosamine: Generation of butterscotch aromatic and bioactive health compounds without detectable levels of neo-formed alkylimidazoles.</a></h1><p>A mixture of glucosamine (GlcN, 15% w/v) and different amino acids in 1:1 M ratio was incubated at 70 °C for 12 h. The resulting GlcN-amino acid caramels were analysed for α-dicarbonyl compounds, polyhydroxyalkyl pyrazines, heterocyclic compound and alkylimidazoles. All the analyses were performed by using HPLC-MS/MS followed by pooling the variables with principal component analysis (PCA). GlcN- caramels generated the greatest amount of butterscotch aromatic compound diacetyl and polyhydroxyalkyl pyrazines (fructosazine and deoxyfructosazine). The potentially toxic heterocyclic compound, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was generated in greater amounts with the GlcN- caramels. However, the toxic alkylimidazoles (4-MEI and THI) were not present in any of the GlcN-amino acid caramels. The results suggest that caramel with butterscotch aroma and bioactivity can be produced with GlcN-amino acid at 70 °C. The PCA performed discriminated the majority of the GlcN-amino acid combinations; GlcN- and GlcN-Ser were best discriminated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p></html>
