<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31201552>Obeticholic : An Update of Its Pharmacological Activities in Liver Disorders.</a></h2><p>Obeticholic  (OCA), 6α-ethyl-3α,7α-dihydroxy-5-cholan-24-oic , is a semisynthetic derivative of the chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA, 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5-cholan-24-oic ), a relatively hydrophobic primary bile  synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-CDCA or INT-747, was originally described by investigators at the Perugia University in 2002 as a selective ligand for the bile  sensor, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). In addition to FXR and similarly to CDCA, OCA also activates GPBAR1/TGR5, a cell membrane G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile . In 2016, based on the results of phase II studies showing efficacy in reducing the plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate biomarker for disease progression in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), OCA has gained approval as a second-line treatment for PBC patients nonresponsive to UDCA. The use of OCA in PBC patients associates with several side effects, the most common of which is pruritus, whose incidence is dose-dependent and is extremely high when this agent is used as a monotherapy. Additionally, the use of OCA associates with the increased risk for the development of liver failure in cirrhotic PBC patients. Currently, OCA is investigated for its potential in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Phase II and III trials have shown that OCA might attenuate the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with , but it has no efficacy in reversing the steatotic component of the disease, while reduces the circulating levels of HDL-C and increases LDL-C. In summary, OCA has been the first-in-class of FXR ligands advanced to a clinical stage and is now entering its third decade of life, highlighting the potential benefits and risk linked to FXR-targeted therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693358>Anti-steatosis compounds from leaves of Mallotus furetianus.</a></h2><p>There is no drug administration-approved therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this study, eight compounds, gallic  (1), methyl gallate (2), corilagin (3), 3,4,8,9,10-pentahydroxydibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (4), repandinin B (5), (Z)-3-hexenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (6), (+)-lyoniresinol-3α-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (7) and mallophenol A (8) were isolated from the active fractions of Mallotus furetianus. Three compounds, (6, 7 and 8) revealed potent anti-steatosis activity in the oleic  (OA)-induced steatosis cell model, with the minimum effective concentration of 0.05 (6), 0.0005 (7) and 0.0005 (8) μg/mL, which were much lower than the control compound, fibrate (72.4 μg/mL).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303744>Agonism for the bile  receptor GPBAR1 reverses  and vascular damage in a mouse model of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the  and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile -activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses  and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses  and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed  injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay. BAR501 reversed this pattern in a Gpbar1-dependent manner, highlighting a potential role for GPBAR1 agonism in treating the  and vascular component of NASH.-Carino, A., Marchianò, S., Biagioli, M., Bucci, M., Vellecco, V., Brancaleone, V., Fiorucci, C., Zampella, A., Monti, M.

F-labeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic  penta-peptide (F-FPP-RGD) has been used as a PET probe for tumors expressing integrin αvβ3. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of PET with F-FPP-RGD to detect hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mice.Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice aged 6 weeks were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino -defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 3 and 8 weeks. F-FPP-RGD PET imaging of the liver was performed at 3 and 8 weeks after CDAHFD feeding. After PET scanning, levels of hepatic integrin αvβ, 3α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen type 1 alpha 1(col1a1) were measured. Histopathological analysis of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as blood biochemistry analysis, was also performed. CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks produced a moderate-to-severe steatosis and inflammation of the liver in mice. NAFLD activity score (NAS) in mice fed the CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks were more than 4 indicating NASH or borderline NASH pathology. Fibrosis was observed only in mice fed the CDAHFD for 8 weeks. PET imaging showed that the hepatic standardized uptake value, SUV, was increased with prolonged CDAHFD feeding compared with the respective controls (CDAHFD 3 weeks 0.32 ± 0.06 vs 0.48 ± 0.05, p < 0.01; CDAHFD 8 weeks 0.35 ± 0.04 vs 0.75 ± 0.07, p < 0.01, respectively). Prolonged CDAHFD feeding increased hepatic mRNA and protein levels of integrin αv and β3 at 3 and 8 weeks. Hepatic F-FPP-RGD uptake and amount of integrin αv and β3 protein were well correlated (r = 0.593, p < 0.05 and r = 0.835, p < 0.001, respectively). Hepatic F-FPP-RGD uptake also showed a positive correlation with Sirius red-positive area.The hepatic uptake of F-FPP-RGD correlated well with integrin αv and β3 expression and histological fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH, suggesting the predictability of fibrosis in NASH pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27652492>Discovery of 3α,7α,11β-Trihydroxy-6α-ethyl-5β-cholan-24-oic  (TC-100), a Novel Bile  as Potent and Highly Selective FXR Agonist for Enterohepatic Disorders.</a></h2><p>As a continuation of previous efforts in mapping functional hot spots on the bile  scaffold, we here demonstrate that the introduction of a hydroxy group at the C11β position affords high selectivity for FXR. In particular, the synthesis and FXR/TGR5 activity of novel bile  bearing different hydroxylation patterns at the C ring are reported and discussed from a structure-activity standpoint. The results obtained led us to discover the first bile  derivative endowed with high potency and selectivity at the FXR receptor, 3α,7α,11β-trihydroxy-6α-ethyl-5β-cholan-24-oic  (TC-100, 7) which also shows a remarkable physicochemical and pharmacological profile. Compound 7 combines the excellent physicochemical properties of hydrophilic bile  such as ursodeoxycholic , with the distinct ability to specifically bind and regulate FXR activity in vivo, thus providing a bona fide novel therapeutic agent to treat enterohepatic disorders such as cholestasis, NASH, and .</p></html>
