Desogestrel and norgestimate must be transformed to metabolites for all or part of their biologic activity; gestodene is active in its original form. Compared with present low-dose monophasic and triphasic  formulations, the new combinations appear to be equivalent in efficacy and type and frequency of side effects. Cycle control may be slightly improved with the gestodene preparation and somewhat poorer with the desogestrel regimen. As with the present triphasics, most changes reported in coagulation indexes for the new combinations remained within normal limits, as did changes in carbohydrate and . There is no present evidence that either the norgestimate or aesogestrel formulation provides a clinical improvement over the  triphasic. In the gestodene combination, the progestogen's increased biologic activity allows further reduction of total steroid dose.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2972141>[New progestational hormones].</a></h2><p>The pharmacology and the application in oral hormonal contraceptives of four new progestogens--gestodene, desogestrel, norgestimate, and dienogest--are described in a survey. Although derived from 19-norethisterone these progestogens exhibit in clinical dosages no androgenic effects. Both in animal and in human tests gestodene possesses the highest progestogenic potency followed by , desogestrel, norgestimate, and dienogest. The monophasic preparations with the new progestogens (femovan--gestodene, marvelon--desogestrel, cilest--norgestimate, certostat--dienogest) are safe contraceptives and the incidence of bleeding disturbancies amount to about 5%. After administration of these monophasic contraceptives the concentration of SHBG in serum increases and as a result of this the level of free testosterone decreases. Further a favourable effect on  is observed. In spite of a different progestogen content these combination pills are almost without influence on biochemical parameters and carbohydrate .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3139359>The effects of Norplant on clinical chemistry in Singaporean acceptors after 1 year of use: metabolic changes.</a></h2><p>In this longitudinal study involving 100 Singaporean acceptors, the effects of NORPLANT on their metabolic function was evaluated. With respect to liver function, the results indicate possible hepatocellular dysfunction; there was a significant rise in mean serum bilirubin from 0.55 mg/dl to 0.87 mg/dl after 12 months of use (p less than 0.001). This rise could not be attributed to a skewed distribution of mean value as the difference achieved statistical significance using the paired 't' test as well as the Wilcoxon signed rank test using the median distribution. In terms of the effects of NORPLANT on , we have demonstrated a significant rise in HDL-cholesterol (1.08 mmol/l +/- 0.34 to 1.13 mmol/l +/- 0.24; p less than 0.05) with significant decreases in mean serum triglycerides (1.21 mmol/l +/- 0.74 to 0.89 mmol/l +/- 0.45; p less than 0.002) and total cholesterol (5.05 mmol/l +/- 1.02 to 4.64 mmol/l +/- 0.81; p less than 0.001) after one year of use. There was also a significant rise in the HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio after 1 year (0.225 +/- 0.086 cf 0.250 +/- 0.059; p less than 0.001). As we have not incorporated a simultaneous non-pill treated control group, the observed changes in lipoprotein lipids could be attributed to extraneous factors such as diet, exercise or other environmental changes. Nevertheless, the findings though speculative indicate NORPLANT use to be non-contributory to cardiovascular risk and indeed it may be protective factor against such risks in this population. The use of NORPLANT was not associated with any significant effect on glucose tolerance after 12 months of use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9678138>Contraception guidance in women with pre-existing disturbances in carbohydrate .</a></h2><p>To review our studies on the clinical and metabolic impact of contraceptive methods in women with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in order to provide suggestions for the contraceptive counselling of these women.The clinical events following first insertions of copper IUDs were studied in 103 women with IDDM and in 119 non-diabetic women. Moreover we studied the effects on glycometabolic control and  in women with well-controlled IDDM using low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) containing ethinylestradiol combined with norethisterone (n = 10),  (n = 9) or gestodene (n = 11). Hemostatic and endothelial function was also studied in the women using the gestodene-containing preparation. Finally, we studied the impact of oral contraceptives on the insulin sensitivity in women with previous GDM.The continuation rates and indications for medical removal of the IUDs were similar in the diabetic and the non-diabetic women. There was no increased pregnancy rate or increased frequency of pelvic inflammatory disease in the diabetic women. The glycemic control was not changed by the OCs and none of the treatment regimens were associated with changes in plasma lipids linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis. Indications of increased fibrin formation, which seemed to be compensated by increased fibrinolytic activity, were noted with the gestodene-containing preparation. None of the women developed microalbuminuria during the study. Compared to normal women, we found reduced insulin sensitivity in the women with previous GDM using the pill.Intrauterine devices and barrier methods can be used by diabetic women with the same reservations as in the general population. Low-dose OCs do not influence the glycemic control and have no adverse impact on plasma lipids. The balance between fibrin formation and resolution was maintained during intake of the gestodene-containing pill. Our findings suggest that combined oral contraceptives can be used in women with uncomplicated IDDM and in women with previous GDM if clinical and metabolic monitoring can be ensured.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2116079>A three-year evaluation of metabolic changes in Singaporean Norplant acceptors.</a></h2><p>In a longitudinal study involving 100 Singaporean women, the effect of NorplantR on metabolic function was evaluated. With respect to liver function, the results indicate possible hepatocellular dysfunction as evidenced by a significant rise in serum bilirubin and a significant fall in total proteins and globulin during the period under review. As regards , total triglycerides and total cholesterol still remained significantly decreased at the end of the three years. The LDL, which was significantly decreased in the first year, increased during the subsequent two years to its preinsertion value at the end of three years. The HDL-cholesterol levels continued to decrease in the second and third year after a significant increase in the first year. Despite this, the HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol-HDL cholesterol remained above 0.200. As we have not incorporated a simultaneous non-pill treated control group, the observed changes in lipoprotein lipids could be attributed to extraneous factors such as diet, exercise, or other environmental changes.

In rare instances, large increments in blood pressure are measured. We investigated the effect of a combination of ethinyl estradiol (EE) plus a progestogen with antimineralocorticoid, i.e. natriuretic, properties [Drospirenone (DRSP)] on body weight, blood pressure, the renin-aldosterone system, atrial natriuretic factor, plasma lipids, and glucose tolerance. It is anticipated that this will lead to the development of an OC that does not raise body weight or blood pressure. Four groups of 20 women each received 30 micrograms EE plus 3 mg DRSP (group A), 20 micrograms EE plus 3 mg DRSP (group B), 15 micrograms EE plus 3 mg DRSP (group C), and, as a control OC, 30 micrograms EE plus 150 micrograms  (Microgynon, Schering; group D) for 6 months. During the OC-free control cycles before and after treatment and throughout treatment, the target parameters were measured. Between the pretreatment cycle and the sixth treatment cycle, mean body weight fell by 0.8 to 1.7 kg in groups A, B, and C (P < 0.05 vs. D), whereas it rose by 0.7 kg in group D. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell by 1-4 mm Hg in groups A, B, and C (significant for A and C vs. D) and increased by 1-2 mm Hg in group D. Renin substrate rose equally in all groups (P < 0.05), whereas PRA and plasma aldosterone rose significantly only in the DRSP groups, presumably due to sodium loss. In the DRSP groups, high density lipoprotein cholesterol rose (P < 0.05), in contrast to group D. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol fell slightly (P > 0.05), whereas triglyceride levels showed a stronger increase in the DRSP groups (P < 0.05) than in group D. All groups attained good cycle control; group A had the best. Side-effects were minimal. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a combined OC that leads to a small decrease in body weight and blood pressure. It may be especially beneficial for women susceptible for a gain in weight and a rise in blood pressure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11929643>An open label, comparative study of the effects of a dose-reduced oral contraceptive containing 20 microg ethinyl estradiol and 100 microg  on hemostatic, lipids, and carbohydrate  variables.</a></h2><p>In this open label, randomized study we compared the influence of a dose-reduced oral contraceptive containing 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 100 microg  (20 EE) with a reference preparation containing 30 microg EE and 150 microg  (30 EE) on hemostatic, lipids, and carbohydrate  variables. Data from 48 volunteers were obtained. The direction of the change (increase or decrease) in most of the hemostatic variables were similar in both treatment groups. In particular, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 increased during treatment, reaching a median percent change of 40% in the 20 EE group and of 17% in the 30 EE group after one year. D-Dimer fibrin split products remained virtually unchanged, with no change at Cycle 13. The median HDL2 cholesterol levels decreased by 26% in the 20 EE group and by 39.8% in 30 EE group (p = 0.0045 for group difference) after one year. The median one year change for LDL cholesterol was 3.23% in the 20 EE group, compared to 25% in the 30 EE group, for VLDL 11.1% compared to 38.8%, respectively, and for total triglycerides 10.0% compared to 37.5%, respectively. The median absolute change for the area under the curve (AUC)(0-3h) for glucose at treatment Cycle 13 was 41.25 mmol/L x min in the 20 EE group and 73.50 mmol/L x min in the 30 EE group. The AUC(0-3h) insulin at treatment Cycle 13 decreased in the 20 EE group by 1635.0 pmolL x min and increased in the 30 EE group by 11797.5 pmolL x min (p = 0.0491 for group difference). Both study treatments were safe and well tolerated by the volunteers. In conclusion, the balanced one-third dose reduction in this new oral contraceptive evoked similar effects on the hemostatic variables, but favorable results for the  and carbohydrate profiles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26007631>Haemostatic and  impact of estradiol pills and drospirenone-containing ethinylestradiol pills vs. -containing ethinylestradiol pills: A literature review.</a></h2><p>Since its introduction 50 years ago, the contraceptive pill has continuously evolved to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with its use. An increased risk of VTE still remains, however. Other concerns, such as effects on lipid and carbohydrate , have also been reported. In this study we compared two reference combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing ethinylestradiol (EE)/ (LNG) and EE/drospirenone (DRSP) with COCs containing estradiol (E2) (estradiol valerate [E2V]/dienogest [DNG] and E2/nomegestrol acetate [NOMAC]). They were evaluated according to their influence on recognised haemostatic and  markers.A literature search of the MEDLINE/PubMed database was conducted for head-to-head studies. EE/LNG was chosen as the comparator pill.The haemostatic impact of E2 pills and EE/LNG has been extensively compared, in contrast to that of EE/DRSP and EE/LNG. Changes in haemostatic and  marker levels between EE/LNG and E2V/DNG were generally not statistically significant. E2/NOMAC showed statistically significantly favourable results on haemostatic markers and had a neutral effect on carbohydrate and lipid  when compared with EE/LNG.E2/NOMAC exhibits less haemostatic and  impact than EE/LNG and other COCs, suggesting that it may be a promising candidate to reduce residual VTE risk associated with COC use.

A day 1 start in cycle one with no backup contraception was used. A total of 3546 female volunteers participated in 35,036 cycles. Medication was missed in 2688 (7.7%) cycles. Nine pregnancies were reported for an uncorrected use-effectiveness rate of 0.33 per 100 woman-years. Cycle control was excellent, bleeding irregularities were minimal, and the incidence of side effects was very low. No clinically significant variations in blood pressure means or weight means were observed. Carbohydrate and  studies were limited to 6 months and showed minimal alterations. Subject compliance with the preparation was excellent. It is concluded that this triphasic oral contraceptive with its varying ratios of  and ethinyl estradiol is an effective, predictable, and well-tolerated combination oral contraceptive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2972791>Comparative effects of combined oral contraceptives containing desogestrel or  on serum lipids, lipoproteins and sex hormone binding globulin in healthy women.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2046076>Coronary heart disease risk markers in users of low-dose oral contraceptives.</a></h2><p>Seven combination oral contraceptives (OCs) were studied for their effects on glucose, insulin, triglyceride and lipoprotein concentrations. Subjects included 925 women using fixed-dose (monophasic) or variable-dose (triphasic) formulations and 418 premenopausal women not using OCs. The monophasics contained 150 or 250 micrograms of , 500 or 1,000 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel as the progestin. Triphasic progestin doses were 50-125 micrograms of  or 500-1,000 micrograms of norethindrone. All the formulations increased the fasting serum triglycerides. No changes were seen in serum total cholesterol. The effects on serum lipoproteins depended on the progestin type and dose. Monophasics containing 500 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Monophasics containing  reduced HDL cholesterol. The triphasics did not affect LDL or HDL cholesterol but altered the balance of HDL subfractions. All the formulations caused a deterioration in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance and increased pancreatic insulin secretion. The greatest effects were seen with formulations containing .

This study was designed to prove the efficacy of the long-acting testosterone undecanoate ester (TU) alone or in combination with oral  (LNG) in a phase II clinical trial.Twenty-eight healthy men were randomized to receive injections of 1000 mg TU every 6 weeks in combination with daily oral LNG (250 microg) or daily oral placebo treatment over a period of 24 weeks, followed by a control period of 28 weeks.During the course of the study semen analysis, reproductive hormone analysis, analysis of clinical chemistry and  parameters, well-being and sexual function, sonography of scrotal contents and prostate were performed.Marked suppression of gonadotrophins in both treatment groups resulted in azoospermia in 8/14 and 7/14 volunteers and severe oligozoospermia (< 3 x 1012/l) in 4/14 and 7/14 in the placebo and gestagen treated groups, respectively. Time to induction of azoospermia (mean +/- SEM) was not significantly different between the placebo (week 19.5 +/- 2.2) and LNG groups (week 15.4 +/- 2.2). During the whole treatment period mean testosterone serum concentrations remained within normal limits. Although not significant, it was evident that volunteers who became azoospermic had a better suppression of gonadotrophins and lower SHBG levels during treatment compared to non-azoospermic volunteers. Despite better gonadotrophin suppression in the LNG group no significant differences compared to placebo could be observed in the extent and kinetics of suppression of spermatogenesis, thus not demonstrating a major beneficial effect of LNG in the combination with injectable TU. Treatment led in both groups to a decrease of HDL and Lp(a) which was more pronounced in the LNG group (P > 0.05).Treatment with 1000 mg testosterone undecanoate injected at 6 weekly intervals or in combination with  showed suppression of spermatogenesis comparable to weekly injections of 200 mg testosterone enanthate. Because of its long half-life and in the absence of severe side-effects, testosterone undecanoate can be considered as first choice testosterone ester in further studies of hormonal male contraception.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3772909>Oral contraceptives and lipoprotein .</a></h2><p>The extensive literature on the effects of oral contraceptives on plasma lipoproteins is reviewed. The interpretation of various studies has been confounded by the diversity of contraceptive formulations and by the fact that estrogen and progestogen components in a given preparation may neutralize or potentiate each other's effects. Recent studies on contraceptive estrogens and progestogens administered alone have helped to reveal some of the mechanisms behind oral-contraceptive-induced changes in plasma lipoproteins.

Azole antifungal agents such as ketoconazole act by inhibiting cytochrome P-450 mediated sterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane and thus have the potential to interfere with mammalian steroidogenesis. Fluconazole is a novel orally-effective antifungal triazole which has been reported to have more specific effects on the cytochrome P-450 enzymes involved in fungal sterol synthesis. 2. Due to the potential value of systemic antifungal agents in the treatment of infections commonly occurring in women, we assessed the effect of oral fluconazole on the metabolic profile of 18 healthy premenopausal women, 10 of whom were taking combined oral contraceptives (OC). Each woman acted as her own control, being studied both before and 21-28 days after fluconazole therapy (50 mg daily), in the luteal phase of consecutive menstrual cycles. 3. The endocrinological profile included measurement of serum oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations, short tetracosactrin adrenal stimulation test and thyroid function tests. Carbohydrate  was investigated by means of an oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Serum lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were analysed on samples taken after an overnight fast. 4. Minor biochemical changes associated with fluconazole treatment included increases in serum thyroxine and testosterone concentrations (but not in women taking OC as well as fluconazole) and in insulin and apolipoprotein B levels (but only in women taking OC as well as fluconazole). In general, these changes were small and of no clinical significance with the values remaining within the laboratory normal range. There were no adverse side-effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2146499>The effects of different formulations of oral contraceptive agents on  and carbohydrate .</a></h2><p>Oral contraceptives can induce changes in  and carbohydrate  similar to those associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, including increased serum triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and insulin levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In this study, we examined whether modification of the type or dose of progestin in oral-contraceptive preparations diminishes these changes.We measured plasma lipoprotein levels and performed oral glucose-tolerance tests in a cross section of 1060 women who took one of nine types of oral contraceptives for at least three months and 418 women who took none. Seven of the contraceptive formulations contained various doses and types of progestin:  in low (150 micrograms), high (250 micrograms), and triphasic (50 to 125 micrograms) doses; norethindrone in low (500 micrograms), high (1000 micrograms), and triphasic (500 to 1000 micrograms) doses; and a new progestin, desogestrel, in one dose (150 micrograms). All seven contained 30 to 40 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol. Two additional formulations contained progestin alone.As compared with controls, women taking combination drugs did not have increased serum total cholesterol levels but did have increases of 13 to 75 percent in fasting triglyceride levels. Levels of LDL cholesterol were reduced by 14 percent in women taking the combination containing desogestrel and by 12 percent in those taking low-dose norethindrone. Levels of HDL cholesterol were lowered by 5 percent and 16 percent by the combinations containing low-dose and high-dose , respectively; these decreases were due to reductions of 29 percent and 43 percent, respectively, in the levels of HDL subclass 2. The combination pill containing high-dose norethindrone did not affect HDL cholesterol levels, whereas that containing low-dose norethindrone increased HDL cholesterol levels by 10 percent. The desogestrel combination increased HDL cholesterol levels by 12 percent. Levels of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and B were generally increased by combination drugs. Depending on the dose and type of progestin, combination drugs were associated with plasma glucose levels on the glucose-tolerance test that were 43 to 61 percent higher than in controls, insulin responses 12 to 40 percent higher, and C-peptide responses 18 to 45 percent higher. Progestin-only formulations had only minor metabolic effects.The appropriate dose and type of progestin may reduce the adverse effects of oral contraceptives on many metabolic markers of risk for coronary heart disease.

The development of progestins has been influenced in a major way by the search for orally active hormonal contraceptives, since it is likely that hormonal contraceptives will continue to utilize a progestin, the only possible alternative being represented by the utilization of antiprogestins. Synthetic progestogens in clinical use today belong to three main chemical families: progesterone derivatives (progesterone, retro-progesterone, 19-norprogesterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone); gonane and 19-nortestosterone derivatives (norethisterone, , desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate); a spironolactone derivative. Biological potency of progestogens varies depending on the end-point measured, usually ovulation inhibition and endometrial transformation; with both these tests, the most active compounds are all gonane derivatives, with a potency over a 100 times that of the natural hormone. When administered in adequate doses, a progestin inhibits fertility by inhibiting ovulation. This action is mainly exerted at the hypothalamic level where, physiologically, progesterone decreases the number of LH pulses. When progestogens are delivered directly to the uterine cavity, their action seems to be purely local. It has been amply proven that--even when administered in doses that do not constantly inhibit ovulation--a progestin can still remain effective as a contraceptive by acting at the level of the cervical mucus and, at least in part, of the endometrium. Progestogens utilized today differ largely in their pharmacokinetics. In general, after intake, these compounds are rapidly absorbed and distributed so that peak serum concentrations are reached between 1 and 4 h. Third-generation progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate) have common characteristics: a higher affinity for progesterone receptors than their predecessors, a lower affinity for androgen receptors, a higher selectivity of action, a higher central inhibitory activity, a higher potency at the level of the endometrium, and an overall metabolic neutrality, in terms of effects on  and carbohydrate . In general, progestins can induce two types of adverse effects: changes in  and bleeding irregularities. Whereas the newer compounds seem to have overcome the first of these adverse effects, the second remains untouched: to this day, proper cycle control can only be achieved with combined hormonal contraceptives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1832625>Characteristics of the new progestogens in combination oral contraceptives.</a></h2><p>This review details the characteristic features of three new progestogens which soon will be available in low-dose combination oral contraceptive agents in the United States. Available data suggest that desogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate are extremely potent progestogens with few androgenic side effects. The smaller changes in lipids induced by these progestogens seem to confer some advantage to the use of preparations containing one of these agents. Whether this advantage is also present clinically remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2142577>Effects of three combined oral contraceptive preparations containing desogestrel plus ethinyl estradiol on  in comparison with two  preparations.</a></h2><p>The effects of three different desogestrel-containing combined oral contraceptive preparations on  were compared with those of two  preparations.

The effects of these preparations were assessed on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I to apolipoprotein B after 3 months of treatment, and the percentage changes with regard to pretreatment were calculated. The monophasic desogestrel (150/30) and biphasic desogestrel preparations induced higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels than did their -containing counterparts. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased in monophasic  and clearly decreased in the lowest ethinyl estradiol-containing monophasic desogestrel (150/20) and biphasic desogestrel preparations. Apolipoprotein B increased in all preparations. The antiatherogenic indexes (ratios of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I to apolipoprotein B were higher for monophasic desogestrel (150/30) and biphasic desogestrel than for comparable -containing preparations.

The subjects comprised 58 women randomly allocated to two treatment groups (29 each): norethisterone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 micrograms (NET/EE) or  150 micrograms/ethinyl estradiol 30 micrograms (LNG/EE) and a control group of 23 women using intra-uterine devices (IUD). Blood samples were taken on admission and at 3 and 12 months after pills or insertion of IUDs. Fasting glucose levels were decreased while 2h glucose and triglyceride were increased throughout the treatment period in NET/EE group [corrected]. LNG/EE group only showed significant increase of 2h glucose at 12 months and decrease of LDL cholesterol at 3 months while total cholesterol was significantly suppressed at 3 and 12 months [corrected]. The atherogenic index, LDL/HDL cholesterol was significantly reduced by 12 months. Both groups had no change in hemoglobin, hematocrit and total protein levels but alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (SGOT) were suppressed. While NET/EE suppressed albumin significantly, this was not observed with LNG/EE group. However, these differences observed with use of each pill preparations, were not so obvious between treatment groups and control. Changes in total, HDL and LDL cholesterol and SGOT were not significantly different than the IUD group. Furthermore, except for 2h glucose, there was no increase in the number of abnormal parameters after treatment.

Four groups composed of 25 volunteers each (mean age 26.1 +/- 4.5 years; body mass index 21.9 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2)) were treated for six cycles with monophasic combinations containing 21 tablets with either 30 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) + 2 mg dienogest (DNG) (30 EE/DNG), 20 microg EE + 2 mg DNG (20 EE/DNG), 10 microg EE + 2 mg estradiol valerate (EV) + 2 mg DNG (EE/EV/DNG), or 20 microg EE + 100 microg  (LNG; EE/LNG). The study was completed by 91 women. Blood samples were taken by venipuncture after at least 12 h fasting on Days 21-26 of the control cycle and Days 18-21 of the first, third, and sixth treatment cycle. There were clear differences between the effects of EE/LNG and the formulations containing estrogens and DNG. Although EE/LNG did not change the triglycerides levels, a significant increase was observed during treatment with the DNG-containing preparations. Although EE/LNG significantly reduced HDL-CH and HDL(2)-CH, there was a nonsignificant increase with the DNG-containing OCs. No change was observed in the levels of HDL(3)-CH. A significant rise in apolipoprotein A1 occurred during intake with the three DNG-containing formulations, but not with EE/LNG. In contrast to the women treated with combinations of estrogens and DNG, apolipoprotein B rose significantly in the women in the EE/LNG group. Lipoprotein (a) was significantly reduced by 30 EE/DNG and EE/LNG and remained unaltered with 20 EE/DNG and EE/EV/DNG. Altogether, the changes in  caused by the DNG-containing formulations appeared to be more favorable than those observed with EE/LNG. In OCs with DNG, the EE dose does not seem to play a major role with respect to the effect on lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29400073>Oral hormonal therapy with ethinylestradiol- improves insulin resistance, obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 independent of circulating mineralocorticoid in estrogen-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>Estrogen deficiency has been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases , and recent clinical trials of standard formulations of hormonal therapies have not demonstrated consistent beneficial effects. Estrogen-progestin therapy has been used as exogenous estrogen to normalize depressed estrogen level during menopause. Ovariectomized rodents mimic an estrogen-deficient state in that they develop cardiometabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance (IR). We therefore hypothesized that hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptive steroids, ethinylestradiol- (EEL), improves IR, obesity, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through reduction of circulating mineralocorticoid in ovariectomized rats. Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (SHM) and ovariectomized (OVX) rats were treated with or without EEL (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ) daily for 8 weeks. Results showed that OVX or SHM + EEL treated rats had increased HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of IR), 1 h postload glucose, HOMA-β, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL cholesterol, TG/HDL cholesterol, plasma insulin, GSK-3, corticosterone, and aldosterone. On the other hand, OVX + EEL treatment ameliorated all these effects except that of aldosterone. Taken together, the results demonstrate that oral hormonal replacement with EEL improves IR and pancreatic β-cell function and suppresses GSK-3 and glucocorticoid independent of circulating aldosterone, suggesting a positive cardiometabolic effect of oral EEL therapy in estrogen-deficient rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31308416>Oral contraceptive use increases risk of inflammatory and coagulatory disorders in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: An observational study.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a multispectral disorder requiring lifelong management. Its pathophysiology is still being explored which makes its treatment options restrained. Present study explores impact of oral contraceptive mode of treatment on metabolic, hormonal, inflammation and coagulation profile of PCOS women. 50 subjects diagnosed with Rotterdam criteria receiving no drug treatment served as controls whereas 50 subjects receiving only OCPs (Ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg,  0.15 mg) as a mode of treatment at least for six-months served as cases. Ferriman-Gallwey score and hormonal profile improved on OCP treatment. However, parameters like weight, Body mass index, waist-hip ratio, Oral glucose tolerance test,  profile, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, interleukin1β, visfatin, resistin, tissue factor, PT and APTT showed considerable derangements in OCP group. All above parameters are associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary vascular disease, cancers, hypercoagulable state, venous thromboembolism and thrombotic events. Long-term use of OCPs needs to be considered carefully for PCOS patients who are already burdened with associated risk factors. This study was conducted in a region where women do not have much access to high-end screening and diagnostic facilities that further exacerbates their clinical outcomes. Large scale, long-term studies need to be designed to further evaluate safety use of OCPs in PCOS women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2655452> and lipoprotein changes in women taking low-dose, triphasic oral contraceptives: a controlled, comparative, 12-month clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Effects on /lipoprotein  of two triphasic oral contraceptives, Triphasil (ethinyl estradiol/) and Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 (ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone) were compared in a 12-month controlled, prospective clinical trial. The data indicate that use of both estrogen-progestin preparations were accompanied by increases in cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein3 cholesterol, apolipoproteins A1 and B, and triglycerides. Also observed were a decline in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and greater decreases in high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels; the latter were below the lower limits of laboratory's reference range. All other changes remained within clinically acceptable limits. There were no statistically significant differences between the test preparations, suggesting that the impact on  of the triphasic preparations Triphasil and Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 are similar and, given the dynamic balance between the various fractions, are unlikely to impart an adverse cardiovascular risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21814535>Hormonal contraception--what kind, when, and for whom?</a></h2><p>In Germany today, one-third of the 20 million women of child-bearing age use combined oral contraceptives (COCs). In this article, we summarize the current knowledge of the mode of action, wanted and unwanted side effects, and long-term risks of COCs. The  intrauterine device (IUD) and long-acting injectable or implantable monophasic progestogen preparations offer comparable contraceptive efficacy to COCs. Nonetheless, they are less frequently used in Germany than COCs, because of their propensity to cause breakthrough bleeding.Selective review of the literature.COCs suppress gonadotropin secretion and thereby inhibit follicular maturation and ovulation. Their correct use is associated with 0.3 pregnancies per 100 women per year, their typical use, with 1 pregnancy per 100 women per year (Pearl index). COCs have effects on the cardiovascular and hemostatic systems as well as on  and carbohydrate . When given in the presence of specific risk factors, they significantly increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and thromboembolism. Women with persistent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection who take COCs are at increased risk of developing invasive cervical cancer. On the other hand, COCs lower the cumulative incidence of endometrial and ovarian cancer by 30% to 50%, and that of colorectal cancer by 20% to 30%. Other malignancies seem to be unaffected by COC use.As long as personal and familial risk factors are carefully considered, COCs constitute a safe, reversible, and well-tolerated method of contraception.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12318530>A comparison of  implants with depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate injections for contraception.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9227183>The effect of oral contraceptive agents on the basal metabolic rate of young women.</a></h2><p>The use of oral contraceptive agents by women may be a factor that contributes to the observed inter-individual variability in the BMR. We, therefore, measured the BMR, body build and composition in two groups of young women and also assessed their self-reported level of physical activity. One group had been using oral contraceptive agents for a period of 6 months or more (OCA, n 24), while the other group had never used oral contraceptives (NOCA, n 22). There were no significant differences in age, body build or composition. The absolute BMR in the groups were not significantly different when compared using an unpaired t test (OCA: 5841 (SD 471) v. NOCA: 5633 (SD 615) kJ/d). However, using an analysis of covariance, with either body weight or a combination of  and  free mass as covariates, the OCA group had a BMR almost 5% higher than that of the NOCA group (OCA: 5871 v. NOCA: 5601 kJ/d; P = 0.002). When those subjects with high self-reported levels of physical activity were excluded, the difference in BMR between the two groups persisted (P = 0.001). An ANOVA of oral contraceptives use and phase of menstrual cycle showed significant differences in BMR with use of oral contraceptives (P = 0.004) but no difference in BMR between phases of the menstrual cycle. In conclusion, the use of oral contraceptive agents deserves consideration when conducting and analysing data from studies on energy  in young women, as it results in a significantly higher BMR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1623718>Effect of Norplant-2 rods on liver,  and carbohydrate .</a></h2><p>The effect of Norplant-2 rods on liver,  and carbohydrate  was evaluated in 100 women using Norplant-2 rods. Besides a significant increase in serum bilirubin, there was no other obvious evidence to suggest any possible hepatocellular dysfunction with the use of Norplant-2 rods. As regards , decreases in total triglycerides, cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were initially seen. These parameters returned to their preinsertion mean at the end of five years. As a result, the value of the HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol - HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios remained around their preinsertion value at the end of five years. All this appears to indicate that the use of Norplant-2 rods is not directly contributory to cardiovascular risk.

A group of 177 Norplant implants acceptors was recruited in five centers (Bangkok, Jakarta, Mexico City, Singapore, and Stockholm) and monitored during one baseline menstrual cycle and 3, 5, 11, 16, and 22 months after implant insertion. They were compared with a group of 174 copper intrauterine (IUD) device users who had blood sampling performed at comparable time points.  changes were greatest 3 months after implant insertion and a slow reversal of these trends towards baseline was observed during the next 19 months. The main changes observed at 3 months were a 10% drop in total cholesterol, and an 11% drop in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels, together with a 19% decline in serum triglycerides. Variations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were not significantly different from those observed in the group of IUD users. There was consistency in these findings between centers in that the changes were in the same direction but of different magnitude in different centers. It is concluded that  changes induced by Norplant implants will probably not affect the risk of atherosclerotic disease in women who use this contraceptive method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8545853>Molecular interactions of  and its 5 alpha-reduced derivative with androgen receptors in hamster flanking organs.</a></h2><p>The 5 alpha-reduction of  (LNG) as well as its binding capacity to the androgen receptors of the hamster flank organ were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of LNG and its 5 alpha-reduced metabolite in the flank organ test and on [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipids by this tissue were determined. Homogenates from female hamster flank organs were incubated in the presence of [3H]LNG at pH 7.4. The radioactive 5 alpha-LNG metabolite was isolated and its purity was assessed. Competition experiments for androgen binding receptors were carried out with 1.38 nM [3H-7 alpha-17 alpha]dimethyl-19- nortestosterone (DMNT), Kd, plus a range of increasing concentrations of the different unlabeled steroid hormones. The flank organ test was performed in vivo, and [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipids was determined under organ culture conditions. The 5 alpha-LNG had the same binding capacity to androgen receptors (AR) as LNG in male flank organs. The flank organ test demonstrated that 5 alpha-LNG activity was similar to that observed for  and testosterone (T) on gonadectomized male hamster flank organs. Topical applications of LNG or 5 alpha-LNG increased [U-14C]glucose incorporation into lipids in a way similar to that of T. The overall data indicate that LNG and 5 alpha-LNG produced androgenic activity in the  pathway of male flank organs, and that 5 alpha-reduction is not essential for the LNG effect on this tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8862497>The role of triphasic  in oral contraception: a review of metabolic and hemostatic effects.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies suggesting a possible association between the use of combined oral contraceptives and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease have led to extensive investigations into the effect of oral contraceptives on  and carbohydrate , and on hemostasis. Since this association was originally suggested, the steroid dose in oral contraceptives has been significantly reduced and new progestogens have been developed. Also, triphasic formulations have been introduced which offer a well-balanced estrogen/progestogen ratio, allowing a further reduction in the progestogen dose per cycle, and thus helping to minimize unwanted metabolic and hemostatic effects. The metabolic interactions of triphasic , the first triphasic formulation to be introduced, have received particular attention.  appears to be largely unaffected by triphasic , most studies reporting no significant change in high- (HDL-C) or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Several studies have reported a decrease in the lipoprotein subfraction HDL2-C levels, but in most cases measurements of the LDL-C/HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1/B ratios reveal no clinically significant effects. Concerning lipids, most studies suggest that triphasic  has less metabolic impact than the monophasic formulation. In common with all currently available oral contraceptives, triphasic  appears to have some effect on carbohydrate . The study results vary, however; some investigators have found an impairment of glucose tolerance, whereas others have not detected any significant effect. Compared with  and carbohydrate , fewer studies have investigated the effect of triphasic  on hemostasis. In common with all estrogen-containing oral contraceptives,  appears to stimulate some procoagulant activity, elevating the levels of factors VII and X, and fibrinogen. However, the effect of triphasic  appears to be balanced, with most studies reporting a corresponding increase in anti-coagulant-fibrinolytic activity. Although most of the studies reviewed here reported some statistically significant metabolic interactions, many authors comment that the changes are probably not clinically relevant in terms of an altered risk of cardiovascular disease. The true risk of vascular disease associated with modern low-dose oral contraceptives remains to be confirmed when sufficient epidemiological data eventually become available.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12065173>Efficacy and safety of oral and transdermal hormonal replacement treatment containing .</a></h2><p>The oral combined formulation of  with estradiol valerate (LNG+EV) has demonstrated to be effective on some postmenopausal symptoms.

The primary variables were the mean intraindividual relative changes from baseline to cycle 7 in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Changes in other  parameters, haemostatic parameters, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), carbohydrate  parameters, blood pressure and body weight were also assessed.Mean ± SD HDL cholesterol increased by 7.9% ± 21.8% with E(2)V/DNG and decreased by 2.3% ± 14.4% with EE/LNG. Mean ± SD LDL cholesterol decreased by 6.5% ± 15.9% with E(2)V/DNG and by 3.0% ± 17.4% with EE/LNG.

A wide variety of contraceptives are available for these women. However, hormonal contraceptives might influence carbohydrate and lipid  and increase micro- and macrovascular complications, so caution in selecting a contraceptive method is required.To investigate whether progestogen-only, combined estrogen and progestogen or non-hormonal contraceptives differ in terms of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, in their side effects on carbohydrate and lipid , and in long-term complications such as micro- and macrovascular disease when used in women with diabetes mellitus.The search was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, WorldCat, ECO, ArticleFirst, the Science Citation Index, the British Library Inside, and reference lists of relevant articles. The last search was performed in January 2013. In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies.Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that studied women with diabetes mellitus comparing: 1. hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives; 2. progestogen-only versus estrogen and progestogen contraceptives; 3. contraceptives containing < 50 µg estrogen versus contraceptives containing ≥ 50 µg estrogen; and 4. contraceptives containing first-, second- and third-generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. The principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness, diabetes control, lipid  and micro- and macrovascular complications.Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts identified from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third review author. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta-analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.Four randomised controlled trials were included. No unintended pregnancies were reported during the study periods. Only one trial was of good methodological quality. It compared the influence of a -releasing intrauterine device (IUD) versus a copper IUD on carbohydrate  in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. No significant difference was found between the two groups. The other three trials were of limited methodological quality. Two compared progestogen-only pills with different estrogen and progestogen combinations, and one also included the -releasing IUD and copper IUD. The trials reported that blood glucose levels remained stable during treatment with most regimens. Only high-dose combined oral contraceptives and 30 µg ethinylestradiol + 75 µg gestodene were identified as slightly impairing glucose homeostasis. The three studies found conflicting results regarding lipid . Some combined oral contraceptives appeared to have a minor adverse effect while others appeared to slightly improve lipid . The copper IUD and progestogen-only oral contraceptives also slightly improved lipid  and no influence was seen while using the levonorgestel-releasing IUD. Only one study reported on micro- and macrovascular complications. It observed no signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances, however study duration was short. Only minor adverse effects were reported in two studies.The four included randomised controlled trials in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether progestogen-only and combined contraceptives differ from non-hormonal contraceptives in diabetes control, lipid  and complications. Three of the four studies were of limited methodological quality, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described surrogate outcomes. Ideally, an adequately reported, high-quality randomised controlled trial analysing both intermediate outcomes (that is glucose and lipid ) and true clinical endpoints (micro- and macrovascular disease) in users of combined, progestogen-only and non-hormonal contraceptives should be conducted. However, due to the low incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease and accordingly the large sample size and long follow-up period needed to observe differences in risk, a randomised controlled trial might not be the ideal design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1591919> in Norplant-2 users--a two-year follow-up study.

Changes in  caused by oral hormonal contraceptives differ in the various clinical trials; however, most investigators found that serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides increase under the application of OCs. Contrary to this, a decrease of total cholesterol and triglycerides under Norplant-2 use was noted. Furthermore, we found a significant decrease of lipoproteins and apolipoproteins--with the exception of LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein All, which did not show any significant modifications.

The 21-carbon series (pregnane nucleus) includes the corticoids and the true progestins (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate). The 19-carbon series (androstane nucleus) includes all the androgens, among them the progestins used in most oral and parenteral contraceptives. The removal of carbon 19 from testosterone changes the major hormonal effect from androgenic to progestogenic, but these "19-nor" steroids retain varying degrees of androgenic activity. (They can also have limited estrogenic activity, but this is insignificant at the low doses used for contraception.) Some of the 19-nortestosterone progestins are metabolized to other compounds (e.g., norethynodrel, ethynodiol diacetate, and lynestrenol to norethindrone), and some (, desogestrel) are active unchanged. The lingering androgenic effects of 19-nor progestins are dose-related, opposed by estrogen, and are manifested metabolically (e.g., glucose tolerance, lipoprotein synthesis) and symptomatically (e.g., acne, weight gain). The effect of 19-nortestosterones on lipoproteins prompted the development of less androgenic compounds, but the obvious benefit of the new progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate) is a reduction in the symptoms associated with the androgenicity of the older compounds. Mitigation of androgenic effects on lipoprotein and carbohydrate  could have long-term benefits, especially for women who are at risk of arteriosclerotic vascular disease; however, these effects remain to be epidemiologically demonstrated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8222475>Contraception in the diabetic woman.</a></h2><p>Contraceptive prescription in women with current diabetes, type I or II, and in women with previous gestational diabetes must be highly effective and take into account the metabolic effects and risks particular to diabetes.

However, we have limited information about the effects on women at high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes due to being overweight and obese.To evaluate the effects of second and third generation contraceptive pills on  and carbohydrate  in overweight and obese women.This triple-blind controlled trial was performed on 137 healthy women aged 18 - 40 years with a body mass index of 25-34.9 (kg/m) who were referred to health centers in Tabriz, Iran from 2014 to 2015. The women were randomly divided into groups who were to take 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg  (EE/LGN) (n = 69) or 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol/150 mcg desogestrel (EE/DSG) (n = 68) with an allocation ratio of 1: 1 for three cycles. As primary outcomes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were assessed; total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (2-hour 75-g OGTT) were assessed as secondary outcomes.The differences in  and carbohydrate parameters were not significant between the two groups, except for HDL-C (Adjusted MD (CI95%) = 7.00 (2.98 to 11.02)). HDL-C decreased with EE/LGN (P = 0.016) and increased with EE/DSG (P = 0.004). LDL-C and TC increased in both groups, whereas TG increased only with EE/DSG (P < 0.05). Compared with the baseline, FPG levels did not differ significantly in both groups, but EE/DSG increased 2-hour 75-g OGTT (P = 0.010).We observed no significant differences between the two groups in  and carbohydrate , except for HDL-C. Considering the importance of overweight and obese women's health, studies with longer follow-up periods are recommended in this respect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16723306>Contraception in perimenopausal women with diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and intrauterine devices (IUDs) on carbohydrate and  and hemostasis in perimenopausal diabetic women.The open randomized study included a total of 113 diabetic women using COCs with different estrogen/progestogen profiles - ethinylestradiol (EE) 20 microg/desogestrel 150 microg, EE 30 microg/desogestrel 150 microg and EE 30 microg/gestodene 75 microg - and -releasing or copper IUDs. Average daily insulin requirements, levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the state of coagulation hemostatis and fibrinolytic activity were determined at baseline and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of contraception. The control group was composed of 40 age-matched diabetic women who did not use any methods of contraception.Neither COCs nor IUDs influenced glycosylated hemoglobin and had little or no influence on the elevation in the requirements for insulin preparations. The majority of the preparations did not exert any unfavorable effect on the blood  profile. Taking COCs was accompanied by increased intravascular activation of blood platelets and to a lesser degree by alterations in parameters of hemostatic homeostasis. The use of IUDs had a neutral effect on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis systems.Comparing  levels and hemostatic variables as a function of glycosylated hemoglobin level, we conclude that diabetes control has greater influence on these parameters than the type and dose of steroids involved in the contraceptive devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11779584>Triphasic oral contraceptives: review and comparison of various regimens.</a></h2><p>To review and compare the risk-benefit profile of triphasic oral contraceptives with that of low-dose monophasic oral contraceptives.Literature on currently marketed triphasics and monophasics.Healthy women of reproductive age.Comparison of the rationale for development, composition, mechanism, efficacy, menstrual cycle control, side effects, health benefits, and risk-benefit profile.All triphasics contain ethinyl estradiol (0.025-0.040 mg/d) and one of several progestins in doses (0.05-1.0 mg/d) related to their relative potencies, which are substantially lower overall (total dose) than those in monophasics. The triphasics are highly efficacious. In general, menstrual cycle control and side effects are similar in both types, but triphasics containing the newer progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate) have better cycle control and a reduced incidence of androgenic side effects compared with those with norethindrone or .

In this study we measured the urinary excretion of the metabolites of prostacyclin [6-keto-prostaglandin F 1 alpha(6-keto) and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (dinor)] and of thromboxane A2 [thromboxane B2 (TxB2)] as well as serum HDL- and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations before and during DG and LN administration alone or in combination with ethinyl estradiol (EE) in 26 women. Before the trial, urinary dinor excretion correlated with serum total HDL cholesterol (r = 0.499; P less than 0.01) and HDL2 cholesterol levels (r = 0.668; P less than 0.001; n = 26). Administration of DG (150 micrograms/day; 14 women) or LN (150 micrograms/day; 12 women) for 2 weeks caused no changes in the excretion of these prostanoids, but LN administration decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels. After that, the women underwent a monophasic regimen of 150 micrograms DG or LN plus 30 micrograms EE for 3 months and thereafter polyphasic regimens of the same steroids for a further 3 months. The DG-containing pills increased urinary dinor excretion by 25-40%, but caused no changes in 6-keto and TxB2 excretion, as measured on days 19-21 of the cycles. LN-containing pills reduced urinary 6-keto excretion by 22% at the end of polyphasic treatment, but caused no changes in dinor and TxB2 output. DG plus EE, but not LN plus EE, increased serum total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations by a maximum of 25%. Thus, a DG plus EE combination may stimulate PGI2 synthesis by increasing the levels of HDL/HDL2.

Review.</a></h2><p>Considerable progress has been made in learning about the physiology and biochemistry of the sebaceous glands and several of the diseases that affect this component of the skin. Of these diseases, acne has particular importance. It is associated with adolescence, and because of the hormonal changes that take place in this stage, when it is severe it can cause depression. Moreover, in a considerable proportion of acne sufferers both adolescent and adult, it can produce tumors and deformation of the sebaceous glands. This seriously affects the sufferers to the point where it may limit their professional activities because they do not want to be seen in public. Several important issues from classic studies on the sebaceous gland will be reviewed in this document to report the state of the art of current treatments for the pathology of these glands. The sebaceous gland is an intracrine organ, capable of synthesizing and metabolizing different steroidal hormones. The role of each of the enzymes involved in these processes of the skin will be analyzed. The presence of different hormone receptors in the scientific literature will be also reviewed, due to the role of the sebaceous gland in lipogenesis at different ages. We also describe the mechanism of action of androgens and progestins in relation to coregulators recruited for lipogenesis in this gland. We propose several new steroidal compounds based on their mechanism of action to block lipogenesis in the sebaceous glands. These molecules offer potential for new treatment options for skin diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10337871>Comparison of the effects of triphasic oral contraceptives with desogestrel or  on apolipoprotein A-I-containing high-density lipoprotein particles.</a></h2><p>Recent observations suggest that the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with both the level and composition of the two major populations of apolipoprotein (apo)-defined high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles: those containing both apo A-I and apo A-II [Lp(AI,AII)] and those containing apo A-I without apo A-II [Lp(AI)]. While sex hormones are known to affect HDL, their influence on these apo-defined HDL particles is not known. We have determined the effects of two triphasic oral contraceptive (OC) formulations on these HDL particles in healthy normolipidemic women aged 21 to 35 years. The formulations contain comparable quantities of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and either desogestrel (DG), a minimally androgenic progestin, or  (LN), a more androgenic progestin.  and lipoprotein levels were measured during the third week of the normal menstrual cycle and the sixth month of OC use. The DG/EE formulation significantly increased total cholesterol (C) 15%, triglyceride (TG) 99%, phospholipid (PL) 17%, apo A-I 28%, apo A-II 34%, apo B 21%, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) 238%, HDL-C 20%, and HDL3-C 28% (P < .02 to .005, n = 11), but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The LN/EE formulation also increased total C 15%, TG 33%, apo A-I 15%, HDL3-C 21% (P < .05, n = 10), apo B 30% (P < .005), and, additionally, LDL-C 19% (P < .05). Both formulations increased Lp(AI,AII) (DG/EE, 34%, P < .005; LN/EE, 24%, P < .01). These changes reflected comparable increases of small (7.0 to 8.2 nm) and medium (8.2 to 9.2 nm) particles in the LN/EE group and a predominant increase of medium-sized particles in the DG/EE group. Also, in the LN/EE group but not the DG/EE group, there were fewer large (9.2 to 11.2 nm) particles. Lp(AI) increased only in the DG/EE group (25%, P = .075) and was due to the presence of more large particles. The level of Lp(AI) did not change in the LN/EE group, but the /A-I ratio of these particles was lower (P = .012) and there were more small particles. Thus, triphasic OC formulations with progestins of different androgenicity had different effects on VLDL, LDL, and the level and composition of HDL particles with and without apo A-II, possibly reflecting estrogen/progestin/androgen balance. Estrogen dominance increases both Lp(AI,AII) and Lp(AI) and favors large Lp(AI) particles, while progestin/androgen dominance increases only Lp(AI,AII) and favors small particles. Because of the importance of HDL in the arterial wall physiology, OC formulations with different estrogen and progestin content may affect arterial wall health to a different extent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8449015>Effects of Norplant contraceptive subdermal implants on serum lipids and lipoproteins.</a></h2><p>A longitudinal, short-term study of women using NORPLANT ( implants) was conducted. Cholesterol content of the major lipoproteins along with total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in fasting blood samples from 32 women volunteers. Results for lipids and lipoproteins determined 6 and 12 months post-NORPLANT insertion were compared with values obtained for samples taken just before implantation. Total serum triglycerides was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) from 1.14 +/- 0.44mmol/l (mean +/- SD) to 0.89 +/- 0.25mmol/l at six and to 0.89 +/- 0.34mmol/l at twelve months post-insertion.

These changes in values from the time of insertion to twelve months, were statistically significant (P < 0.02). As regards lipoprotein fractions, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-chol) exhibited statistically significant reduction (P < 0.001) from 1.38 +/- 0.34 mmol/l to 0.71 +/- 0.30 mmol/l (mean +/- SD) six months post-insertion. Although the value had improved to 1.14 +/- 0.38mmol/l by twelve months, the value was still significantly different from the pre-insertion value.

This was significantly elevated (P < 0.001) at six months to 2.54 +/- 0.48mmol/l (mean +/- SD). The twelve-month post-insertion value of LDL-chol (2.02 +/- 0.79) was similar to the pre-insertion value.

No significant difference was observed in PAI-1 levels of the two groups; however, significant decrease in FVIII levels was observed in OCP group as compared to drug-naïve group. PAI-1 levels of OCP group correlated positively with blood glucose two hours, triglycerides and insulin two hours, while FVIII levels of OCP group correlated negatively with fasting insulin and homoeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance.OCPs use has differential effect on pro-coagulant markers among women with PCOS.

An open-label comparative clinical trial was conducted with 4,234 healthy women using comparative clinical trial was conducted with 4,234 healthy women using triphasic  (LUG)/EE and NGM/EE through a total of 22,312 menstrual cycles. Contraceptive (LUG)/EE and NGM/EE through a total of 22,312 menstrual cycles. Contraceptive efficacy was excellent with both preparations, with no statistically significant between-regimen differences in pregnancy rates. The theoretical Pearl index was the NGM/EE triphasic, and 0.34 for the LNG/EE triphasic. Adverse experiences in groups were typical of those that may occur among women taking low-dose OC agents. was similar with the two preparations: 8.6% for the NGM/EE triphasic and 6.8% for the LNG/EE triphasic. In a separate mechanism of action study, specific endocrine parameters were investigated in 20 subjects using the NGM/EE triphasic for 4 cycles. Ovulation suppression was demonstrated in statistically significant decreases from pretreatment values in serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, progesterone, and estradiol. Significant on-treatment increases in serum levels of sex hormone binding globulin evidenced minimal androgenicity. All hormonal values returned to or toward normal in the post-treatment cycle. The study results support those obtained in large noncomparative studies of the NGM/EE triphasic. This phased-dose combination suppresses ovulation and is a very effective, minimally androgenic contraceptive agent with a good safety profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2960242>New progestogens in oral contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The aim of using new synthetic progestogens (gestodene and norgestimate) in oral hormonal contraceptives is to find a combination that has a more beneficial effect on  and endometrium than presently available formulations. Our studies with low-dose pills containing 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/150 micrograms  or 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/150 micrograms desogestrel compared with the new pills with 35 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/250 micrograms norgestimate or 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol/75 micrograms gestodene revealed no significant alterations of serum glucose after glucose loading.

Studies of the  showed that depending on the type and estrogen combination, progestogens have different effects on . The new progestogens seem to have a more pronounced effect on triglycerides, whereas total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol remain almost unchanged. In general, it could be shown that low-dose oral contraceptives have little impact on . Studies with low-dose monophasic preparations, including the new formulations, reveal only a low effect on blood coagulation. According to our and other data on the new progestogens in oral contraceptives available so far, it can be expected that such low-dose monophasic and triphasic combination pills will be beneficial during longtime use with respect to side effects on the cardiovascular system and control of the menstrual cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8237578>Evaluation of liver function and  following Norplant-2 rods removal.</a></h2><p>The effect of Norplant-2 rods on liver function and  was evaluated in 100 Singaporean women.

Combined oral contraceptive (COC) treatment is associated with impaired glucose and  but the mechanisms are elusive. We therefore, hypothesized that DPP-4 inhibition ameliorates COC-induced glucose dysregulation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation through adenosine deaminase (ADA) /xanthine oxidase (XO) /uric acid-dependent pathway. Female Wistar rats received (po) vehicle and COC (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol plus 5.0 μg ; po) with or without DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin; 100 mg/kg; po) for 8 weeks (n = 6/group). Glucose dysmetabolism was assessed by elevated fasting blood glucose, impaired oral glucose tolerance test and homeostatic model assessment of IR. Treatment with COC led to increased plasma fasting glucose, triglyceride-glucose index, 1-h postload glucose response, insulin, free fatty acid, IR and impaired glucose tolerance. COC treatment also resulted in increased plasma and hepatic TG, TG/HDL-cholesterol ratio, malondialdehyde, uric acid (plasma; 25.2 ± 0.6 mg/dl; hepatic 128.9 ± 8.0 mg/100 mg tissue), lactate dehydrogenase, DPP-4, ADA and XO (plasma;10.5 ± 1.1 U/L; hepatic 21.2 ± 1.4 U/g protein) activities. Likewise, COC led to reduction in nitric oxide level. However, DPP-4 inhibition significantly ameliorated these alterations induced by COC treatment through suppression of uric acid (plasma; 15.1 ± 1.0 mg/dl, hepatic; 75.6 ± 5.0 mg/100 mg tissue), XO (plasma; 4.1 ± 0.9 U/L, hepatic; 8.7 ± 0.4 U/g protein), ADA and DPP-4 activities suggesting their involvement in glucose dysregulation and hepatic TG accumulation induced by COC treatment. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition would impact positively on cardiometabolic disorders, at least in part, through XO, ADA and uric acid suppression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and stroke are serious disorders with a considerable risk of mortality. Because worldwide over 100 million women use oral contraceptives, issues of drug safety are of great importance. The risk of venous thrombosis during low-dose oral contraceptive use is three- to sixfold increased compared with that of nonusers. The association is not only attributed to the estrogen component of the pill: the risk is twice as high for desogestrel and gestodene (third generation) containing oral contraceptives as for  (second generation) containing oral contraceptives. The risk of venous thrombosis is highest in the first year of use and in women with genetic or acquired risk factors for thrombosis. Both venous or arterial thrombosis are unrelated to duration of use or past use of combined oral contraceptives. The risk of myocardial infarction and stroke during low-dose oral contraceptive use is two- to fivefold increased relative to that of nonusers. The risk of arterial thrombosis induced by oral contraceptive use is more pronounced in smokers and women with hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. All types of thrombosis have strongly age-dependent incidences, and therefore in absolute figures the risks and effects of risk factors increase with age. The lowering of the estrogen dose in combined oral contraceptives from 50 microg to 20-30 microg in the last decade did not clearly reduce the risk of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. For stroke and peripheral arterial disease no difference in risk was found between second and third generation oral contraceptives. For myocardial infarction study results are conflicting, and a small benefit of third- over second-generation oral contraceptives cannot be ruled out. However, this is unlikely to counterbalance the adverse effect of third generation contraceptives on venous thrombosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15104206>Impact of long-term hormone replacement therapy on in vivo and in vitro markers of  oxidation.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen has been suggested to inhibit oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in vitro, but progestins may oppose this effect. We studied whether estrogen HRT and combined HRT with estrogen and progestin differ in their ability to resist in vivo and in vitro oxidation of lipids. Study group included 15 women on oestradiol valerate (mean age 56 years, treatment duration 10.5 years) and 15 women on combined HRT with oestradiol valerate and  (mean age 58 years, treatment duration 11.3 years). In addition to  and apolipoprotein concentrations, the lagtime of LDL to oxidation, the rate of the propagation phase and the maximum concentration of conjugated dienes were recorded as indices of LDL susceptibility to copper-induced oxidation in vitro. As an in vivo marker of oxidative stress we measured 24-h excretion of urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha). All measurements were done after long-term HRT (baseline), after 4 weeks pause and again 3 weeks after reintroduction of HRT. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI concentrations were significantly higher and LDL to HDL ratio significantly lower after long-term oestradiol valerate therapy than after combined therapy. Simultaneously, the triglyceride and lipoprotein (a) levels were higher in the estrogen group. Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and the level of 8-iso-PGF2alpha were similar in both groups at all measurement points, and treatment group was not a statistically significant determinant of these markers at baseline. According to these results, estrogen and combined HRT do not differ in their abilities to oppose LDL oxidation in vitro or systemic oxidative stress in vivo, but have differential effects on blood lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10601880>Opposing effects of estrogen and progestins on LDL oxidation and vascular wall cytotoxicity: implications for atherogenesis.</a></h2><p>Estrogens are widely regarded as beneficial to arterial wall health. Among the mechanisms of this benefit are antioxidant effects on LDL and the arterial wall. Because progestins oppose the effect of estrogen in several systems, we asked if progestins oppose the antioxidant effect of estrogen. To study this question, LDL and various female sex hormones were incubated alone and combined in the absence or presence of bovine aortic endothelial cells, placental trophoblast, or macrophages, and LDL oxidation and cytotoxicity were quantitated. In the absence of cells, LDL incubated with copper in phosphate-buffered saline enhanced the oxidation of LDL. When 17beta-estradiol was added to this system, an antioxidant effect was observed. Progestins inhibited this protective estrogenic effect. In endothelial cell culture, progestins also opposed the antioxidant effect of estrogen, with the strongest antiestrogenic effect seen with the synthetic progestins,  and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Endothelial cell cytotoxicity was proportional to the enhanced  peroxide formation observed with progestins or estrogen. Similar opposing effects were seen when estrogen and progesterone were added to primary cultures of placental trophoblast or macrophages. Thus, three cell culture systems modeling circulating arterial blood contact with cell surfaces demonstrated opposing effects of estrogens and progestins on LDL oxidation and cell cytotoxicity. These studies are in keeping with published reports that female sex steroids influence LDL oxidation in vivo and consequent arterial wall injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15493951>New progestogens: a review of their effects in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.</a></h2><p>The progestins have different pharmacological properties depending upon the parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone, from which they are derived. Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. In postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, progestins are used in combination with estrogen as hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone-receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesised as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, which have been synthesised in the last 2 decades, may be considered fourth-generation progestins. These include dienogest, drospirenone, Nestorone (Population Council, New York, NY, USA), nomegestrol acetate and trimegestone. The fourth-generation progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone progesterone. Drospirenone differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. Trimegestone and Nestorone are the most potent progestins synthesised to date, followed by two of the older progestins, 3-keto-desogestrel and . The new molecules trimegestone, drospirenone and dienogest also have antiandrogenic activity. Following the publication of the results of the Women's Health Initiative study, the role of progestins in HRT became controversial. Unfortunately, this concern has been directed towards progestins as a class, although striking differences exist among the progestins. Natural progesterone and some of its derivatives, such as the 19-norprogesterone molecules, and the new molecules drospirenone and dienogest are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the  profile. The effects of progestins on breast tissue remain controversial as well. However, depending on the progestin and the duration of application, breast cell differentiation and apoptosis may predominate over proliferation. It is still unclear if the currently available progestins are able to bind specifically to the PR isoforms PR-A or PR-B and whether this is of clinical relevance to breast cell proliferation is also unclear. Although it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on the risk of coronary heart disease or breast cancer in younger postmenopausal women, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large randomised, well controlled clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1826569>The clinical and biochemical effects of two combination oral contraceptive agents.</a></h2><p>A comparison of the effects of two low-dose oral contraceptives on  was undertaken in an open-group comparative design study at the Family Planning Clinic, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. Sixty healthy women aged 18-35 years requesting oral contraception were allocated alternately to use a monophasic oral contraceptive containing 30 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and 150 micrograms desogestrel (Marvelon, group A), or a triphasic oral contraceptive containing 30-40 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and 50-125 micrograms  (Triphasil, group B). The changes in the lipoprotein profile elicited by the two preparations differed significantly. Group A subjects had a much greater triglyceridaemic response (42.4%) than group B (14.6%) and had a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo-A1). In group B, HDL-C decreased and Apo-A1 showed little change. Non-HDL-C (NHDL-C) and Apo-B levels hardly changed in either group. The atherogenic ratios, NHDL-C/HDL-C and Apo-B/Apo-A1 were higher in group B. This study confirmed a significant difference in the response of plasma lipoproteins to the two oral contraceptive preparations. The evidence suggests that the desogestrel-containing oral contraceptive elicits a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile than does the -containing preparation. Although unsupported by direct clinical evidence that changes in the lipoprotein pattern induced by oral contraceptives cause atherosclerosis, these effects should be considered when prescribing oral contraceptives for women who have risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2115298>Metabolic changes during treatment with two different progestogens.</a></h2><p>Two triphasic oral contraceptives containing the same amount of ethinyl estradiol in combination with gestodene or  were compared with respect to contraceptive effect, on  and coagulation. Serum concentrations of gestodene, , ovarian and pituitary hormones, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Thirty-five randomized into two groups receiving either of the preparations. Before treatment and in the third and sixth cycles, blood sample were drawn in the morning while subjects were still in bed to obtain basal conditions. The contraceptive effect and cycle control were good with both preparations, and there were only a few minor side effects. Sex hormone-binding globulin was elevated twofold in the  group and threefold in the gestodene group. The gestodene concentration in serum varied more than the  concentration, but with correction for variations in sex hormone-binding globulin binding, less variability in gestodene and  concentrations were seen. High-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol decreased in the  group but was unchanged in the gestodene group, whereas apolipoprotein A1 increased in the gestodene group but not in the  group. Antithrombin III decreased in the gestodene group but was unchanged in -treated women. Factor VII increased in both groups but more in the gestodene group. We conclude that gestodene has a positive influence on , probably because of its lower androgenicity, and a slightly negative influence on coagulation. The latter, however, probably has no clinical relevance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2576251>The current status of oral contraceptive clinical development in Japan.</a></h2><p>Since the oral contraceptive guideline was issued in April 1987, Japanese pharmaceutical firms have been asking physicians to perform clinical studies of the low-dose OCs. At present, eight products from six companies are under clinical development. Ethinyl estradiol (30-35 micrograms per tablet) as an estrogen component is common to all the test drugs. The progestin component in each OC is norethindrone, , or desogestrel. Phase I clinical studies on small numbers of healthy volunteers showed that they could tolerate the test drugs without any serious complaints. The effects on endocrine systems, including the inhibition of ovulation, were also examined. Pharmacokinetic parameters of active ingredients were comparable to those of Western women, and no substantial difference seemed to exist between Japanese and Western women. As an example, the results of phase I studies of OJK-777 (Ortho-Novum 7/7/7) are mentioned. Phase III clinical studies, which are "open studies," are now under progress with more than 3,000 women. The major objectives are to examine (1) how well the drugs are tolerated, and the dropout rates; (2) the effects on cycle control, especially bleeding patterns; (3) effects on the cardiovascular system, including coagulation and ; (4) effects on hormone secretions. Although some women have been taking the test drugs for more than 12 cycles, overall statistics are not yet available, because the guideline requires long-term administration (for more than 24 cycles). However, some characteristic features observed thus far are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2521321>Comparative metabolic effects of three types of combined oral contraceptive pills in Chinese women.</a></h2><p>The results of a prospective longitudinal controlled study comparing some metabolic effects of a low-dose -ethinyl oestradiol combined oral contraceptive (Microgynon 30), a desogestrel-ethinyl oestradiol-containing pill (Marvelon) and a -ethinyl oestradiol triphasic preparation (Triquilar) after one year of treatment in ethnic Chinese women are presented.

NGM's selectivity results in excellent efficacy, cycle control, and minimal androgenicity when it is combined with ethinyl estradiol (EE). Clinical studies of a monophasic regimen of NGM/EE indicate a positive impact on , revealing an increase in serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with a concomitant and significant decrease in the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Little impact on carbohydrate  was noted. Serum levels of sex hormone binding globulin, an indicator of androgen-estrogen balance, also increased significantly with NGM/EE in accordance with its low androgenic activity. A significant between-regimen difference in SHBG was seen in a comparison study of NGM/EE and LNG/EE triphasic formulations (a mean rise of 68.6% with NGM/EE vs a decrease of 6.1% with LNG/EE). NGM's lack of estrogenicity was evidenced by unchanged prolactin levels and absence of effect on the coagulation system. In a large study of the monophasic formulation in 59,701 women, some improvement in acne was reported as well as minimal weight gain.

Both desogestrel (acting as 3-keto-desogestrel) and norgestimate (acting mainly through ) are prodrugs. While nomegestrol is derived from 19-norprogesterone, the other compounds are 19-nortestosterone derivatives: desogestrel, norgestimate and gestodene belong to the subgroup of 13-ethyl-gonanes with an ethinyl group at C17 alpha, and dienogest represents an estrane (13-methyl-gonane) with a cyanomethyl group at C17 alpha. Both dienogest and nomegestrol have antiandrogenic properties. In proportion to the dose, the highest serum concentrations are observed after intake of gestodene. When combined with ethinylestradiol, gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel accumulate in serum during daily treatment because of slowed-down elimination. This is probably caused both by binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and by inhibition of inactivating enzymes. Dienogest does not accumulate in serum, although at a dose of 2 mg very high serum concentrations of dienogest are reached. The most potent progestogens are gestodene and desogestrel, while the effect of dienogest and nomegestrol on endometrium and cervix is less, even though in a similar range. As the ovulation-inhibiting effect is brought about not only by receptor-mediated interactions but also by a direct inhibition of steroid biosynthesis, dienogest and nomegestrol are much less effective than gestodene, desogestrel and norgestimate. Ethinylated progestogens, particularly gestodene, have been demonstrated to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes. Both gestodene and desogestrel may moderately reduce SHBG levels and counteract the stimulating effect of ethinylestradiol on hepatic serum proteins, while dienogest and nomegestrol have no influence. Compared with progestogens with androgenic properties which may restrict the stimulatory action of ethinylestradiol on haemostatic parameters, the newer progestogens do not seem to be superior with respect to haemostasis. There are no data on the direct effect of the compounds on the arterial and venous vessel wall. Due to the less pronounced antagonism on ethinylestradiol-induced changes in , the newer progestogens appear to be beneficial rather than deleterious, although atherosclerosis was probably not promoted by the older formulations because of the direct effect of ethinylestradiol on the arterial wall. There is no evidence for a lesser impact of the newer progestogens on carbohydrate , which is mostly impaired by the estrogen component in oral contraceptives. Formulations containing the newer progestogens are, however, preferable in patients with hyperandrogenaemia, the symptoms of which may be improved by the suppression of total and free testosterone and an increase in SHBG; an additional beneficial effect of the antiandrogenic properties of dienogest or nomegestrol remains to be proven.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1436906>The new era in oral contraception: pills containing gestodene, norgestimate, and desogestrel.</a></h2><p>The latest advance in the 30-year evolution of oral contraceptives (OCs) is the development of three new progestogens: desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene. These three new agents are derivatives of , a gonane hormone, and have been used to develop pills that provide effective pregnancy prevention at lower doses than oral contraceptives using the older steroids. Desogestrel is a prohormone that must first be metabolized into its biologically active form. Norgestimate is already active, but it will be metabolized in part to . Gestodene is biologically active in its native form. Among the improvements in metabolic parameters seen with this new generation of progestogens are a lack of impact on blood pressure, a balanced effect on coagulation, and a reduced impact on carbohydrate  compared with earlier, higher-dose formulations. The new pills also seem to produce no negative effects on  and lipoprotein biosynthesis, and perhaps even improve the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein. Cycle control with all three progestogens is improved, with much lower incidence of intermenstrual bleeding (IMB). Efficacy is as good as with other OCs. Another benefit of the new low-dose progestogens, however, is the low incidence of minor side effects observed in women using these contraceptives. Low incidences of weight gain, headache, and nausea were reported, and the dropout rate because of side effects was low in both international and US trials. Serious side effects are rarely seen with pills containing the new progestogens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1309944>Two new combinations of estrogen and progestogen for prevention of postmenopausal bone loss: long-term effects on bone, calcium and , climacteric symptoms, and bleeding.</a></h2><p>Bone mass, calcium and , climacteric symptoms, bleeding, blood pressure, and weight changes were studied in 62 healthy postmenopausal women at 3-month intervals throughout 2 years of treatment with continuous estradiol valerate (2 mg) plus cyproterone acetate (1 mg), sequential estradiol valerate (2 mg) plus  (75 micrograms), or placebo. During the 2 years of the study, bone mineral content of the distal and ultradistal regions of the forearm (measured by single-photon absorptiometry) remained unchanged in the hormone groups, whereas bone mineral content at these sites decreased by 5 and 6%, respectively, in the placebo group.

While the newer compounds are related to , their biochemical structure differs. All, however, are strongly progestogenic with respect to ovulation inhibition and are very selective in their affinity for endometrial progesterone receptors. At present, experience with the third-generation combined OCs is relatively limited, and extensive comparative data have yet to be accrued. Nevertheless, these ultra-low-dose compounds appear to be as efficacious as the traditional OCs, while their cycle control may be slightly superior. In addition, the incidence of minor side effects, such as nausea, weight gain, and mastalgia, compares favorably with that of the earlier OCs.

We hypothesized that disruption of glucoregulation and liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation induced by COC use would be abated by valproic acid (VPA) treatment through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. Female Wistar rats aged 9-10 weeks were treated with a combination of estrogen-progestin COC steroids (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg ; p.o.) with or without VPA (100.0 mg/kg; p.o.) daily for 6 weeks. The result shows that the disrupted glucoregulation and associated elevated hepatic ADA activity, plasma and hepatic XO activity, uric acid (UA), TG/HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde induced by COC treatment were attenuated by VPA treatment. However, VPA did not have any effect on plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, ADA, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid. Our results demonstrate that suppression of plasma and hepatic XO activities, along with hepatic ADA activity and UA by VPA treatment, protects against disrupted glucoregulation and increased liver TG by COC independent of elevated corticosteroids. The findings imply that VPA would provide protection against the development of cardiometabolic disorder via inhibition of the ADA/XO/UA-mediated pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2495889>Two-year follow-up of changes in clinical chemistry in Singaporean Norplant-2 rod acceptors: metabolic changes.</a></h2><p>In this longitudinal study involving 100 Singaporean acceptors, the effects of Norplant-2 rods on metabolic function was evaluated. The mean serum bilirubin during the second year remained significantly raised from its preinsertion value (p less than 0.001). Furthermore the total proteins and globulin were still significantly decreased (p less than 0.001). Thus with respect to liver function, the results still indicate possible dysfunction at the end of two years. As regards , the serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol still remained significantly decreased at the end of two years when compared to preinsertion values. The HDL-cholesterol levels which showed no significant change during the first year of use decreased significantly during the second year of use. As a result the HDL-cholesterol/Total cholesterol - HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly and was 12.0% lower than the pre-insertion ratio (p less than 0.01). Similarly the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol increased during the second year of use and was 2.6% higher than its preinsertion ratio. However, this increase was still not statistically significant. As we have not incorporated a simultaneous non-steroid treated control group, the observed changes in  could be attributed to extraneous factors such as diet, exercise or other environmental changes. Nevertheless, the findings at the end of two years, though speculative, still indicate Norplant-2 use to be non-contributory to cardiovascular risk in this population. The use of Norplant-2 was not associated with any significant effect on glucose tolerance after two years of use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8172528>Comparative assessment of the effects of subdermal  implant system and long acting progestogen injection method on .</a></h2><p>In order to compare the effects of two type of long-acting progestogen contraceptive methods with subdermal  (LNG) implants and depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections on , a clinical cohort study was performed by requiring 25 women in each group adopting either LNG implant or DMPA injection method voluntarily. After 6 months of use, serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were determined and compared between the two groups of acceptors. The mean of total cholesterol in LNG implant acceptors was significantly lower than that in DMPA injection acceptors. The mean values of HDL-cholesterol in LNG implant acceptors (41.7 +/- 7.7 mg/dl) and in DMPA injection acceptors (45.0 +/- 9.0 mg/dl) were in the normal range without significant difference between the two groups. The mean value of triglycerides did not differ significantly between LNG implant acceptors (77.6 +/- 25.1 mg/dl) and DMPA injection acceptors (91.0 +/- 30.3 mg/dl). Serum concentrations of  fractions such as HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in LNG implant acceptors were relatively low compared to those in DMPA injection acceptors. Since there was a comparable reduction in both total-and HDL-cholesterol levels in the LNG implant group, the ratio of total-to HDL-cholesterol, which is thought to be a factor in determining the risk of coronary artery disease, remained in the normal range (2 +/- 4.5). This suggests that the use of these two contraceptive methods with progestogens does not alter the risk of development of coronary artery disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8342453>Evaluation of liver function and  following Norplant implant removal.</a></h2><p>A final evaluation of this longitudinal study involving 100 Singaporean women shows that, besides a significantly elevated bilirubin level, there is no other evidence of hepatocellular dysfunction with the use of Norplant implants. The elevated bilirubin levels remained significantly elevated six months after removal of the implant. Despite this, all values of bilirubin remained within the clinical range for the population studies. As regards , total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and total triglycerides continued to remain below the pre-insertion mean at six months post-removal. The HDL-cholesterol showed a significant increase following removal of the implants. As a result, the HDL-cholesterol/(total cholesterol-HDL-cholesterol) ratio continued to remain above 0.200.

In this cross-sectional study, the study groups consisted of control group that represented by 30 healthy married women who were not on any contraceptive mean or any hormonal therapy and had normal menstrual cycles, group two consisted of 30 women who were users of Levonorgesterl 0.15 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle, group three consisted of 30 women who were users of Gestodene 0.075 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle, and group four consisted of 30 women who were users of Drospirenone 3 mg plus Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg as 21 days cycle. One-way analysis of variance followed by LSD post hoc test was used for comparison of variables. P value <0.05 was considered to be significant. The comparison of the studied groups revealed that COCPs containing  plus ethinylestradiol resulted in significantly lower adiponectin level, and significantly higher leptin and resistin levels with more atherogenic lipid profile presented by significantly higher LDL-C, significantly lower HDL-C concentrations, and significantly higher atherogenic index. Formulation containing ethinylestradiol combined with gestodene neither altered adipose tissue function nor showed deleterious effect on lipid panel. Formulation containing ethinylestradiol combined with drospirenone resulted in significantly higher HDL-C and adiponectin concentrations. In conclusion, the uptake of COCPs containing  plus ethinylestradiol is associated with high cardiovascular risk since this formulation showed significantly lower adiponectin concentration, significantly higher leptin, resistin, and atherogenic index as compared to other studied groups. By contrast, the formulations containing ethinylestradiol combined with third generation progestin gestodene or fourth generation progestin drospirenone are associated with low cardiovascular risk since they neither altered adipose tissue function nor impaired lipoprotein  as experienced by their favorable effect on leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, with non-changed atherogenic index, higher HDL-C levels and lower LDL-C levels as compared to  plus ethinylestradiol formulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15871634>Ezetimibe: a review of its , pharmacokinetics and drug interactions.</a></h2><p>Ezetimibe is the first -lowering drug that inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of -soluble nutrients. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised (>80%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and ). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17224852>-releasing intrauterine system as an adjunct to estrogen for the treatment of menopausal symptoms--a review.</a></h2><p>Exogenous estrogen is an effective means of prevention for postmenopausal symptoms. Estrogen treatment should be combined with progesterone in non-hysterectomized women to prevent estrogen-induced malignant transformation of the endometrium. Progesterone supplementation using continuous combined estrogen + progesterone treatment may result in an increased incidence of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. In addition, progesterone supplementation with sequential estrogen + progesterone treatment may cause immediate adverse effects, such as irregular bleeding and spotting, breast congestion, fluid retention, abdominal distention, and a change in  profile. All these effects are related, at least in part, to the progesterone component of the therapy.To avoid these complications, researchers are seeking safer progestational components and different modes of administration.

While estrogens and androgens were previously demonstrated to impact organisms during environmental exposures, progestagens have recently been shown to have strong impacts on aquatic organisms. To gain an understanding of the impacts of these types of chemicals on aquatic species, experiments evaluating the mechanisms of action of progestagen exposure were conducted with the Eastern Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). The objective of this study was to conduct hepatic microarray analysis of male and female G. holbrooki exposed to progestins and anti-progestagens. In addition, we evaluated the ability of , a synthetic progesterone (progestin), to induce anal fin elongation and to determine how anal fin growth is modulated during co-exposures with progesterone and androgen receptor antagonists. Gene expression analyses were conducted on male and female G. holbrooki exposed for 48h to the agonist , the antagonist mifepristone, or a mixture of the two chemicals. Microarray analysis revealed that mifepristone does not act as an anti-progestagen in G. holbrooki in liver tissues, and that  elicits strong effects on the processes of embryo development and lipid transport.  was also demonstrated to induce male secondary sexual characteristic formation in females, and co-exposure of either an androgen or  in the presence of the anti-androgen flutamide prevented anal fin elongation. These results provide indications as to the potential impacts of progestins, including non-target effects such as secondary sexual characteristic formation, and demonstrate the importance of this class of chemicals on aquatic organisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Subjects consumed either a high- or a low- diet for 2 weeks in an open, randomized, crossover study lasting 6 weeks. Investigations were performed at the end of each diet during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.Blood pressure was measured by 24 h ambulatory recording; cardiovascular reactivity was determined by examining blood pressure responses to systemic infusions of noradrenaline and angiotensin II and to the cold pressor test; and carbohydrate  was investigated by an intravenous glucose-tolerance test.Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly higher in women taking oral contraceptive pills compared with non-users on both diets; however, responses of lipoprotein levels to the two diets did not differ between study groups (total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 15 and 17% in oral contraceptive pill users and by 14% each in non-users, on the low- compared with the high- diet). Fasting plasma insulin levels, the insulin-production response to administration of glucose (insulin area under the curve) and resting clinic and night-time systolic blood pressures were all significantly reduced on the low- diet, but only in non-users. Blood pressure responses to noradrenaline and maximal heart rate response to cold were significantly attenuated during the low- diet in oral contraceptive pill users. During the low- diet, resting systolic, 24 h systolic and diastolic blood pressures and insulin area under the curve were all significantly higher for women taking the oral contraceptive pills. Users of these pills also exhibited a greater systolic sensitivity to administration both of noradrenaline and of angiotensin II and had a higher plasma renin activity irrespective of dietary phase.These results confirm that oral contraceptive pills have the potential to cause adverse effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular reactivity and the insulin-production response to administration of glucose and suggest that some of the beneficial effects of a low- diet on these parameters may be negated in women taking oral contraceptive pills.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219852>A multicentre comparative study of serum lipids and lipoproteins in four groups of oral combined contraceptive users and a control group of IUD users.

In culture conditions, a rapid and significant increase of radiolabeled glucose was observed with T. By contrast when LNG was present in the incubation medium, no differences in 14C-U-glucose incorporation were observed when compared with their controls. When T+LNG were added, a similar result to the obtained when using LNG alone was determined. Testosterone increased glycerides and free fatty acids but decreased polar lipids; whereas LNG did not have any effect in the relative proportions of 14C-U-glucose incorporated into the different classes of lipids, when it was compared with their controls.

Unpaired t test and Chi-square test were used for comparison of variables between oral contraceptive users and non-oral contraceptive users.Serum adiponectin and leptin levels were changed in COC consumers. The data obtained for adiponectin in COC consumers (6.6 ± 4.06 μg/ml) were significantly lower (-27.4%, P = 0.004) than control group (9.1 ± 5.09 μg/ml). The difference between the serum leptin concentration of the control group (11.5 ± 6.9 ng/ml) and women receiving COCs (14.1 ± 6.7 ng/ml) was not significant (+18.4%, P = 0.083). There was nonsignificant difference between HDL levels of subjects taking COC (44.02 ± 10.7 mg/dl) and control group (49.4 ± 14.3 mg/dl). The LDL levels of COC consumer (131.40 ± 66.40 mg/dl) was significantly higher (P = 0.002) than controls (102.30 ± 44.0 mg/dl). The serum cholesterol concentration of women receiving COC (193.2 ± 70.4 mg/dl) was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than controls (172.8 ± 49.6 mg/dl). The age of COC consumption and the duration of intake of COCs beyond 36 months had no significant effect on the adiponectin and leptin concentrations.LD COC uptake results in a significant decrease in serum adiponectin concentration, nonsignificant increase in leptin levels and a more atherogenic lipid profile by significantly increasing LDL and nonsignificantly decreasing HDL concentrations. These findings suggested that COC may reduce or stimulate the adiponectin and leptin concentrations, respectively. This might be due to an effect of these pills on adipocyte maturation via inhibition or stimulation of the synthesis of new adiponectin and leptin molecules or may be a result of the increased frequency of a particular allele of the adiponectin and leptin. It is suggested that these alterations in adiponectin and leptin concentrations and lipid profiles may be related to their probable effects in response to various pathological and physiological properties of COC or its metabolites. It seems that probably free radicals produced during  of COCs change the amounts of adipokines and atherogenic lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2128711>Modern trends in contraception.</a></h2><p>Substantial improvements have been made in oral contraceptives, a new injectable contraceptive (Norplant), and the intrauterine device (IUD).

In rabbits, norgestimate binds to uterine progestin receptors, stimulates the endometrium, and inhibits ovulation. Norgestimate acts directly on target organs, stimulating rabbit endometrium when injected into the uterine cavity and inhibiting luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone-stimulated luteinizing hormone release in dispersed rat pituitary cells in culture. Norgestimate has no estrogenic activity, and like other progestins, it suppresses the action of estrogen. Unlike some other progestins, it is relatively free of androgenic activity. Norgestimate and its 17-deacetylated metabolite demonstrate very poor affinity for androgen receptors compared with  and gestodene and do not exhibit androgenic activity when measured as the stimulation of prostatic growth in immature rats. Norgestimate's lack of affinity for human sex hormone-binding globulin is further evidence of its minimal androgenicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8495558>Oral contraceptive treatment decreases arterial low density lipoprotein degradation in female cynomolgus monkeys.</a></h2><p>The effect of oral contraceptive therapy on early events in atherogenesis was studied in female cynomolgus monkeys. After a 1-month dietary challenge, monkeys were randomized into three groups stratified by total plasma cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The monkeys were then fed a cholesterol-containing diet for 16 weeks. This relatively short period ensured that studies were done before any treatment-induced differences in arterial morphology occurred. Monkeys were treated with either diet alone (control group), with the addition of a monophasic oral contraceptive (equivalent to a human dose of 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 500 micrograms norgestrel per day), or with a triphasic oral contraceptive (equivalent to a human dose of 30-40 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 50-125 micrograms  per day). Twenty-four hours before necropsy, low density lipoproteins (LDLs) labeled with 131I and LDLs labeled with the residualizing label 125I-tyramine cellobiose were injected into the animals. The arterial LDL degradation rate, amount of undegraded LDLs, and total LDL accumulation were then determined. Although there were regional differences in LDL , both treatments decreased the rate of LDL degradation and LDL accumulation in the coronary arteries and other arterial sites. Treatment also resulted in significantly lower LDL molecular weights. Despite a trend toward a more atherogenic  profile (decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased total plasma/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio), oral contraceptive treatment may inhibit atherogenesis by decreasing arterial LDL degradation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11257242>Comparison of the lipoprotein, carbohydrate, and hemostatic effects of phasic oral contraceptives containing desogestrel or .</a></h2><p>Desogestrel (DSG) is a less-androgenic progestogen than  (LNG). This difference in androgenicity may be responsible for observed differences in metabolic effects between oral contraceptive (OC) formulations containing almost equivalent estrogen doses but with either DSG or LNG as a progestogen. To test the hypothesis, a prospective 9-month randomized comparison of plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, hemostasis, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was conducted in 66 healthy women using phasic formulations of OCs containing either DSG (DSG-OC) or LNG (LNG-OC). The study results showed that SHBG increased 3-fold with DSG-OC and 2-fold with LNG-OC. DSG-OC increased HDL-C, HDL(2)-C and HDL(3)-C; LDL-C decreased transiently. LNG-OC decreased HDL(2)-C and increased HDL(3)-C; HDL-C was unchanged and LDL-C decreased transiently. Both formulations increased VLDL-C and triglycerides, more with DSG-OC, but apolipoprotein B levels increased equally. Apo A-I and A-II increased more with DSG-OC than with LNG-OC. Neither formulation altered Lp(a) or fasting glucose and insulin levels. Postprandially, both formulations decreased glucose and increased insulin responses, but to an equivalent degree. Both OCs slightly enhanced procoagulant and profibrinolytic parameters to the same extent except for internally compensating decreases in Factor V and protein S with DSG-OC. In summary, at almost equivalent estrogen doses, a phasic OC containing DSG compared with LNG has a less androgenic effect on lipoproteins and SHBG, similar effects on hemostatic parameters with lower protein S and factor V activity and equivalent effects on carbohydrate . The lipoprotein, SHBG, and protein S and factor V differences are likely due to the lesser androgenicity of DSG allowing for a greater expression of the dose of estrogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2335101>Comparison of two triphasic contraceptives with different progestogens: effects on  and coagulation proteins.</a></h2><p>This study compared the effects of two triphasic oral contraceptives (OCs) taken for 6 pill cycles.

The women were randomly allocated to one of the two pill groups--a triphasic preparation containing low doses of LNG and EE in various proportions and a monophasic preparation of 150 micrograms LNG and 30 micrograms EE, and an additional 18 women, choosing to use IUDs, were recruited as controls. Blood samples were taken at admission, 3 and 12 months thereafter. For both pill groups, total cholesterol decreased with duration of use, while HDL cholesterol decreased slightly at 3 months and thereafter increased. LDL cholesterol decreased slightly at 3 months, returning to baseline at 12 months for the monophasic group, while remaining unchanged at 12 months for the triphasic group. The monophasic preparation appeared to lower total, LDL and HDL cholesterols to a greater extent at 3 months than the triphasic preparation. Compared with IUD users, for the monophasic group, both total and HDL cholesterols were significantly lower at 3 months and HDL and LDL cholesterols were lower at 12 months. In addition, ratios of HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol were significantly lower at 12 months. Changes in triglycerides were minimal for both pill groups. However, at 3 months, triglycerides for the triphasic group were significantly higher than the IUD users, but this observation was not of any clinical importance since comparison of changes with their respective pretreatment values were not statistically significant. These results indicate that these changes are related to the dosage and estrogen-progestogen ratio of the preparation. Furthermore, the monophasic preparation may have a disadvantage over the triphasic preparation since it appears to cause more disturbance in .

There was a significant rise in mean serum bilirubin from 0.54 mg/dl to 0.85 mg/dl after 12 months of use (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was also a significant fall in total proteins from 7.37 gm/dl to 7.12 gm/dl (p less than 0.001) and serum globulin from 3.18 gm/dl to 2.84 gm/dl (p less than 0.001). As regards , we have demonstrated significant decreases in mean serum triglycerides (1.04 mmol/l to 0.83 mmol/l), p less than 0.001; total cholesterol (5.04 mmol/l to 4.64 mmol/l), p less than 0.001; and LDL-cholesterol (3.36 mmol/l to 3.10 mmol/l), p less than 0.001 after one year of use. There was a small fall in the HDL-cholesterol (1.21 mmol/l to 1.16 mmol/l) after 12 months of use; this fall was not significant. Despite this, there was a rise in the HDL-cholesterol/Total cholesterol - HDL-cholesterol ratio (0.258 cf 0.244; p less than 0.05) after 1 year of use. As we have not incorporated a simultaneous non-pill treated control group, the observed changes in lipoprotein lipids could be attributed to extraneous factors such as diet, exercise or other environmental changes. Nevertheless, the findings, though speculative, indicate Norplant-2 use to be non-contributory to cardiovascular risk and indeed it may be a protective factor against such risks in this population.

Based on lack of change in intermediate markers, as well as results of epidemiologic studies, low-dose OCs do not increase the risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a risk factor for impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and coronary artery disease, and most previous OC studies excluded these women; thus, we have limited information about carbohydrate and  in obese OC users.This study compared changes in carbohydrate and  parameters in 71 normal-weight and 38 obese women initiating the OC. Women were randomized to two pills: 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/150 mcg  (LNG) or 20 mcg EE/100 mcg LNG. Participants underwent baseline and cycle-3 measurements of fasting serum glucose; insulin; triglycerides and total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.Normal-weight and obese participants experienced similar changes in mean glucose, insulin and log homeostatic model assessment, as well as similar changes in total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides; however, change in mean LDL (-4.9±20.6 mg/dL vs. +3.8±17.3 mg/dL) was different between the obese and normal-weight groups, respectively. Among the obese participants, change in glucose was marginally greater with the higher dose pill (p=.06); otherwise, changes between the body mass index groups were not modified by pill dose.Obesity had little effect on any OC-induced changes in carbohydrate or  except for a borderline adverse interaction between obesity and OC dose with respect to fasting glucose and a positive interaction between obesity and OC use with respect to LDL cholesterol.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The different pharmacological composition of EPs is responsible for different clinical effects. One of the most used low-dose EP associations is ethinylestradiol 20 mcg plus  100 mcg in monophasic regimen (EE20/LNG100). This review summarizes clinical pharmacology, cycle control, and effects on lipid and glucose , coagulation, body weight/body composition, acne, and sexuality of EE20/LNG100. Overall, EE20/LNG100 combination is safe and well tolerated, and in several studies the incidence of adverse events in the treated group was comparable to that of the placebo group. Cycle control was effective and body weight/body composition did not vary among treated and untreated groups in most studies. The EE20/LNG100 combination shows mild or no effect on lipid and glucose . Lastly, EE20/LNG100 is associated with a low risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In conclusion, in the process of decision making for the individualization of EPs choice, EE20/LNG100 should be considered for its favorable clinical profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23788843>Novel oral contraceptive for heavy menstrual bleeding: estradiol valerate and dienogest.</a></h2><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is associated with significant direct medical costs and impacts both society and the quality of life for individual women. Heavy menstrual bleeding, a subset of AUB, also referred to as menorrhagia, is defined as menstrual blood loss greater than 80 mL or the patient's perception of excessive blood loss. The newest treatment option available is a novel combination oral contraceptive product containing estradiol valerate (E2V) and dienogest (DNG). As with other combination oral contraceptives, E2V/DNG works primarily by preventing ovulation. However, in contrast with other combination oral contraceptives, it is the progestin component of E2V/DNG that is responsible for endometrial stabilization. Use of E2V/DNG for six months has led to significant reductions in heavy menstrual bleeding with an average 65% reduction in mean blood loss. Approximately half of the women with heavy menstrual bleeding who received E2V/DNG for six months demonstrated an 80% reduction in mean blood loss. Additionally, significant improvements in hematologic indicators (ie, ferritin, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) have been shown. Based on its chemical properties, E2V/DNG may have fewer adverse effects on lipid and glucose  and reduced risk of thromboembolic complications compared with other combination oral contraceptives. This has not yet been shown in clinical trials and until then it should be assumed that E2V/DNG has a safety profile similar to other combination oral contraceptives containing 35 μg or less of ethinyl estradiol. E2V/DNG has been compared with another combination oral contraceptive in healthy women without heavy menstrual bleeding and demonstrated improved bleeding patterns. E2V/DNG has not been compared with the  intrauterine device or other treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding. When compared with some other treatment options for AUB, E2V/DNG provides the added advantage of effective contraception.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11861055>Metabolic effects of implantable steroid contraceptives for women.</a></h2><p>The metabolic impact of progestin-only contraceptives is less than that of combined oral contraceptives. Subdermal contraceptive implant systems that provide a sustained release of low levels of progestins are now becoming widely available. This review evaluates the metabolic effects of currently available products that release the progestins  (Norplant, Jadelle, and their Chinese equivalents); etonogestrel (Implanon); nomegestrol acetate (Uniplant); and Nestorone, formally called ST-1435 (Nestorone implant/Elcometrine). Data on liver, kidney, and renal function; carbohydrates and insulin release; hemostasis; blood pressure; and lipids are considered. The metabolic effects reported for these methods as a whole were minimal. Any changes were generally within the normal range for the populations studied and, therefore, are unlikely to be of clinical significance. However, all published studies have been conducted in healthy populations of women. To inform clinical practice, the field would be well served to have additional empiric data from well-designed, well-implemented, and well-reported trials in women who are deemed to be at elevated risk for certain diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8447353>Selectivity information on desogestrel.</a></h2><p>Improvement in oral contraceptive formulations was originally achieved through dose reduction of the estrogen and progestogen components. Recently, further improvement was achieved by increasing the selectivity of contraceptive progestins. The ratio between the affinity for the progesterone receptor and the affinity for the androgen receptor is an indicator of progesterone (or androgen) selectivity of a progestin. This ratio (selectivity index) reflects the relative amount of androgenic or progestational effect at a given dose. Relative selectivity can be characterized with in vitro receptor-binding studies and animal pharmacologic experiments. In comparison with , desogestrel displays markedly lower androgenicity and slightly increased relative progestational activity. In receptor-binding experiments and animal pharmacologic studies, 3-keto-desogestrel, the active metabolite of desogestrel, shows the highest selectivity index. The favorable effect of desogestrel-containing oral contraceptives on lipoprotein  and preexisting androgen-dependent skin disorders and the absence of adverse effects on blood pressure and body weight are attributed to the increased progestin selectivity of desogestrel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1535580>A cross-over study of three oral contraceptives containing ethinyloestradiol and either desogestrel or .</a></h2><p>A randomised cross-over trial was performed to compare the pharmacodynamic actions of three low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs): Marvelon (150 micrograms desogestrel (DSG)+ 30 micrograms ethinyloestradiol (EE)), Mercilon (150 micrograms DSG + 20 micrograms EE) and Microgynon (150 micrograms  (LNG) + 30 micrograms EE). None of the OCs produced any significant changes in serum cholesterol, LDL-C and apoprotein B. Triglycerides were increased by the desogestrel OCs but not by Microgynon. The latter however increased the glucose and insulin responses to a glucose tolerance test whereas Marvelon and Mercilon had no effect. HDL-C increased with Marvelon, was unchanged with Mercilon and was decreased with Microgynon. Apoprotein AII was increased by all three OCs but only the DSG OCs increased apoprotein AI. All OCs produced similar increases in caeruloplasmin but the increase in SHBG was much greater with Marvelon and Mercilon than with Microgynon. Testosterone was reduced more with Microgynon than with the DSG OCs. Many of the changes reflect the strong anti-oestrogenic action of LNG on metabolic parameters compared to DSG. Except for the effect on HDL-C, there was little difference between Marvelon and Mercilon on metabolic parameters and this complements the findings from large-scale clinical trials of the two OCs. Mercilon, therefore provides a very satisfactory alternative to Marvelon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2495887>Two-year follow-up of changes in clinical chemistry in Singaporean Norplant acceptors: metabolic changes.</a></h2><p>In this longitudinal study involving 100 Singaporean acceptors, the effects of Norplant on metabolic function was evaluated. With respect to liver function, the results at the end of two years still indicate the presence of possible hepatocellular dysfunction. Despite a 4.5% decrease in serum bilirubin during the second year, the mean serum bilirubin still remained significantly raised (p less than 0.001). Furthermore there was a significant fall in total proteins and globulin during the period under review (p less than 0.001).

All the 19-nor testosterone progestogens in OC formulations basically have similar potencies and androgenic activities with the exception of norgestrel (NG). NG is the most potent and androgenic of these agents. It is five to ten times as potent as norethindrone (NET);  (1-NG), one of the two isomers of NG and the one responsible for its potency, is ten to 20 times more potent than NET. In addition, 1-NG is several times more androgenic than NET. However, when evaluating OC androgenic potency the antiandrogenic effect of the progestational agent as well as the effects of the estrogenic component have to be considered. Thus, it is useful to assess parameters that are affected by both OC components, such as changes in  levels. It may be concluded that given the potential deleterious metabolic effects produced by androgenic compounds, formulations should be used that have the least impact on these parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2204902>Oral contraceptives and cardiovascular risk.

Exogenous sex steroids produce important effects on . Early intervention against cholesterol is important in reducing cardiovascular risk. Current users of high-dose formulations, particularly older women who smoke, are at greatest risk for cardiovascular complications, especially myocardial infarction. Low-dose oral contraceptives have more modest effects on , but important differences in the potency of progestins remain. Fortunately, recent studies among users of lower-dose oral contraceptive formulations fail to show an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, prudent physicians will avoid oral contraceptives that may adversely affect lipoprotein , such as those containing progestins with high androgenic and antiestrogenic potency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1908716>Subdermal progestin implant contraception.</a></h2><p>Sustained-release progestin contraceptives are a new approach to meeting a worldwide need for more effective and acceptable birth control. These contraceptive systems provide low, stable levels of synthetic progestins for periods of months to several years. Unlike earlier injectable and oral contraceptives, they do not cause peaks in progestin levels beyond those required for effective contraception, nor do they employ estrogens. For these reasons, sustained-release progestin systems are without some of the health risks attributed to birth control pills, and they are more effective, as well as easy to use, and completely reversible. They share common side effects, the most frequent of which is irregular menstrual bleeding caused by the erratic shedding of hypotrophic endometrium. Despite this and other minor side effects, most users find the sustained-release systems acceptable alternatives to other methods of contraception. Permanent or biodegradable subdermal implants, injections, intrauterine and intracervical devices, and vaginal rings are all employed as delivery systems for contraceptive progestins. The Norplant (Wyeth Ayerst, Radnor, PA) system, consisting of six silastic tubes filled with  and implanted under the skin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is already used by more than a half million women worldwide. The other sustained-release systems are in various stages of development, at least several years away from general use. When these new methods complete clinical trials, women will be able to choose from among implants, injections, or pellets with various durations of action, all providing convenient, highly effective contraception with low risk to health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1764941>Progestagen-only oral contraceptives: comparison of the metabolic effects of  and norethisterone.</a></h2><p>A 6-month single-blind study compared the use of a progestagen-only oral contraceptive containing norethisterone 350 micrograms/day (NE 350) with one containing  30 micrograms (LN 30), to assess the metabolic effects.

No changes were seen in food intake, activity level or % lean muscle mass with OC use for either BMI-based group.Overall, OC use appears to cause a slight increase in basal metabolic rate in female monkeys, leading to a decrease in body weight and percent body  in obese individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15851470>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase is involved in the control of proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and survival in human transformed cells.</a></h2><p>Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are the most abundant fatty acid species in mammalian organisms, and their distribution is regulated by stearoyl-CoA desaturase, the enzyme that converts saturated into monounsaturated fatty acids. A positive correlation between high monounsaturated fatty acid levels and neoplastic transformation has been reported, but little is still known about the regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as in cancer development. Here we report that simian virus 40-transformed human lung fibroblasts bearing a knockdown of human stearoyl-CoA desaturase by stable antisense cDNA transfection (hSCDas cells) showed a considerable reduction in monounsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipid synthesis, compared with empty vector transfected-simian virus 40 cell line (control cells). hSCDas cells also exhibited high cellular levels of saturated free fatty acids and triacylglycerol. Interestingly, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-depleted cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in proliferation rate and abolition of anchorage-independent growth. Prolonged exposure to exogenous oleic acid did not reverse either the slower proliferation or loss of anchorage-independent growth of hSCDas cells, suggesting that endogenous synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids is essential for rapid cell replication and invasiveness, two hallmarks of neoplastic transformation. Moreover, apoptosis was increased in hSCDas cells in a ceramide-independent manner. Finally, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-deficient cells were more sensitive to palmitic acid-induced apoptosis compared with control cells. Our data suggest that, by globally regulating , stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity modulates cell proliferation and survival and emphasize the important role of endogenously synthesized monounsaturated fatty acids in sustaining the neoplastic phenotype of transformed cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3318155>[Progestagens in contraception].</a></h2><p>The different spectrum of biological actions of the various synthetic progestogens is compared on the basis of their chemical structure, pharmacokinetics and interaction with the multiple receptors.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were tested before (pretreatment group) and 1 year later following insertion (on-treatment group). Baseline mean parameters were compared with mean parameters at 1 year for statistical significance using paired samples t-test.Thirty-three (68.75%) women were eligible for control in the on-treatment group. Mean age of the patients was 44.34+/-7.59 years. The study results showed that mean FPG level was significantly increased, whereas mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly decreased. Although mean systolic blood pressure tended to decrease and HDL-C concentrations to increase, these changes from baseline levels were insignificant. There were no significant changes in mean TG, TC, VLDL, LDL, AST and ALT.The only significant unfavorable effect observed was an increase in FPG level.

From an epidemiologic viewpoint, the atherogenic impact of new low-dose OCs is less marked, including in users over 40 years of age, but thromboembolic effects still persist--though at a lower level than with standard-dose products. From a metabolic viewpoint, the adverse effects of the progestogens contained in current OCs on the lipoprotein profile and their atherogenic effect on the vessel wall seem effectively counterbalanced by the estrogen content of these new OCs. However, the progestin content seems still responsible for a low level of chronic insulin resistance, which might be related to vascular alterations potentially linked to syndrome-X. In conclusion, reduced metabolic effects of new low-dose OCs appear to decrease their atherogenic risk. However, thrombotic effects dose-related to the estrogen component of OCs are still persisting and seem less easily suppressible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323981>Ovarian  Modulates Circulating Lipids in Premenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>The premenopausal circulating  profile may be linked to the hormonal profile and ovarian .Assess how estradiol, progesterone, and ovarian  contributes to the premenopausal  profile; and evaluate the acute effects of a common hormonal oral contraceptive (OC) on circulating lipids.Experimental crossover with repeated measures.Academic hospitals.Eight healthy, regularly menstruating women.Participants underwent periodic serum sampling during a normal menstrual cycle; a standard 21-day, monophasic combined hormonal OC cycle (30 µg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 µg of  per day); menopause simulated by leuprolide acetate (22.5-mg depot); and an artificial menstrual cycle achieved via transdermal estradiol (50 to 300 µg/d) and vaginal micronized progesterone (100 to 300 mg/d).Primary outcomes included evaluation of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio.

Indexing terms included progestins, desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, , and norgestrel.Only human clinical and pharmacokinetic trials performed in Europe, Canada, and the US were included.All available data from human studies were reviewed; both comparative and noncomparative studies were included because of the paucity of direct comparative information available.The newer progestins were designed to minimize the adverse effects (e.g., acne, hirsuitism, nausea, carbohydrate and  changes) observed with older oral contraceptives (OCs) while maintaining efficacy and good menstrual cycle control. Desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene have minimal amounts of androgenicity and antiestrogenic potential. All of these agents are pharmacokinetically similar to older agents: they are highly bioavailable when administered orally, hepatically metabolized, and obtain steady-state concentrations after 8-10 days of continuous administration. The newer agents have similar Pearl Indexes and slightly better cycle control. Furthermore, the new progestins appear to cause fewer adverse effects, such as acne and hirsuitism, and similar rates of weight gain, blood pressure changes, and  and carbohydrate  changes.Desogestrel, norgestimate, and gestodene appear to offer clinical advantages because of their decreased androgenicity. Women whose cycles are currently well controlled with other OCs should not be switched to a newer progestin. However, any of the combination OC products that contain these progestins may be prescribed for women intolerant of older agents or to first-time users of OCs. The newer progestins appear to be efficacious and offer similar cycle control, improved safety and tolerability profiles, and comparable price with the older agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2256489>Effect of low-dose oral contraceptives on carbohydrate and  in women with recent gestational diabetes: results of a controlled, randomized, prospective study.</a></h2><p>Women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to one of two low-dose oral contraceptives to evaluate the effect of low-dose oral contraceptives on carbohydrate and . A cohort of similar women requesting a non-oral-contraceptive method served as controls.

A 75 gm, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting  profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols) were performed at entry, after 3 months, and after 6 to 13 months of treatment. The prevalence of diabetes at 6 to 13 months (27/156 patients) was not significantly different between groups (non-oral-contraceptive group, 17%; ethinyl estradiol-norethindrone, 15%; ethinyl estradiol-, 20%). When examined by prior gestational diabetes mellitus class, diabetes mellitus was present in 7% of prior class A1 and 29% of women with prior class A2 disease (p less than 0.001). Mean cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly improved in all three groups at 3 months and at 6 to 13 months, whereas triglycerides remained unchanged. There were no differences in cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides levels between the groups.

One-year data from 48 volunteers were obtained.We found a decrease of HDL2 cholesterol and increases of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total triglycerides in both treatment groups from baseline to the 13th treatment cycle. Although for four of six variables, the changes in the 20 EE group were lower compared with the 30 EE group, none of the differences between the two treatments were statistically significant. The median values for the fasting levels of insulin, C-peptide and free fatty acids slightly increased or remained unchanged while the fasting glucose levels slightly decreased after 13 treatment cycles. While the glucose area under the curve (AUC) (0-3 h) was similar in both groups during the OGTT, the insulin AUC(0-3 h) was less increased in the 20 EE/100 LNG group compared with the 30 EE/150 LNG group. None of the differences between the treatment groups for any of the carbohydrate  variables were statistically significant at any time point.

In animal models, NOMAC demonstrated moderate antiandrogenic activity and strong antiestrogenic activity. In clinical studies, the progestogen was associated with effective suppression of gonadotropic activity and ovulation in premenopausal women, and a neutral impact on hemostasis, lipids, and carbohydrate . In normal and cancerous human breast tissue, NOMAC has shown favorable effects on estrogen , and in human breast cancer cell lines in vitro, it does not stimulate cell proliferation. The pharmacologic profile of NOMAC suggested that it would be well suited for combination with a physiologic estrogen in a combined oral contraceptive (COC), with the aim of achieving effective contraception with good cycle control and a favorable safety profile. A monophasic COC containing NOMAC 2.5mg and 17β-estradiol (E2) 1.5mg, administered in a 24/4-day regimen, is currently under clinical investigation. In a phase III study, NOMAC/E2 provided consistent and robust ovulation inhibition, with contraceptive effects that compared favorably with those of drospirenone 3mg/ethinyl estradiol (EE) 30 μg. Investigators for a second phase III study reported less overall impact with NOMAC/E2 on hemostatic, , inflammatory, and carbohydrate  parameters than with  150 μg/EE 30 μg.

Oral contraceptive-induced changes in both carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors may contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Carbohydrate and lipoprotein risk factors for coronary heart disease are reviewed, and oral contraceptive-induced changes in carbohydrate and lipoprotein , which may lead to altered risk status for coronary heart disease, are discussed. The importance of methodology in evaluating the results of studies assessing such oral contraceptive-induced changes is stressed. The role of progestins in influencing coronary heart disease risk factors is surveyed, and differences among progestins commonly used in oral contraceptive formulations are discussed. In addition, the effect of various combination oral contraceptives on risk factor status is outlined. Finally, the implications of available evidence for the selection of progestins for oral contraceptive formulations of the future are discussed. Current data indicate that medium- and low-fixed-dose oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen/norethindrone acetate have less metabolic impact than do comparable -containing formulations, including multiphasic formulations. Triphasic formulations may have less effect on coronary heart disease risk factors, although data are not yet conclusive. Novel progestins such as desogestrel may also have lesser effects on metabolic functions, but the reduced androgenicity of such compounds may expose women to an increased risk of estrogen-induced hypertriglyceridemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8521763>Gestodene. A review of its pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability in combined contraceptive preparations.</a></h2><p>The newer progestogens gestodene, desogestrel and norgestimate were developed in an attempt to produce agents with more selective progestational activity that would improve cycle control and minimise metabolic changes and adverse events while effectively preventing pregnancy. In clinical practice, gestodene is combined with ethinylestradiol in monophasic or triphasic combined oral contraceptive preparations. The drug has pharmacokinetic advantages over the other new progestogens in that it is active per se (the others are prodrugs) and has high bioavailability (approximately 100%). The ability of gestodene-containing oral contraceptives to inhibit ovulation is similar to that of preparations containing other progestogens although the required dosage is lower. In common with oral contraceptives containing desogestrel or norgestimate, and in contrast with those containing , gestodene-containing preparations are associated with neutral or positive changes in  and carbohydrate . The effects of gestodene preparations on coagulation parameters, like those of desogestrel and , are balanced by changes in the fibrinolytic system. Although the impact of these changes on clinical cardiovascular end-points has not been determined, the altered  profile is not likely to have significant clinical relevance because of the predominantly thrombogenic nature of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users. Pregnancy rates and Pearl Indices with gestodene-containing preparations are low and similar to those with preparations containing other progestogens. Most pregnancies are attributable to user failure. Cycle control appears to be better with gestodene preparations than with  preparations, and available data suggest that cycle control may also be better with monophasic gestodene/ethinylestradiol than with monophasic desogestrel- or norgestimate-containing preparations, and better with triphasic gestodene- than with triphasic - or norgestimate-containing preparations. However, differences between the new progestogen-containing preparations need to be confirmed in further large-scale trials. The most common adverse events with gestodene/ethinylestradiol are headaches and breast tension; the incidence of short term adverse events, including acne, is similar to that with preparations containing other progestogens. Changes in blood pressure and bodyweight are negligible. There are no comparative data on the incidence of cardiovascular events with gestodene-containing and other combined preparations. While the risk of breast cancer appears to be increased with long term combined oral contraceptive use in certain patient subgroups, this risk needs to be balanced against the noncontraceptive benefits of these preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2657358>[Oral contraception with low-dose progestagen].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1954724>Contraception for women with diabetes: an update.</a></h2><p>Today several effective contraceptive methods are available for women with IDDM. Contraceptive guidance as part of the pre-pregnancy counselling needs to be more widely implemented by general practitioners and in non-specialized obstetrical and gynaecological departments. Women with diabetes are generally well motivated, and thus the barrier methods may prove both acceptable and reliable contraceptive agents for some of these women. When, however, a high risk of user failure can be predicted, the IUD or hormonal contraception may be the only reversible alternative. According to our findings, IUDs can be recommended without reservation to women with IDDM. In women with previous GDM it seems that low dose oral contraceptive compounds may be administered without running the risk of inducing glucose intolerance, but long-term results are still unavailable. Natural oestrogens may be administered in combination with a progestogen for a limited period as an efficient and acceptable mode of contraception in women with IDDM without any concomitant adverse effects on diabetic control. From our investigations it also appears that short-term administration of combined low dose OCs containing the traditional progestogens (e.g. norethisterone or ) or the new gonane progestogens (e.g. gestodene) does not alter glycaemic control in women with IDDM. Similarly, these compounds do not cause any significant changes in /lipoprotein levels during short-term treatment, although the intake of monophasic ethinyloestradiol/norethisterone preparations may result in higher triglyceride levels and tends to increase  levels more than triphasic ethinyloestradiol/ compounds. The results from our clinic have shown that OCs can be safely recommended at pre-conception counselling so that women with diabetes can obtain both optimal glycaemic control and efficient spacing of their pregnancies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2969320>Changes in lipoprotein composition in women receiving two low-dose oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol and gonane progestins.</a></h2><p>In a prospective double-blind study of the effects of two low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) on  and lipoprotein , two groups of eighteen young healthy women selected at random were submitted to a six months' use of either monophasic ethinylestradiol (EE) + desogestrel (DG) or triphasic EE +  (LNG). Total cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) together with apoproteins A-I, A-II, B and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity (LCAT) were determined in serial plasma samples collected before, at three and six months during, and one month after OC use. Cholesterol and apoproteins (A-I, A-II, B) composition of lipoproteins (HDL-2, HDL-3, LDL) isolated by ultracentrifugation were additionally determined. On Mono-EE + DG, plasma TG (+39.3%, +45.6%), PL (+21.9%, +16.8%) and apo A-I (+35.5%, +23.3%) levels were significantly increased at 3 and 6 months of use; plasma HDL-C (+24%) and Apo A-II (+21.4%) were transiently increased at 3 months.  and apoprotein composition of HDL-2, HDL-3 and LDL were unchanged. On Tri-EE + LNG, a slight but not significant decrease in HDL-C was observed throughout the study while other plasma lipids and apoproteins were unchanged. Ultracentrifugation revealed a lower content of C (-44.2%) and apo A-I (-44.6%) in HDL-2. LCAT activity expressed as molar esterification rate (MER) rose in a more sustained way during EE + DG use than during EE + LNG treatment. Covariance analysis shows a further significant difference between results of both treated groups for the Apo AI/Apo B ratio that was increased by Mono-EE + DG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22464229>Molecular interactions of natural and synthetic steroids in female hamsters' flank organs.</a></h2><p>The initial step of steroidal action on target cells is gene activation; therefore, the quantification of mRNA is a direct method for comparing the role of different steroids in the skin.This study demonstrated the role of several steroids on the mRNA expression encoding for different enzymes involved in the lipid  in hamsters' flank organs, which are a pilosebaceous complex.To determine the effect of treatments with testosterone (T) progesterone (P),  (LNG), 17α-p-chlorobenzoyloxy-6-chloropregn-4,6-diene-3,20-dione (5) and 17α-p-chlorobenzoyloxy-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione (6); T and/or LNG; T and 5 or 6; P and/or 5 or 6 on the expression of mRNA encoding for lipid enzymes, the steroids were applied to the glands; later, the mRNAs expression for the enzymes was determined by PCR.

A combination of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and  (LNg) was used (six tablets with 30 micrograms EE + 50 micrograms LNg, five tablets with 40 micrograms EE + 75 micrograms LNg, and 10 tablets with 30 micrograms EE + 125 micrograms LNg), also known as Triphasil (Wyeth). In a private practice, 409 subjects participated in 7,286 treatment cycles. Three pregnancies occurred, all due to subject failure. Menstrual regulation was excellent and the incidence of side effects extremely low. Withdrawals from the study for possibly drug-related medical reasons totaled 9.0% through 56 cycles of treatment. Metabolic changes also were evaluated in 14 of these women over a 6-month period. The only statistically significant increase in carbohydrate values occurred at 6 months. The mean glucose level at 30 minutes of the oral glucose tolerance test was above the baseline mean value, but serum insulin levels showed no statistically significant deviation.  values presented are total lipids, total cholesterol, triglycerides, alpha-, beta-, and pre-beta-lipoproteins, and high density and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean values at baseline and those during treatment for any  variable. These results indicate that this triphasic oral contraceptive has a high degree of efficacy, a low incidence of side effects, excellent cycle control, and high subject compliance, and would seem to indicate a minimal influence on the  of lipids and carbohydrates in the small number of subjects studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2887400>Metabolic investigations with Femodene--an oral contraceptive containing gestodene and ethinyloestradiol.</a></h2><p>The metabolic effects of a new oral contraceptive Femodene (SHD 356C) containing 75 micrograms gestodene (delta-15-) and 30 micrograms ethinyloestradiol were studied in two groups of women.

However, this does not agree with current pathophysiological concepts. This review compares all 17 comparative studies on the hemostatic effects of DSG/GSD- and LNG- or norgestimate (NGM)-containing OCs, and comments on two recent cross-sectional studies on the effects of third- and second-generation OCs on activated protein C (APC) sensitivity. In the comparative studies, the only difference in hemostatic parameters between DSG/GSD- and LNG- or NGM-containing OC users was a tendency towards higher factor VII (FVII) levels with DSG/GSD OCs. Differential effects on APC sensitivity were observed with the endogenous thrombin generation potential (ETP) assay, but not with the classical APC resistance test. FVII is not a risk marker for VTE, but is affected by dietary , estrogens and androgens and may interfere with the ETP assay. As no differences in established VTE risk markers were observed, there is no plausible reason for a differential risk of VTE with DSG/GSD- and LNG-containing OCs. In fact, the lack of differences with regard to established risk markers of VTE gives further support to the findings of the most recent epidemiological studies, which have not found any difference in the risk of VTE between third- and second-generation OCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9315415>A study on the effects of Norplant implantable contraceptive on , lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein  in Singaporean women.</a></h2><p>The Norplant subdermal implants system is rapidly becoming acceptable as a contraceptive system all over the world. Earlier studies in Singapore indicated that the implants do not appear directly contributory to cardiovascular risk. However, extraneous environmental effects could have contributed to the observed changes. In this study, when nonsteroid copper intrauterine device (IUD) users were used as control, we have shown that the findings are in concordance with the results of the earlier studies. There was a decrease in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HDL and LDL cholesterol over the period of study. However, despite these changes the HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio remained stable and was above 0.200. As regards apolipoprotein, there was generally a significant full in apolipoprotein AI, AII, and B. As a result, the apolipoprotein AI/AII ratio showed a significant decrease in the first 3 months before increasing close to its preinsertion value at 2 years. Similarly, the apolipoprotein AI/B ratio also stabilized at the end of 2 years.

Ninety volunteers were randomized to use Implanon (n = 45) or Norplant (n = 45), and a nonrandomized group of 45 Multiload Cu 250 IUD users served as a control. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein AII, and apolipoprotein B were measured. The ratios of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, of HDL to LDL cholesterol, and of apolipoprotein AI to apolipoprotein B were determined.  and lipoprotein determinations were done at screening and after 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months.

Mean changes from baseline in the  and apolipoprotein parameters, although occasionally statistically significant, were small in all groups (less than 1 standard deviation of the mean concentration at baseline) and clinically not significant. Statistically significant differences between the Implanon and Norplant groups were only occasionally observed. In both implant groups, total mean cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein AI concentrations tended to decrease during the study, but statistically significant changes from baseline were only occasionally observed, suggesting that drug-related factors are not involved. The mean ratios of HDL/total cholesterol and the HDL/LDL cholesterol showed very little change over time in both implant groups; slight and statistically nonsignificant increases were noted at most time points.

The continuous release of low-dose  from an intrauterine device was used as progestogen co-medication to estradiol in a new type of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy. Women were randomized to either cyclical treatment with 2 mg of oral estradiol valerate in combination with 250 micrograms of  for the last ten days (Cyclo Progynova) or continuously with 2 mg estradiol valerate orally in combination with a 20 micrograms per 24 hour  releasing intrauterine device.Reduced HDL cholesterol was initially recorded in both treatment arms and disappeared after 1 year of treatment. Triglycerides were reduced in the orally treated group, but not in the device group. No changes in LDL cholesterol were noted.The findings suggest that continuous combined HRT with intrauterine release of 20 micrograms  per 24 hours in perimenopausal women is neutral as far as  is concerned, since no alterations compared with pretreatment values could be noted after 12 months of treatment. Less marked  changes were obtained in perimenopausal women as compared with data on postmenopausal women. Differences in methodology may partly account for this.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12281082>New progestins focus on eliminating side effects.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9522325>A comparative study of two -containing hormone replacement therapy regimens of efficacy and tolerability variables.</a></h2><p>To compare the effect of two sequential hormone replacement regimens differing in the dose of  on climacteric symptoms, bleeding pattern and  in postmenopausal women.In a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-treatment-controlled study, 210 postmenopausal women were assessed at the end of treatment cycles 3 and 6. The high- group was treated with 2 mg estradiol valerate (days 1-21) sequentially combined with 0.25 mg  (days 12-21). The low- group received the same estrogen regimen (2 mg estradiol valerate, days 1-21), but  was administered sequentially in a dose of 0.15 mg during the last 12 days of the cycle (days 10-21). Statistical analysis by Student's t-test for dependent variables (measured values versus baseline) and independent variables (differences between groups), and the composite t-test method for comparison of both regimens with respect to efficacy, was performed.Both groups were statistically comparable. The trial was completed by 137 subjects. Protocol violations occurred in 38 cases. Thirty-five subjects dropped out during the study, 21 of them because of adverse events. Both treatments were equally effective in the treatment of climacteric complaints. There were no clinically significant changes in body weight, blood pressure, haematological tests, and parameters of clinical chemistry. There was a tendency towards a reduction in bleeding intensity in both groups in the second half of the treatment period. The treatment for six cycles with both regimens significantly (P < 0.05) decreased plasma concentrations of triglycerides (significant in the low- group only), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-3-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein A1. In parallel, the serum concentration of total cholesterol increased significantly in both treatment groups, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the high- group only. The changes in high-density lipoprotein-2-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B did not reach statistical significance.It can be concluded that both sequential combined oral hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens were equivalent with respect to efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of women with climacteric complaints. The preparation with the lower dose of progestin showed a tendency towards a less unfavourable influence on the  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3237104>Oral contraceptives: hormonal dose and effects on carbohydrate .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2147014>Low-dose oral contraceptives lower plasma levels of apolipoprotein E.</a></h2><p>Three different oral contraceptive preparations were studied before and after a 3 month treatment period with respect to their effects on plasma lipoprotein parameters.

It appears that venous risk is attributable to subtle changes in clotting factors, while arterial risk may be secondary to changes in glucose and . In order to determine which women are at greatest risk from oral contraceptive use, Spellacy et al. has developed a risk scoring form that aids in the screening process. After excluding women with an absolute contraindication to pill use, women at greatest risk for cardiovascular disease related to oral contraceptive use are those with a family history of hyperlipidemia, gestational or overt diabetics, hypertensives, and smokers over the age of 35. The gradual reduction by manufacturers of the steroid content of oral contraceptives appears to have lessened the incidence of adverse effects. Our current knowledge of risk factors permits the clinician to reduce exposure to oral contraceptive-related mortality by as much as 86 per cent. As we continue to search for ways to reduce risk among oral contraceptive users, it is important to note that more than 25 per cent of women are still taking formulations containing 50 micrograms of estrogen. It becomes the responsibility of the practicing physician to "step-down" these patients to lower-dose preparations such as the multiphasics.

Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and trimegestone (TMG). These new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. TMG and NES are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and  (LNG). The new molecules TMG, DRSP and DNG also have antiandrogenic activity. Striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with EE leads to other reactions related to the E itself and whether the associated progestin counterbalances, more or less, the estrogenic action. The 19-norprogesterone molecules and the new molecules DRSP and DNG are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the  profile. Given their pharmacological properties, it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on metabolic or vascular risks. However, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041437>Effects of Mirena (-releasing intrauterine system) and Ortho Gynae T380 intrauterine copper device on --a randomized comparative study.</a></h2><p>This study aims to assess the effects of -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on  in an Asian population using Ortho Gynae T380 copper containing (nonhormonal) intrauterine device (IUD) as a control.Ninety-two healthy women requesting IUD for contraception were randomly allocated to the two groups and were followed up at 6-, 12- and 18-month intervals.

This is especially true in the case of hormonal contraception, not intended to combat a disease. Over the six decades during which their use has progressively expanded, the risk-benefit profile of combined oral contraceptives (COC) has substantially changed, with new combinations, dosages and mode of administration appearing on the market. Area covered: In a series of articles, recent information on the complex issue of COC risks and benefits will be reviewed in the hope of providing an updated picture. The present article reviews metabolic changes occurring during use of modern combinations of estrogens (ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, estradiol valerate and estetrol) and new progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol acetate), often compared to classic compounds, such as . Three categories of metabolic effects in healthy women are detailed: on carbohydrates,  and bone mineral content. Expert commentary: Overall, the picture is reassuring: the new generations of progestins are basically devoid of androgenic, estrogenic or glucocorticoid related side-effects. This should result in an improved safety profile, although past history teaches us that that large comparative and surveillance studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn. At any rate, available evidence indicates that metabolic effects of third and fourth generation progestins, especially when they are combined with natural estrogens, are minimal and, if used in healthy women, should not cause concern.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17054193>Hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives in women with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2.</a></h2><p>Adequate contraceptive advice is important in women with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 to reduce the risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in unplanned pregnancies.

In addition, experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies marketing contraceptives were contacted to identify published, unpublished or ongoing studies.Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that studied women with diabetes mellitus comparing: 1. hormonal versus non-hormonal contraceptives. 2. progestogen-only versus estrogen/progestogen contraceptives. 3. contraceptives containing <50 microg estrogen versus contraceptives containing > or = 50 microg estrogen. 4. contraceptives containing 'first'-, 'second'- and 'third'-generation progestogens, drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. Principal outcomes were contraceptive effectiveness, diabetes control,  and micro- and macrovascular complications.Two investigators evaluated the titles and abstracts from the literature search. Quality assessment was performed independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion or consulting a third reviewer. Because the trials differed in studied contraceptives, participant characteristics and methodological quality, we could not combine the data in a meta-analysis. The trials were therefore examined on an individual basis and narrative summaries were provided.Three randomised controlled trials were included. Only one was of good methodological quality. It compared the influence of -releasing IUD versus copper-IUD on carbohydrate  in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. No difference was found in daily insulin requirement, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting blood sugar after twelve months. The other two trials were of limited methodological quality. Both compared progestogen-only pills with different estrogen/progestogen combinations. The trials reported blood glucose levels to remain stable during treatment with most regimens. Only high-dose combined oral contraceptives were found to slightly impair glucose homeostasis. Combined oral contraceptives also appeared to have a minor adverse effect on  whereas progestogen-only contraceptives slightly improved . Only one study reported on micro- and macrovascular complications. No signs or symptoms of thromboembolic incidents or visual disturbances were observed. However study duration was short. Minor adverse effects were reported in one study. The trial found progestogen-only pills to cause more bleeding irregularities when compared with combined oral contraceptives. Unintended pregnancies were not observed during any of the studies.The three included randomised controlled trials in this systematic review provided insufficient evidence to assess whether progestogen-only and combined contraceptives differ from non-hormonal contraceptives in diabetes control,  and complications. Two of the three studies were of limited methodological quality, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and described surrogate outcomes. Ideally, an adequately reported, high-quality randomised controlled trial analysing both intermediate outcomes (i.e. glucose and ) and true clinical endpoints (micro- and macrovascular disease) in users of combined, progestogen-only and non-hormonal contraceptives should be conducted. However, due to the low incidence of micro- and macrovascular disease and accordingly the large sample size and follow-up period needed to observe differences in risk, a randomised controlled trial might not be the ideal design.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1908177>Short-term and long-term effects of Norplant-2 on plasma lipoproteins and glucose tolerance.</a></h2><p>Twenty-five women using the -containing contraceptive implant, Norplant-2, were studied longitudinally, to see the effects on  profile, glucose tolerance and hepatic transaminases with short-term (12 weeks) and long-term (18 to 24 months) use of Norplant-2 [corrected]. Total lipids, cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides and their subfractions were evaluated. There was a significant increase in LDL-cholesterol after 12 weeks of use (p less than 0.05), which did not persist at 18-24 months follow-up.

This randomized, comparative, baseline controlled study was designed to investigate the effects of the preparations on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. The following formulations were studied: a monophasic preparation containing ethinylestradiol and desogestrel (M-DSG) and two triphasic formulations containing ethinylestradiol and gestodene or  respectively (T-GSD and T-LNG). These preparations were studied for six treatment cycles. Total cholesterol and apoprotein B did not change in any group. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was significantly decreased in the groups of women treated with M-DSG and T-GSD respectively. No changes were observed in the T-LNG group. With M-DSG, significant increases were observed in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL3 cholesterol, whilst HDL2 cholesterol did not change. With both T-GSD and T-LNG, no changes were observed in HDL cholesterol, whilst a significant increase in HDL3 cholesterol together with a trend to decrease in HDL2 cholesterol were observed. Apolipoprotein AI increased with the following ranking M-DSG greater than T-GSD greater than T-LNG. The LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio significantly decreased with both M-DSG and T-GSD. In the T-LNG group there was no change in this ratio. Triglycerides increased to the same extent in all treatment groups. As far as concerns the risk of arterial diseases, these three oral contraceptive formulations mostly induced negligible and/or partly favorable changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins; however, the lipoprotein pattern during M-DSG treatment resulted better than during T-GSD, and the latter turned out to be better than during T-LNG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11777489>The effects of two progestogen-only pills containing either desogestrel (75 microg/day) or  (30 microg/day) on .</a></h2><p>The effects of two progestogen-only pills (POPs) containing either desogestrel (75 microg/day) or  (30 microg/day) on  were compared in a double-blind, randomized study in Sweden and Finland. Eighty-one healthy female volunteers received either desogestrel 75 microg/day or  30 microg/day for seven treatment periods of 28 days. The following  parameters were measured at screening and at treatment Periods 3 and 7: total cholesterol, total triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, HDL(2)-cholesterol, HDL(3)-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), and the carrier proteins sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and cortisol-binding globulin. Overall, both study medications had similar, minimal effects on . To summarize, compared with pre-treatment, no changes were observed for LDL-cholesterol and its protein fraction apolipoprotein B. The concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides decreased marginally. Decreasing trends were also seen for lipoprotein (a), HDL-cholesterol and its subfractions, HDL(2)-cholesterol and HDL(3)-cholesterol, and the apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II. The results indicated no significant differences between the groups in any of the parameters, with the exception of a smaller decrease in HDL(3)-cholesterol at treatment Period 7 for the desogestrel-containing POP compared with the -containing POP and a significant difference between the two treatments for lipoprotein (a) at Period 3. The serum concentration of the carrier protein SHBG was found to be slightly higher in the desogestrel group, which may be a manifestation of the higher androgenicity of  compared with desogestrel. It can be concluded that the POP containing 75 microg desogestrel has a negligible effect on . Despite the higher progestogen dose, the effect of this new POP is similar to that of a traditional POP containing 30 microg .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1345289>[Health benefits of contraception].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3282811>Oral contraceptives: effects on glucose and  in insulin-dependent diabetic women and women with previous gestational diabetes.

This review examines in detail the clinical efficacy of the new COCs, where possible in comparison with those containing  or norethisterone, and their pharmacological effect on carbohydrate and , haematological factors, pituitary-ovarian function and serum protein and androgen concentrations. Based mainly on the pharmacological evidence, the newer COCs are an improvement over the older low-dose formulations and are clearly preferable to the high-dose ones. However, the older low-dose COCs, despite many years of use, have not resulted in a high incidence of adverse effects. The increasing use of the new COCs, as evidenced by their increasing market share throughout Europe, does indicate that they have been well accepted in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14712971>Serum  and lipoprotein changes induced by preparations containing low-dose ethinylestradiol plus .</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects on  of a new low-dose monophasic combination oral contraceptive with 100 microg  and 20 microg ethinylestradiol. Sixty healthy women aged 18-45 years were administered the medication during three cycles. The study participants were screened for  changes.

Based on the work of Nikkila, it shows the source of the production of HDL and LDL, the factors that can affect these lipoprotein levels, and where in the cascade of lipoprotein  these factors exert influence. The source of HDL production is the liver and the intestine. At this stage, diet, exercise, hormones, genetics, drugs, and certain disease states can affect HDL levels. Lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) esterifies HDL-free cholesterol in plasma, and HDL3 is formed that in turn is transformed to HDL2. At the same time, VLDL from the gut and the liver will be converted, under the influence of LPL, to HDL2 and LDL. Thus HDL2 is being formed by the breakdown of VLDL and from the transformation of HDL3 to HDL2. Insulin, exercise, alcohol, fats, drugs, and diet affect lipoprotein lipase and consequently influence levels of LDL and HDL2 indirectly. Progestogens increase and estrogens decrease hepatic endothelial lipase, thus affecting the HDL2 concentration. It is at this point that combination OCs influence HDL2. The balance between estrogen and progestogen in a given contraceptive determines the extent and direction of HDL2 concentration. A separate pathway in the liver also catabolizes HDL2 and HDL3. LDL is generated partly from catabolism of VLDL and is partly secreted from the liver. The removal of LDL is mediated by receptors in both the liver and peripheral tissues. It is here that the Brown-Goldstein theory plays a major role. If LDL receptors are present in an insufficient number or are defective, then the C will accumulate and atherosclerosis may follow. Thus two key enzymes, LCAT and LPL, control the production of HDL2 and LDL, whereas a third enzyme, hepatic endothelial lipase, catabolizes HDL2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1565306>New concepts in contraception: Norplant subdermal implant.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16234121>[Effects of -releasing intrauterine system on serum lipids and hepatic function].</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of -releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on serum lipids and hepatic function.Blood samples of 35 cases receiving LNG-IUS were collected and determined for serum lipids and hepatic functions.Six months after insertions, HDL-C and ApoA were increased significantly, while LDL-C and ApoB decreased significantly.

The current challenge is to minimize the side effects and metabolic impact of the administered hormones in both oral contraceptives and hormone replacement agents. When the dose of estrogen in oral contraceptives was reduced the risk of thromboembolism decreased, but the androgenic side effects of the progestin became increasingly apparent. The addition of progestins to hormone replacement therapy reduces the risk of endometrial cancer associated with unopposed estrogen, but their androgenicity offsets the favorable effects of estrogen on . Androgens not only cause troublesome clinical side effects but also induce changes in blood levels of lipoproteins that have been associated with an increased risk of atherogenesis and coronary heart disease, as well as alterations in glucose and insulin levels. Both the side effects and the adverse effects on lipoprotein and glucose  can be reduced by the use of less androgenic progestins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8631192>Interaction of oral contraceptive use with the effects of age, exercise habits and other cardiovascular risk modifiers on metabolic risk markers.</a></h2><p>An analysis was undertaken to determine whether combined oral contraceptive (OC) use interacts with the effects of potential cardiovascular risk modifiers (age, body mass index, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, exercise habit, family histories of heart disease or diabetes, number of pregnancies and duration of OC use) on blood pressure and , lipoprotein, glucose and insulin risk markers for cardiovascular disease. Relationships between risk modifiers and risk markers were compared between non-users (n = 418) and users of low-estrogen dose OC (n = 925, categorised according to progestin content as monophasic , triphasic , norethindrone or desogestrel). OC use diminished the adverse effects of age on glucose tolerance. Aerobic exercise had a particularly beneficial effect on triglyceride levels and OGTT insulin response in OC users. The rise in HDL and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations with alcohol intake seen in non-users was diminished in OC users. Increasing duration of use of a desogestrel combination was associated with increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations. No adverse effects of risk modifiers on metabolic risk markers and blood pressure were augmented by OC use, and some were even diminished.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10580168>Estradiol 17beta inhibition of LDL oxidation and endothelial cell cytotoxicity is opposed by progestins to different degrees.</a></h2><p>Progestins oppose the effects of estrogens in many biological systems, but it is not known if progestins oppose the antioxidant effects of estrogen and to differing degrees. To test these questions, the effects of various sex steroids on LDL oxidation and cytotoxicity were studied in the absence or presence of endothelial cells. Freshly isolated LDL was incubated in the presence of Cu(++) in the absence or presence of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells in phenol red-free medium and without or with hormones in 0.5% ethanol. The hormones included 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), progesterone (Pg), norgestimate (NGM),  (LNG), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). LDL oxidation was measured as formation of conjugated dienes,  peroxides, and TBARS, and cyotoxicity by tetrazolium salt reduction (MTT reduction). Progestins diminished conjugated diene lag phase, accelerated  peroxide and TBARS production in the absence and presence of cells and accelerated cytotoxicity. When E(2) and progestin were incubated with cells at a molar ratio of 1:5,  peroxides were reduced from baseline by E(2) alone 31%, E(2)/Pg 29%, E(2)/NGM 16%, E(2)/LNG 9% (all P<0.05 or more) and E(2)/MPA 8% (ns) (E(2) or E(2)E(2)/NGM, E(2)/LNG and E(2)/MPA [P<0.001]; E(2)E(2)/LNG or E(2)/MPA [P<0.05]). MTT reduction followed a similar gradient, greatest with E(2) alone, least with E(2)/MPA.Progestins promote LDL oxidation and, conjointly, endothelial cell cytotoxicity. Progestins oppose the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of estrogen when given in combination. MPA and LNG have the strongest prooxidant and cytotoxic effects, which may limit the cardiovascular benefit of estrogen during combined administration in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12342192>Approaches vary in managing the over-40 pill patient.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970309>Effects of long-term estrogen replacement therapy versus combined hormone replacement therapy on nitric oxide-dependent vasomotor function.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen may increase production of the predominant endothelium-derived vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) and consequently improve vascular reactivity. In contrast, concurrent progestin therapy may oppose this beneficial effect. We studied the effect of long-term estrogen HRT and combined HRT on vasomotor function and on plasma nitrate, which reflects the amount of NO in the circulation. As  peroxidation affects NO production and impairs endothelial function, we also measured the amount of the in vivo  peroxidation marker urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha). The study group comprised 15 women receiving estradiol valerate HRT (mean age, 56 yr; treatment duration, 10.5 yr) and 15 women receiving combined HRT with estradiol valerate and  (mean age, 58 yr; treatment duration, 11.3 yr). The peak flow velocity (PFV) and pulsatility index of the common carotid and internal carotid artery and the abdominal aorta were measured by ultrasonography after long-term HRT (baseline), after a 4-wk pause and again 3 wk after reintroducing HRT. A statistically significant interaction between the groups and time points was observed in the PFV of the internal carotid artery (P = 0.011). In women taking estradiol valerate, the PFV values decreased significantly after withdrawal of HRT (P = 0.007) and increased again to the baseline level after reintroduction of therapy (P < 0.001). In women receiving combined HRT, the PFV remained stable over all study periods. At baseline, the PFV of women taking estradiol valerate correlated with the plasma nitrate concentration in the common carotid artery (r = 0.646; P = 0.009) and in the abdominal aorta (r = 0.579; P = 0.024). For pulsatility index and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) excretion, there were no significant differences between the groups. Our results suggest that the favorable effects of long-term estrogen treatment on blood flow are at least partly mediated through NO. The addition of  to the treatment regimen appears to abolish this effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2449395>Oral contraceptive absorption and sex hormone binding globulins in obese women: effects of jejunoileal bypass.</a></h2><p>Plasma levels of two oral contraceptive gestagens were studied during 24 hour oral challenges in seven morbidly obese women after jejunoileal bypass comparing the results to unoperated normal controls. To study binding and transport of the gestagens, sex hormone binding globulin levels were determined in these patients, in normal-weight controls, and in unoperated morbidly obese patients. The unoperated morbidly obese patients had significantly decreased levels of sex hormone binding globulin, compared to normal-weight controls and to the jejunoileal bypass patients, whose levels were similar to the controls. The jejunoileal bypass patients had a reduced capacity to absorb oral contraceptive gestagens, although the plasma levels were of the same magnitude found in normal subjects using lower doses of gestagens. However, the gestagen to sex hormone binding globulin ratio was lower in jejunoileal bypass patients, implying reduced biologic activity and thus reduced contraceptive efficiency of the gestagen. There were no enzymatic or morphologic signs of liver dysfunction. No correlations were found between plasma gestagen levels and number or volume of stools, fecal  excretion, or intravenous C-cholic acid load. It is concluded that caution must be exercised in prescribing oral contraceptives to jejunoileal bypass patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12629101>The male contraceptive regimen of testosterone and  significantly increases lean mass in healthy young men in 4 weeks, but attenuates a decrease in  mass induced by testosterone alone.</a></h2><p>In hypogonadal men, testosterone (T) in replacement dosages is known to increase -free mass (lean mass) and decrease  mass. In young eugonadal men, similar dosages of T increase lean mass, but much higher dosages of T are required to decrease total body  mass. Current T-based male hormonal contraceptive regimens include a second agent, such as a progestin, to maximize inhibition of pituitary gonadotropins and improve efficacy. To study the effect of such combinations on body composition, we randomized healthy, young, eugonadal men into four combinations of exogenous T and the progestin,  (LNG): 1) 100 mg T enanthate, im, weekly plus 125 micro g LNG, orally, daily (T+LNG); 2) T plus placebo LNG (T alone); 3) placebo T plus LNG (LNG alone); and 4) placebo T plus placebo LNG (placebo). We then analyzed body composition by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry after 4 and 8 wk of treatment. T+LNG significantly increased total lean mass after 4 and 8 wk of treatment (3.5 +/- 0.9% and 4.2 +/- 1.2%, respectively; P < 0.05) and truncal lean mass after 4 and 8 wk of treatment (4.7 +/- 0.9% and 5.0 +/- 0.9%, respectively; P < 0.05) compared with baseline and placebo. T alone also increased total and truncal lean mass significantly compared with placebo after 4 wk of treatment, but not compared with baseline (3.3 +/- 1.4% and 3.2 +/- 2.3%, respectively; P < 0.05 vs. placebo), suggesting an additive effect of T and LNG to increase lean mass.  mass significantly decreased in the abdomen in men administered T alone compared with LNG alone (-4.9 +/- 2.8%; P < 0.05).  mass significantly increased in the abdomen with LNG alone (4.1 +/- 1.0%; P < 0.05) compared with baseline and was unchanged with the combination of T+LNG, suggesting that LNG attenuates the decrease in  mass seen with T alone. There was no change in weight or body mass index in any group during the study. This study shows that in young eugonadal men 1) T alone rapidly increases lean mass and decreases  mass in 4-8 wk; 2) T+LNG rapidly increases lean mass, but has no effect on  mass; and 3) LNG alone increases  mass. The favorable profile on body composition by T is, therefore, partially attenuated by the progestin, LNG. These findings suggest that androgen-based male hormonal contraceptives might have favorable effects on body composition. The impact of these changes on cardiovascular risk in normal men needs further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1827568>Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins during postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy combined with either 19-nortestosterone derivatives or 17-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives.</a></h2><p>To study the influence of combined hormone replacement therapy on levels of serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins.One hundred thirty-nine healthy early postmenopausal women selected by means of a questionnaire, a medical examination, and a laboratory screening procedure to be a representative sample of postmenopausal Danish women aged 45 to 55 years old were randomized to four treatment and two placebo groups. The four groups receiving hormone replacement therapy were given 2 mg estradiol valerate equivalents (E), either sequentially combined with 75 micrograms  (E/LNG), 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (E/MPA), or 150 micrograms desogestrel (E/DG), or continuously combined with 1 mg cyproterone acetate (E/CPA). Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were measured before institution of hormone replacement therapy and at nine well-defined times during the following 84 days. Total response and cyclical variations were calculated.All active treatment regimens reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly: E/CPA, 6% (95% confidence limits 0.3% to 11.3%); E/LNG, 10.9% (4.9% to 16.6%); E/MPA, 14.4% (7.4% to 20.9%); E/DG, 10.7% (3.3% to 17.6%). The changes in serum total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were similar but smaller than those in LDL-C. None of these treatment regimens induced significant overall changes in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1).

Sixteen women were randomized to receive 3 cycles of treatment with 30 microg ethinylestradiol/150 microg  (EE/LNG) and 3 cycles of treatment with 30 microg ethinylestradiol/75 microg gestodene (EE/GSD). Before and after treatment the plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO), homocysteine, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides were measured. No significant alterations of the NO, homocysteine, and triglyceride plasma levels were observed during use of both contraceptive pills. Compared to levels after EE/LNG treatment, HDL plasma levels were higher (P =.05) and the cholesterol/HDL ratio was lower after the EE/GSD pill (P =.05). Significant correlations were found between NO and homocysteine and NO and cholesterol.

Healthy, female volunteers (1189 women) either not using OC (non-users) or currently using one of six different combined formulations (users) were compared. Combinations studied contained 30-40 micrograms ethinyl estradiol combined with the progestins , norethindrone (at two and three different doses, respectively) or desogestrel. After statistical standardisation to account for the significantly greater age of the non-users and longer duration of OC use amongst the  combination users, mean blood pressure was higher, compared with non-users, in users of monophasic or triphasic  combinations (systolic: +4.3 mmHg (p < 0.001) and +2.7 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively; diastolic: +2.6 mmHg (p < 0.001) and +2.3 mmHg (p < 0.05), respectively).

To investigate the effect of progestogen and 17 beta-estradiol replacement therapy on atherogenesis, we studied 60 cholesterol-fed ovariectomized rabbits for 13 weeks. They were randomly assigned to four groups of 15 rabbits each and received oral treatment with norethisterone acetate, , 17 beta-estradiol, or placebo. The active treatment groups achieved serum hormone concentrations, which produced physiological effects on the uterus. No significant differences in serum total cholesterol or ultracentrifuged lipoproteins (very low density, intermediate density, low density, or high density lipoproteins) were found between the four groups during the experimental period. There were no significant differences between the progestogen and placebo groups in the aortic accumulation of cholesterol. The estradiol group had only accumulated about half the aortic cholesterol as compared with the placebo group and the progestogen groups (p less than 0.05). The antiatherogenic effect of 17 beta-estradiol was estimated to be equal to a 40-50% reduction in serum total cholesterol. These findings suggest that two commonly prescribed 19-nortestosterone-derived progestogens, which are considered to be "atherogenic," do not affect atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed ovariectomized rabbits, whereas 17 beta-estradiol produces a significant antiatherogenic effect that is independent of  in plasma, possibly the result of a direct action on the arterial wall.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11888095>Intrauterine 10 microg and 20 microg  systems in postmenopausal women receiving oral oestrogen replacement therapy: clinical, endometrial and metabolic response.</a></h2><p>The clinical and endometrial efficacy and  response of two different doses of intrauterine  were assessed in comparison with sequential oral medroxyprogesterone acetate in postmenopausal women receiving continuous oral E2-valerate.One-year prospective multicentre randomised control trial.Four outpatient clinics in Oulu, Helsinki and Jyväskylä, Finland.A total of 163 healthy volunteer postmenopausal women with climacteric complaints or already using hormone replacement therapy (HRT).Subjects were randomly allocated to receive a new intrauterine system releasing 10 microg of  daily or an established intrauterine system (Mirena) releasing 20 microg of  daily or sequential oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (5mg/day, 14/30 days). All three regimens were combined with an oral daily dose of 2mg of E2-valerate.Bleeding patterns were assessed by diaries kept by the subjects. Endometrial effects were evaluated by histologic biopsies taken at the baseline and after six and 12 months of therapy.

After six months of therapy, 43 (95.6%) of the 47 subjects receiving 10 microg  and 54 (98.2%) of the 55 subjects receiving 20 microg  had no bleeding, while the sequential medroxyprogesterone acetate regimen produced typical cyclic withdrawal bleedings.

After 12 months of therapy, strong endometrial suppression was found in 46/47 and 55/55 of the subjects receiving 10 microg and 20 microg of , respectively, while the endometrium was proliferative in 18/47 of the subjects in the medroxyprogesterone acetate group. Serum total cholesterol decreased in all treatment groups. HDL cholesterol increased in women receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate or the smaller intrauterine dose of .Both intrauterine doses of  provided good endometrial protection in postmenopausal women on oestrogen replacement therapy. The advantage of the 10 microg system with a smaller size is the easier insertion of the system and a minimal attenuation of the favourable effects of oral oestrogen on the serum  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20858187>Protrhombotic effects of contraceptives.</a></h2><p>The use of oral contraceptives first became widespread some 40 years ago, and reports of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease among women who used these agents soon followed. Few drugs have been the object of such intensive epidemiological research, the outcome of which has provided clinicians with detailed information about risks not only of specific thrombotic diseases but also important non-contraceptive benefits from the pill. Recently, oral contraceptives have been classified by some according to "generation" (first, second, third, and most recently, fourth generation): first-generation formulations containing lynestrenol or norethindrone, second-generation formulations containing , third-generation formulations containing desogestrel or gestodene, and oral contraceptives containing an estrogen and other progestagens (cyproterone or norgestimate) or a progestagen alone. The results of several study was that the use of the older high-dose oral contraceptives increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by modifying the Low-density lipoprotein and High-Density lipoprotein cholesterol level, increasing triglyceride serum level, reducing glucose tolerance, raising blood pressure, and promoting clotting mechanisms. In this review we investigate the mechanism of the oral contraceptives and performed a risk assessment of every generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3111786>Glucose and  with triphasic oral contraceptives in women with history of gestational diabetes.</a></h2><p>The glucose and  in a group of women with previous history of gestational diabetes were evaluated before and after 6 months treatment with a low-dose triphasic oral contraceptives pill (TP). This group was compared with a control group of women, also with history of gestational diabetes, using intrauterine devices (IUD). In the TP group, 26.7% of the women developed impaired glucose tolerance which reverted to normal in all but one after cessation of the TP. The IUD group showed no change in glucose tolerance. The integrated insulin response to a 75g OGTT in the TP group increased by 48.3% at 6 months compared with an increase of 23.4% for the same period in the IUD group. In the TP group there was a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol without changes in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides level. We conclude that even low-dose triphasic oral contraceptive pills can cause glucose intolerance in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus.</p></html>
