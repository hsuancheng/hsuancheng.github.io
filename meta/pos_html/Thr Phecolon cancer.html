The NH2-terminal sequence of the glycoprotein from normal  lavages is Lys-Leu--lle-Glu-Ser--Pro--(Asn)-Val-Ala-Glu-Gly-Lys-Glu-Val-(Leu,lle)-(Leu,lle)-(Leu,lle)-Val-(His,Arg?)-?-(Leu,lle). This is homologous to the NH2-terminal sequence of 23 of the first 24 amino acids of carcinoembryonic antigen isolated from tumor tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6547917>Isolation and primary structure of human PHI (peptide HI).</a></h1><p>The isolation of the human form of PHI (peptide HI) is described. The peptide was purified from human  extracts by using a chemical method for the detection of its C-terminal amidated structure. Human PHI consists of 27 amino acid residues and the complete amino acid sequence is: His-Ala-Asp-Gly-Val---Ser-Asp--Ser-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gly-Gln-Leu-Ser- Ala-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Met-NH2. The differences between the structures of porcine and human PHI are at position 12 (Arg/Lys replacement) and at position 27 (Ile/Met).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19035308>Continuous administration of the somatostatin structural derivative /TT-232/ by subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump improves the efficacy and potency of antitumor therapy in different mouse and human tumor models.</a></h1><p>The somatostatin structural derivative, TT-232, has a special 5-residue ring structure (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys--NH2) and very different characteristics from the known growth hormone (GH) active somatostatin analogs. This somatostatin structural derivative has no GH release inhibitory or antisecretory activity and does not bind to rat pituitary or the cortex, where all the known somatostatin receptor subtypes are expressed. TT-232 had previously been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a large number of  cell lines in vitro and reduce the size of different tumors in animal models in vivo.The therapeutic efficacy of TT-232 was evaluated in different long-term administration routes: the traditional injection (i.p. or s.c.) versus infusion treatment via s.c.- or i.v.-inserted Alzet osmotic minipump, and on different types of transplantable rodent (S-180 sarcoma, P-388sc lymphoid leukemia, -26 adenocarcinoma, MXT breast carcinoma, B-16 melanoma) and human tumor models (HT-18 lymphoid melanoma, T-47/D breast carcinoma, A-431 epidermoid carcinoma). On the basis of our previous experiments the optimum injected dose of TT-232 was found to be 15 microg/kg twice a day. This dose is equivalent to 0.6 dg/day by infusion therapy.In our experiments, the best results were achieved when TT-232 was applied as an infused treatment. In the S-180 sarcoma and P-388sc lymphoid leukemia rodent tumor models the infusion treatment with TT-232 resulted in 61%-100% tumor growth inhibition and in 20%-60% of the mice being long-term and tumor-free survivors. In the aggressive -26 adenocarcinoma and MXT breast carcinoma models, the infusion treatment resulted in 52%-75% tumor growth inhibition. In the B-16 melanoma model, the infusion treatments resulted in 47% -63% growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of infusion treatment with TT-232 on HT-18 human lymphoid melanoma tumor proved to be significant, resulting in 69%-79% decreases in tumor volume. In the T-47/D human breast carcinoma, the infusion treatment resulted in 48%-53% tumor growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of infusion treatment on A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma tumor resulted in 70%-74% decreases in tumor volume.The antitumor efficacy of TT-232 was seen in almost all the tumors investigated. In our study, the route of infusion was shown to increase drug efficacy relative to conventional delivery methods (injection). The results obtained from this study suggest that TT-232 is a promising new antitumor agent in  chemotherapy and a good candidate for delivery by continuous (infusion) therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21528233>Mutational analysis of the hMSH2 gene in a wide variety of tumors.</a></h1><p>The hMSH2 gene participates in DNA mismatch repair and its mutation can result in genetic instability of the human genome which is an important feature of tumorigenesis. In this study, genetic alterations of the hMSH2 gene were examined in 43 ovarian, 36 non-small cell lung (NSCL), 31 poorly differentiated gastric, 15 endometrial, and 11  cancers, nine gastric  cell lines, 41 adult T-cell leukemias (ATLs), two ATL cell lines, and 37 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was also investigated for ovarian, NSCL, and  cancers. The incidence of MSI was 1/36 (3%) for NSCL, 2/23 (9%) for ovarian, and 1/11 (9%) for  cancers. Missense base changes of the hMSH2 gene were identified in two gastric  patients (ATG to ATA resulting in Met changing to Ile at codon 688 in exon 13 and ACA to GCA resulting in  changing to Ala at codon 803 in exon 14). These mutations were found in samples with no MSI. One ovarian and one gastric , and six ATL samples showed two types of polymorphisms of hMSH2 (CTT to TTT resulting in Leu changing to  at codon 390 in exon 7 and CAG to AAG resulting in Gin to Arg at codon 419 in exon 7). Our data suggest that MSI and hMSH2 mutations are uncommon in sporadic tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2866794>Amino acid sequence of human tumor derived angiogenin.</a></h1><p>The amino acid sequence and disulfide bond pairing of human tumor derived angiogenin, the first tumor angiogenesis factor to be isolated in pure form from human sources, have been determined by conventional sequencing techniques adapted and applied to nanomole and subnanomole levels of material. Angiogenin, obtained from conditioned media of a human  adenocarcinoma cell line, is a single-chain protein consisting of 123 amino acids with the following sequences: less than Glu1-Asp-Asn-Ser-Arg-Tyr--His- -Leu--Gln-His-Tyr-Asp15-Ala-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gly-Arg-Asp-Asp- Arg-Tyr-Cys-Glu-Ser-Ile-Met30- Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Leu--Ser-Pro-Cys-Lys-Asp-Ile-Asn-- Phe45-Ile-His-Gly-Asn-Lys-Arg-Ser -Ile-Lys-Ala-Ile-Cys-Glu-Asn-Lys60-Asn-Gly-Asn-Pro-His-Arg-Glu-Asn -Leu-Arg-Ile -Ser-Lys-Ser-Ser75 --Gln-Val---Cys-Lys-Leu-His-Gly-Gly-Ser-Pro-Trp-Pro90-Pro -Cys-Gln-Tyr -Arg-Ala--Ala -Gly--Arg-Asn-Val-Val-Val105-Ala-Cys-Glu-Asn-Gly-Leu-Pro-Val- His-Leu-Asp-Gln-Ser-Ile-Phe120-Arg-Arg-Pro123-OH. Three disulfide bonds link the half-cystinyl residues 26-81, 39-92, and 57-107. The sequence is homologous to that of the pancreatic ribonucleases with 35% identity and many of the remaining residues conservatively replaced. Similarities are especially apparent around the major active-site residues His-12, Lys-41, and His-119 of ribonuclease which are conserved as are three of the four disulfide bonds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22273147>New lyophilized kit for rapid radiofluorination of peptides.</a></h1><p>Radiolabeling compounds with positron-emitting radionuclides often involves a time-consuming, customized process. Herein, we report a simple lyophilized kit formulation for labeling peptides with (18)F, based on the aluminum-fluoride procedure. The prototype kit contains IMP485, a NODA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetate)-MPAA (methyl phenylacetic acid)-di-HSG (histamine-succinyl-glycine) hapten-peptide, [NODA-MPAA-D-Lys(HSG)-D-Tyr-D-Lys(HSG)-NH(2)], used for pretargeting, but we also examined a similar kit formulation for a somatostatin-binding peptide [IMP466, NOTA-D--Cys--D-Trp-Lys--Cys-Throl] bearing a NOTA ligand to determine if the benefits of using a kit can be extended to other AlF-binding peptides. The NODA-MPAA ligand forms a single stable complex with (AlF)(2+) in high yields. In order to establish suitable conditions for a facile kit, the formulation was optimized for pH, peptide to Al(3+) ratio, bulking agent, radioprotectant, and the buffer. For optimal labeling, the kit was reconstituted with an aqueous solution of (18)F(-) and ethanol (1:1), heated at 100-110 °C for 15 min, and then simply and rapidly purified using one of two equally effective solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods. Al(18)F-IMP485 was isolated as a single isomer complex, in high yield (45-97%) and high specific activity (up to 223 GBq/μmol), within 20 min. The labeled product was stable in human serum at 37 °C for 4 h and in vivo, urine samples showed the intact product was eliminated. Tumor targeting of the Al(18)F-IMP485 in nude mice bearing human  xenografts pretargeted with an anti-CEACAM5 bispecific antibody showed very low uptake (0.06% ± 0.02 ID/g) in bone, further illustrating its stability. At 1 h, pretargeted animals had high Al(18)F-IMP485 tumor uptake (28.1% ± 4.5 ID/g), with ratios of 9 ± 4, 123 ± 38, 110 ± 43, and 120 ± 108 for kidney, liver, blood and bone, respectively. Tumor uptake remained high at 3 h postinjection, with increased tumor/nontumor ratios. The NOTA-somatostatin-binding peptide also was fluorinated with good yield and high specific activity in the same kit formulation. However, yields were somewhat lower than those achieved with IMP485 containing the NODA-MPAA ligand, likely reflecting this ligand's superior binding properties over the simple NOTA. These studies indicate that (18)F-labeled peptides can be reproducibly prepared as stable Al-F complexes with good radiochemical yield and high specific activity using a simple, one-step, lyophilized kit followed by a rapid purification by SPE that provides the (18)F-peptide ready for patient injection within 30 min.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14501379>TT-232: a somatostatin structural derivative as a potent antitumor drug candidate.</a></h1><p>TT-232 (D--Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Cys--NH2) has been developed as an antitumor somatostatin analog. TT-232 has no growth hormone release inhibitory effect and does not inhibit the secretion of gastric acid. This analog induces apoptosis in and exerts pronounced antiproliferative effects on various human tumors (, pancreas, lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, hepatoma) cell lines. The growth of human xenografts (prostate, breast carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma) and animal tumors (-26, P-388, S-180, B16, MXT) was inhibited by TT-232 (dose range: 30-750 microg/kg/day) in 54-98% of cases. Continuous long-term infusion proved to be the most effective way of administration. TT-232 combined with decarbazine or etoposide treatment enhanced the antitumor activity of these drugs on human melanoma and lymphoma xenografts, respectively. Regarding the mode of action, TT-232 activates cell cycle inhibitors via SSTR receptors, inhibits tyrosine kinases through interfering with the proliferative signaling cascades, and interacts with an intracellular receptor and an enzyme involved in glycolysis causing translocation of this enzyme to the nucleus, thus inducing apoptosis. TT-232 may be a promising candidate in the therapy of human malignancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20641421>HSDAVFTDNYTKLRKQ-NIe-AVKK-(3-OCH3,4-OH)-FLNSSV-GABA-L-(Dap-(BMA))-Cu.</a></h1><p>HSDAVFTDNYTKLRKQ-Nle-AVKK-(2-OCH3,4OH)-FLNSSV-GABA-L-(Dap-(BMA)2)-Cu (Cu-TP3939) is a radiolabeled molecular imaging agent developed for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumors with overexpression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) receptors (1, 2). Cu is a positron emitter with a half-life () of 12.7 h. VIP and PACAP38 are two basic C-terminally amidated peptides (28 amino acids and 38 amino acids, respectively) that possess a remarkable amino acid homology (3-6). VIP was initially isolated from porcine intestine, and PACAP38 was isolated from bovine hypothalamus (7-9).(Later, another form of PACAP was isolated with sequence homologous to N-terminal 27 amino acid secued of PACAP28 and named PACAP27.). VIP (HSDAVFTDNYTRLRKQMAVKKYLNSILN-NH) is a hydrophobic, basic peptide that contains three lysine residues (1520, and 21, ), two arginine residues (12 and 14, ), two tyrosine residues (10 and 22, ), an essential histidine residue at the N terminus, and an amidated C-terminus (10). The sequence of PACAP27 shows 68% identity with VIP (11). Like VIP, PACAP27 also has an amidated C-terminal and histidine residue at the N terminus. VIP and PACAP are known regulators within the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. VIP has been shown to have a broad range of activities as a neuroendocrine mediator in diverse cells and tissues (12). Similarly, PACAP has also been shown to act as a hormone, a neurohormone, a neurotransmitter, and a trophic factor in a number of tissues (11). VIP and PACAP act through common G-protein–coupled receptors (11, 12). Three main subtypes of VIP/PACAP receptors are identified as PAC, VPAC, and VPAC. PACAP binds with high affinity to all three receptors, but VIP binds with high affinity to VPAC and VPAC and with low affinity to PAC. These receptors have been shown to be overexpressed on many human tumors, including breast (100% receptor incidence), prostate (100%), ovarian (100%), pancreas (65%), lung (58%),  (96%), stomach (54%), liver (49%), and urinary bladder (100%) carcinomas, as well as lymphomas (58%) and meningiomas (100%) (5, 13). These receptors are potential molecular targets for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of various cancers (14-17). I-Labeled VIP (I-VIP) was prepared for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric carcinomas, as well as carcinoid tumors (18-20). The results were generally promising in that both primary and metastatic lesions in the liver, lung, and lymph nodes were visualized (21, 22). Tc-Labeled VIP (Tc-VIP) analogs were also developed because Tc is more readily available for clinical applications (23-25). In the initial Tc radiolabeling, VIP was conjugated at the N terminal of the histidine residue with a bifunctional chelating agent for Tc labeling. This Tc-VIP analog had relatively high radiochemical impurities and a loss of biological activity because the histidine residue was required for the VIP biological activity. In an effort to improve Tc labeling, Pallela et al. (24) prepared TP3654 (named according to its molecular weight) using 4-aminobutyric acid as a spacer and extended the peptide to include a tetrapeptide moiety of Gly-Gly-(d)-Ala-Gly, which provided an N configuration for Tc chelation. The biological activity of Tc-TP3654 was similar to that of native VIP28, and the binding to the human colorectal  was receptor-specific with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC) of 1.5 × 10 M. To prepare a PET probe for VIP imaging, Thakur et al. (25) synthesized Cu-TP3982 (IC = 8.1 × 10 M) for PET imaging of oncogene VPAC receptors overexpressed in human breast  cells by synthesizing a protected diaminedithiol (NS)-VIP for Cu chelation. Cu-TP3939, another VIP analog, was also successfully prepared for PET imaging of experimental human prostate  in mice (1, 2). This analog with Lys, Nle, (3-OH, 4-OH) , Val, and  was found to be more potent and more biologically stable than the native VIP28 (26, 27). It contains a carboxy terminus lysine residue separated from VIP-asparagine by a γ-aminobutyric acid spacer, and NS is used as the chelating agent. Zhang et al. (1) showed that Cu-TP3939 is a promising molecular imaging probe for PET imaging of prostate . Another study (2) from the same research group also demonstrated the potential use of PET imaging of Cu-TP3939 for human breast cancers.</p></html>
