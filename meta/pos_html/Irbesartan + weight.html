Therefore, we aimed to assess their acute toxicity for deriving triage recommendations.An observational case series with data collected retrospectively from eight PICs in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Inclusion criteria were monoexposure, defined dose, and documented follow-up.In total, 206 cases of exposures to angiotensin II antagonists were included (candesartan, 94; eprosartan, 3; , 20; losartan, 26; olmesartan, 16; telmisartan, 18; and valsartan, 29). The median dose expressed as a multiple of their maximum daily dose for adults adjusted to  (MDDw) was 2.3 in children and 6.8 in adults. Patients involved were 150 children with a median age of 2 years and a median  of 13 kg and 56 adults with a median age of 47 years and a median  of 70 kg. Most children remained asymptomatic (82.7%), 16.7% developed minor symptoms. Only once, a low blood pressure of 60/40 mm Hg required intravenous fluids after ingestion of a 8.75-fold MDDw of candesartan by a 2.5-year-old toddler. Among adults, 53.6% remained asymptomatic while almost half of the patients suffered from minor (37.5%) or moderate (8.9%) symptoms.As no or only minor symptoms were observed after ingestion of less than a fivefold MDDw in both children and adults, only symptomatic patients and those who have ingested a fivefold MDDw or higher dose should be referred for medical assessment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17581624>Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism in a patient with an incidentally found adrenal mass.</a></h2><p>A 50-year-old woman who was complaining of abdominal pain was referred to the endocrine clinic after a small (0.8 cm by 0.8 cm) mass was found in her right adrenal gland on CT examination of the abdomen. She had a history of hypertension for 10 years, generalized anxiety disorder for 5 years and a  increase of 18 kg over the previous 3 years. The patient did not report weakness, polyuria or excessive thirst. She had a history of hypokalemia while on hydrochlorothiazide therapy. To improve blood pressure control, a total of three antihypertensive medications had been sequentially added to her regimen. At presentation, medications included 300 mg  daily, 5 mg amlodipine daily and 100 mg sustained-release metoprolol daily.Renin activity, levels of plasma aldosterone and levels of fractionated plasma metanephrines were measured and an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test was performed. In addition, measurements of urine aldosterone excretion on a high-salt diet, MRI-examination of the adrenal glands and bilateral adrenal vein sampling were conducted.An aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma.The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the right adrenal gland, which led to normalization of aldosterone excretion, lowering of her blood pressure on a single antihypertensive medication (50 mg sustained-release metoprolol daily) and resolution of hypokalemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15500387>Telmisartan - killing two birds with one stone.</a></h2><p>In theory, a drug that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system in order to lower blood pressure and acts as a PPARgamma agonist to increase insulin sensitivity, could be very useful in the treatment of coexisting Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Telmisartan is an angiotensin Type 1 (AT(1))-receptor antagonist being used in the treatment of hypertension. Recent studies suggest that telmisartan is also a partial PPARgamma agonist. In an animal model of insulin resistance, telmisartan lowered serum levels of glucose, insulin and triglycerides, and . Thus, telmisartan, an AT(1)-receptor antagonist and PPARgamma agonist, represents the prototype of a new approach to treating coexisting diabetes and hypertension, which needs to be evaluated clinically.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125946>Identification and determination of selected angiotensin II receptor antagonist group drugs by HPLC method.</a></h2><p>Losartan potassium, valsartan, telmisartan, , eprosartan mesylate and candesartan cilexitil, the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were analyzed in bulk substances and in tablets: Lorista tablets 50 mg, Diovan tablets 160 mg, Micardis tablets 20 mg, Aprovel tablets 300 mg, Teveten tablets 600 mg and Blopress tablets 16 mg. The conditions for identification by HPLC method in a gradient system and for determination of those compounds in isocratic systems were developed. The determination was carried out using Zorbax SB-Phenyl column with UV-VIS detector set at 230 nm and the following mobile phases: 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate (pH = 5.5) - acetonitrile - methanol in 35:9:6 v/v/v ratio for eprosartan mesylate and valsartan, in 15:6:4 v/v/v ratio for losartan potassium and  and in 10:9:6 v/v/v ratio for telmisartan and candesartan cilexitil. The recovery from simulated tablets was determined and amounted to: for eprosartan mesylate - 99.04%, valsartan - 100.0%, losartan potassium - 100.03%,  - 100.35%, telmisartan - 100.06% and candesartan cilexitil - 100.40%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27919004> ameliorates hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis in type 2 diabetic db/db mice via stimulating PPAR-γ, AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling and autophagy.</a></h2><p> (Irb), a unique subset of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with PPAR-γ activation function, has been reported to play a role in renal dysfunction, glucose , and abnormal  profile in diabetic animal models and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms that improve hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis are unclear. This study investigated the effects of Irb on  and hepatic steatosis using the spontaneous type 2 diabetic db/db mouse model. The results demonstrated body and liver weight, food consumption,  content in serum and liver tissue, and liver dysfunction as well as hepatic steatosis were increased in db/db mice compared with db/m mice, whereas the increases were reversed by Irb treatment. Moreover, Irb administration resulted in an increase in LC3BII as well as the LC3BII/I ratio through activating PPAR-γ and p-AMPK and inhibiting p-Akt and p-mTOR, thereby inducing autophagy in the db/db mouse liver. Therefore, our findings suggest that Irb can ameliorate hyperlipidemia and liver steatosis by upregulating the expression of PPAR-γ, activating the AMPK/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and inducing liver autophagy.Copyright © 2016.

The method is based on the reaction of carboxylic acid group of the oxidized  with a mixture of potassium iodate (KIO(3)) and iodide (KI) to form yellow colored triiodide ions in aqueous medium at 30+/-1 degrees C. The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of change of absorbance at 352 nm. The initial-rate and fixed-time (DeltaA) methods are adopted for constructing the calibration curves, which were found to be linear over the concentration ranges of 10.0-60.0 and 7.5-60.0 microg ml(-1) respectively. The regression analysis of calibration data yielded the linear equations: rate=-2.138 x 10(-6)+1.058 x 10(-4)C and DeltaA=-3.75 x 10(-3)+3.25 x 10(-3)C for initial rate and fixed time (DeltaA) methods, respectively. The limit of detection for initial rate and fixed time methods are 0.21 and 2.40 mug ml(-1), respectively. The various activation parameters such as E(a), DeltaH++, DeltaS++ and DeltaG++ are also calculated for the reaction and found to be 70.95+/-0.43 kJ mol(-1), 68.48+/-0.21 kJ mol(-1), 16.54+/-0.24 J K(-1) mol(-1) and -4.94+/-0.07 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The proposed methods are optimized and validated as per the guidelines of International Conference on Harmonisation (U.S.A.). The point and interval hypothesis tests have been performed which indicate that there is no significant difference between the proposed methods and the reference method. The methods have been successfully applied to the determination of  in commercial dosage forms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9475275>Acute renal effects of AT1-receptor blockade after exogenous angiotensin II infusion in healthy subjects.</a></h2><p>In 10 healthy normotensive volunteers on a normal sodium diet, we evaluated the renal effects of a single oral dose of 50 mg of  (SR 47436, BMS 186295), an angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist, in baseline conditions and during an exogenous angiotensin II infusion (2.5 ng/kg/min). We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Hormones, blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and urinary electrolytes were measured during each phase. To examine further the determinants of glomerular filtration at the microcirculation level, fractional clearance of neutral dextran was performed, and sieving curves were applied on a hydrodynamic model of ultrafiltration.  administration was followed by an increase in active renin and plasma angiotensin II concentrations and renal plasma flow without change of systemic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, or plasma aldosterone concentration.  did not affect either sieving curves or glomerular ultrafiltration determinants. Angiotensin II infusion at 2.5 ng/kg/min elicited a slight pressor response accompanied by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and an enhancement of fractional dextran clearance over the radius range explored (3.4-5.4 nm). The transcapillary glomerular pressure gradient deltaP and the ultrafiltration coefficient kf were computed to increase by 9% and to decrease by 23%, respectively, without change in intrinsic membrane properties.

Here, we characterize two angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), telmisartan and , as new selective PPAR modulators (SPPARMs). Analysis of PPARgamma protein conformation using protease protection showed that telmisartan directly interacts with the receptor, producing a distinct conformational change compared with a glitazone. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays revealed selective cofactor binding by the ARBs compared with glitazones with an attenuated release of the nuclear receptor corepressor and absence of transcriptional intermediary factor 2 recruitment by ARBs. Consistently, selective cofactor binding resulted in differential gene expression profiles in adipocytes (ARB versus glitazone treated) assessed by oligo microarray analysis. Finally, telmisartan improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice in the absence of  gain. The present study identifies two ARBs as new SPPARMs. SPPARM activity by ARBs could retain the metabolic efficacy of PPARgamma activation with reduction in adverse effects exerting in parallel AT1 receptor blockade. This may provide a new therapeutic option for better cardiovascular risk management in metabolic diseases and may initiate the development of new classes of drugs combining potent antihypertensive and antidiabetic actions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15806974>[The renoprotect effect of shenhua recipe on 5/6 renal ablation rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the reno protective effect of Shenhua recipe on the experimental model of 5/6 renal ablation.5/6 renal ablation rats were underlying this experiment.

So, we investigated renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, alone and in combination with  in a rat model of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats, injected with nicotinamide-streptozotocin, were treated orally for 12 weeks with either vehicle, dapagliflozin 2 mg/kg/day,  30 mg/kg/day, or combination of both drugs; respectively. Biochemical analysis included blood glucose, HbA1c, urinary albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, TGF-β1, sRAGE, oxidative markers, and histopathological examination of kidneys. Treatment with dapagliflozin, , and especially their combination, produced significant reduction in albuminuria, improved renal function parameters, increased sRAGE level and improved inflammatory and oxidative markers, together with amelioration of renal histopathological changes. Beside glycemic control, dapagliflozin produced higher sRAGE levels than , suggesting that inhibition of AGE-RAGE axis is important in its renoprotective action. Combination of dapagliflozin and  produced more remarkable protective effects on renal function and structure, than use of either agent alone. It is concluded that, combination of SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin and ARB,  could offer more effective renal protection and represent a promising therapeutic option for management of diabetic nephropathy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To address this question, obese fa/fa Zucker rats were submitted to a 13-month treatment by  (30 mg/kg/day p.o.). Vehicle-treated obese fa/fa Zucker rats exhibited an important mortality (72%), which was markedly reduced by  (22%, P<0.05). Mortality in control lean fa/+ rats attained 12%.  diminished the elevation in urinary protein excretion, plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, and reduced the extent of glomerular and tubulo-interstitial lesions together with a reduction of urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 excretion in fa/fa Zucker rats.  treatment prevented the rise in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels, and partially corrected low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) cholesterol ratio in fa/fa Zucker rats.

Kidneys were processed for light microscopy (LM) and immunohistochemistry, including antibodies against interstitial alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), transforming growth factor-beta(1)(TGF-beta 1), and collagen (COL) I, III, and IV.All treated groups presented similar reduction in blood pressure compared with untreated OZR. However, animals from G4 (B + I) showed better control on proteinuria together with a higher creatinine clearance. Additionally, G4 showed a significant (P < 0.05) lower kidney ; smaller glomerular area; lower glomerulosclerosis score; lower percentage of tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and interstitial alpha-SMA; lower tubular PAI-1 score; lower percentage of COL I, III, and IV in renal interstitium; and lower wall/lumen ratio in renal vessels, when compared with the other groups. OZR treated with B and/or I showed a better outcome (P < 0.01) in the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in comparison with untreated OZR.These results suggest that combined therapy using B and I is more effective than therapy with either drug at monotherapy for controlling renal damage in this animal model.

Results were compared with those in the iliac artery and abdominal aorta and the coronary circulation of the Wistar rat. Ang II, III, and IV decreased coronary flow in SHRs and Wistar rats, with Ang III and IV being approximately 10 and approximately 1000 times less potent than Ang II. Ang-(1-7) decreased coronary flow at concentrations >1 micromol/L in SHRs. The Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist  blocked the effects of Ang II, III, and IV, whereas the Ang II type 2 receptor antagonist PD123319 blocked the effects of Ang-(1-7). The maximal Ang II- and III-induced decreases in coronary flow in SHRs were twice as large as those in Wistar rats. PD123319 enhanced the constrictor effects of Ang II and III in Wistar rats so that, in the presence of this drug, their effects were comparable to those in SHRs. In contrast, PD123319 did not alter the Ang II- and III-induced responses in SHRs and blocked the constrictor effect of Ang II in iliac arteries. Ang II type 2 receptor-mediated relaxation did not occur in iliac arteries and abdominal aortas, and the constrictor effects of Ang metabolites in these vessels were identical in Wistar rats and SHRs. In conclusion, coronary constriction induced by Ang II, Ang III, and Ang-(1-7) is enhanced in SHRs as compared with Wistar rats. This is attributable to the absence of counterregulatory Ang II type 2 receptor-mediated relaxation and/or a change of the Ang II type 2 receptor phenotype from relaxant to constrictor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22051424>Blood pressure outcomes in patients receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers in primary care: a comparative effectiveness analysis from electronic medical record data.</a></h2><p>The authors examined the comparative effectiveness of 4 angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with hypertension using a large electronic medical record database.

Results were adjusted by baseline BP, starting dose, year, age, sex, race, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications of patients. All ARBs led to sustained reductions in BP, but with significant differences in the magnitude of BP reduction.

Aliskiren/HCTZ provided blood pressure reductions similar to those with /HCTZ and amlodipine/HCTZ (15.4/11.3 and 13.6/10.3 mm Hg, respectively), with similar tolerability to placebo/HCTZ. Adverse event rates were highest with amlodipine/HCTZ because of a higher incidence of peripheral edema (11.1% versus 0.8% to 1.6% in other groups). In conclusion, combination treatment with aliskiren is a highly effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for obese patients with hypertension who fail to achieve blood pressure control with first-line thiazide diuretic treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19772721>Matrix elimination ion chromatography method for trace level azide determination in  drug.</a></h2><p>Ultra-trace analysis of azide in complicated  sample matrix is achieved by the in-line sample preparation technique. Sodium azide is the precursor of , which is used as an anti-hypertensive drug. Due to the toxic nature of sodium azide, reliable determination of azide in  is necessary.  when analyzed for sodium azide, as per the USP 31-NF26 method, gets adsorbed to the analytical column, leading to reduction in column capacity and irreproducible retention time. The retained drug has to be removed with special rinsing solution, followed by re-equilibration with the mobile phase. This process takes at least 3 to 4 h for each sample analysis. The new method developed overcomes the limitations of the USP 31-NF26 method. This method is validated for specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, sample solution stability, and robustness as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The relationship between peak response and concentration is found to be linear between 5 to 80 ng/mL of sodium azide, with the correlation coefficient (r(2)) of 0.9995. The limits of detection and quantification for sodium azide are 0.532 and 1.61 microg/gm with respect to the sample .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15047614>Improved islet morphology after blockade of the renin- angiotensin system in the ZDF rat.</a></h2><p>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the endocrine pancreas. Although angiotensin II has significant effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis, the contribution of the RAS to changes in islet structure and function associated with type 2 diabetes is yet to be defined. This study examined the specific effects of RAS blockade on islet structure and function in diabetes. Thirty-six male Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, 10 weeks of age, were randomized to receive the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (8 mg/l in drinking water; n = 12),  (15 mg/kg via gavage; n = 12), or no treatment (n = 12) for 10 weeks. Results were compared with lean littermates (ZL) (n = 12) studied concurrently. ZDF rats had increased intra-islet expression of components of the RAS correlating with increased intraislet fibrosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Disordered islet architecture, seen in ZDF rats, was attenuated after treatment with perindopril or . Islet fibrogenesis was also diminished, as measured by picrosirius staining and expression of collagens I and IV. Gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 was increased in the ZDF pancreas (ZL, 1.0 +/- 0.1; ZDF, 2.0 +/- 0.3; P < 0.05) and reduced after blockade of the RAS (ZDF + P, 1.3 +/- 0.2; ZDF + I, 1.5 +/- 0.1; vs. ZDF, both P < 0.05). Improvements in structural parameters were also associated with functional improvements in first-phase insulin secretion. These findings provide a possible mechanism for the reduced incidence of new-onset diabetes that has been observed in clinical trials of RAS blockade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16013932>[Therapeutic interchange standardization for antiotensin II receptor antagonists in the treatment of hypertension in the hospital setting].</a></h2><p>Standardization of the therapeutic inter change process in the hospital setting by the establishment and spreading of standard criteria has been defined as an activity conducent to increased health care quality, and hence improved patient care.To establish standardized therapeutic swapping for angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA-II) in the treatment of blood hypertension, and to evaluate the suitability of therapeutic interchange in an integrated individualized drug dispensation system.Standardized therapeutic inter-change was performed based on therapeutic equivalence criteriafor ARA-Ils such as candesartan, eprosartan, , losartan,olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan, according to the pharmacodynamic characteristics, dosage recommendations, pharmacokinetic characteristics and interactions of each one of them. The suitability of therapeutic interchange was assessed in terms of standardization or adaptation to this practice developed by using percentage adherence in the previous 12 months (period A) and during the 12 months following its implementation and spread(period B).The only ARA-II included in the hospital's pharmacotherapeutic guide is losartan, on which standardized therapeutic interchange for initial and maintenance doses of any drug within this class was based. The overall number of interchanges per-formed was 417-216 during period A and 201 during period B. Implementing therapeutic swapping has significantly increased adherence to explicitly established criteria by 35.2% (95% CI:25.9 to 44.5%). Similarly, during period B a reduction in the variability of therapeutic interchanges among various pharmacists was observed regarding losartan dosage.The standardization of therapeutic interchange procedures for ARA-lls allowed a reduction of the variability seen in this process, and hence the potential for medication-related problems. Another benefit of the spread of therapeutic swapping has been an increased adjustment of medical prescriptions to the hospital's pharmacotherapeutic guide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16739358>[Arterial hypertension in obese patients.

Conversely, some 43% of overweight and obese patients suffer from hypertension. Diabetes (16.7%), coronary heart disease (15.0%) and nephropathy (7.8%) are common additional findings. The cardiac risk in these patients is thus appreciably elevated. Currently, a prospective medical care study "Best practice with  in overweight and obese patients" (BIG) - is being conducted throughout Germany. In this study obese hypertensive patients of general practitioners are receiving the AT1 blocker , as monotherapy or in fixed combination with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide over a period of 3 months. Obese patients and nonobese patients are compared with regard to the following variables: drug utilization, blood pressure decrease, responder rates, normalization rates, decrease in the number of patients with (micro)albuminurea, changes in patient risk profile (e.g. after SCORE), and tolerability.

The delapril/manidipine fixed-dose combination consists of two antihypertensive agents with different, yet complementary, mechanisms of action. Delapril/manidipine has demonstrated short- and long-term antihypertensive efficacy in a number of clinical studies in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy. Comparative studies have demonstrated that delapril/manidipine is as effective as enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in patients with hypertension with an inadequate response to monotherapy, and as effective as /HCTZ, losartan/HCTZ, olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ, ramipril/HCTZ and valsartan/HCTZ in reducing BP in patients with hypertension and diabetes, or in obese patients with hypertension. Therapy with delapril/manidipine also appears to exert beneficial effects that extend beyond a reduction in BP, including nephroprotective activity and an improvement in fibrinolytic balance, supporting its value as a treatment option in these patient populations at high or very high cardiovascular risk because of the presence of organ damage, diabetes or renal disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10069680>Angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonism with  inhibits ventricular hypertrophy and improves diastolic function in the remodeling post-myocardial infarction ventricle.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the role of angiotensin II (AII) on diastolic function during post-myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular remodeling, coronary ligation or sham operation was performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Experimental animals were maintained on either , a selective AT1-receptor antagonist, or no treatment. Measurement of cardiac hypertrophy, diastolic function, and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase; SERCA) and phospholamban (PLB) gene expression was assessed at 6 weeks after MI. Myocardial infarction caused a significant increase in myocardial mass and left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, whereas LV systolic pressure and +dP/dt were reduced. The time constant of isovolumic relaxation (tau) was markedly prolonged after MI. Post-MI hypertrophy was associated with substantial increases in the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), but no significant changes in SERCA or PLB levels. Although  treatment did not significantly alter post-MI LV systolic or filling pressures, it nevertheless effectively decreased ventricular hypertrophy, improved tau, and normalized ANP expression. These results demonstrate that AT1-receptor antagonism has important effects on myocardial hypertrophy and ANP gene expression, which are independent of ventricular loading conditions. In addition, the improvement in diastolic function was not related to changes in SERCA and PLB gene expression, suggesting that enhanced myocardial relaxation was related to the blockade of AII effects on myocyte function or through a reduction of ventricular hypertrophy itself or both.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11999756>Fast screening method for the determination of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection.</a></h2><p>A selective, accurate and precise high-performance liquid chromatographic assay coupled to fluorescence detection was developed for the detection of some angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA II): Losartan, , Valsartan, Candesartan cilexetil and its metabolite Candesartan MI. The analytes and the internal standard (bumetanide, a high-ceiling diuretic) were extracted from plasma under acidic conditions by means of solid-phase extraction using C8 cartridges. This procedure allowed recoveries close to 80% for all these drugs excluding Candesartan cilexetil (70%) which presented adsorption processes on glass and plastic walls. The analytes and potential interferences were separated on a reversed-phase column, muBondapak C18, at room temperature. A gradient elution mode was used to carry out the separation, the optimal mobile phase being composed of acetonitrile-5 mM acetate buffer, pH 4, at variable flow-rates (from 1.0 to 1.2 ml/min). Fluorescence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 250 nm and an emission wavelength of 375 nm. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations for all the compounds were lower than 8% except for Losartan (12%) and the method assesses a quite good accuracy (percentage of relative error approximately 6% in most of the cases). The limit of quantitation for these compounds was 3 ng/ml for Candesartan cilexetil and M1, 16 ng/ml for Losartan and 50 ng/ml for  and Valsartan, which allows their determination at expected plasma concentration levels.

However, the determinants of torasemide pharmacokinetics in patients during steady-state conditions are largely unknown. We therefore explored the impact of genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (SLCO1B1), gender, and the effects of losartan and  comedication on the interindividual variability of steady-state pharmacokinetics of torasemide.Twenty-four patients receiving stable medication with torasemide 10 mg once daily and with an indication for additional angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) treatment to control hypertension or to treat heart failure were selected. Blood samples were taken before torasemide administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration. After this first study period, patients received either  150 mg (five female and seven male patients aged 69+/-8 years) or losartan 100 mg (two female and ten male patients aged 61+/-8 years) once daily. After 3 days of ARB medication, eight blood samples were again collected at the timepoints indicated above. The patients' long-term medications, which did not include known CYP2C9 inhibitors, were maintained at a constant dose during the study. All patients were genotyped for CYP2C9 (*1/*1 [n=15]; *1/*2 [n = 4]; *1/*3 [n=5]) as well as for SLCO1B1 (c.521TT [n=13]; c.521TC [n=11]).Factorial ANOVA revealed an independent impact of the CYP2C9 genotype (dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the 24-hour dosing interval at steady state [AUC(24,ss)/D]: *1/*1 375.5+/-151.4 microg x h/L/mg vs *1/*3 548.5+/-271.6 microg x h/L/mg, p=0.001), the SLCO1B1 genotype (AUC(24,ss)/D: TT 352.3+/-114 microg x h/L/mg vs TC 487.6+/-218.4 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.05) and gender (AUC(24,ss)/D: males 359.5+/-72.2 microg x h/L/mg vs females 547.3+/-284 microg x h/L/mg, p<0.01) on disposition of torasemide. Coadministration of  caused a 13% increase in the AUC(24,ss)/D of torasemide (p=0.002), whereas losartan had no effect.This study shows that the CYP2C9*3 and SLCO1B1 c.521TC genotype and female gender are significant and independent predictors of the pharmacokinetics of torasemide.

Drug treatment was continued for 15 weeks. Left ventricular ACE mRNA levels were measured by ribonuclease protection assay. The left ventricular/ ratio was increased 43% in hearts from rats with untreated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) versus control hearts (P < .05). However, there was no difference in either the left ventricular/ ratio (2.78 +/- 0.08 versus 2.81 +/- 0.20 mg/g; P = NS) or myocyte cross-sectional area in the AT1-blocker-treated versus untreated LVH hearts. Amlodipine also showed no effect on regression of hypertrophy. In vivo left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly higher in untreated LVH versus sham-operated rats (193 +/- 8 versus 118 +/- 4 mm Hg; P < .05), and there was a similar severe elevation of left ventricular systolic pressure in the AT1-blocker- and amlodipine-treated LVH groups (189 +/- 9 and 188 +/- 16 mm Hg; P = NS versus untreated LVH). In vivo left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in the untreated LVH than in the sham-operated rats (14.8 +/- 2.3 versus 7.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg; P < .05). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was lower in the AT1-blocker-treated (11.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg) and amlodipine-treated rats (11.5 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) and was similar to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the sham-operated rats (P = NS). Left ventricular ACE mRNA levels were elevated in untreated LVH rats but were normalized in both the AT1-blocker-treated rats and amlodipine-treated rats.Long-term AT1-receptor blockade did not regress LVH in rats with persistent systolic pressure overload due to ascending aortic stenosis.

At weekly intervals, PRA was measured during the 24 h after administration of placebo, olmesartan medoxomil (20 or 40 mg), or valsartan (80 or 160 mg) (Study CS866-445), or placebo, olmesartan medoxomil (40 mg), valsartan (160 or 320 mg), or  (300 mg) (Study CS866-448). The primary end point was change in PRA relative to placebo from predose to 24 h postdose (DeltaPRA24).In the 20 subjects who completed each study, there was a direct relationship between baseline PRA and DeltaPRA24 for all doses. Subjects with low PRA (<0.65 ng/mL/h) exhibited very low absolute increases in PRA. The DeltaPRA(24) increased significantly with olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg (P<.01) and 40 mg (P<.001) and valsartan 160 mg (P<.05) but not with valsartan 80 mg. In the second study (in which baseline PRA was lower), DeltaPRA24 increased with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg (P<.0001), valsartan 320 mg (P<.01), and  300 mg (P<.01) but not with valsartan 160 mg. The DeltaPRA24 was greatest with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg and was dose-related for olmesartan medoxomil but not for valsartan.The greater DeltaPRA24 with olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg indicates a more prolonged AT1 receptor blockade than with valsartan 80, 160, or 320 mg or  300 mg.

We hypothesized that ARNI improves cardiac and kidney parameters in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats, an angiotensin II-dependent hypertension model. Rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin for 5 or 12 weeks. In the final 3 weeks, rats were treated with vehicle,  (ARB) or +thiorphan (ARNI). Blood pressure, measured by telemetry in the 5-week group, was lowered identically by ARB and ARNI. The heart weight/tibia length ratio in 12-week diabetic animals was lower after ARNI compared with after ARB. Proteinuria and albuminuria were observed from 8 weeks of diabetes onwards. ARNI reduced proteinuria more strongly than ARB, and a similar trend was seen for albuminuria. Kidneys of ARNI-treated animals showed less severe segmental glomerulosclerosis than those of ARB-treated animals. After 12 weeks, no differences between ARNI- and ARB-treated animals were found regarding diuresis, natriuresis, plasma endothelin-1, vascular reactivity (acetylcholine response) or kidney sodium transporters. Only ARNI-treated rats displayed endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation. In conclusion, ARNI reduces proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and heart weight in diabetic TGR(mREN2)27 rats more strongly than does ARB, and this occurs independently of blood pressure.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15939809>PPARgamma-activating angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers induce adiponectin.</a></h2><p>The adipose-specific protein adiponectin has been recently discovered to improve insulin sensitivity. Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) blockers (ARBs) reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus by mostly unknown molecular mechanisms. To identify new antidiabetic mechanisms of ARBs, we studied the regulation of adiponectin by angiotensin II (Ang II) and different ARBs in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes and obese Zucker rats. Adiponectin protein expression was markedly stimulated by Ang II (5 nmol/L), which was inhibited by blockade of the AT2R, and further enhanced by the ARB . -mediated adiponectin upregulation started beyond the concentrations needed for AT1R blockade and was also present in the absence of Ang II, implicating an AT1R-independent mechanism of action. Recently, certain ARBs (, telmisartan) were identified as ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma. Telmisartan also stimulated adiponectin protein expression, whereas the non-PPARgamma-activating ARB eprosartan had no effect. Blockade of PPARgamma activation by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 markedly inhibited -induced adiponectin expression. Cognate mRNA levels of adiponectin were not affected by ARBs. Kinetic studies using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide showed that  prevented the cellular depletion of adiponectin protein. Finally, administration of  to obese Zucker rats improved insulin sensitivity and attenuated adiponectin serum depletion. The present study demonstrates that AT2R activation and certain ARBs induce adiponectin in adipocytes, which was associated with an improvement of parameters of insulin sensitivity in vivo. ARB-induced adiponectin stimulation is likely to be mediated via PPARgamma activation involving a post-transcriptional mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20826135> enhances GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker has been reported to alleviate metabolic disorder in animal studies and human clinical trials. Although this effect may be related to the ability of  to serve as a partial agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, the target tissues on which  acts remain poorly defined. As muscle glucose transport plays a major role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis, we investigated the effect of  on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. In C2C12 myotubes, 24-h treatment with  significantly promoted both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. In L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts,  caused a significant increase in glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in a concentration-dependent manner. Valsartan, another angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker had no effect on either glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation, implying that these actions on glucose transport are independent of angiotensin II receptor blockade. Moreover,  exerted these effects in an additive manner with insulin, but not with acute treatment for 3 h, suggesting that they may require the synthesis of new proteins. Finally, in insulin-resistant Zucker fatty rat,  (50 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) significantly ameliorated insulin resistance without increasing  gain. We conclude that  has a direct action, which can be additive to insulin, of promoting glucose transport in skeletal muscle. This may be beneficial for ameliorating obesity-related glucose homeostasis derangement.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with wild-type littermates, Het-KO mice had greater LV/ ratio (4.0 ± 0.1 vs. 3.3 ± 0.1 mg/g, P < 0.001), thicker interventricular septal wall (0.70 ± 0.02 vs. 0.65 ± 0.01 mm, P < 0.02), lower Mybpc3 mRNA level (-43%, P < 0.02), higher four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 (Fhl1, +110%, P < 0.01), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (Ace1, +67%, P < 0.05), but unchanged Agtr1 mRNA levels in the septum. Treatment with  had no effect in wild-type mice but abolished septum-predominant LV hypertrophy and Fhl1 upregulation without changes in Ace1 but with an increased Agtr1 (+42%) in Het-KO mice. Thus, septum-predominant LV hypertrophy in Het-KO mice is combined with higher Fhl1 expression, which can be abolished by AT1 receptor blockade, indicating a role of the renin-angiotensin system and Fhl1 in cMyBP-C-related HCM.© 2013 The Authors Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology © 2013 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20629810>Efficacy and safety of /HCTZ in severe hypertension according to cardiometabolic factors.</a></h2><p>This post hoc analysis of a 7-week, randomized, double-blind trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial /hydrochlorothiazide treatment in 468 patients with severe, uncontrolled, hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or =100 mm Hg) at high cardiovascular risk.

Four-week-old heterozygous male transgenic (mREN2)27 rats (n=24) were matched according to  (BW) and blood pressure (BP) and randomly allocated to receive a placebo (group P), the mixed endothelin type A and B receptor antagonist bosentan (100 mg/kg BW PO, group B), the Ang II type 1-specific receptor antagonist  (50 mg/kg BW PO, group I), or the endothelin type A-selective antagonist BMS-182874 (52 mg/kg BW PO, group BMS). After 4 weeks of treatment, during which BW and BP were measured weekly, animals were euthanized, and the heart, left ventricle, right ventricle, adrenal gland, brain, and kidney were weighed. The plasma levels of adrenocortical steroids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The tension responses of ET-free segments of the thoracic aorta to 5 x 10(-6) mmol/L phenylephrine, 60 mmol/L KCl, and cumulative doses of ET-1 were assessed. The density of ET-1 receptor subtypes in the aorta and vascular structural changes in the mesenteric arterioles (100 to 200 microm ID) were also measured with autoradiography and myography, respectively. Compared with all other groups, group I rats showed significantly (P<0.001) lower systolic BP (group I, 161+/-8 mm Hg; group P, 269+/-23 mm Hg; group B, 275+/-17 mm Hg; and group BMS, 254+/-21 mm Hg), left ventricular  (2.28+/-0.15 versus 3. 71+/-0.26, 3.38+/-0.27, and 3.96+/-0.51 mg/g BW, respectively), tension responses to vasoconstrictors, and normalized media thickness of the mesenteric arterioles (22.3+/-0.6 versus 25.3+/-0.5, 25.5+/-0.7, and 24.1+/-1.5 microm, respectively). Compared with levels in group P (78+/-25 pmol/mL), plasma aldosterone levels were significantly decreased in group B (51+/-11 pmol/mL) and group I (40+/-16 pmol/mL). Thus, endogenous ET-1 and Ang II contribute to the regulation of aldosterone, but only Ang II is crucial for the development of hypertension and related target organ damage via the Ang II type 1 receptor. Endogenous Ang II does not appear to enhance cardiovascular production of ET-1 in this model of hypertension within the time span of our experiment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15007034>Identification of telmisartan as a unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist with selective PPARgamma-modulating activity.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome is a common precursor of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes that is characterized by the clustering of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased blood pressure. In humans, mutations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) have been reported to cause the full-blown metabolic syndrome, and drugs that activate PPARgamma have proven to be effective agents for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Here we report that telmisartan, a structurally unique angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for the treatment of hypertension, can function as a partial agonist of PPARgamma; influence the expression of PPARgamma target genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; and reduce glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. None of the other commercially available angiotensin II receptor antagonists appeared to activate PPARgamma when tested at concentrations typically achieved in plasma with conventional oral dosing. In contrast to ordinary antihypertensive and antidiabetic agents, molecules that can simultaneously block the angiotensin II receptor and activate PPARgamma have the potential to treat both hemodynamic and biochemical features of the metabolic syndrome and could provide unique opportunities for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in high-risk populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296052> increased PPARγ activity in vivo in white adipose tissue of atherosclerotic mice and improved adipose tissue dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The effect of the PPARγ agonistic action of an AT(1) receptor blocker, , on adipose tissue dysfunction was explored using atherosclerotic model mice.

It is presently unknown if newer specific angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists are as effective or more effective in treating these conditions compared with ACE inhibitors. There is evidence that these classes of drugs may affect cardiac hypertrophy by different mechanisms. This study compared the effect of , an AT1R antagonist, with that of captopril, an ACE inhibitor, on expression of early genetic markers of cardiac hypertrophy in lean male SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats. SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rats (n = 10/group) were given captopril (100 mg/kg/day),  (50 mg/kg/day), or placebo for 16 weeks.  and captopril significantly reduced systolic pressure and produced similar rightward shifts in the angiotensin I dose-response curve. Renal renin gene expression was increased 8.6-fold by  and 17.7-fold by captopril. The only effect on echocardiographic findings was a similar decrease in aortic peak velocity, an index of systolic function, by both treatments. Early markers of cardiac hypertrophy were significantly attenuated by both drugs. Both drugs produced marked and equivalent reductions in left ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels compared with controls. This decrease in ANP gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in plasma ANP concentration in the treatment groups. The shift from V1 to V3 myosin isozymes was similarly decreased in both treatment groups, compared with controls. These data suggest that captopril and  are similarly effective in controlling expression of genes associated with ventricular hypertrophy in heart failure-prone SHHF/Mcc-fa(cp) rat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25830765>Optimum AT1 receptor-neprilysin inhibition has superior cardioprotective effects compared with AT1 receptor blockade alone in hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>Neprilysin inhibitors prevent the breakdown of bradykinin and natriuretic peptides, promoting vasodilation and natriuresis.

Mean arterial blood pressure was unaffected by vehicle or thiorphan alone.  lowered blood pressure, but after 7 days pressure started to increase again. Low- but not high-dose thiorphan prevented this rise. Only during exposure to low-dose thiorphan plus  did heart weight/body weight ratio, cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide expression, and myocyte size decrease significantly. Circulating endothelin-1 was not affected by low-dose thiorphan with or without , but increased after treatment with high-dose thiorphan plus . This endothelin-1 rise was accompanied by an increase in renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 protein abundance, and an upregulation of constrictor vascular endothelin type B receptors. Consequently, the endothelin type B receptor antagonist BQ788 no longer enhanced endothelin-1-induced vasoconstriction (indicative of endothelin type B receptor-mediated vasodilation), but prevented it.

This study explored the renal protective effect and possible mechanism of gliquidone in mice with diabetic nephropathy.Animal model of diabetic nephropathy was established in KKAy mice. The renal protective effect of gliquidone was studied by evaluating the kidney function through  of urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr) and serum triglyceride (TG) that were performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer. The levels of oxidative stress indicators, such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), were evaluated in renal tissue homogenates using the automatic biochemical analyzer. The inhibitory effect of gliquidone on renal interstitial fibrosis and its association with Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy was investigated using molecular biological techniques.It was found that low-, medium- and high-dose gliquidone improved the mice's general health condition, such as mental status, fur condition, eating, and drinking. Gliquidone reduced the  and the kidney  / ratio of mice. Gliquidone improved the kidney function, indicated by reductions in urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine and triglyceride. Gliquidone treatment increased levels of nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase, but decreased level of malondialdehyde. The expression of Jagged1/Notch1/hes1/Snail1/α-SMA decreased, while the expression of E-cadherin increased in gliquidone-treated kidneys. High dose gliquidone showed the best effect, one that was similar to that of the positive control drug .Taken together, our results suggested that gliquidone can ameliorate the diabetic symptoms of diabetic nephropathy through inhibiting Notch / Snail1 signaling pathway, improving anti -oxidative response and delaying renal interstitial fibrosis.

The aim of this study was to determine whether sulodexide could be used to treat chronic kidney failure in rats.Sixty Wistar rats undergone 5/6 nephrectomy, then were randomly divided into 4 groups: the model group, sulodexide group (sulodexide 5 mg/kg per day, im),  group  (20 mg/kg per day, ig) and sulodexide plus  group. Another 12 rats were enrolled into the sham operation group. After the treatments for 4, 8 and 12 weeks, urinary protein and serum creatinine levels were measured. After 12 weeks, serum cholesterin and triglycerides levels were measured, and the degrees of glomerular sclerosis and renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis were scored. The expression of aminopeptidase P (JG-12) in the renal tissue was examined using immunohistochemical staining. The renal expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) were detected with RT-PCR and Western blot.Proteinuria was markedly attenuated in the sulodexide-treated groups. After 4 and 8 weeks only the sulodexide-treated groups showed significant reduction in serum creatinine; while after 12 weeks all the three treatment groups showed significant reduction in serum creatinine. Furthermore, all the three treatment groups showed significant reduction in the scores of glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The glomerular expression of JG-12 was increased in both the sulodexide group and the sulodexide plus  group, but not in the  group. The eNOS mRNA and protein expression was decreased and the tPA mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased in the model group compared with Sham group.

In addition, angiotensin (Ang) II is able to induce insulin resistance and an inflammatory state through Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R). Accordingly, we examined whether inhibition of AT1R with  (IRB) can protect against the development of insulin resistance in obese Zucker rats (OZRs). IRB-treatment improved the insulin-stimulated insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation at tyrosine (Tyr) residues 1158, 1162, 1163 (involved in activation of the IR kinase) and at Tyr972 (involved in substrate recognition). AT1R blockade also originated a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. This was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylation of IR on serine (Ser) 994, a residue that seems to be implicated in the regulation of IR kinase in OZR. In this study, we demonstrated that Ser994 of IR is a direct substrate for TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a new member of the IKK-related kinase family. TBK1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the IR, in the liver of OZR supporting an in vivo association between the IR and TBK1. Interestingly, a marked increase in the association between TBK1 and the IR was found in the liver of OZR as well as in other models of insulin resistance/diabetes. Taken together, these findings suggest that TBK1 could be involved in the insulin resistance mechanism related with IR Ser994 phosphorylation in a genetic model of diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17516706>Regression of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetics after switch to  treatment : an observational study in 38 016 patients in primary care.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the blood pressure-lowering potency, renoprotective efficacy and safety of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1))-receptor blocker  in monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or other antihypertensive medications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus switched from various antihypertensive pretreatments.Multicentre, open, prospective, 6-month observational study in 38 016 patients at 9838 general practitioners' offices throughout Germany.

Angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective antihypertensive drugs that have been reported to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) to differing extents, with favorable effects on glucose metabolism and the incidence of new-onset diabetes. Among the ARBs, telmisartan is a partial activator of PPARgamma,  is a weak partial activator, and olmesartan has no effect on PPARgamma activation.The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects on glucose homeostasis of combining rosuvastatin with ARBs of varying PPARgamma-activating potency in Greek adults with impaired fasting glucose, mixed dyslipidemia, and stage 1 hypertension.This was a 24-week, randomized, open-label study. Inclusion criteria were impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (100-125 mg/dL [5.6-6.9 mmol/L]), mixed dyslipidemia (LDL-C >160 mg/dL [4.14 mmol/L] and triglycerides >150 mg/dL [1.69 mmol/L]), and stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mm Hg).

At age 8, 14, 20 and 28 weeks the effects of SR/BMS on the systemic and regional haemodynamic (radioactive microsphere technique) and the cardiac and vascular morphological parameters (automatic image analysis) were investigated.SR/BMS limited genetic hypertension development and opposed the age-related rises in total peripheral and regional vascular resistances. Simultaneously, it limited the age-related increases in heart , left ventricular cross-sectional area and collagen content. Age-related increases in aortic media thickness and amount of collagen were also significantly reduced, whereas aortic compliance was increased. Eight weeks after withdrawal of treatment the antihypertensive effect of SR/BMS, although attenuated, and the limitation of cardiac and vascular remodelling, persisted.Early AT1 receptor blockade in SHR opposes genetic hypertension development during the treatment period and persistently after its interruption. Prevention of genetic hypertension development during the treatment period can be accounted for by the limitation of the age-related development of the haemodynamic and morphological abnormalities, whereas the persistence of the antihypertensive effect observed after drug withdrawal is due mainly to a maintained prevention of the development of the cardiovascular morphological alterations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19536783>Hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis of  in human plasma: application to pharmacokinetic study of .</a></h2><p>A hydrophilic interaction chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method (HILIC/MS/MS) for the determination of  in human plasma was developed.  and losartan (internal standard) were extracted from human plasma with ethyl acetate at acidic pH.

Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II (AngII) plays a key role in mediating cell hypertrophy. The aim of our work was to explore the role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in mediating AngII-induced tubular cell hypertrophy in vivoandin vitro.In an in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control rats, diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with  (IRB). The index of kidney hypertrophy (kidney /, KW/BW), glomerular tuft area (AG), glomerular tuft volume (VG) and proximal tubular area (AT) were determined. Renal expression for CTGF was detected by immunohistochemical staining. In an in vitro study, the influence of CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (CTGF AS) on AngII-induced CTGF expression and cell hypertrophy was also investigated.In an in vivo study, diabetic rats showed a significant increase of KW/BW, AG, VG, and AT from week 1 onwards compared to normal control, which could be significantly inhibited by using IRB. Furthermore, there was a significantly increasing expression of CTGF in both glomeruli and tubuli in diabetic rats compared to control, and the extent of CTGF expression closely correlated with the severity of renal hypertrophy. Treatment with IRB could markedly inhibit the renal expression of CTGF. In an in vitro study, AngII stimulated the expression of CTGF mRNA and CTGF protein. AngII significantly increased the total protein content in HK2 cells, which was markedly inhibited by co-treatment with CTGF AS. The average cellular diameter determined by scanning electronic microscope showed that the increase of cell size induced by AngII could be significantly inhibited by CTGF AS. Furthermore, flow cytometer study showed that AngII arrested the cell cycle in the G0-G1 phase, which was significantly reversed by treatment with CTGF AS.Our data provide both in vivo and in vitroevidence that CTGF is involved in mediating AngII-induced renal hypertrophy.2006 S.

Despite evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve glomerular size-selectivity, whether this effect is solely due to ANG II blocking or if other mediators also play a contributory role is not clear yet. We studied 20 proteinuric patients with IgA nephropathy, who received either enalapril (20 mg/day) or the ANG II receptor blocker  (100 mg/day) for 28 days in a randomized double-blind study. Measurements of blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and fractional clearance of neutral dextran of graded sizes were performed before and after 28 days of treatment. Both enalapril and  significantly reduced blood pressure over baseline. This reduction reached the maximum effect 4-6 h after drug administration but did not last for the entire 24-h period. Despite transient antihypertensive effect, proteinuria was effectively reduced by both treatments to comparable extents. Neither enalapril nor  modified the sieving coefficients of small dextran molecules, but both effectively reduced transglomerular passage of large test macromolecules. Theoretical analysis of sieving coefficients showed that neither drug affected significantly the mean pore radius or the spread of the pore-size distribution, but both importantly and comparably reduced the importance of a nonselective shunt pathway.

The advent of antagonists of the angiotensin II receptor has increased the options for inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In adults, angiotensin II antagonists have antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects similar to those of converting enzyme inhibitors and an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo. In children, no information is available on angiotensin II antagonists. A total of 20 children (aged 4 to 17 years) with chronic kidney disease received the angiotensin II antagonist  given once daily. They had hypertension (n = 11), overt proteinuria (n = 3), or both (n = 6). At last follow-up, 2 to 17 months after starting  (median dosage: 3.3 mg/kg  daily), arterial pressure was significantly reduced: the systolic value by 16 [6-22] and the diastolic value by 11 [4-22] mmHg (median and interquartile range). In nine patients with proteinuria, the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio significantly decreased by 145 [105-209] mg/mmol.

Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from AM, has been proved clinically effective in improving renal inflammation and glomerular injury in CKD. However, the mechanisms of HKC are still not fully understood.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α/γ dual agonists have the potential to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study evaluated the function of Huangkui capsule (HKC), an extract from Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic (AM), as a dual agonist for PPARα/γ and investigated its anti-DN effects in a DN rat model.ChIP and reporter gene assays were performed and the expression of PPARα/γ target genes was monitored to examine the ability of HKC to activate PPARα/γ. DN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via unilateral nephrectomy and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HKC was administered to the diabetic nephropathy rats at three different doses: high dose HKC (300mg/kg/d); middle dose HKC (175mg/kg/d); and low dose HKC (75mg/kg/d).  (4mg/kg/d body weight) was used as a positive control. Following 12 weeks' treatment, we measured general status, renal morphological appearance, proteinuria, blood biochemical parameters, and glomerular morphological changes. The expression of collagen IV, TGFβ, TNFα and IL-6 in renal tissue was evaluated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in renal tissue was also analyzed.HKC enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARα and PPARγ in cultured cells, livers and kidneys of DN rats, and it reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels and fat in livers of DN rats. Furthermore, HKC reduced the expressions of inflammatory genes in kidneys of DN rats. Strikingly, HKC reduced ER stress and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation in the liver and kidney of DN rats and subsequently improved renal injury.Our results show that HKC improved lipid  disorders by activating PPARα/γ and attenuating ER stress. HKC could dose-dependently ameliorate renal inflammation and glomerular injury in DN rats.

To this end, we have studied whether these drugs influence insulin secretion in vivo through effects on islet blood perfusion. Captopril (3 mg/kg of ),  (3 mg/kg of ) and pravastatin (0.5 mg/kg of ) were injected intravenously into anaesthetized female Wistar rats. Blood flow rates were determined by a microsphere technique. Blood glucose concentrations were measured with test reagent strips and serum insulin concentrations were measured by ELISA. Pancreatic blood flow was markedly increased by pravastatin (P<0.001), captopril (P<0.05) and  (P<0.01). Pancreatic islet blood flow was significantly and preferentially enhanced after the administration of captopril (P<0.01),  (P<0.01) and pravastatin (P<0.001).

Liver to  ratio and/or stereology were used as a measure of tumour burden. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine AT1R and VEGF expression as well as proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (active caspase 3) and angiogenesis (CD34).Combined RAS therapies failed to improve upon single arm therapies. However, while  previously inhibited tumour growth in this model, in the current experiments  failed to affect tumour burden. Subsequent analysis showed a cancer-cell specific upregulation of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) in -insensitive compared to -sensitive tumours. The upregulation of AT1R was associated with an increase in proliferation and VEGF expression by cancer cells. While animals bearing -sensitive tumours showed a marked decrease in the number of proliferating cells in the liver and VEGF-expressing infiltrating cells in the tumour following AT1R treatment, these were unchanged by treatment in animals bearing -insensitive (high AT1R expressing) tumours.Although the results do not support increased efficacy of combined treatment, they provide intriguing evidence of the importance of RAS expression in determining patient response and tumour growth potential and suggest that components of the RAS could be used as biomarkers to aid in patient selection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12498264>Optimization and validation of a capillary zone electrophoretic method for the analysis of several angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists.</a></h2><p>We optimized a capillary zone electrophoretic method for separation of six angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (ARA-IIs): candesartan, eprosartan, , losartan potassium, telmisartan, and valsartan.

Paradoxically, in HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF), a high  mass index (BMI) appears to be beneficial. Approximately 50% of HF patients have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF). However, there are few data regarding the relationship between BMI and outcomes in HFPEF.Baseline characteristics and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed in the 4109 patients (mean age, 72 years; mean follow-up, 49.5 months) in the  in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (I-PRESERVE) trial. Based on the BMI distribution, 5 BMI categories were defined: <23.5, 23.5 to 26.4, 26.5 to 30.9, 31 to 34.9, and ≥35 kg/m(2). Most patients (71%) had a BMI ≥26.5, 21% had a BMI between 23.5 and 26.4, and 8% had a BMI <23.5 kg/m(2). Patients with higher BMI were younger, more often women, and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes and higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with BMI of 26.5 to 30.9 kg/m(2) had the lowest rate for the primary composite outcome (death or cardiovascular hospitalization) and were used as reference group. After adjustment for 21 risk variables including age, sex, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, the hazard ratio for the primary outcome was increased in patients with BMI <23.5 (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.56; P=0.019) and in those with BMI ≥35 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.52; P=0.011) compared with the referent group. A similar relationship was found for all-cause mortality and for HF hospitalization.Obesity is common in HFPEF patients and is accompanied by multiple differences in clinical characteristics.

Olmesartan and mycophenolic acid (CellCept) are drugs that are capable of increasing inflammation and enteropathy in some individuals and, if not recognized, can lead to chronic diarrhea. It is this type of drug-induced diarrhea that is the focus of this review.A summary of our findings (recent and earlier published) as well as a review of published works from other centers were conducted.There is increasing evidence that olmesartan use is associated with enteropathy in a small number of individuals who use angiotensin receptor II blockers, and that this enteropathy is characterized by severe diarrhea capable of inducing severe dehydration and, in some instances, failure of organs such as the kidney. Typical patient demographics are Caucasian individuals who are older (>50 years old) and obese or overweight prior to weight loss. Prolonged exposure to olmesartan use for 1-2 years is typical, although case reports of  and valsartan have been reported as well. Discontinuing olmesartan leads to improvement of symptoms; however, the period for healing is variable, with some patients requiring steroid therapy and even prolonged parental nutrition support. In addition, many histological features of olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also present in celiac disease, including villi shortening and lymphocyte infiltration. Other drug-associated enteropathies have also been reported with mycophenolate mofetil used in transplantation.Of the drug-associated enteropathies discussed in this review, olmesartan can generate the most severe symptoms, albeit quite rare. Therefore, with patients who present with severe diarrhea and weight loss, one should consider olmesartan-associated enteropathy. In addition, many of the features associated with olmesartan-associated enteropathy are also found in celiac disease enteropathy; as such, one should review any celiac disease diagnosis for any use of olmesartan at the time of diagnosis.© 2015 S.

Angiotensin II /AT receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of vascular effects of obesity/insulin resistance but its role during gestation is not as clear. We sought to determine angiotensin II- ATR participation on a diet-induced gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) experimental model. Female Wistar rats were fed with a standard or hypercaloric diet for 7 weeks. Half of the animals were mated and became pregnant from week 4-7. Animals were treated with saline,  (30 mg/kg) or metformin (320 mg/kg) for the last two weeks of the protocol.  gain, systolic blood pressure (BP), oral glucose tolerance test and vascular contractility were measured at the last day of the protocol (day 19-20 of pregnancy). Hypercaloric diet increased blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance test, and increased BP in pregnant rats, fulfilling criteria for GDM. Both drugs decreased impaired GTT and relative hyperglycemia. Metformin had no effect on BP but prevented  increase. In isolated aortas,  and metformin decreased vasoconstriction only of non-pregnant hypercaloric diet fed animals. Results support angiotensin II/ ATR involvement in BP and glucose homeostasis disturbances observed in present GDM model. Also, provide evidence that a hypercaloric diet can mask pregnancy´s physiological hypoglycemia and hypotension without surpassing non-pregnant values.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that increased O2(.-) production, more than diminished nitric oxide (NO) generation, plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction present in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).The study was performed in 30-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR. In addition, 16-week-old SHR were treated with oral  (average dose 20 mg/kg per day) for 14 weeks (SHR-I). Aortic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADH/NADPH) oxidase activity was determined by use of chemiluminescence with lucigenin. Aortic constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) activity was determined by measuring the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Vascular responses to acetylcholine were determined by isometric tension studies.Whereas systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY, no differences were observed in SBP between SHR-I and WKY. In SHR compared with WKY, we found significantly greater NADH/NADPH-driven O2(.-) production, similar cNOS-mediated NO production and an impaired vasodilation in response to acetylcholine. Treated SHR had similar NADH/NADPH oxidase activity and significantly lower cNOS activity than the WKY group. Vasodilation in response to acetylcholine was improved in SHR-I.These findings suggest that a diminished availability of NO secondary to an enhanced NADH/NADPH oxidase-dependent O2(.-) production may play a critical role in endothelial dysfunction of adult SHR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28446404>[ ameliorates cardiac inflammation in type 2 diabetic db/db mice].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effects of  against cardiac inflammation associated with diabetes and obesity in the db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes and explore the underlying mechanisms.Twenty- four 10-week-old diabetic db/db mice were equally randomized into  treatment (50 mg/kg per day) group and model group, using 12 nondiabetic littermates (db/+) as the controls, The mice were treated with  or saline vehicle for 16 consecutive weeks, after which the heart pathology was observed and the heart , , and serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol(TC), and triglycerides(TG) were measured. The expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p65 in the myocardium was assessed with immunohistochemistry, the protein levels of P-IκBα ,IκBα and β-actin were analyzed with Western blotting, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).Compared with db/+ mice, the saline-treated db/db mice developed obesity, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (P<0.01). Histopathological examination of the heart tissue revealed inflammatory cell infiltration, increased myocardial interstitium and disorders of myocardial fiber arrangement. The diabetic mice showed increased P-IαBα and decreased IκBα protein levels, enhanced activity and expression of NF-κB in the hearts, and increased mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in the myocardium. These abnormalities were all associated with increased inflammatory response. Treatment with  improved the heart architecture and attenuated high glucose-induced inflammation in the diabetic mice.Treatment with  attenuates cardiac inflammation in type 2 diabetic db/db mice, and this effect was probably associated with the suppression of cardiac angiotensin II and NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24876066>A novel dilute and shoot HPLC assay method for quantification of  and hydrochlorothiazide in combination tablets and urine using second generation C18-bonded monolithic silica column with double gradient elution.</a></h2><p> (IRB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) are angiotensin-II receptor antagonist and thiazide-class diuretic compounds, respectively, which are in use in the treatment of hypertension.

Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow [GFR and RPF per g of kidney  (KW)] were determined using the clearance technique.Arterial pressure was similarly reduced by treatments. GFR was lower in L-NAME-treated rats than in controls (552 +/- 52 versus 1106 +/- 78 microl/min per g KW), whereas RPF was reduced to a larger extent, thus resulting in an increase in filtration fraction. GFR was normalized by  but not enalapril or the combination (1042 +/- 50, 790 +/- 79 and 725 +/- 38 microl/min per g KW, respectively). RPF returned to normal and filtration fraction fell markedly with the combination. All treatments reduced the lesions of preglomerular vessels and reversed L-NAME-induced albuminuria and cardiovascular hypertrophy. At a dose of 3 mg/kg per 24 h,  only reduced the lesions of the afferent arteriole.Through its effects on AT1 receptors, angiotensin II may play an important role in the maintenance of L-NAME hypertension and associated alterations.

Six normal dogs (NLs) were compared to six untreated MR dogs (MR) and seven dogs treated with the receptor blocker  (MR+AT(1)RB) started 24 h after induction of MR (60 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) and continued for three months.Treatment with AT(1)RB decreased systemic vascular resistance but did not significantly improve cardiac output, LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) or LVEDD/wall thickness compared to untreated MR dogs. Resting isolated cardiomyocyte length increased in MR versus NLs and was further increased in AT(1)RB dogs. Left ventricular end-systolic dimension increased to a greater extent from baseline in AT(1)RB dogs versus untreated MR dogs (29 +/- 9% vs. 12 +/- 6%, p < 0.05), despite a significantly lower LV peak systolic pressure in AT(1)RB dogs. Plasma-angiotensin (ANG) II was elevated greater than threefold in both MR and MR+AT(1)RB versus NLs. In contrast, intracardiac ANG II was increased greater than twofold in MR dogs versus NLs, but was normalized by AT(1)RB.The use of AT(1)RB decreased systemic vascular resistance and attenuated local expression of the renin-angiotensin system but did not prevent adverse LV chamber and cardiomyocyte remodeling. These results suggest that blockade of the AT(1) receptor does not improve LV remodeling and function in the early myocardial adaptive phase of MR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15901242>Failure of angiotensin II to suppress plasma renin activity in normotensive subjects with a positive family history of hypertension.</a></h2><p>The renin-angiotensin system is implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Renin release is regulated by a number of factors, including circulating Ang II (angiotensin II), the so-called short feedback loop. The aim of the present study was to investigate the responsiveness of circulating Ang II on PRA (plasma renin activity) in normotensive subjects with a PFH or NFH (positive or negative family history of hypertension respectively). PRA, renal haemodynamics and urinary sodium excretion were measured during infusion of Ang II without and with pretreatment with the AT1 (Ang II type 1) receptor blocker . Normotensive men with a PFH (n=13) and NFH (n=10), with a mean age of 38 years, were given on different occasions intravenous Ang II infusions of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 ng.kg-1 of .min-1 before and after pretreatment with 150 mg of  once a day for 5 consecutive days. RPF (renal plasma flow) and GFR (glomerular filtration rate) were also measured. Before Ang II infusion, the PFH and NFH groups did not differ with respect to BP (blood pressure),  mass index, PRA, RBF (renal blood flow) or urinary sodium. There was no difference in BP or renal haemodynamic response to the highest Ang II dose between the groups. PRA declined with the highest Ang II dose (P<0.01) in subjects with a NFH, but not in subjects with a PFH. After treatment with  when Ang II had no effect on BP in either group, Ang II also suppressed PRA in subjects with a PFH (P<0.01), and the difference between the groups at baseline was thus eliminated. In conclusion, these findings indicate that subjects with a PFH have a defective Ang II suppression of PRA, which is corrected by AT1 receptor blockade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12969165>Better renoprotective effect of angiotensin II antagonist compared to dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in childhood.</a></h2><p>The dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin II antagonist  effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertensive children.Eligible for the open-label, randomized study were nephropathic children between 6.0 and 18 years of age with plasma creatinine <177 micromol/L, overt proteinuria, untreated arterial hypertension (systolic, 5 to 30 mm Hg; and diastolic, 1 to 15 mm Hg;>95th centile) and stable immunosuppressive treatment.

A previous study revealed that rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have an enhanced hypertensive response to subsequent angiotensin II administration that is mediated at least, in part, by increased activity of brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines. This study tested whether leptin mediates this HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension by interacting with brain renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokine mechanisms. Rats fed an HFD for 3 weeks had significant increases in white adipose tissue mass, plasma leptin levels, and mRNA expression of leptin and its receptors in the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Central infusion of a leptin receptor antagonist during HFD feeding abolished HFD sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension. Furthermore, central infusion of leptin mimicked the sensitizing action of HFD. Concomitant central infusions of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist , the tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis inhibitor pentoxifylline, or the inhibitor of microglial activation minocycline prevented the sensitization produced by central infusion of leptin. RT-PCR analysis indicated that either HFD or leptin administration upregulated mRNA expression of several components of the renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines in the lamina terminalis and paraventricular nucleus. The leptin antagonist and the inhibitors of angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α synthesis, and microglial activation all reversed the expression of these genes. The results suggest that HFD-induced sensitization of angiotensin II-elicited hypertension is mediated by leptin through upregulation of central renin-angiotensin system and proinflammatory cytokines.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16802178>Candesartan cilexetil in children with hypertension or proteinuria: preliminary data.</a></h2><p>The angiotensin II receptor blockers  and losartan effectively reduce blood pressure and proteinuria in childhood.

It is unclear whether these effects are mediated via subtype 1 receptors of Ang II, because these receptors are thought to mediate vasoconstriction. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (euglycemic clamp technique) and leg muscle blood flow (plethysmography) were measured in nine healthy male volunteers (mean age, 24 +/- 2 yr) on three occasions using a double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. The subjects were allocated in random order to (1) placebo premedication per os plus placebo infusion, (2) placebo premedication per os plus infusion of 5 ng Ang II/kg per min, and (3) premedication with 300 mg of the angiotensin II-1-receptor antagonist  per os plus infusion of 5 ng Ang II/kg per min. In addition, GFR and effective renal plasma flow were assessed using the steady-state inulin- and paraaminohippurate clearance. Insulin sensitivity (i.e., M value) and muscle blood flow after infusion of Ang II (9.3 +/- 1.8 mg/kg per min; 17.7 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g per min) were significantly higher than after placebo infusion (7.2 +/- 1.6 mg/kg per min, P: < 0.02; 13.5 +/- 1.8 ml/100 g per min, P: < 0.01). In contrast, after premedication with , they were not significantly different (7.5 +/- 1.7 mg/kg per min; 14.3 +/- 1.9 ml/100 g per min) as compared with placebo infusion. Mean GFR and effective renal plasma flow were significantly lower (P: < 0.01), and renal vascular resistance was significantly higher (P: < 0.01) with Ang II infusion as compared with the placebo infusion study. Premedication with  almost completely blocked the vasoconstrictive effect of Ang II on renal vasculature.

From 10% to 30% of the adult population in industrialized countries has MetSyndr, which effectively predicts the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and CV disease. Because of the complex etiology of MetSyndr, a multi-targeted, integrated therapeutic approach is required to simultaneously treat high BP, obesity, lipid disorders and T2D (if present), to fully protect CV, cerebrovascular and renal systems. If lifestyle modification ( control, diet, exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake) is ineffective, pharmaco-theraphy should be added to treat simultaneously the lipid- and non-lipid CV risk factors. Patients with HTN and MetSyndr should be started on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, unless contraindicated. The ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce the odds of developing new onset T2D and also decrease albuminuria. The ACE inhibitors provide cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits beyond their effect on BP; they also improve IR. The ARBs are renoprotective in addition to being cardioprotective. Long-acting calcium channel blockers are also recommended in hypertensive patients with MetSyndr; these drugs also improve IR. Thiazides (at low doses) and selected ss-blockers can be given to patients with HTN and MetSyndr. Celiprolol in combination with diuretics has a favorable effect on glucose tolerance and IR in patients with HTN and MetSyndr, and spironolactone added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy provides additional reno- and CV protective benefits in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Carvedilol, a ss-blocker with vasodilating properties, added to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, is effective in preventing worsening of microalbuminuria in patients with HTN and MetSyndr; it also improves IR and glycemic control. Most patients eventually require two or more antihypertensive drugs to reach BP goal. It is recommended that therapy in patients whose BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above target at diagnosis be initiated with a combination of antihypertensive drugs, administered either as individual drugs or as fixed-dose formulations. Treatment with fixed-dose combinations, such as  + hydrochlorothiazide provides good BP control in more than two-thirds of hypertensive patients with MetSyndr. Lipid and BP targets are reached in a high percent of patients with HTN and CV disease treated with a combination of amlodipine + atorvastatin.

Compared with the sham-operated group, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), diastolic pressure (LVDP), heart  to  ratio were all significantly increased in the MI group while the LV contractility (dP/dt) and pulsatile arterial pressure were significantly reduced. Both drugs reduced the elevated LVEDP and LVDP and prevented cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore,  attenuated the right shift of the pressure-volume curves, prevented postinfarction-induced increase in urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate and reduced urinary aldosterone excretion. Although both drugs were able to prevent further cardiac hypertrophy and improved cardiac filling pressure, only  limited LV dilatation. These data indicate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system at the level of AT1 receptors may have a better cardioprotective benefit than reducing angiotensin II levels by ACE inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14656956>Hypersensitivity of the adrenal cortex to trophic and secretory effects of angiotensin II in Lyon genetically-hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>In Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats, a model of low-renin genetic hypertension, we investigated adrenal sensitivity to angiotensin II in terms of angiotensin II receptor (AT1 and AT2 receptors) regulation, morphological changes, and aldosterone and corticosterone secretion. Twelve-week-old LH rats, compared with normotensive LN and LL rats, were either untreated or treated for 4 weeks with AT1 receptor antagonist  (50 mg/kg/d), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (3 mg/kg/d), or perindopril (3 mg/kg/d) plus angiotensin II infusion (200 ng/kg/min). At 16 weeks, untreated LH rats had high systolic blood pressure (P<0.05), low aldosterone (P<0.05), and increased corticosterone (P<0.05) plasma levels. AT1-receptor binding density in the zona glomerulosa was similar in the three strains. In LH rats, angiotensin II infusion increased the relative adrenal  from 10.5+/-0.3 to 16.7+/-0.7 mg/100g (P<0.05), whereas this change was very modest in normotensive rats. Zona glomerulosa enlarged and plasma aldosterone increased after angiotensin II infusion in the 3 strains, but more markedly in LH versus normotensive rats (2.4- versus 1.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively; 20- versus 10-fold in normotensive rats, P<0.05). Surprisingly, after angiotensin II infusion, despite the absence of angiotensin II receptors in the three strains, the zona fasciculata-reticularis enlarged 1.5-fold and plasma corticosterone increased 1.7-fold only in LH rats (P<0.05), suggesting an indirect control of this compartment by angiotensin II. The hypertrophy and hypersecretory activity of both zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata-reticularis in LH rats in response to angiotensin II point to the adrenal cortex as a pivotal tissue in the pathophysiology of hypertension in LH rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16029550>[Effects of combination therapy with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist on ventricular remodeling and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase].</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effects of ACEI, AT1 receptor antagonism, and combination of these two drugs on ventricular remodeling, and the vary of eNOS in rats with myocardial infarction (MI).Eighty-six rats were randomly divided into four groups at twenty-four hours after MI, and treated for 2 weeks and 6 weeks. (1) MI-placebo (n = 22); (2) MI-Fosinopril (n = 20, 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)); (3) MI- (n = 23, 50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)); (4) MI-Fosinopril +  (n = 21, 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) + 50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)); and sham-ligation. Mean blood pressure and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were evaluated, as well as ventricular  (VW)/ (BW) ratio. The total collagen was quantified by histomorphometry. The expressions of eNOS mRNA and protein within the noninfarction zone were determined by RT-PCR and histomorphometry.Acute myocardial infarction resulted in a significant increase of LVEDP (P < 0.05), LVDd (P < 0.01), and VW/BW (P < 0.01), and total collagen (at 2 weeks 6.1 +/- 0.7 vs 3.6 +/- 0.5 and at 6 weeks 5.1 +/- 0.8 vs 3.6 +/- 0.4, P < 0.01) in noninfarcted region. Treatment with fosinopril,  and combination of these two drugs improved them. At the sixth week,  and combination therapy decreased more significantly total collagen compared with fosinopril (3.4 +/- 0.7 and 3.3 +/- 0.7 vs 4.2 +/- 0.6, P < 0.05). The level of eNOS mRNA expression increased more significantly in combination therapy group than in fosinopril or  group alone (at 2 weeks 1.55 +/- 0.17, at 6 weeks 1.61 +/- 0.16, P < 0.01). eNOS protein increased.Fosinopril or  alone, and combination of these two drugs can improve hemodynamics, limited myocardial hypertrophy, attenuated the development of myocardial interstitial fibrosis in the noninfarcted left ventricule. The use of , especially combined with fosinopril was more effective than fosinopril alone in the suppression interstitial fibrosis. Combination therapy was more effective than fosinopril and  alone in enhancing eNOS mRNA and protein expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931880>[The mechanism of  against diabetes induced myocardial fibrosis in rat model].</a></h2><p>To observe the protective effect of  on myocardial fibrosis in diabetic rats, and analyze the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in this protection.Thirty two male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups:normal control group (CON, =10), experimental group (=22). Twenty diabetic rats which had modelled successfully were randomly divided into two groups:diabetic group (DM, =10),  + DM group (Ir+DM, =10). After 8 weeks, fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, body weight (BW), the ratio of heart weight/body weight (H/B) and left ventricular weight index (LVWI) were measured. The myocardial morphological and fibrotic changes were observed by Masson staining. Col I and col Ⅲ contents were evaluated using ELISA method, and the protein expressions of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 in heart tissue were tested by Western blot.Compared with CON group, in diabetic rats, the levels of FBG, H/B and LVWI were increased while BW was decreased. The contents of col I and col Ⅲ were increased as well as the protein expression of p-ERK1/2 and the ratio of p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2(<0.05,<0.01), which had the statistic differences, while ERK1/2 protein expression was not changed. Masson staining showed myocardial collagen was increased, arranged in disorder and uneven distribution. However, in Ir+ DM group, BW was increased obviously, H/B, LVWI, the contents of col I and col Ⅲ were decreased significantly (<0.05,<0.01), p-ERK1/2 protein expression and the ratio of p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 were decreased (<0.01), which had the statistic differences.

An analytical method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MSMS) was developed and validated for use in routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The method includes 21 antihypertensive drugs or active metabolites from the groups beta blockers (n=5), calcium antagonists (n=5), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (n=4), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (n=3) and diuretics (n = 3), in addition to one α1-selective alpha blocker.A 200 µL serum sample was handled automatically using a pipetting robot. Protein precipitation was performed with 600 µL of 1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v:v) and phospholipid removal was carried out using a Waters OSTRO™ 96-well plate. After evaporation and reconstitution the eluent was injected thrice with different inlet and mass spectrometric methods to cover the different physico-chemical properties of the drugs and the variations in therapeutic concentration ranges between drugs. Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (2.1x50mm, 1.7 µm) column equipped with a corresponding pre-column was used for chromatographic separation. For every analyte an isotopically labelled analogue served as internal standard, except for lisinopril where enalaprilat-d5 was used.Accuracies were in the range of -13.7 to 13.2% and intra-day and inter-day precisions in the range of 1.1 to 10.5%. The linearity within the calibration ranges expressed as coefficient of determination was higher than 0.995 for all compounds. Matrix effects and recovery efficiencies were within acceptable limits. The limits of quantitation varied from 0.02 to 10.7 µg/L. The stability of the drugs in serum at different conditions was tested. Diltiazem was not stable at 4-8 °C with up to 23.5 % loss after six days. Degradation of atenolol, , bendroflumethiazide, hydrochlorothiazide and diltiazem was observed when stored at 30 °C. The suitability of the method was demonstrated in a routine TDM setting, analysing samples from 127 patients undergoing antihypertensive drug treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 269 hypertensive patients were selected and 106 healthy normotensive individuals were included as controls. At the time of inclusion a wide range of clinical variables was documented. QoL was assessed at baseline and 1 month after the intensification of antihypertensive therapy, using a self-administered, specific hypertension, 56-item questionnaire in addition to the generic EuroQoL-5D.QoL was poorer among the hypertensive subjects than among the normotensive individuals, even adjusting for the differences observed between the groups (age, sex, education and working status). The same was found with the EuroQol-5D. In the hypertensive subjects, after applying a multiple regression equation, only four variables significantly retained their negative impact on QoL: sex (female), greater organ damage and higher heart rate and . After the intensification of antihypertensive therapy with , QoL improved significantly. Neither the presence of side-effects during the month of follow-up, nor the degree of BP reduction showed a significant impact on QoL, although the latter came close to statistical significance.Hypertensive patients have significantly poorer QoL than normotensive subjects, even with adjustment for differences. In hypertensives, QoL is affected by some clinical variables that might help us to identify those with worse QoL.

Angiotensin II-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38MAPK were assessed by Western blot analysis. c-fos mRNA expression by angiotensin II was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the absence and presence of PD98059, selective inhibitor of ERK1/2-dependent pathways and SB202190, selective p38MAPK inhibitor.Angiotensin II increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, but not JNK. Responses were significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY. , AT1 receptor antagonist, but not PD123319, AT2 receptor blocker, abolished angiotensin II-induced effects. PP2, selective Src inhibitor, decreased angiotensin II-mediated activation of MAP kinases. Angiotensin II increased c-fos mRNA expression in SHR and had a small stimulatory effect in WKY. These actions were inhibited by PD98059, whereas SB202190 had no effect.Angiotensin II-induced activation of vascular ERK1/2 and p38MAPK is increased in SHR. These effects are mediated via AT1 receptors, which activate Src-dependent pathways. Overexpression of c-fos mRNA in SHR is due to ERK1/2-dependent, p38MAPK-independent pathways. Our results suggest that angiotensin II activates numerous MAP kinases in VSMCs and that differential activation of these kinases may be important in altered growth signaling in VSMCs from SHR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15000295>Hypotensive and prophylactic effects of angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor antagonist, , in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>We determined the acute hypotensive effect of a single administration and the prophylactic effect of chronic treatment with , an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on the development of end-organ damage in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP).

The renin angiotensin system has been implicated in the development of ventricular hypertrophy. At 5 weeks complete AV block (CAVB) in the dog, there is: (1) biventricular hypertrophy associated with a transient activation of components of the renin angiotensin system, (2) increased APD, more pronounced in the left than in the right ventricle leading to spatial dispersion of repolarization, and (3) enhanced susceptibility to drug-induced torsade de pointes arrhythmias. To investigate whether these remodeling processes develop in parallel, time dependency was assessed in absence or presence of the AT1 receptor-blocker .Dogs in sinus rhythm, 2 and 5 weeks CAVB were compared to dogs chronically treated with  (30 mg/kg BID). Endocardial monophasic APD of left and right ventricle was measured and susceptibility to torsade de pointes was tested by infusing Dofetilide (0.025 mg/kg/5'). Hypertrophy was determined by relating heart-to- at sacrifice. Left ventricular APD had increased more than right ventricular APD at 2 and 5 weeks CAVB, leading to an increase in spatial dispersion. At that time torsade de pointes were evocable in the majority of the dogs. Hypertrophy had only developed completely at 5 weeks CAVB.  had no effect on electrical and structural parameters or on arrhythmogenicity.In the CAVB dog ventricular hypertrophy is not a prerequisite for electrical remodeling or drug-induced torsade de pointes, and the AT1-receptor has no dominant role in the completion of these remodeling processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670240>Telmisartan-induced sprue-like enteropathy: a case report and a review of patients using non-olmesartan angiotensin receptor blockers.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have identified sprue-like illness associated with the use of the antihypertensive agent olmesartan medoxomil. However, whether this condition is specific to the use of olmesartan or is associated with the use of drugs belonging to the class of "sartans" remains to be clarified.

We also aimed to investigate the post-effects of angiotensin II blockage treatment on clusterin expression and to compare these with apoptosis. Five groups of Wistar albino rats were used: First group consisted of healthy controls; the second group included the untreated STZ-diabetics; 30 days of  or perindopril treated STZ-diabetics formed the third and the fourth groups, respectively; while the subjects receiving a combined treatment with  and perindopril for 30 days consisted the fifth group. TUNEL method for apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA, clusterin-beta and clusterin-alpha/beta antibodies were performed. Apoptotic cells especially increased in the kidney tubuli of untreated diabetic group and on the contrary, a significant decrease was observed in the group that received a combined drug treatment. While sCLU was increased in the glomeruli and tubuli of the untreated diabetic group, it was decreased in all the treated groups. An increase in the nCLU immunoreactivity was observed in the podocytes, mesangial cells, and the injured tubule cells of the untreated diabetic group. nCLU immunopositive cells were decreased in all treated diabetic groups. In addition to this, the distribution of nCLU was similar to the distribution of apoptotic cells in the diabetic groups. Our results indicate that sCLU expression in diabetic nephropathy was induced due to renal tissue damage, and the nCLU expression increase in renal tubuli was related to apoptosis.

C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2-week intermittent restraint stress and orally treated with vehicle, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day . The plasma concentrations of lipid and proinflammatory cytokines [Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6] were assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Monocyte/macrophage accumulation in inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) was observed with CD11b-positive cell counts and mRNA expressions of CD68 and F4/80 using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR methods respectively. The mRNA levels of angiotensinogen, proinflammatory cytokines shown above, and adiponectin in WAT were also assessed with RT-PCR method. Glucose  was assessed by glucose tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests, and mRNA expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in WAT. Restraint stress increased monocyte accumulation, plasma free fatty acids, expression of angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines including MCP-1, and reduced adiponectin.  reduced stress-induced monocyte accumulation in WAT in a dose dependent manner.  treatment also suppressed induction of adipose angiotensinogen and proinflammatory cytokines in WAT and blood, and reversed changes in adiponectin expression. Notably,  suppressed stress-induced reduction in adipose tissue weight and free fatty acid release, and improved insulin tolerance with restoration of IRS-1 and GLUT4 mRNA expressions in WAT. The results indicate that  improves stress-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance.

Diabetes was induced by injection of STZ intraperitoneally after rats had received uninephroectomy. Blood glucose (BG),  (BW), urinary albumin excretion (Ualb), 24-hour proteinuria (24hUpro) were observed in the rats at week 4, 8, 12 respectively. Creatinine clearance (Ccr), kidney  (KW), profile of kidney hypertrophy (KW/BW), renal tissue protein contents (RTP), glomerular area (A(G)), glomerular volume (V(G)), and width of GBM were determined at week 12 when the rats were sacrificed. Renal expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) were determined by immunohistochemistry.There is no significant difference of BG between group DN and group DNI (P > 0.05). Irb treatment significantly prevented the increase of Ualb excretion and 24hUpro and the deterioration of Ccr in diabetic rats (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 respectively). Furthermore, Irb markedly inhibited the increasing of KW, KW/BW, RTP, AG and VG shown in diabetic rats (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 respectively).

Sixteen-month-old hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with  (20 mg/kg/d) or saline for 8 weeks. At the end of treatment, systolic blood pressure and heart  to  ratio were reduced in -treated compared with nontreated SHRs. Electrical and contractile properties were measured in isolated ventricular myocytes, by patch-clamp or video-dimension analysis, respectively. Action potential duration was significantly shorter in -treated than in nontreated SHRs (at -60 mV: 119 +/- 24 ms vs 187 +/- 20 ms); correspondingly, maximal I(to) density was larger in -treated than in nontreated SHRs (25.4 +/- 2.8 pA/pF vs 18.5 +/- 1.5 pA/pF). Maximal specific conductance of I(f) was lower in -treated vs nontreated SHRs (24.8 +/- 3.0 pS/pF vs 35.2 +/- 4.0 pS/pF).

We explored the potential for the anti-hypertensive angiotensin II type 1-receptor (ATR(1)) antagonists to improve insulin sensitivity through modulation of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma, in vitro and in vivo compared to the potent insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone.PPARgamma modulation by ATR(1) antagonists was measured first by direct recruitment of PGC-1, followed by trans-activation reporter assays in cells, and promotion of adipogenesis in fibroblast and pre-adipocyte cell lines. Improvement of insulin sensitivity was measured as changes in levels of glucose, insulin, and adiponectin in ob/ob mice.Telmisartan, candesartan, , and losartan (but not valsartan or olmesartan) each served as bona fide PPARgamma ligands in vitro, with EC(50) values between 3 and 5 micro mol/l. However, only telmisartan, and to a lesser extent candesartan, resulted in significant PPARgamma agonism in cells. In vivo, although rosiglitazone significantly lowered both glucose (33%, p<0.01) and insulin (61%, p<0.01) levels and increased expression of adiponectin (74%, p<0.001), sartan treatment had no effect.Many members of the sartan family of ATR(1) antagonists are PPARgamma ligands in cell-free assays but their modulation of PPARgamma in cells is relatively weak. Furthermore, none appear to improve insulin sensitivity in a rodent model under conditions where other insulin sensitizers, including rosiglitazone, do. These results question whether reported effects of sartans on insulin sensitivity may be through other means, and should guide further efforts to develop dual agents to treat hypertension and insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20004542>Simultaneous determination of  and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma using HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry: Application to bioequivalence studies.</a></h2><p>A sensitive, specific and selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of  and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma.

In the following sets of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that these angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, when applied systemically, can inhibit the effects of angiotensin AT1 receptor stimulation in the brain.  and losartan were administered i.v. or p.o. at doses of 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg . The responses to 100 ng angiotensin II injected into the lateral brain ventricle (i.c.v.), namely blood pressure increase, vasopressin release into the circulation and drinking, were recorded for up to 3 h. While both angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists dose-dependently attenuated the pressor responses to central angiotensin AT1 receptor stimulation to a similar degree (maximal inhibition, : 62% i.v., 39% p.o.; losartan: 62% i.v., 46% p.o.; respectively),  was more effective with respect to the inhibition of vasopressin release (76% i.v., 65% p.o.) and drinking (63% i.v., 79% p.o.) than losartan (58% i.v., 33% p.o and 22% i.v., 56% p.o., respectively).

The degree of central angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade following peripheral application may vary between different representatives of this class of drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18390206>[Experimental study in renal protective effect of tranilast on rats with adriamycin nephropathy].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect and mechanism of tranilast on the adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome of rats.Twenty four rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal control group, model group,  treatment group and tranilast treatment group. The rats in normal control group were injected with normal saline via the tail vein. The rats in the other groups were uninephrectomized and injected with adriamycin 5 mg/kg via the tail vein one week later. Rats in model group underwent gavage to receive the sodium carboxymethylcellulose, rats in  treatment group to receive the  with 10 mg/kg x d, and rats in tranilast treatment group to receive the tranilast with 400 mg/kg. Rats were then sacrificed at the end of week 8. The , 24 hours urinary protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) of each group rats were measured for the study. Renal pathological changes were evaluated. And immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). In situ hybridization was used to measure the expression of a-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) mRNA in the kidney.Compared with the untreated nephrotic syndrome rats, the proteinuria and Scr of rats treated with tranilast were significantly reduced (P < 0.05); Compared with model group, the renal pathological changes of rats in tranilast treatment group were decreased, with glomerular sclerosis to be markedly lower; Tranilast could decrease the expression of TGF-beta1, TIMP-1 and alpha-SMA mRNA in the kidney of rats with adriamycin nephropathy.Tranilast has a renoprotective effect on adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, of which the mechanism may be related to that tranilast can depress the expression of TGF-beta1, and TIMP-1 in the kidney, with result in decreasing the synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix. And tranilast inhibits the transdifferentation of renal primary cells, regulates the synthesis and degradation system of extracellular matrix.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23691520>The Effect of Dantonic Pill on β -Catenin Expression in a Rat Model of Streptozotocin-Induced Early Stage of Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common causes of end-stage renal failure.

The lungs are very sensitive to the constrictive and proliferative effects of angiotensin-II and could represent a preferential target for this peptide.Rats with large myocardial infarcts or sham surgery received the angiotensin-II receptor antagonist  (40 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 2 or 8 weeks (n=5 to 8 for each group). Hemodynamic and morphometric measurements were obtained followed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence analysis and electron microscopic characterization of lung sections.The infarct groups developed progressive pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy with elevated left ventricular filling pressures (all P<0.01). Despite similar infarct size, filling pressures were lower (P<0.01) while pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy were completely normalized by . Isolated lungs pressure-flow relationships were identical at 2 weeks. At 8 weeks it was steepest and shifted upward in the infarct group (P<0.001), and completely normalized by . Lung  doubled after infarct with no evidence of pulmonary edema and was also normalized by . Important lungs structural remodeling evidenced by collagen and reticulin deposition, thickening of the alveolar septa and proliferation of cells with ultrastructural characteristics of myofibroblasts (pericytes) were identified after infarct.After large myocardial infarct there is important pulmonary structural remodeling in which myofibroblasts (pericytes) proliferation may play an important role. This initially protective mechanism against high filling pressures could eventually contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. Future studies are needed to determine if angiotensin-II directly modulates pulmonary remodeling after myocardial infarct.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12827033>Influence of two doses of  on non-dipper circadian blood pressure rhythm in salt-sensitive black hypertensives under high salt diet.</a></h2><p>The authors examined whether the blockage of angiotensin II receptors by  (IRB) can reverse the "non-dipper" circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP) to a "dipper" pattern in black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients submitted to a high-sodium loading. Twelve black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients (seven men; age, 35-58 years) on a high-sodium diet (300 mmol Na+ per day) were followed for 8 weeks. A placebo was given during the first 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks on IRB 150 mg/d, 2 weeks on placebo, and 2 weeks on IRB 300 mg/d. On the last day of placebo, IRB 150 mg/d, and IRB 300 mg/d treatments, 24-hour BP and urinary 24-hour excretion of Na+ and potassium were measured. On placebo, ambulatory mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 112 mm Hg+/-2 (24 h), 112 mm Hg+/-2 (daytime), and 111 mm Hg+/-2 (nighttime), showing a clear circadian non-dipper profile. Versus placebo, IRB 150 mg/d reduced MAP by 4.2 mm Hg+/-1.1 (24 h), 2.6 mm Hg+/-0.8 (daytime) and 6.0 mm Hg+/-1.3 (nighttime; P<0.05 vs. placebo) and IRB 300 mg/d reduced MAP by 7.8 mm Hg+/-1.4 (24 h), 3.9 mm Hg+/-1.1 (daytime), and 11.8 mm Hg+/-2.1 mm Hg (all P<0.02 vs. placebo); nighttime/daytime MAP decrease was 0.7+/-0.8% on placebo, 3.5+/-2.1% on IRB 150 mg/d, and 7.0+/-1.2% on IRB 300 mg/d (P<0.02 for trend). Compared with placebo, IRB significantly increased serum potassium and plasma renin activity and reduced fractional excretion of potassium and plasma aldosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner.  and urinary sodium excretion did not change throughout the study. It was concluded that the angiotensin receptor blocker IRB can reverse the BP non-dipper profile in salt-sensitive hypertensive patients on a high-salt diet, restoring nocturnal BP decline by a predominantly dose-dependent reduction of nighttime BP. Although the increment of potassium balance and reduction of aldosterone may account for this effect, it occurs independently of increased natriuresis. It is speculated that blunting of nighttime BP decrease in black salt-sensitive hypertensive patients may be related to a deficient suppression of the renin-angiotensin system during the night.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16311101>Selective angiotensin II receptor antagonism enhances whole- insulin sensitivity and muscle glucose transport in hypertensive TG(mREN2)27 rats.</a></h2><p>Essential hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance of skeletal muscle glucose transport, and angiotensin II (ANGII) can contribute to the pathogenesis of both conditions. The male heterozygous TG(mREN2)27 rat (TGR) harbors the mouse transgene for renin, exhibits local tissue elevations in ANGII and is an excellent model of both hypertension and insulin resistance associated with defective insulin signaling. The present study was designed to assess the specific role of ANGII in the insulin resistance of the male heterozygous TGR. TGRs were treated with either vehicle or the ANGII (AT(1)-specific) receptor antagonist,  (50 mg/kg ), for 21 consecutive days. Compared with vehicle-treated TGRs, whole- insulin sensitivity was increased 35% (P < .05) in the -treated group, and insulin-mediated glucose transport was increased (P < .05) in both type IIb epitrochlearis (80%) and type I soleus (59%) muscles after  treatment. Moreover, glycogen synthase activation due to insulin was increased 58% (P < .05) in the soleus of the -treated TGRs. However, no significant improvements were observed for functionality of insulin-signaling elements (tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 [IRS1], IRS1 associated with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, and Ser473 of Akt) in muscle of -treated animals, except for a 25% increase (P < .05) in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in soleus. Collectively, these data indicate that the improvements in whole- and skeletal muscle insulin action after long-term antagonism of ANGII action in TGRs occur independently of modulation of the functionality of these insulin-signaling elements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19901849>Long-term treatment with an angiotensin II receptor blocker decreases adipocyte size and improves insulin signaling in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and insulin resistance. In addition, administration of selective Ang II type-1 receptor blockers has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. However, only a few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms involved in this association.The current study was undertaken to determine whether an Ang II receptor blocker () is effective in improving insulin resistance in adipose tissue from obese Zucker rats, a model of metabolic syndrome.Ten-week-old male obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) were treated daily with either vehicle or 50 mg/kg  for 6 months, and their age-matched lean (+/?) (lean Zucker rats) was used as a control. We determined systolic blood pressure (SBP), together with plasma levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose. In addition, we evaluated insulin signaling through the insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt/glucose transporter 4 pathway as well as the inflammatory status of adipose tissue.Obese Zucker rats displayed hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypercholesterolemia and increased SBP together with decreased activation of insulin signaling through the insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt pathway in adipose tissue as well as increased adipocytes size, macrophage infiltration and augmented levels of inflammatory mediators such tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and Ang II. Chronic  treatment resulted in an improvement of all alterations.The present study provides substantial information that demonstrates that long-term selective Ang II blockade ameliorates insulin resistance in adipose tissue from a model of metabolic syndrome via a mechanism that could involve the modulation of insulin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199794>Olmesartan-associated enteropathy: results of a national survey.</a></h2><p>Recently, a new enteropathy has been described: olmesartan-associated enteropathy. However, the association has been questioned: a phase 3 trial and a cohort study found no association between gastrointestinal events and olmesartan.To collect French cases of sartan-associated enteropathy to describe further this entity, confirm or refute causality, and determine if the association exists with other sartans.French gastroenterologists were invited to report cases of sartan-associated enteropathy and collect clinical, biological and histological data. Patients with diarrhoea and histological duodenal abnormalities were included.Thirty-six patients with olmesartan-associated enteropathy were reported, including 32 with villous atrophy and four without. There was only one patient with -associated enteropathy. None of the patients died. Patients with villous atrophy had diarrhoea, vomiting, renal failure, hypokalaemia, body weight loss and hypoalbuminaemia. Thirty-one patients were hospitalised; four required intensive care. Anti-transglutaminase and anti-enterocyte antibodies were negative; anti-nuclear antibodies were positive (9/11). Endoscopic duodenal biopsies showed villous atrophy (32/32) and polyclonal intra-epithelial CD3+CD8+ lymphocytosis (11/11). Exactly, 14/15 patients responded to steroids and/or immunosuppressants, prescribed because of suspected autoimmune enteropathy. Ten olmesartan interruptions were followed by reintroductions before steroids or immunosuppressants. Interruptions were followed by remissions (9/10), but reintroductions were followed by relapses (9/9). Twenty-nine patients were in remission since olmesartan interruption, including 26 without immunosuppressants. Patients with normal villi had similar clinical characteristics, but mild histological abnormalities (intra-epithelial lymphocytosis and lamina propria lymphocytic infiltration).Olmesartan causes a severe and immune-mediated enteropathy, with or without villous atrophy.

In addition, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin II type I receptor blocker (ARB) can effectively prevent left ventricular remodeling. The current study focused on whether the combination of ACEI and ARB is more beneficial for preventing ventricular remodeling and whether Smad proteins mediate this beneficial effect.MI was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery in rats. Twenty-four hours after ligation, the survived rats were randomly divided into five groups and treated for 8 weeks: placebo group, ACEI group (benazepril 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), ARB group ( 50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)), ACEI + ARB group (benazepril 10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) +  50 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) and control group (sham-operated rats). After 8 weeks, we examined the following indexes: the ratio of ventricular  to  (VW/BW), left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVDd), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), ratio of E-wave to A-wave velocity, collagen of noninfarcted zone, the mRNA expression of TGFbeta(1), Smad 2, and Smad 3 by RT-PCR in noninfarcted zone, the protein expression of Smad 2 and Smad 3 in noninfarcted zone by Western blot.VW/BW significantly increased in the placebo groups compared with that in the control group (P < 0.01). This increase was limited in ACEI, ARB, and combined groups (P < 0.01 compared with placebo group). There was no significant difference among the three actively treated groups. Collagen was increased in placebo group (5.68 +/- 0.5)% compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment attenuated this increase of collagen [(4.3 +/- 0.5)%, (3.5 +/- 0.5)%, (3.2 +/- 0.4)%] in comparison with that in placebo group (P < 0.01 respectively). Combined treatment showed more significant effect on collagen deposition. EF and FS significantly decreased, LVDd and E/A significantly increased in placebo group compared with that in control group (P < 0.01 respectively). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment ameliorated these indexes (P < 0.01 compared with placebo group). The mRNA expression of TGFbeta(1), Smad 2, and Smad 3 (0.700 +/- 0.045, 0.959 +/- 0.037 and 0.850 +/- 0.051) increased in placebo group compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment normalized the increase (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ARB and combined treatment proved to be more effective in decreasing TGF beta(1) and Smad mRNA expression than ACEI treatment (P < 0.01). The expression of Smad 2 and Smad 3 protein increased in placebo group compared with that in control group (P < 0.01). ACEI, ARB and combined treatment normalized the increase (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ARB and combined treatment proved to be more effective than ACEI alone (P < 0.01).TGFbeta(1)-Smads signal activation is correlated with ventricular remodeling following MI. ACEI and ARB treatment prevents ventricular remodeling by inhibiting expression of Smad 2 and Smad 3. ARB and combined treatment are more effective than ACEI alone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25298195>Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade ameliorates proteinuria in puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy by inhibiting the reduction of NEPH1 and nephrin.</a></h2><p>The precise pathogenic mechanism and role of angiotensin II (Ang II) action in the development of proteinuria in minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is uncertain.The glomerular expressions of the slit diaphragm (SD) molecules nephrin, podocin and NEPH1 in rat puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy, a mimic of MCNS, were analyzed. The effects of Ang II receptor blockade (ARB) ( 15 mg/kg body weight/day) on proteinuria and on the expression of the SD molecules were analyzed.mRNA expressions of nephrin, podocin and NEPH1 were decreased to an undetectable level at 1 h. The staining of these SD molecules shifted to a discontinuous pattern, and their intensity was reduced. NEPH1 staining was reduced to an undetectable level on day 10. ARB treatment ameliorated the peak value of proteinuria (237.6 ± 97.0 vs. 359.0 ± 63.3 mg/day, p < 0.05), and prevented the decrease in the mRNA expression of the SD molecules (nephrin 66.96 %, podocin 60.40 %, NEPH1 77.87 % of normal level). The immunofluorescence staining of NEPH1 was restored by ARB. ARB treatment enhanced the expression of NEPH1 of normal rats.Dysfunction of the SD molecules including NEPH1 is a crucial initiation event of PAN nephropathy. ARB treatment ameliorates proteinuria in PAN nephropathy by inhibiting the reduction of NEPH1 and nephrin. Ang II action regulates the expression of NEPH1 and nephrin in not only the pathological but also physiological state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7843749>Hemodynamic and biochemical effects of the AT1 receptor antagonist  in hypertension.</a></h2><p>We studied the hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and biochemical effects of the novel angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist  in 86 untreated patients with essential hypertension on a normal sodium diet. According to a double-blind parallel group trial, patients were randomized to a once-daily oral dose of the AT1 receptor antagonist (1, 25, or 100 mg) or placebo after a placebo run-in period of 3 weeks. Randomization medication was given for 1 week. Compared with placebo, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure did not change with the 1-mg dose, and it fell (mean and 95% confidence interval) by 7.0 (4.2-9.8)/6.1 (3.9-8.1) mm Hg with the 25-mg dose and by 12.1 (8.1-16.2)/7.2 (4.9-9.4) mm Hg with the 100-mg dose. Heart rate did not change during either dose. With the 25-mg dose, the antihypertensive effect was attenuated during the second half of the recording, and with the 100-mg dose, it was maintained for 24 hours. Baseline values of renin and the antihypertensive response to the 25- and 100-mg doses were well correlated (r = .68, P < .01). Renin did not change with the 1-mg dose, but it rose threefold to fourfold with the 25-mg dose and fourfold to fivefold with the 100-mg dose 4 to 6 hours after administration. With the 100-mg dose, renin was still elevated twofold 24 hours after dosing. The changes in renin induced by the AT1 receptor antagonist were associated with parallel increments in angiotensin I and angiotensin II.

The diabetic model rats were then randomly divided into DM group, low-dose (8 mg/kg) and high-dose (16 mg/kg) TG treatment groups, and  (50 mg/kg) treatment group. After 8 weeks, the levels of blood glucose (BG), 24-h urine protein (24 h Upro), serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. The pathological changes in the renal tissues were examined by optical microscopy, and the mean glomerular area (MGA) and mean glomerular volume (MGV) were measured with pathological image analysis. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 protein in the renal tissue, and their mRNA expressions were detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR.HIF-1α and ET-1 expression increased in the kidney of diabetic rats. Compared with the diabetic model rats, the rats receiving TG and  treatment showed decreased levels of Scr, BUN, 24h Upro, MGA and MGV, improved renal histopathology, and reduced expression of HIF-1α and ET-1 mRNA and protein in the renal tissue. These changes were more obvious in high-dose TG treatment group. Correlation analysis showed that the expression of HIF-1α was positively correlated with that of ET-1, and they were both positively correlated with kidney weight index (KW/BW), 24 h Upro, MGA, and MGV.HIF-1α and ET-1 are overexpressed in the kidney of diabetic rats.

While angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, the active peptide that causes a pressor response, the ARBs inhibit its peripheral action. The ARBs reduce blood pressure in animal models as well as in humans. Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996),  (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute liver injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of liver injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute liver failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent liver injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan,  olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and  loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and fatty liver by imaging or liver biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484304>Effects of angiotensin type 1 receptor blockade on arginine and ADMA synthesis and metabolic pathways in fawn-hooded hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>The fawn-hooded hypertensive (FHH) rat develops spontaneous glomerulosclerosis that is ameliorated by inhibition of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1). Since kidney damage is associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, we investigated how AT-1 antagonism influenced nitric oxide synthase (NOS), as well as NOS substrate [L-arginine (L-Arg)] and inhibitor [asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)]. L-Arg is synthesized by renal argininosuccinate synthase/argininosuccinate lyase (ASS/ASL) and then either consumed within the kidney by arginase II or NOS or released into the circulation. L-Arg is then taken up from plasma into cells where it can be utilized by NOS and other pathways. The competitive inhibitor of NOS, ADMA, is degraded by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH).Male FHH rats were put on a 40% casein diet for 13 weeks, and some received AT-1 antagonist which reduced blood pressure and kidney  and prevented glomerulosclerosis and hyperfiltration. The AT-1 antagonist reduced the expression of DDAH2, increased DDAH1 and increased total DDAH activity in the kidney cortex, although there was no change in plasma or kidney cortex ADMA levels. The AT-1 antagonist caused no change in the expression of renal ASS/ASL, but reduced renal and aortic arginase expression and renal arginase activity, which could explain the increased plasma L-Arg. In separate studies, 1 week of AT-1 blockade in young FHH rats had no effect on any of these parameters.Thus, the net result of AT-1 antagonist was an improved L-Arg to ADMA ratio due to the prevention of renal and vascular arginase activation which favours increased NO production. Since 1 week of AT-1 blockade in the absence of kidney damage was without effect on arginases, this suggests that the reduction in arginase activity is secondary to the prevention of structural damage rather than a direct immediate effect of AT-1 antagonism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12511232>Mechanisms of  in prevention of renal lesion in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>To investigate the mechanisms of angiotensin II receptor antagonist  (Irb) in prevention of renal lesion in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal control (group N), diabetic nephropathy (group DN), and diabetic nephropathy treated with Irb (group DNI). Diabetes was induced by injection of STZ ip after rats had received uninephrectomy. Blood glucose (BG),  (BW), urinary albumin excretion (Ualb), and 24-h proteinuria (24hUpro) were observed in the rats at week 4, 8, and 12, respectively. Creatinine clearance (Ccr), the kidney  (KW), profile of kidney hypertrophy (KW/BW), renal tissue protein contents (RTP), glomerular area (AG), glomerular volume (VG), and width of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) were determined after the rats were sacrificed at week 12. Renal expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) were determined by immunohistochemistry.There was no significant difference in BG between group DN and DNI (P >0.05). Irb prevented the increasing of Ualb excretion, 24 hUpro, and Ccr in diabetic rats ( P < 0.01). Furthermore, Irb markedly inhibited the increasing of KW, KW/BW, RTP, AG, and VG shown in diabetic rats (P <0.05, P <0.01, respectively). Irb prevented the thickening of GBM and immunostaining of CTGF (P <0.01). The extent of CTGF expression was positively correlated with the glomerular immunostaining for TGF-beta1 and size of VG (P <0.01).Irb exerts an early renal protective role to diabetic nephropathy, possibly through inhibition of renal hypertrophy and expression of CTGF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14614530>Comparative effects of tamoxifen and angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist therapy on the hemodynamic profile of the ovariectomized female rat.</a></h2><p>Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) has failed to provide a cardioprotective action in postmenopausal women, and thus alternative pharmacological approaches are required. The present study examined the therapeutic potential of the partial estrogen receptor agonist tamoxifen and the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist  on the hemodynamic profile of ovariectomized (OVX) female Sprague-Dawley rats (9-11 weeks). Three weeks following ovariectomy, uterine atrophy was evident and  was increased as compared with sham-operated animals. Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly increased in the OVX rats as compared with sham rats. One week following ovariectomy, rats were treated with either tamoxifen (10 mg kg-1 day-1) or  (40 mg kg-1 day-1) for a period of 2 weeks. The administration of tamoxifen to OVX rats partially reversed uterine atrophy and prevented  gain, albeit  remained significantly lower than in sham-operated animals. LVSP and LVEDP were normalized in the tamoxifen-treated OVX rats, whereas MAP remained elevated.  partially reduced the  gain of the OVX rats and did not influence uterine atrophy. LVSP and MAP were normalized in -treated OVX rats, whereas LVEDP remained elevated. These data demonstrate that  rather than tamoxifen was efficacious in normalizing MAP in the OVX rats without a secondary effect on the uterus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16920393>Extractive-spectrophotometric determination of disopyramide and  in their pharmaceutical formulation.</a></h2><p>Picric acid, bromocresol green, bromothymol blue, cobalt thiocyanate and molybdenum(V) thiocyanate have been tested as spectrophotometric reagents for the determination of disopyramide and .

The rats were randomly allotted into one of five experimental groups: A (control), B (diabetic untreated), C (diabetic treated with Q), D (diabetic treated with Irb), and E (diabetic treated with Q&Irb), each group containing 10 animals. Groups B-E received STZ. Diabetes was induced in four groups by a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (50 mg/kg, freshly dissolved in 5 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 4.5). Two days after STZ treatment, development of diabetes in four experimental groups was confirmed by measuring blood glucose levels in a tail vein blood samples. Rats with blood glucose levels of 250 mg/dL or higher were considered to be diabetic. The rats in Q-, Irb-, and Q&Irb-treated groups were given Q (in a dose of 3 mg/kg ), Irb (5 mg/kg ), and Q&Irb (in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg + 2.5 mg/kg ) once a day orally by using intra-gastric intubation for 12 weeks starting two days after STZ injection. Treatment of Q and especially Irb reduced the glomerular size and thickening of capsular, glomerular, and tubular basement membranes; and increased amounts of mesangial matrix and tubular dilatation and renal function as compared with diabetics untreated. Notably, the better effects were obtained when Q and Irb given together. We conclude that Q, Irb, and especially Q+Irb therapy causes renal morphologic and functional improvement after STZ-induced diabetes in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of Q and Irb treatment, alone or its combination, may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment in diabetic nephropathy (DNp).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11786504>Vasoconstriction is determined by interstitial rather than circulating angiotensin II.</a></h2><p>1. We investigated why angiotensin (Ang) I and II induce vasoconstriction with similar potencies, although Ang I-II conversion is limited. 2. Construction of concentration-response curves to Ang I and II in porcine femoral arteries, in the absence or presence of the AT(1) or AT(2) receptor antagonists  and PD123319, revealed that the approximately 2 fold difference in potency between Ang I and II was not due to stimulation of different AT receptor populations by exogenous and locally generated Ang II. 3. Measurement of Ang I and II and their metabolites at the time of vasoconstriction confirmed that, at equimolar application of Ang I and II, bath fluid Ang II during Ang I was approximately 18 times lower than during Ang II and that Ang II was by far the most important metabolite of Ang I. Tissue Ang II was 2.9+/-1.5% and 12.2+/-2.4% of the corresponding Ang I and II bath fluid levels, and was not affected by  or PD123319, suggesting that it was located extracellularly. 4. Since approximately 15% of tissue  consists of interstitial fluid, it can be calculated that interstitial Ang II levels during Ang II resemble bath fluid Ang II levels, whereas during Ang I they are 8.8 - 27 fold higher. Consequently at equimolar application of Ang I and II, the interstitial Ang II levels differ only 2 - 4 fold. 5. Interstitial, rather than circulating Ang II determines vasoconstriction. Arterial Ang I, resulting in high interstitial Ang II levels via its local conversion by ACE, may be of greater physiological importance than arterial Ang II.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15462695>The effect of  in reducing cardiovascular risk in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients: an observational study in 16,600 patients in primary care.</a></h2><p>As arterial hypertension substantially increases the risk of premature death, cardiovascular disease and renal insufficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes, effective and safe antihypertensive therapy is of importance. Therefore, the effect of  as monotherapy, or in fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide, on blood pressure, metabolic parameters and microalbuminuria and the safety and tolerability of the drug were assessed.Multicentric, prospective, open phase IV study over 3 months in 16,600 patients with the clinical diagnoses of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Blood pressure was measured sphygmometrically and albuminuria was assessed with semi-quantitative urine dipsticks.Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure reduction, proportion of patients with microalbuminuria and cardiovascular risk calculated based on the SCORE score, each after a follow-up of 3 months compared to baseline. Number and nature of adverse events (AEs).The sample consisted of 51.3% men, mean age was 62.2+/-10.7 years, 53.9% of patients were overweight and 26.4% were obese. Mean SBP/DBP decrease after 3 months was 22.3/11.2 mmHg. The BP lowering effect was similar in the analyses of various subgroups (according to age group, sex, presence of micro- or macrovascular complications).  treatment reduced the percentage of patients with microalbuminuria from 45.6% to 30.6% at 3 months (32.9% relative reduction).

The mean 10-year cardiovascular risk as calculated with the SCORE score was decreased from a baseline value of 9.8% to 5.7% (-58% relative reduction). Tolerability was excellent: only 0.3% experienced an AE.Treatment with  in patients with concomitant hypertension and type 2 diabetes led to large blood pressure reductions. In view of the renoprotective effect documented by the reduced rate of patients with albuminuria, and the improvement of further metabolic parameters, these changes translate into a reduction of cardiovascular risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8738798>Angiotensin II modulates glomerular capillary permselectivity in rat isolated perfused kidney.</a></h2><p>Studies in experimental animals and humans have documented that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduces urinary protein excretion rate and retards the development of renal injury.

For sample preparation, protein precipitation using zinc sulphate and methanol showed advantages in speed, recovery, and reproducibility over solid-phase extraction. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex API 365) with turbo ionspray source was used for detection of compounds with multireaction monitoring (MRM) of two transitions per compound. Suppression effects caused by endogenous matrix compounds were investigated by post-column infusion of analytes and LC analysis of precipitates of blank plasma samples and could be excluded. A validation was performed for the ARA-II drugs (valsartan, , losartan and its active metabolite EXP 3174, eprosartan, candesartan, and telmisartan). The developed method showed good intra- and interday precision (<12% relative standard deviation) and accuracy (<11.5% bias) at different concentrations for all the studied compounds. The calculated lower limits of quantitation were between 7 and 13 ng/mL, and the compounds were stable during the analytical process. These rather expensive drugs against hypertension are prescribed with increasing numbers in Europe and the industrialized nations. Complications might arise from overdosage or metabolic disorders. However, drug monitoring is not usually performed. Because the therapeutic concentrations range from a few nanograms to hundreds of nanograms per milliliter for the different drugs, and they are not amenable to gas chromatography/MS analysis because of their high molecular  and polarity, the LC-MS/MS method is the golden standard for therapeutic drug monitoring and for clinical and forensic toxicology of ARA-II drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16798821>Coronary vasoconstrictor influence of angiotensin II is reduced in remodeled myocardium after myocardial infarction.</a></h2><p>The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis by contributing to the regulation of blood volume, blood pressure, and vascular tone. Because AT(1) receptors have been described in the coronary microcirculation, we investigated whether ANG II contributes to the regulation of coronary vascular tone and whether its contribution is altered during exercise. Since the renin-angiotensin system is activated after myocardial infarction, resulting in an increase in circulating ANG II, we also investigated whether the contribution of ANG II to the regulation of vasomotor tone is altered after infarction. Twenty-six chronically instrumented swine were studied at rest and while running on a treadmill at 1-4 km/h. In 13 swine, myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left circumflex coronary artery. Blockade of AT(1) receptors (, 1 mg/kg iv) had no effect on myocardial O(2) consumption but resulted in an increase in coronary venous O(2) tension and saturation both at rest and during exercise, reflecting coronary vasodilation. Despite increased plasma levels of ANG II after infarction and maintained coronary arteriolar AT(1) receptor levels, the vasodilation evoked by  was significantly reduced both at rest and during exercise. In conclusion, despite elevated plasma levels, the vasoconstrictor influence of ANG II on the coronary circulation in vivo is reduced after myocardial infarction. This reduction in ANG II-induced coronary vasoconstriction may serve to maintain perfusion of the remodeled myocardium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999319>Determination of azide impurity in sartans using reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection.</a></h2><p>A simple and robust, gradient HPLC method was developed for determination of azide ppm (μgg(-1)) levels in different sartans (, candesartan, valsartan). The sartan was dissolved in 0.1M NaOH. Then pH was adjusted to 4.5 with 20% H3PO4 followed by dilution with water. Precipitated API was removed by filtration using 0.45μm membrane PVDF (Polyvinylidene Fluoride) membrane filter, and supernatant was analyzed by gradient elution HPLC at room temperature with Hydro RP HPLC 250×4.6mm, 4μm column and UV detection at 205nm. The best sensitivity was achieved by UV detection cell with 60mm optical path length: LOD 0.17μgg(-1) and LOQ 0.84μgg(-1) for azide. The USP requirement for maximum azide content in  is 10μgg(-1). The analytical method was validated as per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines with respect to system precision, intraday precision (repeatability), intermediate precision (ruggedness), linearity, quantitation limit, detection limit, accuracy, standard and sample solution stability, robustness and selectivity/specificity. The method was linear in the range from LOQ (0.84μgg(-1)) to 101μgg(-1) of azide. The correlation coefficient was 0.9999 and bias on y-axis for 84μgg(-1) test concentration was 0.33%. The accuracy of the method was established based on the recovery obtained between 94.0% and 103.0% for azide. Standard and sample solutions were stable for at least 48h at room temperature and in refrigerator. The method was found to be robust for variation in column temperature (±5°C) and mobile phase flow rate (±0.2mLmin(-1)) and selective for anions such as bromide, nitrate, nitrite, formate and acetate.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with  in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria on the urinary proteome.High-resolution capillary-electrophoresis coupled to mass-spectrometry (CE-MS) was used to profile the low-molecular- proteome in urine of a subgroup of patients from a two year randomized  versus placebo therapy trial, which included hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria on ongoing antihypertensive medication (IRMA2-substudy).We demonstrate that the therapy with 300 mg  daily over a period of two years results in significant changes of the urinary proteome. Both, a classifier developed previously that consists of urinary peptides indicative of chronic kidney disease, as well as several individual peptides changed significantly after treatment. These changes were not observed in the placebo-treated individuals. Most prominent are changes of urinary collagen fragments associated with progression of diabetic nephropathy, indicating normalization in urinary peptides.CE-MS analysis of urine enabled identification of peptides as potential surrogate markers for renoprotection in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients, which show persistent improvement after longterm treatment with .

BMI, our measure of obesity, was highly correlated to the renal response to  (r = 0.7; P = 0.01).Our findings suggest an important role for obesity in activating the intrarenal renin system, perhaps via production of angiotensinogen.

Thus endogenous ANG II may have a tonic effect on tissue metabolism that could be reversed with ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade, particularly during adrenergic stimulation. We studied 14 obese men. They were treated for 10 days with the AT1 receptor blocker  or with placebo in a double-blind and crossover fashion. At the end of each treatment period, we assessed skeletal muscle and adipose tissue metabolism using the microdialysis technique. The ethanol dilution technique was applied to follow changes in tissue blood flow. Measurements were obtained at baseline and during application of incremental isoproterenol concentrations through the microdialysis catheter. Blood pressure decreased from 133 +/- 3/84 +/- 3 to 128 +/- 3/79 +/- 2 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood, respectively (P = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively) with AT1 receptor blockade. Isoproterenol perfusion caused a dose-dependent increase in dialysate glycerol in adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle.  slightly reduced the isoproterenol-induced glycerol response in adipose tissue (P < 0.05 by ANOVA). Ethanol ratio, interstitial glucose supply, and lactate production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle were similar with placebo and . We conclude that AT1 receptor blockade in obese men does not reveal a major tonic ANG II effect on interstitial glucose supply, lipolysis, or glycolysis in skeletal muscle, either at rest or during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Endogeneous ANG II may slightly increase adipose tissue lipolysis. The mechanism may promote the redistribution of triglycerides from adipose tissue toward other organs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11270459>Treatment of psychogenic polydipsia: comparison of risperidone and olanzapine, and the effects of an adjunctive angiotensin-II receptor blocking drug ().</a></h2><p>Our objective was to determine the outcome of novel strategies in managing a case of severe polydipsia.The patient was a 39-year-old male with a 20-year history of paranoid schizophrenia who, despite only mild residual psychotic symptoms, had been hospitalized for the previous 10 years because of severe polydipsic behaviour complicated by water intoxication.Novel antipsychotic agents, risperidone and olanzapine, as well as the specific angiotensin-II receptor blocking drug,  were employed at selected intervals in a study lasting nearly 3 years.

Although activators of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha,gamma,delta) in various combinations are under development for treating the metabolic syndrome, they are hampered by adverse effects related to increased adipogenesis,  gain, fluid overload and carcinogenesis. The recent discovery that telmisartan and , antihypertensive angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blockers (ARBs), were uniquely capable of activating PPARgamma, has provided a novel approach to addressing the multifactorial components of the metabolic syndrome. Both drugs have established favorable safety profiles and can activate PPARgamma at concentrations potentially achievable at therapeutic doses. Emerging studies have revealed that both these drugs have beneficial metabolic profiles. This information provides a strategic rationale and pharmacological platform for the development of novel dual ARB/PPARgamma agonists to target the metabolic syndrome and its cardiovascular sequelae, for which therapy is presently insufficient or non-existent. Beneficial effects of these agents include increased energy expenditure, improved lipid profile, increased insulin sensitivity, blood pressure reduction, and amelioration of the associated pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic risk profiles.

Since angiotensin II (ANG II) has been suggested to play an important role in liver inflammation and fibrosis, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether therapy against renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may provide some beneficial effect in liver of an animal model of metabolic syndrome.For 6 months, obese Zucker rats (OZRs) were treated as follows: OZR-group, OZR + Perindopril (P) group, OZR +  (IRB) group, OZR + Amlodipine (AML) group, and lean Zucker rats (LZRs) group as a control. Livers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry techniques using corresponding antibodies.All treated groups showed a similar reduction in blood pressure compared to untreated OZR. Therapy either with IRB or P improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic enzyme level with respect to untreated OZR. Conversely, AML failed to modify both parameters. Untreated OZR displayed higher hepatic ANG II levels and steatosis together with a marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) level compared to LZR. Following RAS inhibition either by P or IRB, a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the immunostaining of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and TGF-beta1 compared to untreated OZR was observed.These results indicate that ANG II expression is increased in the liver of these animals with steatohepatitis. Furthermore, RAS control by either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade seems to provide a beneficial modulation concerning the inflammatory response to liver injury in this model. Consequently, blockade of RAS could be a new approach to prevent or to treat patients with NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19167594>Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of /hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients stratified by  mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus status: a post hoc subgroup analysis of the /HCTZ Blood Pressure Reductions in Diverse Patient Populations trial.</a></h2><p>This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of efficacy and tolerability data from the /HCTZ Blood Pressure Reductions in Diverse Patient Populations (INCLUSIVE) trial stratified by baseline  mass index (BMI).

Secondary efficacy end points were the mean changes in SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline to week 18 in each BMI subgroup, the proportions of patients in each BMI subgroup achieving their SBP target (<140 mm Hg [<130 mm Hg for patients with T2DM]) and DBP target (<90 mm Hg [<80 mm Hg for patients with T2DM]), and the mean SBP and DBP responses at the end of each treatment period.The ITT population included 736 patients, of whom 99 (13.5%) were normal , 243 (33.0%) were overweight, and 394 (53.5%) were obese. Mean baseline SBP and DBP values were similar across BMI subgroups. Obese patients were generally younger than normal- and overweight patients, and numerically more obese patients had T2DM and metabolic syndrome. The mean reductions in SBP and DBP at week 18 were statistically significant in all subgroups (all, P < 0.001); SBP and DBP goals were achieved by a respective 83.8% and 93.9% of normal- patients, 75.3% and 87.7% of overweight patients, and 76.9% and 77.2% of obese patients. Rates of SBP/DBP control to <140/90 mm Hg in normal , overweight, and obese patients without T2DM were 88.2%, 79.8%, and 80.9%, respectively; the corresponding rates of control to <130/80 mm Hg in patients with T2DM were 50.0%, 41.5%, and 38.5%.In this post hoc subgroup analysis of the INCLUSIVE trial, /HCTZ combination therapy had comparable antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability regardless of BMI or diabetes status.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14968145>Economic evaluation of the use of  and amlodipine in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in patients with hypertension in Canada.</a></h2><p> has been shown to reduce the doubling of serum creatinine (a strong predictor of progression to end-stage renal disease), the onset of end-stage renal disease and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with standard care and amlodipine.The present study assessed the cost effectiveness of , an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, in the treatment of Canadian patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension.The analysis was conducted based on a Markov model using Monte Carlo simulation analysis to estimate the expected values for outcomes of interest. Transition probabilities were obtained from a comparative trial of amlodipine,  and standard care (antihypertensive treatment excluding other angiotensin II receptor antagonists or calcium channel blockers) in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy and hypertension.

Systolic blood pressure was elevated in young SHR (130+/-2 mm Hg) compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (106+/-2 mm Hg). In adult SHR, the rise in systolic blood pressure (44+/-3 mm Hg) was blunted by fosinopril (18+/-1 mm Hg) and  (9+/-3 mm Hg). Lumen diameter of mesenteric resistance arteries was smaller and media/lumen ratio was greater in young and adult SHR versus WKY rats.

For the Collaborative Study Group.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the developed world. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to be renoprotective in type I diabetes and are now the standard of care for both hypertensive and non-hypertensive type I diabetic patients with any level of proteinuria. The role of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in type II diabetic patients is not defined. The Collaborative Study Group has initiated the  Type II Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT), studying the effect of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist  on progression of renal disease and mortality in type II diabetic patients with overt nephropathy and hypertension. Here we report the study design and baseline patient characteristics.To qualify, hypertensive type II patients, age 30-70 years, must have a 24 h urinary protein excretion of >900 mg and a serum creatinine 90-265 micromol/l (1.0-3. 0 mg/dl) in women and 110-265 micromol/l (1.2-3.0 mg/dl) in men. Three treatment arms include , placebo and amlodipine, with every attempt made to achieve similar blood pressure levels in all treatment arms.

In this work, we developed and optimized a new methodology for incorporating physical variability in pharmaceutical production based on the NIR spectrum for the process. Such a spectrum contains the spectral changes caused by each treatment applied to the component mixture during the production process. The proposed methodology involves adding a set of process spectra (viz. difference spectra between those for production tablets and a laboratory mixture of identical nominal composition) to the set of laboratory samples, which span the wanted concentration range, in order to construct a calibration set incorporating all physical changes undergone by the samples in each step of the production process. The best calibration model among those tested was selected by establishing the influence of spectral pretreatments used to obtain the process spectrum and construct the calibration models, and also by determining the multiplying factor m to be applied to the process spectra in order to ensure incorporation of all variability sources into the calibration model. The specific samples to be included in the calibration set were selected by principal component analysis (PCA). To this end, the new methodology for constructing calibration sets for determining the Active Principle Ingredients (API) and excipients was applied to  tablets and validated by application to the API and excipients of paracetamol tablets. The proposed methodology provides simple, robust calibration models for determining the different components of a pharmaceutical formulation.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the acute study, obese rats received either vehicle (water) or  1 hour before the experiment. Although  had no effect on glucose transport (2-deoxyglucose uptake) in the epitrochlearis muscle, which consists mainly of type IIb fibers, acute angiotensin II receptor antagonism led to a dose-dependent increase in insulin action in the predominantly type I soleus muscle.  at 25 and 50 mg/kg induced significant increases (41% and 50%, respectively; P<0.05) in insulin-mediated glucose transport. Moreover, these acute -induced improvements in soleus-muscle glucose transport were associated with enhancements in whole- insulin sensitivity (r=-0.732; P<0.05), as assessed during an oral glucose tolerance test. After chronic administration of  (21 days at 50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), glucose tolerance was enhanced further, and insulin-mediated glucose transport was significantly elevated in both epitrochlearis (32%) and soleus (73%) muscle. Chronic angiotensin II receptor antagonism was associated with significant increases in glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) protein expression in soleus (22%) and plantaris (20%) muscle and myocardium (15%). Chronic -induced increases in whole- insulin sensitivity were associated with increased insulin-mediated glucose transport in both epitrochlearis (r=-0.677; P<0.05) and soleus (r=-0.892; P<0.05) muscle. In summary, angiotensin II receptor (AT(1)-subtype) antagonism, either acutely or chronically, improves glucose tolerance, at least in part because of an enhancement in skeletal-muscle glucose transport, and the effect of chronic angiotensin II receptor antagonism on type I skeletal-muscle glucose uptake is associated with an increase in GLUT-4 protein expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634212>[Regulatory Effect of Chinese Drugs for Stasis Removing and Collaterals Dredging on the Expres- sions of podocin and CD2AP in Podocyte Slit Diaphragm of Diabetic Nephropathy Rats].</a></h2><p>To observe the regulatory effect of Chinese drugs for stasis removing and collaterals dredging (CDSRCD) on the expressions of podocin and CD2AP in podocyte slit diaphragm (SD) of diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats.DN rat model was duplicated in 40 male Sprague- Dawley rats by feeding high fat high glucose diet combined with intraperitoneally injecting 1 % streptozoto- cin (STZ, 35 mg/kg).
