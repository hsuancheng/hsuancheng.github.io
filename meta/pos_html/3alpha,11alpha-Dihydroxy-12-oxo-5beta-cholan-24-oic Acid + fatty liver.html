Activity measurements in  and fibroblasts using a newly developed method.</a></h2><p>Sterol carrier protein X (SCPx) plays a crucial role in the peroxisomal oxidation of branched-chain  . To investigate whether patients with an unresolved defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation are deficient for SCPx, we developed a novel and specific assay to measure the activity of SCPx in both  and fibroblast homogenates. The substrate used in the assay, , 7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-24-keto-5beta-cholestanoy l-CoA (24-keto-THC-CoA), is produced by preincubating the enoyl-CoA of the bile  intermediate THCA with a lysate from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing human D-bifunctional protein. After the preincubation period,  or fibroblast homogenate is added plus CoASH, and the production of choloyl-CoA is determined by HPLC. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the finding of a full deficiency in fibroblasts from an SCPx knock-out mouse. In addition to SCPx activity measurements in fibroblasts from patients with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation of unresolved etiology, we studied the stability and activity of SCPx in fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome, which lack functional peroxisomes. We found that SCPx is not only stable in the cytosol, but displays a higher activity in fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome than in control fibroblasts. Furthermore, in all patients studied with a defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation of unknown origin, SCPx was found to be normally active, indicating that human SCPx deficiency remains to be identified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25191539>Asperuloside stimulates metabolic function in rats across several organs under high-fat diet conditions, acting like the major ingredient of Eucommia leaves with anti-obesity activity.</a></h2><p>Eucommia leaves (Eucommia ulmoides Oliver) contain chlorogenic  (a caffeic  derivative) and geniposidic  and asperuloside (ASP), iridoid glucosides used in beverages. We used a metabolic syndrome rat model, produced by feeding a 35 % high-fat diet (HFD), to examine potential anti-obesity and anti-metabolic syndrome effects and mechanisms of chronic administration of ASP. These effects were compared with Eucommia leaf extract (ELE), the positive control, which exhibits anti-obesity effects. A total of six rats were studied for 3 months in five groups. ASP suppressed body weight, visceral fat weight, food intake and circulating levels of glucose, insulin and lipids, and increased the plasma adiponectin level in rats on a HFD. These effects are similar to those of ELE, except for the influence on the plasma glucose level. RT-PCR studies showed that ASP (like ELE with known anti-obesity effects) diminished isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α, NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 1 (Comp I) mRNA and   synthase levels (white adipose tissue), increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very-long-chain mRNA levels (), and increased Glut4, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3α, succinyl CoA synthase, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase and succinate dehydrogenase mRNA levels (skeletal muscle) under HFD conditions. Interestingly, ASP administration resulted in significantly increased mRNA levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the brown adipose tissue of HFD-fed rats; ELE did not affect the expression of UCP1. The increased expression of UCP1 may be negated by many ingredients other than ASP in the ELE. These findings suggest that chronic administration of ASP stimulates anti-obesity and anti-metabolic syndrome activity in HFD-fed rats across several organs, similar to ELE administration; thus, ASP may be an important ingredient of ELE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12774021>Elevated hepatocyte levels of the Forkhead box A2 (HNF-3beta) transcription factor cause postnatal steatosis and mitochondrial damage.</a></h2><p>The Forkhead box (Fox) transcription factor Foxa2 (HNF-3beta) and related family members Foxa1 (HNF-) and Foxa3 (HNF-3gamma) act in concert with other hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF) to coordinately regulate -specific gene expression. To circumvent the hepatic functional redundancy of the Foxa proteins, we used the T-77 transgenic (TG) mouse line in which the -3-kb transthyretin (TTR) promoter functioned to increase hepatocyte expression of the Foxa2 cDNA. Adult TG mice exhibited reduced hepatic glycogen and progressive  injury, but maintained normal serum levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon. In this study, we further characterized the postnatal  defect in TTR-FoxA2 TG mice. The postnatal TG mice displayed significant reduction in serum glucose levels and in hepatocyte glycogen storage without increased serum levels of ketone bodies and free   suggesting that they are not undergoing a starvation response. We show that TG  developed a substantial transient steatosis, which reached a maximum at postnatal day 5 and is associated with increased expression of hepatic genes involved in   and triglyceride synthesis, lipid beta-oxidation, and amino  biosynthesis. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis of postnatal TG  revealed extensive mitochondrial membrane damage, which is likely due to reactive oxygen species generated from lipid beta-oxidation. In conclusion, our model proposes that in response to reduction in hepatocyte glycogen storage, the TTR-Foxa2 TG mice survive by maintaining sufficient serum levels of glucose through gluconeogenesis using deaminated amino  with dicarboxylate products of peroxisomal lipid beta-oxidation shuttled through the tricarboxylic  cycle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16611167>Roles of type 10 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in intracrinology and metabolism of isoleucine and  .</a></h2><p>Human type 10 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) is a homotetrameric protein located in mitochondria. This enzyme was alternatively named short chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHSD). This NAD(H)-dependent dehydrogenase is essential for the metabolism of branched-chain   and isoleucine, and is expressed in a variety of tissues, e.g., prostate, brain, , and heart. This enzyme inactivates 17beta-estradiol and exhibits a strong oxidative -HSD activity to convert 5alpha-androstanediol and allopregnanolone into 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT) and 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone, respectively, in living cells. Certain malignant prostatic epithelial cells and activated astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease patient's brain contain extraordinarily high levels of this enzyme. This mitochondrial dehydrogenase enables prostate cancer cells to generate 5alpha-DHT in the absence of testosterone. Its inactivation of allopregnanolone is important to the modulation of GABA(A) receptor. Among steroidogenic enzymes 17beta-HSD10 plays a significant part in the intracrinology. Although this protein has an affinity for amyloid-beta peptide, its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is far from clear. Additional knowledge of this versatile enzyme would provide the foundation for designing new drugs aimed at treating some neurological diseases and certain types of cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/192722>Mechanism of C-5 double bond introduction in the biosynthesis of cholesterol by rat  microsomes.</a></h2><p>The dehydrogenation reaction of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol (I) to cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol (II) in the presence of NADH was studied in rat  microsomes and in microsomal acetone powder preparations, using [-3H]cholest-7-en-3beta-ol. It was found that the reaction was inhibited by menadione, adenosine diphosphate, potassium ferricyanide, and cytochrome c while p-cresol had no effect. These results indicated the participation of a microsomal electron transport system in the dehydrogenation of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol. The conversion of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol to cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol was also observed in the absence of NADH when ascorbic  was included in the incubation mixture. However, the ascorbic -catalyzed dehydrogenation was not inhibited by potassium ferricyanide. Immunological evidence that microsomal cytochrome b5 is involved in the dehydrogenation of (I) to (II) was obtained. Antibodies specific for rat  microsomal cytochrome b5 were elicited in rabbits. The anticytochrome b5 immunoglobulin fraction inhibited rat  microsomal NADH-cytochrome c reductase but not NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. Also, the extent of reduction of cytochrome b5 was not affected by the antibodies. The conversion of (I) to (II) by rat  microsomes was inhibited (73%) by anticytochrome b5 immunoglobulin at a ratio of microsomal protein:immunoglobulin of 1:5.6. These results are consistent with the participation of microsomal cytochrome b5 in the introduction of the C-5 double bond in cholesterol biosynthesis. A close analogy of the microsomal dehydrogenation of   and of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol is apparent and this suggests a possible similarity in the mechanisms of the two reactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21147505>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibition attenuates hepatocyte lipoapoptosis.</a></h2><p>Saturated free   induce hepatocyte lipoapoptosis, a key pathologic feature of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The saturated free   palmitate induces hepatocyte lipoapoptosis via an endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway resulting in c-Jun-N-terminal (JNK) activation. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 is a serine/threonine kinase which may also promote JNK activation. Thus, our aim was to determine if GSK-3 inhibition suppresses palmitate induced JNK activation and lipoapoptosis.For these studies, we employed mouse primary hepatocytes, Huh-7 and Hep3B cell lines.Palmitate-induced GSK-3 activation was identified by phosphorylation of its substrate glycogen synthase. GSK-3 pharmacologic inhibition, by GSK-3 inhibitor IX and enzastaurin, significantly reduced PA-mediated lipoapoptosis. More importantly, Huh-7 cells, in which either GSK-3α or GSK-3β isoforms were stably and selectively knocked down by shRNA, displayed resistance to palmitate-induced cytotoxicity. GSK-3 pharmacological inhibitors and shRNA-targeted knockdown of GSK-3α or GSK-3β also suppressed JNK activation by palmitate. JNK activation, in part, promotes lipoapotosis by inducing expression of the pro-apoptotic effector p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). Consistent with this concept, GSK-3 pharmacologic inhibition also reduced PUMA cellular protein levels during exposure to palmitate. On the other hand, the GSK-3 inhibitors did not prevent PA induction of ER stress.Our results suggest that GSK-3 activation promotes a JNK-dependent cytotoxic signaling cascade culminating in lipoapoptosis.Copyright © 2010 European Association for the Study of the .

This issue was addressed by examining the response of mice overexpressing physiologically relevant levels of SCP-2 to a cholesterol-rich diet. While neither SCP-2 overexpression nor cholesterol-rich diet altered food consumption, increased weight gain, hepatic lipid, and bile  accumulation were observed in wild-type mice fed the cholesterol-rich diet. SCP-2 overexpression further exacerbated hepatic lipid accumulation in cholesterol-fed females (cholesterol/cholesteryl esters) and males (cholesterol/cholesteryl esters and triacyglycerol). Primarily in female mice, hepatic cholesterol accumulation induced by SCP-2 overexpression was associated with increased levels of LDL-receptor, HDL-receptor scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-B1) (as well as PDZK1 and/or membrane-associated protein 17 kDa), SCP-2,    binding protein (L-FABP), and -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, without alteration of other proteins involved in cholesterol uptake (caveolin), esterification (ACAT2), efflux (ATP binding cassette A-1 receptor, ABCG5/8, and apolipoprotein A1), or oxidation/transport of bile salts (cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, sterol 27alpha-hydroxylase, Na(+)/taurocholate cotransporter, Oatp1a1, and Oatp1a4). The effects of SCP-2 overexpression and cholesterol-rich diet was downregulation of proteins involved in cholesterol transport (L-FABP and SR-B1), cholesterol synthesis (related to sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 and HMG-CoA reductase), and bile  oxidation/transport (via Oapt1a1, Oatp1a4, and SCP-x). Levels of serum and hepatic bile  were decreased in cholesterol-fed SCP-2 overexpression mice, especially in females, while the total bile  pool was minimally affected. Taken together, these findings support an important role for SCP-2 in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693358>Anti-steatosis compounds from leaves of Mallotus furetianus.</a></h2><p>There is no drug administration-approved therapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this pathogenic paradox. Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to palmitate for twenty hours. To establish the physiological relevance of the in vitro findings, we also studied insulin-resistant Zucker Diabetic  (ZDF) rats. While insulin-receptor phosphorylation was unaffected, activation of Akt and inactivation of the downstream targets Glycogen synthase kinase 3α (Gsk3α and Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) was inhibited in palmitate-exposed cells. Accordingly, dose-response curves for insulin-mediated suppression of the FoxO1-induced gluconeogenic genes and for de novo glucose production were right shifted, and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis were impaired. In contrast, similar to findings in human T2D, the ability of insulin to induce triglyceride (TG) accumulation and transcription of the enzymes that catalyze de novo lipogenesis and TG assembly was unaffected. Insulin-induction of these genes could, however, be blocked by inhibition of the atypical PKCs (aPKCs). The activity of the Akt-inactivating Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was increased in the insulin-resistant cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PP2A by specific inhibitors increased insulin-stimulated activation of Akt and phosphorylation of FoxO1 and Gsk3α. Finally, PP2A mRNA levels were increased in , muscle and adipose tissue, while PP2A activity was increased in  and muscle tissue in insulin-resistant ZDF rats. In conclusion, our findings indicate that FFAs may cause a selective impairment of insulin action upon hepatic glucose metabolism by increasing PP2A activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303744>Agonism for the bile  receptor GPBAR1 reverses  and vascular damage in a mouse model of steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the  and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein-coupled bile -activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses  and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile  that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses  and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed  injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6,TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay. BAR501 reversed this pattern in a Gpbar1-dependent manner, highlighting a potential role for GPBAR1 agonism in treating the  and vascular component of NASH.-Carino, A., Marchianò, S., Biagioli, M., Bucci, M., Vellecco, V., Brancaleone, V., Fiorucci, C., Zampella, A., Monti, M.

F-labeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic  penta-peptide (F-FPP-RGD) has been used as a PET probe for tumors expressing integrin αvβ3. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of PET with F-FPP-RGD to detect hepatic integrin αvβ3 expression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model mice.Thirty-two male C57BL/6 mice aged 6 weeks were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino -defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for 3 and 8 weeks. F-FPP-RGD PET imaging of the liver was performed at 3 and 8 weeks after CDAHFD feeding. After PET scanning, levels of hepatic integrin αvβ, 3α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and collagen type 1 alpha 1(col1a1) were measured. Histopathological analysis of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as blood biochemistry analysis, was also performed. CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks produced a moderate-to-severe steatosis and inflammation of the liver in mice. NAFLD activity score (NAS) in mice fed the CDAHFD for 3 and 8 weeks were more than 4 indicating NASH or borderline NASH pathology. Fibrosis was observed only in mice fed the CDAHFD for 8 weeks. PET imaging showed that the hepatic standardized uptake value, SUV, was increased with prolonged CDAHFD feeding compared with the respective controls (CDAHFD 3 weeks 0.32 ± 0.06 vs 0.48 ± 0.05, p < 0.01; CDAHFD 8 weeks 0.35 ± 0.04 vs 0.75 ± 0.07, p < 0.01, respectively). Prolonged CDAHFD feeding increased hepatic mRNA and protein levels of integrin αv and β3 at 3 and 8 weeks. Hepatic F-FPP-RGD uptake and amount of integrin αv and β3 protein were well correlated (r = 0.593, p < 0.05 and r = 0.835, p < 0.001, respectively). Hepatic F-FPP-RGD uptake also showed a positive correlation with Sirius red-positive area.The hepatic uptake of F-FPP-RGD correlated well with integrin αv and β3 expression and histological fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH, suggesting the predictability of fibrosis in NASH pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18158556>F2-isoprostane receptors on hepatic stellate cells.</a></h2><p>F2-isoprostanes are considered as the most reliable markers of oxidative stress and can be used to evaluate the oxidative status in a number of human pathologies. Besides being markers of oxidative stress, F2-isoprostanes proved to be mediators of important biological effects and would act through the activation of receptors analogous to those for thromboxane A2. In a previous work, we provided evidence that F(2)-isoprostanes, generated during carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis, mediate hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation and collagen hyperproduction. To investigate whether TxA2 receptor (TxA2r or TPr) is involved in the effects of F2-isoprostanes on HSC, experiments on DNA synthesis were carried out in the presence of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-epi-PGF(2alpha)) or the TxA2r-specific agonist I-BOP ([1S-[1alpha,2alpha(Z),3beta(1E,3S*), 4alpha]]-7-[3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic ). Both agonists significantly stimulated DNA synthesis, which was almost completely inhibited by the TxA2r-specific antagonist SQ29548 ([1S-[1alpha,2alpha(Z),,4alpha]]-7-[3-[[2-[(phenylamino)carbonyl] hydrazino] methyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptanoic ), suggesting that much of the effect of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) is mediated by the TxA2r. Further studies showed that increasing concentrations of SQ29548 progressively inhibit DNA synthesis, suggesting a possible competitive antagonism between the two molecules. In addition, we demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) on collagen synthesis could be mediated by TxA2r. The occurrence of TxA2r on HSC was also investigated using western blotting analysis and immunocytochemistry, which reveals that TP is distributed both on plasma membranes and within the cells. Moreover, binding studies indicated the presence of a specific binding site for 3H-SQ29548 on HSC. Competition binding studies indicated that 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) and I-BOP were both able to displace 3H-SQ29548 binding with a very different affinity (K(i)=4.14+/-1.9 x 10(-6) M and K(i)=1.15+/-0.3 x 10(-9) M, respectively), suggesting the involvement of a modified form of isoprostane receptor, homologous to the classic thromboxane A2-binding site in F2-isoprostanes-evoked responses on HSC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30584465>Interleukin-4 Boosts Insulin-Induced Energy Deposits by Enhancing Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with dysregulated hepatic gluconeogenesis as the major cause of fasting hyperglycemia, is closely associated with chronic inflammation. We previously demonstrated interleukin-4 (IL-4) improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance while reducing lipid deposits. The present study examined the  effects of IL-4 on insulin signaling molecules, glucose uptake, and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, as well as  effects on hepatic adiposity, for elucidating the roles of IL-4 in hepatic energy metabolism. Potential interaction between IL-4 and insulin in regulating hepatic metabolism was also investigated. Our results showed that IL-4 enhanced Akt and GSK-3/ phosphorylations, which in turn promoted glycogen synthesis. IL-4 not only potentiated basal glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 2 expression but also promoted insulin-induced glucose uptake. Additionally, IL-4 increased triglyceride contents through facilitating free   uptake and expression/activity of lipogenic enzymes. The major effects of IL-4 on the  were to promote energy storage by boosting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipid synthesis. This study provides evidence to implicate the novel roles of IL-4 in mediating hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, interactions between immune responses and metabolic homeostasis, and the involvement of IL-4 in metabolic abnormalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145152>Potentiation of insulin signaling in tissues of Zucker obese rats after acute and long-term treatment with PPARgamma agonists.</a></h2><p>Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), improve insulin sensitivity in vivo, and the mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we showed that, in Zucker obese (fa/fa) rats, acute (1-day) treatment with both rosiglitazone (a TZD) and a non-TZD PPARgamma agonist (nTZD) reduced plasma free   and insulin levels and, concomitantly, potentiated insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 (Akt-pT308) in adipose and muscle tissues. A similar effect on Akt was observed in  after a 7-day treatment. The increase in Akt-pT308 was correlated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (Akt-pS473), tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta subunit and insulin receptor substrate-1, and serine phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-/beta. The agonists appeared to potentiate Akt1 phosphorylation in muscle and  and both Akt1 and Akt2 in adipose. Finally, potentiation of insulin signaling was also observed in isolated adipose tissue ex vivo and differentiated 3T3 L1 adipocytes in vitro, but not in rat primary hepatocytes in vitro. These results suggest that 1) PPARgamma agonists acutely potentiate insulin signaling in adipose and muscle tissues and such regulation may be physiologically relevant to insulin sensitization in vivo; 2) the agonists directly target adipose tissues; and 3) the metabolic and signaling effects of the agonists are mediated by structurally distinct PPARgamma agonists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15984932> --binding protein (L-FABP) gene ablation alters  bile  metabolism in male mice.</a></h2><p>Although the physiological roles of the individual bile  synthetic enzymes have been extensively examined, relatively little is known regarding the function of intracellular bile -binding proteins. Male L-FABP ( --binding protein) gene-ablated mice were used to determine a role for L-FABP, the major  bile -binding protein, in bile  and biliary cholesterol metabolism. First, in control-fed mice L-FABP gene ablation alone increased the total bile  pool size by 1.5-fold, especially in gall-bladder and , but without altering the proportions of bile , cholesterol and phospholipid. Loss of  L-FABP was more than compensated by up-regulation of: other  cytosolic bile -binding proteins [GST (glutathione S-transferase), -HSD (-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)], key hepatic bile  synthetic enzymes [CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase) and CYP27A1 (sterol 27alpha-hydroxylase)], membrane bile  translocases [canalicular BSEP (bile salt export pump), canalicular MRP2 (multidrug resistance associated protein 2), and basolateral/serosal OATP-1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1)], and positive alterations in nuclear receptors [more LXRalpha ( X receptor alpha) and less SHP (short heterodimer partner)]. Secondly, L-FABP gene ablation reversed the cholesterol-responsiveness of bile  metabolic parameters such that total bile  pool size, especially in gall-bladder and , was reduced 4-fold, while the mass of biliary cholesterol increased 1.9-fold. The dramatically reduced bile  levels in cholesterol-fed male L-FABP (-/-) mice were associated with reduced expression of: (i)  cytosolic bile -binding proteins (L-FABP, GST and -HSD), (ii) hepatic bile  synthetic enzymes [CYP7A1, CYP27A1 and SCP-x (sterol carrier protein-x/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase)] concomitant with decreased positive nuclear receptor alterations (i.e. less LXRalpha and more SHP), and (iii) membrane bile  transporters (BSEP, MRP2 and OATP-1). These are the first results suggesting a physiological role for the major cytosolic bile -binding protein (L-FABP) in influencing  bile metabolic phenotype and gall-bladder bile lipids of male mice, especially in response to dietary cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11980911>Participation of two members of the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family in bile  synthesis and recycling.</a></h2><p>Bile  are synthesized de novo in the  from cholesterol and conjugated to glycine or taurine via a complex series of reactions involving multiple organelles. Bile  secreted into the small intestine are efficiently reabsorbed and reutilized. Activation by thioesterification to CoA is required at two points in bile  metabolism. First, ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic , the 27-carbon precursor of cholic , must be activated to its CoA derivative before side chain cleavage via peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Second, reutilization of cholate and other C24 bile  requires reactivation prior to re-conjugation. We reported previously that homolog 2 of very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS) can activate cholate (Steinberg, S. J., Mihalik, S. J., Kim, D. G., Cuebas, D. A., and Watkins, P. A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15605-15608). We now show that this enzyme also activates chenodeoxycholate, the secondary bile  deoxycholate and lithocholate, and ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoic . In contrast, VLCS activated ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestanoate, but did not utilize any of the C24 bile  as substrates. We hypothesize that the primary function of homolog 2 is in the reactivation and recycling of C24 bile , whereas VLCS participates in the de novo synthesis pathway.

These components each affect androgen-regulated gene expression. The objective of this work was to determine the combined effects of selenium and isoflavones on androgen-regulated gene expression in rat prostate.Male Noble rats were exposed from conception until 200 days of age to diets containing an adequate (0.33-0.45 mg/kg diet) or high (3.33-3.45 mg/kg) concentration of selenium as Se-methylselenocysteine and a low (10 mg/kg) or high (600 mg/kg) level of isoflavones in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Gene expression in the dorsolateral prostate was determined for the androgen receptor, for androgen-regulated genes, and for Akr1c9, whose product catalyzes the reduction of dihydrotestosterone to 5alpha-androstane-, 17beta-diol. Activity of hepatic glutathione peroxidise 1 and of prostatic 5alpha reductase were also assayed.There were no differences due to diet in activity of  glutathione peroxidase activity. Total activity of 5alpha reductase in prostate was significantly lower (p = 0.007) in rats fed high selenium/high isoflavones than in rats consuming adequate selenium/low isoflavones. High selenium intake reduced expression of the androgen receptor, Dhcr24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase), and Abcc4 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 4). High isoflavone intake decreased expression of Facl3 (  CoA ligase 3), Gucy1a3 (guanylate cyclase alpha 3), and Akr1c9. For Abcc4 the combination of high selenium/high isoflavones had a greater inhibitory effect than either treatment alone.

These two neuroactive steroids exert protective effects, by mechanisms that still remain elusive. We have previously shown that the activation of Liver X Receptors improves the peripheral neuropathic phenotype in diabetic rats. This protective effect is accompanied by the restoration to control values of the levels of dihydroprogesterone and 3α-diol in peripheral nerves. In addition, activation of these receptors decreases peripheral myelin abnormalities by improving the lipid desaturation capacity, which is strongly blunted by diabetes, and ultimately restores the myelin lipid profile to non-diabetic values. On this basis, we here investigate whether dihydroprogesterone or 3α-diol may exert their protective effects by modulating the myelin lipid profile. We report that both neuroactive steroids act on the lipogenic gene expression profile in the sciatic nerve of diabetic rats, reducing the accumulation of myelin saturated fatty  and promoting desaturation. These changes were associated with a reduction in myelin structural alterations. These findings provide evidence that dihydroprogesterone and 3α-diol are protective agents against diabetic peripheral neuropathy by regulating the de novo lipogenesis pathway, which positively influences myelin lipid profile.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which signaling molecules control SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis and senescence.We developed cellular models for stress-induced senescence, by exposing Chang cells, which are immortalized human  cells, to subcytotoxic concentrations (200 µM) of deferoxamine (DFO) and H2O2.In this model of stress-induced cell senescence using DFO and H2O2, the phosphorylation profile of glycogen synthase kinase 3α (GSK3α) and β corresponded closely to the expression profile of the mature form of SREBP-1 protein. Inhibition of GSK3 with a subcytotoxic concentration of the selective GSK3 inhibitor SB415286 significantly increased mature SREBP1 expression, as well as lipogenesis and organellar mass. In addition, GSK3 inhibition was sufficient to induce senescence in Chang cells. Suppression of GSK3 expression with siRNAs specific to GSK3α and β also increased mature SREBP1 expression and induced senescence. Finally, blocking lipogenesis with   synthase inhibitors (cerulenin and C75) and siRNA-mediated silencing of SREBP1 and ATP citrate lyase (ACL) significantly attenuated GSK3 inhibition-induced senescence.GSK3 inactivation is an important upstream event that induces SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis and consequent cell senescence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9133619>Physiological role of D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein.</a></h2><p>The second and third reactions of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation spiral are thought to be catalyzed by enoyl-CoA hydratase/L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein (L-bifunctional protein). Recently, we found the presence of D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein (D-bifunctional protein) in mammalian peroxisomes. Therefore, we studied the physiological role of the D-bifunctional protein. The contents of the L- and D-bifunctional proteins were about 0.01 and 0.5 microg/mg protein, respectively, in cultured human skin fibroblasts. The activity of conversion of hexadecenoyl-CoA to 3-ketopalmitoyl-CoA by the D-bifunctional protein was estimated to be about 0.5 milliunit/mg of fibroblast protein. This value was about 100-fold that of the L-bifunctional protein in the fibroblasts. From comparison of the activities of the bifunctional proteins with the rate of palmitate oxidation and the activities of acyl-CoA oxidase and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, it is proposed that the D-bifunctional protein plays a major role in the peroxisomal oxidation of palmitate in the fibroblasts. The contents of both the L- and D-bifunctional proteins in  were about 2.5 microg/mg protein. Therefore, it is suggested that the D-bifunctional protein also plays a significant role in human  peroxisomal   oxidation. Actions of the bifunctional proteins on enoyl forms of other acyl-CoA derivatives were examined. The D-bifunctional protein but not the L-bifunctional protein reacted with 2-methylhexadecenoyl-CoA and ,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholest-2 4-enoyl-CoA. We propose that, among the reactions of the distinct group of carboxylates oxidized specifically in peroxisomes, oxidation of 2-methyl-branched   and side-chain shortening of cholesterol for bile  formation are catalyzed by the D-bifunctional protein, but not the L-bifunctional protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24031053>Post-prandial regulation of hepatic glucokinase and lipogenesis requires the activation of TORC1 signalling in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>To assess the potential involvement of TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) signalling in the regulation of post-prandial hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism-related gene expression in trout, we employed intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin to achieve an acute inhibition of the TOR pathway. Our results reveal that rapamycin inhibits the phosphorylation of TORC1 and its downstream effectors (S6K1, S6 and 4E-BP1), without affecting Akt and the Akt substrates Forkhead-box Class O1 (FoxO1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β (GSK 3α/β). These results indicate that acute administration of rapamycin in trout leads to the inhibition of TORC1 activation. No effect is observed on the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and   oxidation, but hepatic TORC1 inhibition results in decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) gene expression and suppressed   synthase (FAS) and glucokinase (GK) at gene expression and activity levels, indicating that FAS and GK activity is controlled at a transcriptional level in a TORC1-dependent manner. This study demonstrates for the first time in fish that post-prandial regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and glucokinase in rainbow trout requires the activation of TORC1 signalling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079722>Enhanced steatosis by nuclear receptor ligands: a study in cultured human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with a characterized nuclear receptor expression profile.</a></h2><p>Steatosis is the first step in the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis are not fully understood. Many nuclear receptors (NRs) involved in energy homeostasis and biotransformation constitute a network connecting  , cholesterol and xenobiotic metabolisms; therefore, multiple NRs and their ligands may play a prominent role in  fat metabolism and accumulation. In this study we have attempted to gain insight into the relevance of the NR superfamily in NAFLD by investigating the steatogenic potential of 76 different NR ligands in   overloaded human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. Moreover, we have determined the mRNA expression level of 24 NRs to correlate the steatogenic potential of the ligands with the expression of their associated NRs in the cultured cells. Our results demonstrate that 18% of the examined NR ligands enhanced lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes and/or hepatoma cells. Among them, ligands of PPARgamma (e.g., thiazolidinediones), LXR (paxilline and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol), PXR (hyperforin), CAR (,5alpha-androstenol), ERalpha (tamoxifen), FXR (Z-guggulsterone), VDR (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) and particular retinoids and farnesoids showed a significant pro-steatotic effect. The mRNA level of most of the NRs examined was well preserved in human hepatocytes, but HepG2 showed a deranged profile, where many of the receptors had a marginal or negligible level of expression in comparison with the human . By comparing the steatogenic effect of NR ligands with the NR expression levels, we conclude that LXR, PXR, RAR and PPARgamma ligands likely induce fat accumulation by a NR-dependent mechanism. Indeed, over-expression of PXR in HepG2 cells enhanced the steatogenic effect of hyperforin and rifampicin. However, the accumulation of fat induced by other ligands did not correlate with the expression of their associated NR. Our results also suggest that human hepatocytes cultured with free   offer a highly valuable in vitro system to investigate the pathogenesis and therapeutics of the human .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/962892>The metabolism of steroids in the  induced by orotic  feeding.</a></h2><p>1.

We and others have shown that ER stress can induce intracellular lipid accumulation through the activation of the sterol responsive element binding proteins (SREBPs) and initiate programmed cell death by activation of caspases. It has been suggested that ER stress-induced lipid accumulation and cell death play a role in the pathogenesis of disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-1 diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis. Here we show that exposure of HepG2 cells to the branch chain  , valproate, increases cellular resistance to ER stress-induced dysfunction. Two distinctly different potential mechanisms for this protective effect were investigated. We show that exposure to valproate increases the expression of chaperones that assist in the folding of proteins in the ER including GRP78/BiP, GRP94, PDI and calreticulin as well as the cytosolic chaperone, HSP70. However, exposure of HepG2 cells to valproate does not decrease the apparent ER stress response in cells challenged with tunicamycin, A23187 or glucosamine, suggesting that valproate-conferred protection occurs downstream of ER dysfunction. Finally, we demonstrate that valproate directly inhibits the glycogen synthase kinases (GSK)-/beta. The ability of lithium, another inhibitor of GSK3alpha/beta to protect cells from ER stress-induced lipid accumulation suggests that GSK3 plays a central role in signaling downstream effects of ER stress. Strategies to protect cells from agents/conditions that induce ER stress may have potential in the treatment of the growing number of diseases and disorders linked to ER dysfunction.</p></html>
