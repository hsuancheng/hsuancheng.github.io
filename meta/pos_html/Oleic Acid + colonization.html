Strain H4420N was cultured for 6 h in Luria-Bertani broth amended with individual fatty acids at 20 mmol/L, with pH adjusted to 7.0, 4.3, or 2.5. None of the fatty acids exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 7.0 (p >0.05). At pH 4.3, only capric, lauric, and linoleic acids reduced viability of H4420N (p < 0.05). At pH 2.5,  (C18:1) and linolenic (C18:3) acids had modest effects on H4420N viability, whereas capric (C10:0), lauric (C12:0), and linoleic (C18:2) acids resulted in a reduction > or =5 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (p < 0.05). Capric and lauric acids were examined further at pH 2.5 over a range of concentrations (0.15-20 mmol/L). After 10 min of exposure, 5 log10 CFU/mL reductions (p < 0.05) were achieved by lauric  at 2.5 mmol/L and by capric  at 0.31 mmol/L.  stress increased the sensitivity of -tolerant E. coli O157:H7 strain H4420N to fatty acids. Including sources of these fatty acids in diets for cattle might impair the ability of this zoonotic pathogen to survive passage through the stomach, possibly reducing the potential for its  in the lower gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3572838>Intestinal mucus protects Giardia lamblia from killing by human milk.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that nonimmune human milk kills Giardia lamblia trophozoites in vitro. Killing requires a bile salt and the activity of the milk bile salt-stimulated lipase. We now show that human small-intestinal mucus protects trophozoites from killing by milk. Parasite survival increased with mucus concentration, but protection was overcome during longer incubation times or with greater milk concentrations. Trophozoites preincubated with mucus and then washed were not protected. Protective activity was associated with non-mucin CsCl density gradient fractions. Moreover, it was heat-stable, non-dialyzable, and non-lipid. Whereas whole mucus inhibited milk lipolytic activity, protective mucus fractions did not inhibit the enzyme. Furthermore, mucus partially protected G. lamblia trophozoites against the toxicity of , a fatty  which is released from milk triglycerides by lipase. These studies show that mucus protects G. lamblia both by inhibiting lipase activity and by decreasing the toxicity of products of lipolysis. The ability of mucus to protect G. lamblia from toxic lipolytic products may help to promote intestinal  by this parasite.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490675>Hybrid magnetite nanoparticles/Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil nanobiosystem with antibiofilm activity.</a></h2><p>Biofilms formed by fungal organisms are associated with drastically enhanced resistance against most antimicrobial agents, contributing to the persistence of the fungi despite antifungal therapy. The purpose of this study is to combine the unique properties of nanoparticles with the antimicrobial activity of the Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil in order to obtain a nanobiosystem that could be pelliculised on the surface of catheter pieces, in order to obtain an improved resistance to microbial  and biofilm development by Candida albicans and C. tropicalis clinical strains. The R. officinalis essential oils were extracted in a Neo-Clevenger type apparatus, and its chemical composition was settled by GC-MS analysis. Functionalized magnetite nanoparticles of up to 20 nm size had been synthesized by precipitation method adapted for microwave conditions, with  as surfactant. The catheter pieces were coated with suspended core/shell nanoparticles (Fe3O4/:CHCl3), by applying a magnetic field on nanofluid, while the CHCl3 diluted essential oil was applied by adsorption in a secondary covering treatment. The fungal adherence ability was investigated in six multiwell plates, in which there have been placed catheters pieces with and without hybrid nanoparticles/essential oil nanobiosystem pellicle, by using culture-based methods and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The R. officinalis essential oil coated nanoparticles strongly inhibited the adherence ability and biofilm development of the C. albicans and C. tropicalis tested strains to the catheter surface, as shown by viable cell counts and CLSM examination. Due to the important implications of Candida spp. in human pathogenesis, especially in prosthetic devices related infections and the emergence of antifungal tolerance/resistance, using the new core/shell/coated shell based on essential oil of R. officinalis to inhibit the fungal adherence could be of a great interest for the biomedical field, opening new directions for the design of film-coated surfaces with antibiofilm properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8409917>Interaction of Propionibacterium acnes with skin lipids in vitro.</a></h2><p>Propionibacterium acnes is the predominant microbial resident within the pilosebaceous follicles of sebum-rich areas of human skin. This study investigated the effects of known hydrophobic components of sebum on the physiology and nutrition of this microorganism, grown anaerobically at 33 degrees C, under defined conditions using continuous culture techniques. The medium used was chemically defined, comprising eight amino acids, with glucose as the main carbon energy source, and the culture pH was maintained at 5.6. The range of sebum lipids assayed was based on the C18 monounsaturated fatty  9-cis-octadecenoic  (). Stock micronized solutions were aseptically pulsed into continuous cultures in the presence and absence of glucose, and nutritional effects monitored. None of the lipid substrates significantly affected P. acnes growth either in terms of maximum specific growth rate (mu max) or final culture biomass yield. Glycerol (3 mg ml-1) was found to be a poor carbon/energy source in comparison to glucose. Bacterial cells did, however, adhere with varying degrees, to the different lipid species, with maximum adherence occurring with the free fatty . This observation was confirmed by preliminary uptake experiments using [14C]. The interactive site for cell adherence may be the lipid-fibrillar layer associated with the cell surface of P. acnes, as discerned in electron microscopical studies. The findings of this investigation suggest that one function of the P. acnes lipase may be to aid  within the pilosebaceous follicle, by promoting cell adherence to components such as .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17706732>Metabolite profiling of mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula.</a></h2><p>Metabolite profiling of soluble primary and secondary metabolites, as well as cell wall-bound phenolic compounds from roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) was carried out by GC-MS, HPLC and LC-MS. These analyses revealed a number of metabolic characteristics over 56 days of symbiotic interaction with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices, when compared to the controls, i.e. nonmycorrhizal roots supplied with low and high amounts of phosphate. During the most active stages of overall root mycorrhization, elevated levels of certain amino acids (Glu, Asp, Asn) were observed accompanied by increases in amounts of some fatty acids (palmitic and  acids), indicating a mycorrhiza-specific activation of plastidial metabolism. In addition, some accumulating fungus-specific fatty acids (palmitvaccenic and vaccenic acids) were assigned that may be used as markers of fungal root . Stimulation of the biosynthesis of some constitutive isoflavonoids (daidzein, ononin and malonylononin) occurred, however, only at late stages of root mycorrhization. Increase of the levels of saponins correlated AM-independently with plant growth. Only in AM roots was the accumulation of apocarotenoids (cyclohexenone and mycorradicin derivatives) observed. The structures of the unknown cyclohexenone derivatives were identified by spectroscopic methods as glucosides of blumenol C and 13-hydroxyblumenol C and their corresponding malonyl conjugates. During mycorrhization, the levels of typical cell wall-bound phenolics (e.g. 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, ferulic ) did not change; however, high amounts of cell wall-bound tyrosol were exclusively detected in AM roots. Principal component analyses of nonpolar primary and secondary metabolites clearly separated AM roots from those of the controls, which was confirmed by an hierarchical cluster analysis. Circular networks of primary nonpolar metabolites showed stronger and more frequent correlations between metabolites in the mycorrhizal roots. The same trend, but to a lesser extent, was observed in nonmycorrhizal roots supplied with high amounts of phosphate. These results indicate a tighter control of primary metabolism in AM roots compared to control plants. Network correlation analyses revealed distinct clusters of amino acids and sugars/aliphatic acids with strong metabolic correlations among one another in all plants analyzed; however, mycorrhizal symbiosis reduced the cluster separation and enlarged the sugar cluster size. The amino  clusters represent groups of metabolites with strong correlations among one another (cliques) that are differently composed in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots. In conclusion, the present work shows for the first time that there are clear differences in development- and symbiosis-dependent primary and secondary metabolism of M. truncatula roots.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887536>Endotracheal tube biofilm translocation in the lateral Trendelenburg position.</a></h2><p>Laboratory studies demonstrated that the lateral Trendelenburg position (LTP) is superior to the semirecumbent position (SRP) in the prevention of ventilator-associated pulmonary infections. We assessed whether the LTP could also prevent pulmonary  and infections caused by an endotracheal tube (ETT) biofilm.Eighteen pigs were intubated with ETTs colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm. Pigs were positioned in LTP and randomized to be on mechanical ventilatin (MV) up to 24 hour, 48 hour, 48 hour with acute lung injury (ALI) by  and 72 hour. Bacteriologic and microscopy studies confirmed presence of biofilm within the ETT. Upon autopsy, samples from the proximal and distal airways were excised for P.aeruginosa quantification. Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was confirmed by bronchial tissue culture ≥3 log colony forming units per gram (cfu/g). In pulmonary lobes with gross findings of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was confirmed by lung tissue culture ≥3 log cfu/g.P.aeruginosa colonized the internal lumen of 16 out of 18 ETTs (88.89%), and a mature biofilm was consistently present. P.aeruginosa  did not differ among groups, and was found in 23.6% of samples from the proximal airways, and in 7.1% from the distal bronchi (P = 0.001). Animals of the 24 hour group never developed respiratory infections, whereas 20%, 60% and 25% of the animals in group 48 hour, 48 hour-ALI and 72 hour developed P.aeruginosa VAT, respectively (P = 0.327). Nevertheless, VAP never developed.Our findings imply that during the course of invasive MV up to 72 hour, an ETT P.aeruginosa biofilm hastily colonizes the respiratory tract. Yet, the LTP compartmentalizes  and infection within the proximal airways and VAP never develops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7065510>Bacteriologic diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in primates. Usefulness of the protected specimen brush.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the usefulness of a protected specimen brush (PSB) in obtaining uncontaminated lower respiratory tract material for bacteriologic examination in a primate model of -induced acute diffuse lung injury and naturally occurring "nosocomial pneumonia." The bacterial cause of each pneumonia was established by either an immediate postmortem lung aspirate and/or antemortem blood culture. Bacterial pneumonia occurred in 12 of the 15 animals studied. The PSB cultures were sterile in 11 normal, intubated baboons and in 7 animals with non-pneumonic infiltrates by chest radiography. In each of these instances contamination of the specimen by proximal airway flora was avoided with the PSB. Among 10 baboons with bacteriologically documented pneumonias, the PSB cultures correctly identified the causative pathogen in 7 animals despite the presence of diffuse lung infiltrates radiographically, and multiple pathogenic bacteria in proximal airway secretions. Only 1 of 10 (10%) PSB specimens in these animals was contaminated with a possibly unrelated pathogen. The PSB largely avoided contamination of the culture specimen by proximal airway flora, and therefore should be useful in differentiating bacterial  of the airways from pneumonia in the presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769519>Relationships Between  and Linoleic  Content and Seed  by Cercospora kikuchii and Diaporthe phaseolorum.</a></h2><p>Compared with standard cultivars, seed of mid- soybean genotypes sometimes have shown increased  by Cercospora kikuchii in the field as judged by increased levels of purple-stained seed. To examine relationships between  and linoleic  levels in soybean seed and postharvest seed  by two fungal seed pathogens, we inoculated seed with differing :linoleic  (O/L) ratios. Seed with defined O/L ratios were produced by allowing seed development of two isogenic soybean lines to occur in three different air temperature environments. Seed produced in these environments were harvested, individually analyzed for fatty  composition, and inoculated with mycelium preparations of the fungal seed pathogens C. kikuchii or Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae. Fungal biomass of infected seed was quantified by measuring in vitro ergosterol content. For both soybean lines,  by C. kikuchii was positively correlated with the O/L ratio (r = 0.55, P < 0.03) and  content (r = 0.61, P < 0.02), and negatively correlated with linoleic (r = -0.60, P < 0.02) and linolenic (r = -0.58, P < 0.03)  content. No association was found between the extent of seed  by D. phaseolorum and the seed O/L ratio. Our data suggest that the O/L ratio may be related to soybean seed  by C. kikuchii, but there is no evidence of a relationship with D. phaseolorum var. sojae .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27301664>Comprehensive pyrosequencing analysis of the bacterial microbiota of the skin of patients with seborrheic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory dermatologic condition in which erythema and itching develop on areas of the body with sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face and chest. The inflammation is evoked directly by , which is hydrolyzed from sebum by lipases secreted by skin microorganisms. Although the skin fungal genus, Malassezia, is thought to be the causative agent of SD, analysis of the bacterial microbiota of skin samples of patients with SD is necessary to clarify any association with Malassezia because the skin microbiota comprises diverse bacterial and fungal genera. In the present study, bacterial microbiotas were analyzed at non-lesional and lesional sites of 24 patients with SD by pyrosequencing and qPCR. Principal coordinate analysis revealed clear separation between the microbiota of non-lesional and lesional sites. Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Propionibacterium were abundant at both sites. Propionibacterium was abundant at non-lesional sites, whereas Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus predominated at lesional sites; however, the extent of Propionibacterium  did not differ significantly between lesional and non-lesional sites according to qPCR. Given that these abundant bacteria hydrolyze sebum, they may also contribute to SD development. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the bacterial microbiotas of the skin of SD patients.© 2016 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26606689>Linoleic  salt with ultrapure soft water as an antibacterial combination against dermato-pathogenic Staphylococcus spp.</a></h2><p>Skin  of Staphylococcus spp. critically affects the severity of dermatitis in humans and animals. We examined different types of fatty  salts for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus spp. when used in ultrapure soft water (UPSW). We also evaluated their therapeutic effect on a spontaneous canine model of dermatitis.UPSW, in which Ca(++) and Mg(++) were replaced with Na(+) , was generated using a water softener with cation-exchange resin. Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus), Staphylococcus intermedius (Staph. intermedius), and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (Staph. pseudintermedius) were incubated with various fatty  salts in distilled water (DW) or UPSW and the number of bacteria was counted. Among the fatty acids,  salt and linoleic  (LA) salt reduced the number of these bacteria. Also, UPSW enhanced the antibacterial effect of LA on Staph. spp. In spontaneously developed itchy dermatitis in companion dogs, shampoo treatment with liquid soap containing 10% LA in UPSW improved skin conditions.LA salt showed antibacterial activity against Staph. spp. Treatment with soap containing LA with UPSW reduced clinical conditions in dogs with dermatitis.Because  of Staph. spp. on the skin exacerbates dermatitis, the use of LA-containing soap in UPSW may reduce unpleasant clinical symptoms of the skin.© 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15347747>Characterization of the Aspergillus parasiticus delta12-desaturase gene: a role for lipid metabolism in the Aspergillus-seed interaction.</a></h2><p>In the mycotoxigenic oilseed pathogens Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus and the model filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives act as important developmental signals that affect asexual conidiospore, sexual ascospore and/or sclerotial development. To dissect the relationship between lipid metabolism and fungal development, an A. parasiticus Delta(12)-desaturase mutant that was unable to convert  to linoleic  and was thus impaired in polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis was generated. The Delta(12)-desaturase mutant demonstrates delayed spore germination, a twofold reduction in growth, a reduced level of conidiation and complete loss of sclerotial development, compared to the wild-type. Host  is impaired, as reflected by a decrease in conidial production on live peanut and corn seed by the mutant compared to the wild-type. Similarly, the previously isolated A. nidulans Delta(12)-desaturase mutant has reduced  capabilities compared to the wild-type. Therefore, desaturation mutants display a key requisite that affords a genetic solution to oilseed crop contamination by mycotoxigenic Aspergillus species: a reduction in the production of conidia, the infectious particle of the pathogenic aspergilli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22949098>Hybrid nanomaterial for stabilizing the antibiofilm activity of Eugenia carryophyllata essential oil.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that Fe(3)O(4)/ core/shell nanostructures could be used as systems for stabilizing the Eugenia carryophyllata essential oil (EO) on catheter surface pellicles, in order to improve their resistance to fungal . EO microwave assisted extraction was performed in a Neo-Clevenger (related) device and its chemical composition was settled by GC-MS analysis.

However, their consistency in heterogeneous soil and diverse ecological settings is unclear. The current study presents in vitro and field evaluation of pre-characterized PGPR strain Enterobacter sp. Fs-11 (GenBank accession # GQ179978) in terms of its potential to enhance sunflower yield and oil contents under diverse environmental conditions. Under in vitro conditions, strain Fs-11 showed optimal growth at a range of temperature (15 to 40 °C) and pH values (6.5 to 8.5). Extracellular and intracellular localizations of the strain Fs-11 in sunflower root cortical cells through transmission electron microscopy confirmed its epiphytic and endophytic  patterns, respectively. In field experiments, conducted at three different agro-climatic locations, inoculation of strain Fs-11 at 50% reduced NP fertilizer resulted in a significant increase in growth, achene yield, nutrient uptake, and oil contents. Inoculation also responded significantly in terms of increase in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids ( and linoleic acids, respectively) without rising saturated fatty  (palmitic and stearic acids) contents. We concluded that Enterobacter sp.

Serial bacteriologic studies demonstrated  of the oropharynx by pathogenic bacteria within 24 to 48 h of instrumentation, followed by aspiration of colonizing organisms into the tracheobronchial tree. Specimens obtained from the lung periphery remained sterile for at least 24 h longer than the proximal airways. Despite the presence of multiple pathogenic species in oropharyngeal and tracheobronchial secretions, pneumonias were usually due to a single species selected from those colonizing more proximal regions. In an attempt to prevent pneumonias, we added 3 measures to the management of the next 19 animals: meticulous aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, topical instillation of polymyxin B, and prophylactic administration of ampicillin beginning 3 days prior to study. These measures reduced the prevalence of  with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, and only 3 of the 19 animals developed pneumonia. This dramatic reduction of pneumonias is explained in part by prevention of  by highly invasive organisms.

Oxylipin production in this fungus is dependent on developmental regulation of three conserved fatty  oxygenases, PpoA, PpoB and PpoC. Here, we show that in addition to altering spore ratios, loss of ppo genes affect natural product biosynthesis and seed . DeltappoA;DeltappoC and DeltappoA;DeltappoB;DeltappoC mutants were unable to produce the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST) in vitro or in planta but in contrast overproduced the antibiotic penicillin (PN). These findings were correlated with decreased expression of genes involved in ST biosynthesis and increased expression of a PN biosynthetic gene, thus suggesting that oxylipin species regulate secondary metabolites at the transcriptional level. Additionally, the DeltappoA;DeltappoC and the DeltappoA;DeltappoB;DeltappoC mutants were defective in  of peanut seeds as reflected by a decrease in conidiation and production of the seed degradative enzyme lipase.

Treatment with arachidonic  showed a tendency for reduction in . However, treatment with high doses of fatty acids, especially linoleic , increased the numbers of lung metastatic nodules. DHA and EPA only inhibited lung colonizations when administered together with the tumour cells, suggesting that their incorporation is necessary for an influence to be exerted. Chromatography confirmed that contents of fatty acids in both tumour tissues and plasma were indeed affected by the treatments. Tumour cells pretreated with fatty acids in vivo, in particular DHA, also showed a low potential for lung colony formation when transferred to new hosts. Thus, DHA treatment exerted marked antimetastatic activity associated with pronounced change in the fatty  component of tumour cells.

Here, we studied the effect of dietary fat.  resistance was restored within 48 h of return to maintenance diet. Salmonella gut  was also boosted by two oral doses of  or bile salts. These pathogen blooms required Salmonella's AcrAB/TolC-dependent bile resistance. Our data indicate that fat-elicited bile promoted Salmonella gut . Both E. coli and Salmonella show much higher bile resistance than the microbiota. Correspondingly, competitive E. coli can be protective in the fat-challenged gut. Diet shifts and fat-elicited bile promote S. Typhimurium gut infections in mice lacking E. coli in their microbiota. This mouse model may be useful for studying pathogen-microbiota-host interactions, the protective effect of E. coli, to analyse the spread of resistance plasmids and assess the impact of food components on the infection process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23581822>Peroxysomal carnitine acetyl transferase influences host  capacity in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.</a></h2><p>In lower eukaryotes, the glyoxylate cycle allows cells to utilize two-carbon compounds when simple sugars are not available. In filamentous fungi, glyoxylate metabolism is coupled with β-oxidation of fatty acids, and both are localized to ubiquitous eukaryotic organelles called peroxisomes. Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) produced during β-oxidation is transported via the cytosol into mitochondria for further metabolism. A peroxisomal-specific pathway for acetyl-CoA transport requiring peroxisomal carnitine acetyl transferase (CAT) activity has been identified in Magnaporthe grisea peroxisomes. Here, we report that a Sclerotinia sclerotiorum ortholog of the M. grisea peroxisomal CAT-encoding gene Pth2 (herein designated Ss-pth2) is required for virulence-associated host . Null (ss-pth2) mutants, obtained by in vitro transposon mutagenesis, failed to utilize fatty acids, acetate, or glycerol as sole carbon sources for growth. Gene expression analysis of these mutants showed altered levels of transcript accumulation for glyoxylate cycle enzymes. Ss-pth2 disruption also affected sclerotial, apothecial, and appressorial development and morphology, as well as oxalic  accumulation when cultured with acetate or  as sole carbon nutrient sources. Although mutants were able to penetrate and initially colonize host tissue, subsequent  was impaired. Genetic complementation with the wild-type Ss-pth2 restored wild-type virulence phenotypes.

Lipids are abundant in host tissues, and fungal pathogens in the phylum basidiomycota possess both peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways to utilize this potential carbon source. In addition, lipids are important signaling molecules in both fungi and mammals. In this report, we demonstrate that defects in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation pathways influence the growth of C. neoformans on fatty acids as well as the virulence of the fungus in a mouse inhalation model of cryptococcosis. Disease attenuation may be due to the cumulative influence of altered carbon source acquisition or processing, interference with secretion, changes in cell wall integrity, and an observed defect in capsule production for the peroxisomal mutant. Altered capsule elaboration in the context of a β-oxidation defect was unexpected but is particularly important because this trait is a major virulence factor for C. neoformans. Additionally, analysis of mutants in the peroxisomal pathway revealed a growth-promoting activity for C. neoformans, and subsequent work identified  and biotin as candidates for such factors. Overall, this study reveals that β-oxidation influences virulence in C. neoformans by multiple mechanisms that likely include contributions to carbon source acquisition and virulence factor elaboration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453902>Lipid analysis of follicular casts from cyanoacrylate strips as a new method for studying therapeutic effects of antiacne agents.</a></h2><p>The cyanoacrylate follicular biopsy is an established method for the examination of the horny layer and quantitative assessment of microcomedones. We have optimized the method by separating follicular casts mechanically from the cyanoacrylate strips.To use this method to analyse topical therapy-induced changes of the lipid composition in the sebaceous follicular infundibulum.Both the follicular casts and the residual skin surface strip, the last representing a mixture of stratum corneum and surface lipids, were extracted twice with n-hexane-ethanol under ultrasonication, evaporated, redissolved in chloroform-methanol and separated by high-performance thin layer chromatography, using cholesterol sulphate, cerebroside, ceramide types 3 and 4, cholesterol, , triolein, cholesterol oleate and squalene as standards. Identification was performed by computer-assisted densitometric analysis.

The groups treated with topical retinoids showed an additional significant increase in ceramide subfractions, most probably reflecting their influence on epidermal keratinization.Our method proved suitable for the detection of quantitative and qualitative changes in lipid profiles of both infundibulum cast content and surface lipids. It enabled simple, non-invasive and objective assessment of the most relevant lipid classes in the sebaceous infundibulum, and efficient monitoring of drug effects on the follicular infundibulum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15797604>Lipid metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal roots of Medicago truncatula.</a></h2><p>The peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, common to all eukaryotes, is mostly catalyzed by members of the lipoxygenase enzyme family of non-heme iron containing dioxygenases. Lipoxygenase products can be metabolized further in the oxylipin pathway by several groups of CYP74 enzymes. One prominent oxylipin is jasmonic  (JA), a product of the 13-allene oxide synthase branch of the pathway and known as signaling substance that plays a role in vegetative and propagative plant development as well as in plant responses to wounding and pathogen attack. In barley roots, JA level increases upon  by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Apart from this first result regarding JA, no information is available on the relevance of lipidperoxide metabolism in arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Thus we analyzed fatty  and lipidperoxide patterns in roots of Medicago truncatula during mycorrhizal . Levels of fungus-specific fatty acids as well as palmitic  (16:0) and  (18:1 n - 9) were increased in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the degree of arbuscular mycorrhizal  of roots can be estimated via analysis of fungal specific esterified fatty acids. Otherwise, no significant changes were found in the profiles of esterified and free fatty acids. The 9- and 13-LOX products of linoleic and alpha-linolenic  were present in all root samples, but did not show significant differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots, except JA which showed elevated levels in mycorrhizal roots. In both types of roots levels of 13-LOX products were higher than those of 9-LOX products. In addition, three cDNAs encoding CYP74 enzymes, two 9/13-hydroperoxide lyases and a 13-allene oxide synthase, were isolated and characterized. The transcript accumulation of these three genes, however, was not increased in mycorrhizal roots of M. truncatula.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15130141>The effect of lipids on the adherence of axillary aerobic coryneform bacteria.</a></h2><p>A wide range of lipids are present on the skin surface of human beings and bacterial lipases are known to modify them. The microflora of the underarm (axilla) is often dominated by aerobic coryneforms and whilst many require lipids for growth, they appear not to be utilized as carbon sources. The aim of this study was to investigate the adherence aerobic coryneforms to lipids present on the skin surface of the human axilla to determine whether they contribute to  of the skin.Aerobic coryneforms were grown in a defined synthetic medium in the presence of (14)C-glucose to produce radio-labelled cells. Adherence to lipids was tested using a thin layer chromatography plate-based assay.The mechanism of bacterial adhesion to skin lipids is unknown. The results of this study show that a significant proportion of cutaneous aerobic coryneform isolates from the axilla interact with skin lipids resulting in increased adherence, which may contribute to skin .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18227622>Relation between fatty  composition and clinical status or genotype in cystic fibrosis patients.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the relation of clinical parameters and genotype with the serum phospholipid fatty  (FA) composition in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.A blood sample was taken from CF patients with stable pulmonary disease for the determination of phospholipid FA composition and vitamin E concentration who had been followed for at least 6 months at our Cystic Fibrosis Centre. Genotype, age, pancreatic function, nutritional status, caloric intake, pulmonary function and presence of Pseudomonas , liver disease or diabetes mellitus were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups according to their genotype (group A: mutation class I, II, or III, group B: mutation class IV, V).CF patients (group A and B together) have significantly lower docosahexaenoic  (DHA) (p < 0.007) and linoleic  (LA) (p < 0.0001) and higher dihomogammalinolenic  (DHGLA) (p < 0.0001),  (OA) (p < 0.0001) and Mead  (MA) (p < 0.0001), resulting in an increased ratio of arachidonic  (AA)/DHA (p < 0.004), MA/AA (p < 0.0001) and OA/LA (p < 0.0001). Compared to group B, group A had a lower LA (p < 0.002) and a higher DHGLA (p < 0.002), 22:4omega-6 (p < 0.03), 22:5omega-6 (p < 0.03) and 20:3omega-9 (p < 0.04). There was however no significant difference between the groups for age, pulmonary function, nutritional status and vitamin E concentration. There was no relation of serum FA composition with nutritional status, caloric intake, pancreatic function, gender, pulmonary function, Pseudomonas  or diabetes mellitus. In CF with liver disease the DHA was lower than in the patients of the same genotype.FA disturbances are more pronounced in the severe CF genotypes and the presence of CF-related liver disease. Future studies on supplementation should take these parameters into account.(c) 2008 S.

Functionalized magnetite (Fe3O4/C18), with an average size not exceeding 20 nm, has been synthesized by precipitation of ferric and ferrous salts in aqueous solution of  (C18) and NaOH. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and differential thermal analysis coupled with thermo gravimetric analysis were used as characterization methods for the synthesized Fe3O4/C18. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the architecture of the fungal biofilm developed on the functionalized textile dressing samples and culture-based methods for the quantitative assay of the biofilm-embedded yeast cells. The optimized textile dressing samples proved to be more resistant to C. albicans , as compared to the uncoated ones; these functionalized surfaces-based approaches are very useful in the prevention of wound microbial contamination and subsequent biofilm development on viable tissues or implanted devices.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794012> metabolism via a conserved cytochrome P450 system-mediated ω-hydroxylation in the bark beetle-associated fungus Grosmannia clavigera.</a></h2><p>The bark beetle-associated fungus Grosmannia clavigera participates in the large-scale destruction of pine forests. In the tree, it must tolerate saturating levels of toxic conifer defense chemicals (e.g. monoterpenes). The fungus can metabolize some of these compounds through the ß-oxidation pathway and use them as a source of carbon. It also uses carbon from pine triglycerides, where  is the most common fatty . High levels of free fatty acids, however, are toxic and can cause additional stress during host . Fatty acids induce expression of neighboring genes encoding a cytochrome P450 (CYP630B18) and its redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR2). The aim of this work was to study the function of this novel P450 system. Using LC/MS, we biochemically characterized CYP630 as a highly specific  ω-hydroxylase. We explain  specificity using protein interaction modeling. Our results underscore the importance of ω-oxidation when the main ß-oxidation pathway may be overwhelmed by other substrates such as host terpenoid compounds. Because this CYP-CPR gene cluster is evolutionarily conserved, our work has implications for metabolism studies in other fungi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19411623>Distinct roles for VeA and LaeA in development and pathogenesis of Aspergillus flavus.</a></h2><p>Aspergillus flavus, a mycotoxigenic filamentous fungus, colonizes several important agricultural crops, such as maize and peanuts. Two proteins, VeA and LaeA, known to form a nuclear complex in Aspergillus nidulans have been found to positively regulate developmental processes in several Aspergillus species. Here, an examination of near-isogenic A. flavus mutants differing in copy number of veA and laeA alleles (0, 1, or at least 2 each) revealed critical roles for VeA and LaeA in A. flavus development and seed . In contrast to the wild type, both null mutants were unable to metabolize host cell lipid reserves and were inhibited by  in growth assays. The copy number of LaeA but not VeA appeared critical for a density-dependent sclerotial-to-conidial shift, since the multicopy laeA (MClaeA) strain produced relatively constant sclerotial numbers with increasing population size rather than showing the decrease in sclerotia seen in both the wild-type and MCveA strains. The MCveA-laeA strain yielded an intermediate phenotype. This study revealed unique roles of VeA and LaeA in seed pathogenesis and fungal biology, distinct from their cooperative regulatory functions in aflatoxin and sclerotial development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316583>Amelioration of biomass and lipid in marine alga by an endophytic fungus .</a></h2><p>Many studies have been carried out on the growth-modulating efficiency of plants by the  of an endophytic fungus  However, studies involving the co-culture of alga with endophytic fungal strains for enhanced biodiesel production are rare. In this study, the interaction between  and -I, a marine algal strain, was assessed at metabolic level.In association with an endophytic fungus, the algal biomass enhanced from 471.6 to 704 mg/L, and the fatty  methyl ester (FAME) profile of -I increased substantially. In case of FAME profile of co-cultured -I, two essential components of biodiesel, i.e. elaidic  and , increased by 1.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively. To ascertain changes in the metabolic profile of -I by  co-culture, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics study was performed to identify the metabolites involved; and differential nature of the essential metabolites was also confirmed using HPLC and LC-MS. Significant modulation of the bioactive metabolites such as succinate, oxo-propanoate, l-alanine, glutamate, acetate and 1,2 propanediol, hydroxy butane was observed.The metabolites like glutamate and succinate that usually belong to the GABA shunt pathway were observed to be upregulated. The pathway links nitrogen metabolism and carbon metabolism, thus influencing the growth and lipid profile of the algae. These differential metabolites thus indicated the important commensal association between the endophytic fungus and autotrophic marine alga, and established that endophytic fungus can be handy for the sustainability of algal biofuel industries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18227974>Fatty  unsaturation, mobilization, and regulation in the response of plants to stress.</a></h2><p>Stress acclimating plants respond to abiotic and biotic stress by remodeling membrane fluidity and by releasing alpha-linolenic (18:3) from membrane lipids. The modification of membrane fluidity is mediated by changes in unsaturated fatty  levels, a function provided in part by the regulated activity of fatty  desaturases. Adjustment of membrane fluidity maintains an environment suitable for the function of critical integral proteins during stress. alpha-Linolenic , released from membrane lipid by regulated lipase activity, is the precursor molecule for phyto-oxylipin biosynthesis. The modulation of chloroplast  (18:1) levels is central to the normal expression of defense responses to pathogens in Arabidopsis.

We observed that Corynebacterium spp. are overrepresented in children free of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a common pediatric nasal colonizer and an important infectious agent. Corynebacterium accolens, a benign lipid-requiring species, inhibits pneumococcal growth during in vitro cocultivation on medium supplemented with human skin surface triacylglycerols (TAGs) that are likely present in the nostrils. This inhibition depends on LipS1, a TAG lipase necessary for C. accolens growth on TAGs such as triolein. We determined that C. accolens hydrolysis of triolein releases , which inhibits pneumococcus, as do other free fatty acids (FFAs) that might be released by LipS1 from human skin surface TAGs. Our results support a model in which C. accolens hydrolyzes skin surface TAGS in vivo releasing antipneumococcal FFAs. These data indicate that C. accolens may play a beneficial role in sculpting the human microbiome.Little is known about how harmless Corynebacterium species that colonize the human nose and skin might impact pathogen  and proliferation at these sites. We show that Corynebacterium accolens, a common benign nasal bacterium, modifies its local habitat in vitro as it inhibits growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae by releasing antibacterial free fatty acids from host skin surface triacylglycerols. We further identify the primary C. accolens lipase required for this activity. We postulate a model in which higher numbers of C. accolens cells deter/limit S. pneumoniae nostril , which might partly explain why children without S. pneumoniae  have higher levels of nasal Corynebacterium. This work narrows the gap between descriptive studies and the needed in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbe-microbe interactions that help shape the human microbiome. It also lays the foundation for future in vivo studies to determine whether habitat modification by C. accolens could be promoted to control pathogen .Copyright © 2016 Bomar et al.</p></html>
