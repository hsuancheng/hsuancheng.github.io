They received standard chemotherapy ABVD (doxorubicin--25 mg/, bleomycin--10 mg/, vinblastine--6 mg/, dacarbazine--375 mg/, intravenously, on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, every 4 weeks. Patients suffering neutropenia after the first injection of the cytostatic drugs were given dicarbamin 100 mg/day on day 5 before a second administration. Treatment with dicarbamin continued for 15 days. Its protective effect was reported in 27 patients (81.8%). Leukocyte and granulocyte count before dicarbamin was 3.74 +/- 0.25 x 10(9)/l and 1.42 +/- 0.17 x 10(9)/l, respectively. On completion of the polychemotherapeutic cycle, the indices rose to 5.0 +/- 0.28 x 10(9)/13 and 2.49 +/- 0.25 x 10(9)/l, respectively. The beneficial effect of dicarbamin was also demonstrated by a quick recovery of leukocyte levels than in controls (p > 0.5). After the next cycle of polychemotherapy (ABVD) plus dicarbamin was given for Hodgkin's disease and grade III-IV leuko- and granulocytopenia, leukocyte and granulocyte concentrations returned back to normal which indicated the protective action of dicarbamin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19402526>[Comparison of power generation in microbial fuel cells of two different structures].</a></h2><p>Low electricity productivity and high cost are two problems facing the development of microbial fuel cell (MFC). Comparative studies on electricity generation in MFCs of different designs while under the same conditions are important in enhancing the power output. Single-chamber MFC and dual-chamber MFC were constructed and acetate was used as the fuel. Power outputs in these MFC were compared side by side with a resistance of 1,000 Omega connected to each. Experimental results showed that the electricity was generated continuously and steadily in the MFCs. The average maximum output voltages obtained by the single-chamber and dual-chamber MFCs were 600 and 650 mV, respectively. The electric cycles were operated for 110 and 90 h for the single-chamber and dual-chamber MFCs, respectively. From the single-chamber and dual-chamber MFCs, the maximum area power densities were 113.8 and 382.4 mW/ respectively, and the maximum volumetric power densities were 1.3 and 2.2 mW/m3 respectively. The internal resistances of single-chamber and dual-chamber MFC were 188 and 348 Omega, respectively. Results indicated that the dual-chamber MFC had a better performance than the single-chamber MFC. The effective area of anode and the proton exchange membrane had a significant effect on the performance of MFCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29225125>Interdependence of GLO I and PKM2 in the Metabolic shift to escape apoptosis in GLO I-dependent cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Many cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming known as the Warburg effect, which is characterized by a greater dependence on glycolysis for ATP generation, even under normoxic conditions. Glyoxalase I (GLO I) is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the detoxification of cytotoxic methylglyoxal formed in glycolysis and which is known to be highly expressed in many cancer cells. Thus, specific inhibitors of GLO I are expected to be effective anticancer drugs. We previously discovered a novel GLO I inhibitor named TLSC702. Although the strong inhibitory activity of TLSC702 was observed in the in vitro enzyme assay, higher concentrations were required to induce apoptosis at the cellular level. One of the proposed reasons for this difference is that cancer cells alter the energy metabolism leading them to become more dependent on mitochondrial respiration than glycolysis (Metabolic shift) to avoid apoptosis induction. Thus, we assumed that combination of TLSC702 with shikonin-a specific inhibitor of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) that acts as a driver of TCA cycle by supplying pyruvate and which is known to be specifically expressed in cancer cells-would have anticancer effects. We herein show the anticancer effects of combination treatment with TLSC702 and shikonin, and a possible anticancer mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

An alternative to methane production from this organic matter is the direct generation of electricity in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Electricity generation using a single-chambered MFC was examined using acetate or butyrate. Power generated with acetate (800 mg/L) (506 mW/ or 12.7 mW/ L) was up to 66% higher than that fed with butyrate (1000 mg/L) (305 mW/ or 7.6 mW/L), demonstrating that acetate is a preferred aqueous substrate for electricity generation in MFCs. Power output as a function of substrate concentration was well described by saturation kinetics, although maximum power densities varied with the circuit load. Maximum power densities and half-saturation constants were Pmax = 661 mW/ and Ks = 141 mg/L for acetate (218 ohms) and Pmax = 349 mW/ and Ks = 93 mg/L for butyrate (1000 ohms). Similar open circuit potentials were obtained in using acetate (798 mV) or butyrate (795 mV). Current densities measured for stable power outputwere higher for acetate (2.2 A/) than those measured in MFCs using butyrate (0.77 A/). Cyclic voltammograms suggested that the main mechanism of power production in these batch tests was by direct transfer of electrons to the electrode by bacteria growing on the electrode and not by bacteria-produced mediators. Coulombic efficiencies and overall energy recovery were 10-31 and 3-7% for acetate and 8-15 and 2-5% for butyrate, indicating substantial electron and energy losses to processes other than electricity generation. These results demonstrate that electricity generation is possible from soluble fermentation end products such as acetate and butyrate, but energy recoveries should be increased to improve the overall process performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050748>Human Milk Short-Chain  Acid Composition is Associated with Adiposity Outcomes in Infants.</a></h2><p>Presumed benefits of human milk (HM) in avoiding rapid infancy weight gain and later obesity could relate to its nutrient composition. However, data on breast milk composition and its relation with growth are sparse.We investigated whether short-chain   (SCFAs), known to be present in HM and linked to energy metabolism, are associated with infancy anthropometrics.In a prospective birth cohort, HM hindmilk samples were collected from 619 lactating mothers at 4-8 wk postnatally [median (IQR) age: 33.9 (31.3-36.5) y, body mass index (BMI) (kg/): 22.8 (20.9-25.2)]. Their offspring, born at 40.1 (39.1-41.0) wk gestation with weight 3.56 (3.22-3.87) kg and 51% male, were assessed with measurement of weight, length, and skinfold thickness at ages 3, 12, and 24 mo, and transformed to age- and sex-adjusted z scores. HM SCFAs were measured by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and GC-MS. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted to analyze the relations between NMR HM SCFAs and infancy growth parameters with adjustment for potential confounders.NMR peaks for HM butyrate, acetate, and formic acid, but not propionate, were detected. Butyrate peaks were 17.8% higher in HM from exclusively breastfeeding mothers than mixed-feeding mothers (P = 0.003). HM butyrate peak values were negatively associated with changes in infant weight (standardized B  = -0.10, P = 0.019) and BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) between 3 and 12 mo, and negatively associated with BMI (B = -0.10, P = 0.018) and mean skinfold thickness (B = -0.10, P = 0.049) at age 12 mo. HM formic acid peak values showed a consistent negative association with infant BMI at all time points (B < = -0.10, P < = 0.014), whereas HM acetate was negatively associated with skinfold thickness at 3 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.028) and 24 mo (B = -0.10, P = 0.036).These results suggest that HM SCFAs play a beneficial role in weight gain and adiposity during infancy. Further knowledge of HM  function may inform future strategies to support healthy growth.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1943747>Inhibition by etomoxir of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I reduces hepatic glucose production and plasma lipids in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>To determine the therapeutic effect of the carinitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) inhibitor, etomoxir, eight hospitalized obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients were studied (body mass index [BMI], 28.7 +/- 1.3 kg/; age, 54 +/- 8 years [means +/- SE]) at baseline (placebo = t1), and after oral etomoxir (50 mg/d = t2, 100 mg = 3, 150 mg = t4, 200 mg = t5, placebo = t6).

We tested formalin, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), chloramine-T, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Per Aqua or Desirox alone or in combinations of 2 chemicals, one of which was always formalin, in 50  concrete tanks at 2 farms producing salmon Salmo salar smolt in 2001 and 2002. Both Per Aqua and Desirox are combinations of peracetic acid, acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The alternative chemicals or their combinations can be used successfully to lower the parasite burden to such a level that no high mortality occurs during the first 4 wk after the start of an infection. This period of time allows the fish to develop immunity against these ciliates, and treatments can be reduced and stopped in due course. I. multifiliis decreased in number 3 to 4 wk after the beginning of the infection in all the treatments. Large differences in parasite burden and mortality occurred among the replicates in all except the Desirox-formalin tanks, which means that they are not as reliable as the malachite green-formalin used previously. It was also evident that the chemicals and their concentrations must be planned carefully to suit the conditions on each farm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805626>Effects of cereal grain source and supplemental xylanase concentrations on broiler growth performance and cecal   acid concentrations from 1 to 40 d of age2.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of feeding diets varying in cereal grain source and supplemental xylanase concentrations on growth performance and cecal   acid (VFA) concentrations of Ross × Ross 708 male broilers from 1 to 40 d of age. A total of 1,536 day-old chicks were randomly distributed into 64 floor pens (24 chicks/pen; 0.08 /bird) and fed 1 of 8 dietary treatments (TRT) with 8 replicates per TRT. Experimental TRT were of either corn- (TRT 1 to 4) or wheat-based (TRT 5 to 8) origins. The 4 dietary TRT for each cereal grain source consisted of a positive control (PC) reference diet and 3 reduced AMEn diets (AMEn reduced 66 kcal/kg below PC) with supplemental xylanase at either 0 (negative control), 12,000, or 24,000 BXU/kg. Birds and feed were weighed at 1, 14, 26, and 40 d of age to determine BW gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio. At 26 and 40 d of age, cecal contents were collected and pooled per pen (7 birds/pen; 5 replicate pens/TRT) for VFA concentrations. No TRT differences (P > 0.05) in cumulative growth performance were observed. Likewise, no TRT differences (P > 0.05) in acetic or total VFA concentrations were observed at 26 or 40 d of age. However, cereal grain source (P < 0.05) influenced propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric concentrations at 26 and 40 d of age with birds receiving the corn-based diets having higher (P < 0.05) cecal propionic, isobutyric, and isovaleric concentrations, and lower (P < 0.05) butyric acid concentrations than those fed the wheat-based diets. These results indicate that dietary cereal grain source may influence individual cecal VFA concentrations. However, supplemental xylanase did not affect broiler growth performance or cecal VFA concentrations. Therefore, future research evaluating factors limiting xylanase responses on broiler growth performance and cecal VFA production is warranted.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28370635>Precision Aliphatic Polyesters with Alternating Microstructures via Cross-Metathesis Polymerization: An Event of Sequence Control.</a></h2><p>Sequence-regulated polymerization is realized upon sequential cross-metathesis polymerization (CMP) and exhaustive hydrogenation to afford precision aliphatic polyesters with alternating sequences. This strategy is particularly suitable for the arrangement of well-known monomer units including glycolic acid, lactic acid, and caprolactic acid on polymer chain in a predetermined sequence. First of all, structurally asymmetric monomers bearing acrylate and α-olefin terminuses are generated in an efficient and straightforward fashion. Subsequently, cross-metathesis (co)polymerization of M1 and  using the Hoveyda-Grubbs second-generation catalyst (HG-II) furnishes P1-P3, respectively. Finally, hydrogenation yields the desired saturated polyesters HP1-HP3. It is noteworthy that the ε-caprolactone-derived unit is generated in situ rather than introduced to tailor-made monomers prior to CMP. NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) results verify the microstructural periodicity of these precision polyesters. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results reflect that polyesters without methyl side groups exhibit crystallinity, and unsaturated polyester samples show higher glass transition temperatures than their hydrogenated counterparts owing to structural rigidity.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A study was undertaken to determine the effect of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction and salbutamol-induced bronchodilatation on the cough threshold in response to inhaled acetic acid, and to examine the relationship between the acetic acid cough threshold and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine in children with asthma.Nineteen children with asthma (16 boys) of mean (SE) age 10.6 (0.6) years were enrolled in the study. On day 1 each underwent a histamine inhalation challenge to determine the provocative concentration causing a fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of more than 20% (PC20) as an index of individual bronchial hyperresponsiveness. On day 2 the acetic acid cough threshold was determined before and just after the inhalation of the PC20 concentration of histamine, and then salbutamol (1 mg/) was inhaled to relieve the bronchoconstriction. Ten of the 19 patients (eight boys) of mean age 12.2 (0.7) years also tried acetic acid inhalation challenge just after salbutamol inhalation.There was no relationship between the bronchial responsiveness to histamine and acetic acid cough threshold in these patients. The acetic acid cough threshold after histamine inhalation was similar to that before histamine, although FEV1 decreased after histamine. In the 10 patients who also tried acetic acid inhalation challenge after salbutamol the cough threshold did not change.These findings suggest that acid-induced cough sensitivity and bronchomotor tone are independently regulated in children with asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17328216>Power generation using different cation, anion, and ultrafiltration membranes in microbial fuel cells.</a></h2><p>Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are often used in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to separate the liquid in the anode and cathode chambers while allowing protons to pass between the chambers. However, negatively or positively charged species present at high concentrations in the medium can also be used to maintain charge balance during power generation. An anion exchange membrane (AEM) produced the largest power density (up to 610 mW/) and Coulombic efficiency (72%) in MFCs relative to values achieved with a commonly used PEM (Nafion), a cation exchange membrane (CEM), or three different ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with molecular weight cut offs of 0.5K, 1K, and 3K Daltons in different types of MFCs. The increased performance of the AEM was due to proton charge-transfer facilitated by phosphate anions and low internal resistance. The type of membrane affected maximum power densities in two-chamber, air-cathode cube MFCs (C-MFCs) with low internal resistance (84-91 omega for all membranes except UF-0.5K) but not in two-chamber aqueous-cathode bottle MFCs (B-MFCs) due to their higher internal resistances (1230-1272 omega except UF-0.5K). The UF-0.5K membrane produced very high internal resistances (6009 omega, B-MFC; 1814omega, C-MFC) and was the least permeable to both oxygen (mass transfer coefficient of k(O) = 0.19 x 10(-4) cm/s) and acetate (k(A) = 0.89 x 10(-8) cm/s). Nafion was the most permeable membrane to oxygen (k(O) = 1.3 x 10(-4) cm/s), and the UF-3K membrane was the most permeable to acetate (k(A) = 7.2 x 10(-8) cm/s). Only a small percent of substrate was unaccounted for based on measured Coulombic efficiencies and estimates of biomass production and substrate losses using Nafion, CEM, and AEM membranes (4-8%), while a substantial portion of substrate was lost to unidentified processes for the UF membranes (40-89%). These results show that many types of membranes can be used in two-chambered MFCs, even membranes that transfer negatively charged species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1397716>Metabolic effects of suppression of nonesterified  acid levels with acipimox in obese NIDDM subjects.</a></h2><p>NEFAs characteristically are elevated in obese NIDDM patients in both the basal state and after insulin. This elevation might aggravate glycemic control both by decreasing peripheral glucose disposal (glucose- acid cycle), and by increasing HGO. Thus, lowering plasma NEFA levels might improve carbohydrate metabolism. We therefore measured HGO and fuel use (by indirect calorimetry) both in the basal state and during the last 30 min of a hyperinsulinemic clamp (0.025U.kg-1.h-1) in 8 obese NIDDM patients (BMI 34.8 +/- 1.0 kg/) after complete overnight suppression of plasma NEFA levels with acipimox, a new nicotinic acid analogue.

The aim of utilizing a core-shell fibrous scaffold with PCL as core and chitosan as shell was to combine natural biocompatibility, biodegradability and antibacterial properties of chitosan with mechanical properties and resistance to enzymatic degradation of PCL. The scaffolds were prepared with the optimized parameters, obtained from our previous study. Thickness and contact angle measurements as well as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses confirmed repeated fabrication of PCL-chitosan core-shell scaffolds. In this study, assays specific to wound dressing materials, such as water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), in vitro degradability and antibacterial tests were carried out. WVTR value of PCL-chitosan core-shell scaffolds was higher (2315 ± 3.4 g/ · day) compared to single PCL scaffolds (1654 ± 3.2 g/ · day) due to the higher inter-fiber pore size. Additionally, in vitro degradability assays showed that the susceptibility of chitosan to enzymatic degradation can be significantly improved by hybridization with more resistant PCL while still keeping the scaffold to be considered as biodegradable. Finally, inhibition ratio and inhibition zone measurements showed that the PCL-chitosan core-shell polymeric scaffolds had significant antibacterial performance (52.860 ± 2.298% and 49.333 ± 0.719% inhibition ratios; 13.975 ± 0.124 mm and 12.117 ± 0.133 mm clear inhibition zones, against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively), close to the native chitosan.

Although fibric acid derivatives increase serum HDL-C levels and decrease triglyceride levels, their effects on renal function are largely unknown. We conducted this study to determine whether gemfibrozil reduced rates of renal function loss in people with moderate CRI.This was a post hoc subgroup analysis in the Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial, a randomized double-blind trial of gemfibrozil versus placebo in 2,531 men with coronary disease, HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or less (< or =1.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 140 mg/dL or less (< or =3.6 mmol/L), and a range of triglyceride values. Moderate CRI is defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to 59.9 mL/min/1.73  at baseline. Multivariate regression was used to calculate rates of decline in estimated GFR for individuals administered gemfibrozil or placebo, controlling for prospectively determined potential confounders.Change in renal function could be calculated in 1,981 individuals, of whom 399 individuals (20.2%) were eligible for inclusion. Among 399 study subjects, the rate of change in renal function in the gemfibrozil group during a median of 61 months was not significantly different from that in the placebo group (0.49 mL/min/1.73 /y faster; 95% confidence interval, 0.09 slower to 1.09 faster; P = 0.10). No clinically relevant effect of gemfibrozil on renal function was observed in groups defined by baseline lipid levels, kidney function, diabetic status, or other components of the metabolic syndrome. The incidence of transient (10% versus 4%; P = 0.01), but not sustained (9% versus 4%; P = 0.07), increases in serum creatinine levels of 0.5 mg/dL or greater (> or =44 micromol/L) was significantly greater in the gemfibrozil group. However, in 5 subjects with acute increases in serum creatinine levels, serum creatine kinase levels were significantly elevated as well, suggesting that myocyte toxicity may have been responsible.

An acute-response study was also conducted.The drug was well tolerated by all participants; however, heart rate was elevated (9 +/- 2 beats per minute) with the 0.5-mg BID dose. After 28 d of treatment and when compared with placebo, there was no change in 24-h RQ with either 0.1-mg BID (P = 0.1) or 0.5-mg BID (P = 1.0) doses of TAK-677. However, TAK, 0.5 mg BID, resulted in a small increase in 24-h EE that was significantly different from placebo [change from baseline, 13 +/- 17 (0.5 mg BID) vs.-39 +/- 18 (placebo) kcal/d, P < 0.05]. Changes in weight, fat-free mass, and abdominal fat depots (visceral or sc) were not different between the three groups, nor were changes in fasting insulin, free  acid, or glucose concentrations.TAK-677 has no effect on 24-h RQ or fat oxidation but does slightly increase 24-h EE at the highest dose (0.5 mg BID). The acute studies showed large interindividual variability in plasma concentrations of TAK-677 indicating some possible problems with bioavailability and therefore efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12083341>Ganglioside alterations in the central nervous system of rats chronically injected with methylmalonic and propionic .</a></h2><p>Neurological dysfunction and structural cerebral abnormalities are commonly found in patients with methylmalonic and propionic acidemia. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuropathology of these disorders are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that methylmalonic and propionic  induce a significant reduction of ganglioside N-acetylneuraminic acid in the brain of rats subjected to chronic administration of these metabolites. In the present study, we investigated the in vivo effects of chronic administration of methylmalonic (MMA) and propionic (PA)  (from the 6th to the 28th day of life) on the distribution and composition of gangliosides in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex of rats. Control rats were treated with the same volumes of saline. It was first verified that MMA and PA treatment did not modify body, cerebellum, or cortical weight, nor the ganglioside concentration in the cerebral cortex of the animals. In contrast, a significant reduction in total ganglioside content in the cerebellum of approximately 20-30% and 50% of control levels occurred in rats injected with MMA and PA, respectively. Moreover, chronic MMA and PA administration did not interfere with the ganglioside pattern in the cerebral cortex, whereas the distribution of individual gangliosides was altered in the cerebellum of MMA- and PA-treated animals. Rats injected with MMA demonstrated a marked decrease in GM1 and GD3, whereas chronic PA treatment provoked a significant reduction of all ganglioside species, with the exception of an increase in GM2. Since gangliosides are closely related to the dendritic surface and other neural membranes, indirectly reflecting synaptogenesis, these ganglioside abnormalities may be associated with the brain damage found in methylmalonic and propionic acidemias.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17513804>Phase I trial of histone deacetylase inhibition by valproic acid followed by the topoisomerase II inhibitor epirubicin in advanced solid tumors: a clinical and translational study.</a></h2><p>To determine the safety, toxicity, and maximum-tolerated dose of a sequence-specific combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), valproic acid (VPA), and epirubicin in solid tumor malignancies and to define the clinical feasibility of VPA as an HDACi.Patients were treated with increasing doses of VPA (days 1 through 3) followed by epirubicin (day 3) in 3-week cycles. The study evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic end points, toxicities, and tumor response.Forty-eight patients were enrolled, and 44 received at least one cycle of therapy. Patients (median age, 54 years; range, 39 to 78 years) received the following doses of VPA: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 100, 120, 140, and 160 mg/kg/d. Dose-limiting toxicities were somnolence (n = 1), confusion (n = 3), and febrile neutropenia (n = 1). No exacerbation of epirubicin-related toxicities was observed. Partial responses were seen across different tumor types in nine patients (22%), and stable disease/minor responses were seen in 16 patients (39%), despite a median number of three prior regimens (range, zero to 10 prior regimens). Patients received a median number of four treatment cycles (range, one to 10 cycles), and treatment was stopped after reaching maximal epirubicin doses rather than progression in 13 (32%) of 41 patients patients. Total and free VPA plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose and correlated with histone acetylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose was VPA 140 mg/kg/d for 48 hours followed by epirubicin 100 mg/. Sustained plasma concentrations of VPA exceeding those required for in vitro synergy were achieved with acceptable toxicity. Noteworthy antitumor activity was observed in heavily pretreated patients and historically anthracycline-resistant tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10654588>Safety evaluation of phytosterol esters. Part 5. Faecal short-chain  acid and microflora content, faecal bacterial enzyme activity and serum female sex hormones in healthy normolipidaemic volunteers consuming a controlled diet either with or without a phytosterol ester-enriched margarine.</a></h2><p>A study was conducted in 12 healthy males and 12 healthy females (mean age 36 years, mean body mass index 24 kg/), to determine the effect of a margarine enriched with phytosterol esters on faecal short-chain   (SCFAs) and faecal bacterial enzyme activities, viable faecal microflora count, female sex hormones and serum cholesterol concentrations. The study design was a two-period, parallel dosing, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary study. Under controlled dietary conditions, participants consumed 40 g of the control margarine for 21 and 28 consecutive days for males and females, respectively. This was followed immediately by the second part of the study where subjects were equally and randomly allocated to consume daily 40 g of either the control or the test margarine, containing 8.6 g vegetable oil phytosterols (a mixture of beta-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol), also for 21 or 28 days. All females were shown to have a regular menstrual cycle and were on an established method of contraception not involving oral contraceptives. When compared with the control group values, the test group showed a significant reduction in serum total and LDL cholesterol concentrations of 18 and 23% (P < 0.001; P < 0.001) respectively, in faecal lactic acid concentration (P = 0.039) and in serum progesterone levels (P = 0.021). There were no other significant treatment effects. Within each group a number of significant changes occurred compared to baseline. In the test group, faecal lactic acid concentration and the ratio of acetic acid:total ; and the ratio of butyric acid:total , in the control group were both significantly reduced (P = 0.016). Compared to baseline, azo-reductase activity was significantly reduced in the control group (P = 0.047). Total faecal aerobes (P = 0.028), lactobacilli (P = 0.003) and staphylococci (P = 0.025) content was also significantly reduced in the control group, while in the test group only lactobacilli content was reduced (P = 0.019). Of the significant findings reported in this study, none was considered to be of biological importance except the beneficial reduction in serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. The daily consumption of a margarine enriched with 8.6 g vegetable oil phytosterols did not affect the bacterial profile or the metabolic activities of the gut microflora, nor did it result in biologically relevant effects on serum female sex hormone levels. The margarine enriched with the vegetable oil phytosterols was well tolerated by both male and female volunteers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661551>Strain-dependent modulation of macrophage polarization within scaffolds.</a></h2><p>Implanted synthetic substrates for the regeneration of cardiovascular tissues are exposed to mechanical forces that induce local deformation. Circulating inflammatory cells, actively participating in the healing process, will be subjected to strain once recruited. We investigated the effect of deformation on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) adherent onto a scaffold, with respect to macrophage polarization towards an inflammatory (M1) and reparative () phenotype and to early tissue formation. HPBMCs were seeded onto poly-ε-caprolactone bisurea strips and subjected to 0%, 7% and 12% cyclic strain for up to one week. After 1 day, cells subjected to 7% deformation showed upregulated expression of pro and anti-inflammatory chemokines, such as MCP-1 and IL10. Immunostaining revealed presence of inflammatory macrophages in all groups, while immunoregulatory macrophages were detected mainly in the 0 and 7% groups and increased significantly over time. Biochemical assays indicated deposition of sulphated glycosaminoglycans and collagen after 7 days in both strained and unstrained samples. These results suggest that 7% cyclic strain applied to hPBMCs adherent on a scaffold modulates their polarization towards reparative macrophages and allows for early synthesis of extracellular matrix components, required to promote further cell adhesion and proliferation and to bind immunoregulatory cytokines.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to evaluate the effects of reprocessing on beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) kinetics and complement activation in chronic hemodialysis patients, we compared 4 dialyzer membranes on 1st, 2nd and 4th use of the membrane. Dialysis with new cuprammonium rayon dialyzers (0.8 ) for 4 h resulted in a nonsignificant increase in serum beta 2M concentrations of 10.7% (corrected for changes in extracellular volume) and significant generation of the complement component C3a des Arg. On reuse, minimal changes in serum beta 2M levels were noted and complement activation was absent. Dialysis with new cellulose acetate (CA, 1.5 ), polyacrylonitrile (AN69 HF, 1.6 ) or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, 1.6 ) membranes resulted in significant decreases in serum beta 2M levels (19.5, 31.7 and 50.8%, respectively). Reprocessing had negligible effects on the removal of beta 2M by CA and AN69, but by the 4th use halved the effectiveness of PMMA. Reprocessing reduced the significant generation of C3a des Arg observed with new CA and PMMA membranes. We conclude that, except for PMMA, Renalin reprocessing has minor effects on the ability of the membranes to remove beta 2M and improves the biocompatibility of all membranes studied.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843174>Continuation of growth hormone (GH) therapy in GH-deficient patients during transition from childhood to adulthood: impact on insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism.</a></h2><p>The appropriate management of GH-deficient patients during transition from childhood to adulthood has not been reported in controlled trials, even though there is evidence to suggest that this phase is associated with specific problems in relation to GH sensitivity. An issue of particular interest is the impact of GH substitution on insulin sensitivity, which normally declines during puberty. We, therefore, evaluated insulin sensitivity (euglycemic glucose clamp) and substrate metabolism in 18 GH-deficient patients (6 females and 12 males; age, 20 +/- 1 yr; body mass index, 25 +/- 1 kg/) in a placebo-controlled, parallel study. Measurements were made at baseline, where all patients were on their regular GH replacement, after 12 months of either continued GH (0.018 +/- 0.001 mg/kg day) or placebo, and finally after 12 months of open phase GH therapy (0.016 mg/kg x day). Before study entry GH deficiency was reconfirmed by a stimulation test. During the double-blind phase, insulin sensitivity and fat mass tended to increase in the placebo group [deltaM-value (mg/kg x min), -0.7 +/- 1.1 (GH) vs. 1.3 +/- 0.8 (placebo), P = 0.18; deltaTBF (kg), 0.9 +/- 1.2 (GH) vs. 4.4 +/- 1.6 (placebo), P = 0.1]. Rates of lipid oxidation decreased [delta lipid oxidation (mg/kg x min), 0.02 +/- 0.14 (GH) vs. -0.32 +/- 0.13 (placebo), P < 0.05], whereas glucose oxidation increased in the placebo-treated group (P < 0.05). In the open phase, a decrease in insulin sensitivity was found in the former placebo group, although they lost body fat and increased fat-free mass [M-value (mg/kg x min), 5.1 +/- 0.7 (placebo) vs. 3.4 +/- 1.0 (open), P = 0.09]. In the group randomized to continued GH treatment almost all hormonal and metabolic parameters remained unchanged during the study. In conclusion, 1) discontinuation of GH therapy for 1 yr in adolescent patients induces fat accumulation without compromising insulin sensitivity; and 2) the beneficial effects of continued GH treatment on body composition in terms of decrease in fat mass and increase in fat-free mass does not fully balance the direct insulin antagonistic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8621010>The hemodynamic abnormalities in short-term insulin deficiency: the role of prostaglandin inhibition.</a></h2><p>It has been suggested that the hemodynamic derangements present in diabetic ketoacidosis are the results not only of profound volume depletion but also of the effects of increased production of vasodilating prostaglandins (PGs), principally PGI2, released by adipose tissue. In animal and in vitro models, prostaglandin synthesis is increased during insulin deficiency. We assessed the effects of short-term ketosis on the metabolic and hemodynamic variables of 10 IDDM patients free from long-term complications and of 9 normal control subjects after a 7-day randomized double-blind indomethacin (INDO) (50 mg q.i.d.) or placebo treatment period. Calf blood flow (CBF), postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH), and recovery half-time (an index of overall perfusion) after PORH were measured by plethysmography. Left ventricular and myocardial functions were also studied in each different condition during placebo and INDO treatment in IDDM patients. During placebo treatment, the increase in CBF during ketosis was higher (1.75 +/- 0.29 ml / min / 100 ml muscle) than during INDO (0.85 +/- 0.17 ml / min) / 100 ml muscle; P = 0.007). PORH was similar in baseline conditions, during ketosis, and in recovery in both the placebo and INDO arms. Recovery half-time significantly increased during placebo (10 +/- 2; 200%; P < 0.01) but not during INDO (1 +/- 1; 106%; NS) treatment. In normal control subjects, insulin deficiency did not induce any significant effect on hemodynamic variables. In IDDM patients, during placebo treatment, ketosis increased both the cardiac index (from 3.4 +/- 0.7 to 4.1 +/- 0.81 / min / m; P < 0.01) and the stroke index (from 42 +/- 8 to 49 +/- 7 ml/; P < 0.01) without changes in left ventricular ejection fraction but with a significant increase in both left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes. Metabolic recovery induced a normalization of these parameters. INDO treatment significantly blunted these alterations. In summary, we showed that during acute insulin deficiency, INDO-sensitive mechanisms mediate vascular disturbances. Moreover, INDO treatment was capable of completely preventing the cardiac venous return and the left ventricular alterations. INDO does not interfere with the overall ketogenetic process or with insulin-induced metabolic recovery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19356059>In vitro metabolism of leflunomide by mouse and human liver microsomes.</a></h2><p>Leflunomide was found to be metabolized predominantly to A77-1726 and two novel hydroxylated metabolites, M1 and , in microsomes while A77-1726 was only biotransformed to M1.

Eight men (32.4 +/- 1.9 yr; body mass index, 23.9 +/- 0.7 kg/) and eight women (27.9 +/- 0.9 yr; body mass index, 20.9 +/- 0.6 kg/) underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 1 g/kg) before and after HDBR. The glucose load was labeled with 13C and associated with D-[6,6-2H2] glucose infusion, indirect calorimetry, breath tests, and plasma measurements to determine the glucose turnover and biodisponibility, substrate oxidation, and endocrine responses. Body composition was assessed using H2(18)O dilution. In addition, hormones were measured in daily blood and 24-h urine samples. No change in body composition was noted. Daily fasting insulin increased during HDBR (men, 34%; women, 26%), as did the insulin to glucose ratio (men, 30%; women, 25%). The normetanephrine level dropped (men, 30%; women, 16%), but metanephrine was unchanged. During OGTTs, the insulin response was increased after HDBR (men, 47%; women, 67%), whereas plasma glucose levels were similar. Nonesterified   and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were lower. Endogenous glucose production dropped (28%), and exogenous glucose oxidation increased (28%) only in men. Resting energy expenditure was unchanged, but nonproteic respiratory quotient increased (men, 10%; women, 14%). Basal levels of lipid oxidation dropped in both sexes (approximately 90%), but those of carbohydrate oxidation increased in men (40%); as did lipogenesis in women (570%). In response to OGTTs, lipid oxidation was 80% reduced in both sexes after HDBR, but carbohydrate oxidation increased (25%) in men. Lipogenesis occurred in men (304%) and women (74%), but the latter had higher absolute levels. Therefore, 7 days of HDBR resulted in 1) reduced sympathetic activity, 2) insulin resistance suggested at the muscle level in men and at both the muscle and liver levels in women, 3) no changes in glucose biodisponibility, suggesting no alterations in the gastrointestinal function, and 4) a shift toward carbohydrate oxidation in men and a net lipogenesis in women. Such results suggest gender differences in response to sedentary life style and warrant further analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19534134>Sampling natural biofilms: a new route to build efficient microbial anodes.</a></h2><p>Electrochemically active biofilms were constructed on graphite anodes under constant polarization at -0.1V vs saturated calomel reference (SCE) with 10 mM acetate as substrate. The reactors were inoculated with three different microbial samples that were drawn from exactly the same place in a French Atlantic coastal port (i) by scraping the biofilm that had formed naturally on the surface of a floating bridge, (ii) by taking marine sediments just under the floating bridge, and (iii) by taking nearby beach sand. Current densities of 2.0 A/ were reached using the biofilm sample as inoculum while only 0.4 A/ and 0.8 A/ were obtained using the underlying sediments and the beach sand, respectively. The structure of bacterial communities forming biofilms was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, and revealed differences between samples with the increase in relative intensities of some bands and the appearance of others. Bacteria close related to Bacteroidetes, Halomonas, and Marinobacterium were retrieved only from the efficient EA-biofilms formed from natural biofilms, whereas, bacteria close related to Mesoflavibacter were predominant on biofilm formed from sediments. The marine biofilm was selected as the inoculum to further optimize the microbial anode. Epifluorescence microscopy and SEM confirmed that maintaining the electrode under constant polarization promoted rapid settlement of the electrode surface by a bacterial monolayer film. The microbial anode was progressively adapted to the consumption of acetate by three serial additions of substrate, thus improving the Coulombic efficiency of acetate consumption from 31 to 89%. The possible oxidation of sulfide played only a very small part in the current production and the biofilm was not able to oxidize hydrogen. Graphite proved to be more efficient than dimensionally stable anode (DSA) or stainless steel butthis result might be due to differences in the surface roughness rather than the intrinsic features of the materials. Finally, a maximal current density of 7.9 A/ was reached with 10 mM acetate after only 8 days of biofilm formation at -0.1 V/SCE. These results are among the best performance values reported in the literature. Using natural biofilms as inoculum should, consequently, be a new, very promising wayto rapidly build more efficient microbial electrodes than those produced when the inoculum is drawn from bulk environments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17168689>In vitro and in vivo metabolism of a gamma-secretase inhibitor BMS-299897 and generation of active metabolites in milligram quantities with a microbial bioreactor.</a></h2><p>BMS-299897 is a gamma-secretase inhibitor that has the potential for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The metabolism of [(14)C]BMS-299897 was investigated in human liver microsomes, in rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes and in bile duct cannulated rats. Seven metabolites (M1-M7) were identified from in vitro and in vivo studies. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that M1 and  were regioisomeric acylglucuronide conjugates of BMS-299897. Metabolites M3, M4 and M6 were identified as monohydroxylated metabolites of BMS-299897 and M5 was identified as the dehydrogenated product of monooxygenated BMS-299897. In vivo, 52% of the radioactive dose was excreted in bile within 0-6 h from bile duct cannulated rats following a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg of [(14)C]BMS-299897. Glucuronide conjugates, M1 and  accounted for 80% of the total radioactivity in rat bile. In addition to M1 and , M7 was observed in rat bile which was identified as a glucuronide conjugate of an oxidative metabolite M5. For structure elucidation and pharmacological activity testing of the metabolites, ten microbial cultures were screened for their ability to metabolize BMS-299897 to form these metabolites. Among them, the fungus Cunninghamella elegans produced two major oxidative metabolites M3 and M4 that had the same HPLC retention time and mass spectral properties as those found in in vitro incubations. NMR analysis indicated that M3 and M4 were stereoisomers, with the hydroxyl group on the benzylic position. However, M3 and M4 were unstable and converted to their corresponding lactones readily. Based on x-ray analysis of the synthetically prepared lactone of M3, the stereochemistry of benzylic hydroxyl group was assigned as the R configuration. Both the hydroxy metabolites (M3 and M4) and the lactone of M3 showed gamma-secretase inhibition with IC(50) values similar to that of the parent compound. This study demonstrates the usefulness of microbial systems as bioreactors to generate metabolites of BMS-299897 in large quantities for structure elucidation and activity testing. This study also demonstrates the biotransformation profile of BMS-299897 is qualitatively similar across the species including rat, dog, monkey and human which provides a basis to support rat, dog and monkey as preclinical models for toxicological testing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28578227>Evaluating the feasibility of fermentation starter inoculated with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens for improving acetoin and tetramethylpyrazine in Baoning bran vinegar.</a></h2><p>Fermentation starters (Daqu) used in present study included traditional herb Daqu (C Daqu), modified Daqu without herbs (M Daqu) and S Daqu fermented by inoculating acetoin and tetramethylpyrazine high-producing bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens into M Daqu. To evaluate the feasibility of S Daqu combined with M Daqu applied for improving contents of acetoin and tetramethylpyrazine in Baoning bran vinegar without remarkably changing the original microbial community and the other volatiles contents compared with C Daqu, vinegar Pei C, M, M1,  and S were correspondingly prepared in lab scale using C Daqu, M Daqu, M1 Daqu (S Daqu: M Daqu=1:9, w/w),  Daqu (S Daqu: M Daqu=5:5) and S Daqu. PCR-DGGE suggested that Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Oceanobacillus, Acetobacter, Pichia, Geotrichum and Trichoderma were dominant microbes. Microbial community of M were similar with M1, while that of the others were similar. Differences in physicochemical properties among samples may be ascribed to different enzymes activities of Daqu and bioactivities of microbial metabolism during fermentation. Moreover, total contents of organic  in M, M1,  and S increased by 33.10%, 25.77%, 4.32% and 7.74% relative to C, respectively. Volatiles and PLS-DA analysis suggested that  profiles of M were similar with M1, that of  were similar with C, while that of S were significantly different with the others. Both  Daqu and S Daqu facilitated the formation of acetoin and tetramethylpyrazine. However,  Daqu was more efficient for enhancing acetoin and tetramethylpyrazine contents by 191.84% and 123.17% respectively, without significantly changing the other volatiles contents.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we have set up a study to investigate the effectiveness of two probiotic formulations containing a blend of seven bacterial species in modulating intestinal inflammation in two rodent models of colitis, induced by treating mice with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Despite the taxonomy of the bacterial species in the two probiotic formulations being similar, only one preparation (Blend 2-Vivomixx) effectively attenuated the development of colitis in both models. In the TNBS model of colitis, Blend 2 reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, promoting the expansion  macrophages and the formation of IL-10-producing Treg cells in the colon's . In the DSS model of colitis, disease attenuation and Treg formation was observed only in mice administered with Blend 2, and this effect was associated with intestinal microbiota remodeling and increased formation of lactate, butyrate, and propionate. None of these effects were observed in mice administered with Blend 1 (VSL#3). In summary, we have shown that two probiotic mixtures obtained by combining taxonomically similar species produced with different manufacturing methods exert divergent effects in mouse models of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15342677>Validation of deuterium-labeled   for the measurement of dietary fat oxidation during physical activity.</a></h2><p>Measurement of 13C-labeled  acid oxidation is hindered by the need for acetate correction, measurement of the rate of CO2 production in a controlled environment, and frequent collection of breath samples.

Thirteen subjects with body mass index of 22.9 +/- 3 kg/ and body fat of 19.6 +/- 11% were subjected to 2 or 4 h of exercise at 25% maximum volume oxygen consumption (VO2max). The d31-palmitate and [1-13C] palmitate were given orally in a liquid meal at breakfast. The d3-acetate and [1-13C]acetate were given during another visit for acetate sequestration correction. Recovery of d31-palmitate in urine at 9 h after dose was compared with [1-13C] palmitate recovery in breath. Cumulative recovery of d31-palmitate was 10.6 +/- 3% and that of [1-13C]palmitate was 5.6 +/- 2%. The d3-acetate and [1-13C]acetate recoveries were 85 +/- 4% and 54 +/- 4%, respectively. When [1-13C]acetate recovery was used to correct 13C data, the average recovery differences were 0.4 +/- 3%. Uncorrected d31-palmitate and acetate-corrected [1-13C]palmitate were well correlated (y=0.96x + 0; P <0.0001) when used to measure  acid oxidation during exercise.

In conventional in vitro assays using liver microsomes and NADPH as cosubstrate, a high metabolic stability of licofelone was observed. In the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid, licofelone is rapidly converted into the corresponding acyl glucuronide, M1. These results are in conflict with data from clinical studies. After administration of licofelone to humans, M1 plasma concentrations were negligibly low, whereas the exposure of the hydroxy-metabolite  achieved values of approximately 20% compared with that of the parent drug. Metabolism studies with human hepatocytes and dual-activity assays with microsomes, which allowed the simultaneous monitoring of hydroxylation and glucuronidation reactions, were performed, and the metabolic pathway of licofelone was elucidated. After glucuronidation, predominantly catalyzed by UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms UGT2B7, UGT1A9, and UGT1A3, M1 is converted into the hydroxy-glucuronide M3 in a CYP2C8-dependent reaction. The enzyme specificities were investigated using recombinant human cytochrome P450 and UGT isoforms as test systems. In vitro drug-interaction studies using the 6alpha-hydroxylation of paclitaxel as control reaction confirmed that neither licofelone nor M1 is a relevant inhibitor of CYP2C8. The formation of M3 was also observed with liver microsomes from cynomolgus monkeys, but in incubations with mouse and rat liver microsomes, M1 remained unchanged.

The expression of abaI at the transcriptional level was activated by ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants or by synthetic 3-hydroxy-C(12)-HSL. An abaI::Km mutant failed to produce any detectable AHL signals and was impaired in biofilm development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16862369>[Effects of voltage during anodization on titanium surface on cell attachment and spreading of osteoblasts].</a></h2><p>The effects of the voltage during anodic oxidation on cell attachment and spreading of human osteoblasts in early stage were investigated.The samples were anodized in the electrolyte of 0.03 M calcium glycerophosphate (Ca-GP) mixed with 0.15 M calcium acetate (CA) under current density of 70 A/ and different voltages, 140V, 200V or 260V. The surface roughness of the specimens and the attachment and spreading of human osteoblasts in early stage were investigated. SPSS13.0 for windows was used for one-way ANOVA.The surface average roughness of cp Ti was significantly improved from 0.17 micro m to 0.23 micro m, 0.26 micro m, 0.33 micro m, respectively, by anodic oxidation with increased voltage (P<0.05). After 2 hours of cell culture, cell skeleton was reorganized and cell morphology became more irregular with the increase of anodizing voltages. Cell attachment on the specimens anodized under 260V was significantly higher than on the surface of cp Ti (P<0.05).The surface properties of cp Ti can be affected by anodic oxidation. The early cell attachment and spreading were enhanced with anodizing voltage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9321865>Location and quantification of muscarinic receptor subtypes in rat pons: implications for REM sleep generation.</a></h2><p>Microinjecting cholinomimetics into the pontine reticular formation produces a state that resembles natural rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Evocation of this REM sleeplike states is anatomically site dependent within the pons and is mediated by muscarinic receptors. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cholinergic REM sleep generation and muscarinic receptor subtype involvement remain to be specified. This study tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor subtypes are differentially distributed within the oral and caudal divisions of rat pontine reticular nucleus. In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to localize and quantify M1, , and M3 binding sites in the pontine reticular formation and in pontine brain stem regions known to regulate REM sleep. M1-M3 binding sites were present in some REM sleep-related nuclei, such as dorsal raphe and locus ceruleus. The pontine reticular formation was found to have a homogeneous distribution of  binding sites across its rostral to caudal extent, indicating that anatomic specificity of cholinergic REM sleep induction cannot be accounted for by a differential density of muscarinic receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058362>The ketone body metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate induces an antidepression-associated ramification of microglia via HDACs inhibition-triggered Akt-small RhoGTPase activation.</a></h2><p>Direct induction of macrophage ramification has been shown to promote an alternative () polarization, suggesting that the ramified morphology may determine the function of immune cells. The ketone body metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) elevated in conditions including fasting and low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) can reduce neuroinflammation. However, how exactly BHB impacts microglia remains unclear. We report that BHB as well as its producing stimuli fasting and KD induced obvious ramifications of murine microglia in basal and inflammatory conditions in a reversible manner, and these ramifications were accompanied with microglial profile toward  polarization and phagocytosis. The protein kinase B (Akt)-small RhoGTPase axis was found to mediate the effect of BHB on microglial shape change, as (i) BHB activated the microglial small RhoGTPase (Rac1, Cdc42) and Akt; (ii) Akt and Rac1-Cdc42 inhibition abolished the pro-ramification effect of BHB; (iii) Akt inhibition prevented the activation of Rac1-Cdc42 induced by BHB treatment. Incubation of microglia with other classical histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors, but not G protein-coupled receptor 109a (GPR109a) activators, also induced microglial ramification and Akt activation, suggesting that the BHB-induced ramification of microglia may be triggered by HDACs inhibition. Functionally, Akt inhibition was found to abrogate the effects of BHB on microglial polarization and phagocytosis. In neuroinflammatory models induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), BHB prevented the microglial process retraction and depressive-like behaviors, and these effects were abolished by Akt inhibition. Our findings for the first time showed that BHB exerts anti-inflammatory actions via promotion of microglial ramification.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158242>Diagnostic accuracy of magnification endoscopy with acetic acid enhancement and narrow-band imaging in gastric mucosal neoplasms.</a></h2><p>Magnification endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (NBIME) and NBIME with acetic acid enhancement (A-NBIME) visualize the capillary and microstructure patterns of the gastric mucosal surface, respectively. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver agreement for white-light endoscopy (WLE), NBIME, and A-NBIME in the different histologic types of gastric mucosal neoplasm.Consecutive gastric neoplasms (n = 220; 49 adenomas, 144 differentiated adenocarcinomas, and 27 undifferentiated adenocarcinomas) were photographed with WLE, NBIME, and A-NBIME. Macroscopic patterns using WLE, capillary patterns using NBIME, and microstructure patterns using A-NBIME were respectively classified into type M1//M3, type C1/C2/C3/C4, and type S1/S2/S3, as the indicators of adenoma, differentiated adenocarcinoma, and undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (Type C4, unevaluable because of capillary invisibility), according to the previously reported classifications. Endoscopic images were independently reviewed by three experts and three non-experts. Diagnostic accuracy and interobserver diagnostic agreement were compared among the modalities.Kappa values (95 % confidence interval [CI]) for WLE, NBIME, and A-NBIME diagnosis were 0.36 (0.33 - 0.39), 0.58 (0.54 - 0.61), and 0.62 (0.55 - 0.68) for experts and 0.31 (0.29 - 0.33), 0.36 (0.34 - 0.38), and 0.52 (0.48 - 0.56) for non-experts, showing good reproducibility of A-NBIME diagnosis regardless of proficiency. All experts and non-experts diagnosed the histologic types statistically more accurately with A-NBIME than with WLE and NBIME (P < 0.05). Overall the "experts-agreed" diagnostic accuracy (95 %CI) was 75.5 % (70.0 - 81.0) for WLE vs. 74.1 % (67.6 - 80.6) for NBIME vs. 90.5 % (86.7 - 94.1) for A-NBIME (P < 0.05). WLE and NBIME were insufficient to predict the diagnosis of adenomas and undifferentiated adenocarcinomas.A-NBIME showed statistically significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for gastric mucosal neoplasms, with good reproducibility, compared with WLE and NBIME, which provided similar lower accuracy.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21179968>Preparation and characterization of biomimetic adsorbent from poly-3-hydroxybutyrate.</a></h2><p>Biomimetic adsorbent named as PHBBMA was prepared from lipophilic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) by a modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method. PHBBMA, characterized by using scanning electron microscope and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, is porous spherical particles. The characterization with the thermal gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that PHBBMA preparation was a physical process without chemical reaction. The adsorption of PHBBMA for o-nitrochlorobenzene (o-NCB) was fitted better by Langmuir model than by Freundlich model, while the pseudo second-order model fitting was better than the pseudo first-order model fitting. The maximal adsorption capacity of PHBBMA for o-NCB was 57.83 mg/g at 30 degrees C, although its specific surface area (S(BET)) was only 8.45 /g. PHBBMA is a safe and environmental friendly adsorbent with high adsorption capacity because its component is innocuous and biodegradable PHB produced reusing wastes and contaminants, no byproduct can produced, and its ester and hydrocarbyl groups have strong affinity with organochlorine compounds. The further work will focus on the modification and improvement of PHBBMA in order to increase its SBET and adsorption capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21866777>Influence of nitrogen limitation on performance of a microbial fuel cell.</a></h2><p>We describe the operation of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) system operating on a synthetic wastewater (acetic acid), under conditions of increasing nitrogen limitation. Two MFCs were operated under feed conditions which spanned a range of TKN/COD values of 1.6-28 mg/g. Stable operation was observed in all cases, even when no ammoniacal nitrogen was added to the cell. Improved electrochemical performance (measured as power density, W/) was observed as nitrogen limitation was imposed on the cells. Even with no ammonium addition, continuous function of the cell was maintained, at levels consistent with operation at balanced nutrient supplementation. The work has implicated biological nitrogen fixation as a potential source of nitrogen within the MFC. Whilst this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed, the work highlights the opportunity for continuous operation of microbial fuel cells utilising wastewaters with extremely low nitrogen levels, present in pulp and paper, pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries. Further, the described increases in some of the electrochemical indices (e.g. power density) under application of nitrogen limitation may provide a new approach to increasing fuel cell performance. Finally, the lack of any need to add supplemental nitrogen to a MFC-based wastewater treatment technology holds potential for significant financial and environmental savings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1816218>Short term study on relative merits of acetate and bicarbonate dialysis.</a></h2><p>We did a double blind, crossover, prospective study comparing bicarbonate and acetate containing solutions in haemodialysis. Thirty stable patients with end stage renal disease on maintenance haemodialysis while awaiting a renal transplant were each studied on three dialysis with acetate and three with bicarbonate. Nine patients developed symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, and malaise and developed hypotension during acetate dialysis and three patients during bicarbonate dialysis. There were symptoms during 16.66% of acetate dialysis sessions and 5.55% of bicarbonate dialysis sessions. (P less than 0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease in PaO2 and PaCO2 on acetate dialysis at 30 minutes after initiation of dialysis. There was no significant difference in weight loss on dialysis, or in blood pressure and correction of acidosis. We conclude that bicarbonate dialysis is better tolerated, but acetate intolerance is not a major problem since we use small surface area dialysers (0.8 ).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10049961>The effects of valproate, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine on growth and sexual maturation in girls with epilepsy.</a></h2><p>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have endocrine effects that may interfere with growth and sexual maturation in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of AEDs on growth and pubertal development in girls with epilepsy.Forty girls taking valproate (VPA), 19 girls taking carbamazepine (CBZ), and 18 girls taking oxcarbazepine (OXC) for epilepsy and 49 healthy control girls participated in the study, which included a cross-sectional clinical examination when the girls were 8 to 18 years old and a longitudinal growth analysis from the age of 1 year.VPA, CBZ, or OXC did not affect linear growth or pubertal development in girls with epilepsy. However, the patients taking VPA gained weight, and an increase in relative weight was seen in girls who started their medication before as well as during puberty. The body mass index of the VPA-treated girls (19.8 +/- 4.8 kg/) was higher than that of the control girls (18.0 +/- 2.5 kg/) at clinical examination. The weight of the girls taking CBZ or OXC for epilepsy was similar to that of the control girls. Plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels were higher in girls treated with CBZ and OXC than in the control girls, but AEDs did not affect fasting serum insulin, IGF-binding protein-1, or IGF-binding protein-3 concentrations in girls on VPA, CBZ, or OXC medication during the period of exposure (average 2.8, 4.1, and 1.9 years, respectively) in this study.AEDs do not seem to have any adverse effects on linear growth or sexual maturation in girls with epilepsy. VPA-related weight gain can be seen already in prepuberty and it is not associated with hyperinsulinemia in these young patients. The clinical significance of high circulating concentrations of IGF-I in patients taking CBZ or OXC remains to be defined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25555562>Postprandial effects of polydextrose on satiety hormone responses and subjective feelings of appetite in obese participants.</a></h2><p>Dietary fibers are associated with enhanced satiety. However, the mechanism of different dietary fibers contributing to satiety-related gastrointestinal (GI) peptide release, especially in an obese population, is still poorly understood. Polydextrose (PDX), a water-soluble glucose polymer, has demonstrated its ability to reduce energy intake at a subsequent meal, but its mechanism of action requires further research. Also, there is limited evidence on its capacity to regulate subjective feelings of appetite. This study examines the effects of PDX on postprandial secretion of satiety-related GI peptides, short chain   (SCFAs), lactic acid, and subjective appetite ratings in obese participants.18 non-diabetic, obese participants (42.0 y, 33.6 kg/) consumed a high-fat meal (4293 kJ, 36% from fat) with or without PDX (15 g) in an acute, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover trial. Postprandial plasma concentrations of satiety-related peptides, namely ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY), as well as SCFAs and lactic acid were assessed. GI peptide,  and lactate concentrations were then modeled using a linear mixed-effects model.The subjective feelings of hunger, satisfaction, and desire to eat were evaluated using visual analogue scales (VAS), which were analyzed as incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) during the satiation and satiety periods.We found that PDX supplementation increased plasma GLP-1 levels more than the placebo treatment (P = 0.02). In the whole group, GLP-1 concentrations found in participants older than 40 years old were significantly lower (P = 0.01) as compared to those aged 40 years or less. There were no statistically significant differences in postprandial ghrelin, CCK, or PYY responses. The lactic acid concentrations were significantly (P = 0.01) decreased in the PDX group, while no significant changes in SCFAs were found. PDX reduced iAUC for hunger by 40% (P = 0.03) and marginally increased satisfaction by 22.5% (P = 0.08) during the post-meal satiety period.Polydextrose increased the postprandial secretion of the satiety hormone GLP-1 and reduced hunger after a high-fat meal. PDX also reduced the elevated postprandial lactic acid levels in plasma. Therefore, PDX may offer an additional means to regulate inter-meal satiety and improve postprandial metabolism in obese participants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135463>Phase II multicenter study of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent efaproxiral (RSR13) and thoracic radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Efaproxiral (RSR13) reduces hemoglobin oxygen-binding affinity, facilitates oxygen release, and increases tissue pO2. We conducted a phase II multicenter study that assessed the efficacy and safety of efaproxiral when administered with thoracic radiation therapy (TRT), following induction chemotherapy, for treatment of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Fifty-one patients with locally advanced NSCLC were enrolled at 13 sites. Treatment comprised two cycles of paclitaxel (225 mg/) and carboplatin (area under the curve, 6), 3 weeks apart, followed by TRT (64 Gy/32 fractions) with concurrent efaproxiral (50 to 100 mg/kg). Survival results were compared with results of study Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-10.Overall response rate was 75% (37 of 49 patients). Complete and partial response rates were 6% (three of 49 patients) and 69% (34 of 49 patients), respectively. Median survival time (MST) was 20.6 months (95% CI, 14.0 to 24.2); overall survival rates at 1- and 2-years were 67% and 37%, respectively. Survival results were compared with the sequential (S-CRT) and concurrent (C-CRT) chemoradiotherapy arms of RTOG 94-10. MSTs for cases matched by stage, Karnofsky performance status, and age were: RT-010, 20.6 months; S-CRT, 15.1 months; and C-CRT, 17.9 months. Grade 3 to 4 toxicities related to efaproxiral that occurred in more than one patient included transient hypoxemia (19%), radiation pneumonitis (11%), and fatigue (4%).Addition of efaproxiral to S-CRT represents a promising approach in NSCLC treatment, and a randomized study should be pursued. The low incidence of grade 3 to 4 toxicities suggests that the use of efaproxiral instead of a cytotoxic agent, as a radiation sensitizer, may be advantageous.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1991798>Insulin resistance of puberty: a defect restricted to peripheral glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>To examine mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance during normal puberty, sequential 8 and 40 mU/.min euglycemic insulin clamp and hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed in 14 healthy prepubertal and 19 pubertal children. Both groups had comparable rates of glucose turnover and plasma levels of branched chain amino  and FFA at baseline. The low as well as the high insulin dose stimulated peripheral glucose uptake much more effectively in prepubertal children (P less than 0.05). In contrast, suppression of hepatic glucose production (60% at low dose in both groups, pNS) and lowering of substrates in response to insulin was not affected by puberty at either dose. During the hyperglycemic clamp pubertal children showed enhanced insulin responses and in turn a sharper fall in amino  (P less than 0.05 vs. prepubertals). Our data suggest that insulin resistance during puberty is restricted to peripheral glucose metabolism. Selective insulin resistance leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia may serve to amplify insulin's effect on amino acid metabolism, thereby facilitating protein anabolism during this period of rapid growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22613893>Electricity generation and microbial community in a submerged-exchangeable microbial fuel cell system for low-strength domestic wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>A submerged type microbial fuel cell (MFC) system, which consisted of six readily exchangeable air-cathode MFCs, was evaluated for continuous treatment of low-strength domestic wastewater. When supplied with synthetic wastewater (COD 100 mg/L), the system showed increasing maximum power densities from 191 to 754 mW/ as COD loading rates increased (0.20-0.40 kg/m3/day). COD removal efficiencies decreased with increased COD loading rates but the effluent COD concentrations met the relevant effluent quality standard (CODMn 20 mg/L) at all conditions. The system was then operated with domestic wastewater (c.a. 100 mg COD/L) at 0.32 and 0.43 kg/m3/day. The system showed much lower power densities (116-149 mW/) at both loading rates, compared to synthetic wastewater. Anodic microbial communities were completely different when the wastewater type was changed. These results suggest that the newly developed MFC system could be applied to treat low-strength domestic wastewater without requiring any additional organic removal stage.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A double-blind, randomized study was undertaken to evaluate two widely utilized hypolipidemic drugs in the post-prandial phase and their impact on lipid, coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters.Thirty middle-aged men selected according to their low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) > or = 160 and < or = 240 mg/dl and borderline hypertriglyceridemia (110-220 mg/dl) after at least one month of a lipid-lowering diet received gemfibrozil (600 mg bid) or simvastatin (20 mg qd) and the corresponding placebo. On enrollment and after 2 months of drug treatment, they were tested with a standard oral fat load (OFL) (35 g fat/ body surface). On both occasions plasma total-cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein[a] (Lp[a]), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), antithrombin-III (AT-III), plasminogen and fibrinogen were determined just before the meal (t0) and at times 2 hours, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h after it (t2-t8). A two-factor (time and visit) multivariate analysis for repeated measurements was performed to evaluate the data. Total cholesterol, and LDL-C were significantly diminished 2 months after both gemfibrozil and simvastatin, the latter being more active. Plasma triglycerides showed a marked reduction with gemfibrozil at all times, while simvastatin regimen yielded only minor modifications. HDL-C was only slightly increased by simvastatin; Lp[a] plasma levels were almost unaffected. Small fibrinogen (t0, t2, t6, t8), PAI-1 (t6) and AT III (t0-t8) increases were observed after gemfibrozil, while simvastatin did not significantly modify these parameters.In the post-prandial phase, gemfibrozil and simvastatin induce different metabolic effects that beneficially influence the lipid pattern, whereas fibrinolytic and coagulative parameters display minor variations of undetermined significance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7866470>A comparison of the thermogenic, metabolic and haemodynamic responses to infused adrenaline in lean and obese subjects.</a></h2><p>The objective of this work was to study adrenoceptor sensitivity in vivo in a number of tissues in lean and obese humans. The thermogenic, metabolic and cardiovascular responses to a 90 min infusion of adrenaline were measured. The subjects were eleven obese subjects (Body Mass Index 36.0 +/- 1.2 kg/) and 10 non-obese subjects (Body Mass Index 21.9 +/- 0.7 kg/). Metabolic rate, heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, plasma palmitate turnover and oxidation were measured. Thermogenic responses to adrenaline were similar in the lean and obese groups (14.4 +/- 1.6 and 15.1 +/- 1.6 J/min/kg fat free mass respectively). Of the cardiovascular variables measured, only the increase in forearm blood flow during adrenaline infusion differed between lean and obese, being 3.9 +/- 0.5 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min/100 ml forearm respectively. Basal plasma palmitate turnover rates were lower in the obese when expressed per unit fat mass (2.32 +/- 0.17 and 7.61 +/- 1.20 mumol/min/kg fat mass respectively). Basal plasma palmitate oxidation rates were higher in the obese when expressed per unit fat free mass (1.53 +/- 0.19 and 0.82 +/- 0.12 mumol/min/kg fat free mass respectively). In response to adrenaline palmitate turnover increased similarly in both groups, but plasma palmitate oxidation rates fell in the obese whilst they were unchanged in the lean. In the basal state the obese do not appear to have a defect in fat oxidation, but their response to infused adrenaline may favour fat storage over oxidation. No thermogenic defect was shown in the obese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1874488>Effect of insulin and plasma amino acid concentration on leucine metabolism in cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Clinically stable patients with cirrhosis demonstrate insulin resistance with regard to glucose metabolism. However, much less is known about the two major factors, insulin and plasma amino acid concentration, that regulate protein metabolism in cirrhotic patients. To examine this question, we performed paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies in combination with 14C-leucine and indirect calorimetry. In the first study insulin alone was infused, and the plasma amino acid concentration was allowed to decline. During the second study a balanced amino acid solution was infused with insulin to increase the total plasma amino acid concentration approximately twofold. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4.68 vs. 6.45 mg/kg-min, p less than 0.01) was significantly impaired by 30% in cirrhotic patients during both insulin clamp studies. In the postabsorptive state, cirrhotic patients manifested low plasma leucine (76 vs. 102 mumol/L) and alpha-ketoisocaproate (19 vs. 30 mumol/L) concentrations, but all parameters of leucine turnover were normal. When insulin alone was infused, the endogenous leucine flux (an index of protein degradation) declined similarly in cirrhotic patients (30.8 mumol/-min) and control (26.9) subjects, and this was accompanied by a similar decrease in plasma leucine concentration (31% vs. 33%). The decline in circulating leucine concentration was accompanied by a parallel decline in leucine oxidation (5.1 vs. 4.6 mumol/-min) and nonoxidative (28.9 vs. 26.0 mumol/-min) leucine disposal, which were of similar magnitude in cirrhotic patients and control subjects, respectively. In both cirrhotic patients and control subjects, combined hyperinsulinemia/hyperaminoacidemia elicited a similar stimulation of nonoxidative leucine disposal (an index of protein synthesis) and leucine oxidation while causing a greater suppression of endogenous leucine flux than observed with insulin alone. Thus the suppressive effect of insulin on protein degradation and the stimulatory effect of insulin/amino acid infusion on protein synthesis are not impaired in cirrhotic patients, demonstrating a clear-cut dissociation between the effects of insulin on protein and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10096443>The analgesic tropane analogue (+/-)-SM 21 has a high affinity for sigma2 receptors.</a></h2><p>The analgesic properties of the tropane analogue (+/-)-SM 21 have been attributed to the antagonism of presynaptic  receptors resulting in a potentiation of acetylcholine release.

Twenty subjects (serum triglycerides, 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmol/L; age, 52 +/- 7 years; body mass index, 27.8 +/- 1.8 kg/) were randomly allocated to receive either placebo or gemfibrozil 1,200 mg daily for 12 weeks in a double-blind study. Gemfibrozil decreased serum total and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides by 53% and 57%, respectively, and serum apolipoprotein (apo) B concentration by 21%. Gemfibrozil had no effect on the diurnal concentration of free   (FFA). Neither did gemfibrozil change diurnal blood glucose or serum insulin concentrations. The endogenous glucose production rate remained unchanged in both groups during the treatment period, and was similarly suppressed by hyperinsulinemia. The rate of insulin-induced whole-body glucose disposal increased similarly both before (basal 10.8 +/- 1.8, low-dose insulin 10.5 +/- 2.1, and high-dose insulin 20.9 +/- 11.9 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and after (11.1 +/- 1.7, 10.7 +/- 1.2, and 18.6 +/- 7.9, respectively) gemfibrozil treatment. Rates of oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism remained unchanged during gemfibrozil treatment. Basal pretreatment and posttreatment FFA turnover rates were similar in both study groups, as were the rates of substrate oxidation. In summary, gemfibrozil proved to be an effective serum triglyceride-lowering agent in patients with mild hypertriglyceridemia, but had no effect on the insulin sensitivity of glucose metabolism or of antilipolysis. These data support the idea that triglycerides per se do not cause insulin resistance, and that the triglyceride-lowering effect of gemfibrozil is not mediated via antilipolytic action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19150455>Myotoxicity of gemfibrozil in cynomolgus monkey model and its relationship to pharmacokinetic properties.</a></h2><p>Fibrate drugs are PPARalpha agonists prescribed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Severe myotoxicity has been reportedly associated with their use albeit at a low frequency, especially for gemfibrozil. Few studies have investigated the mechanism of fibrate-induced myotoxicity in vivo. Considering the apparent species-related differences in PPARalpha agonist-induced hepatotoxicity, we studied the myotoxicity of gemfibrozil in a Cynomolgus monkey model and explored the relationship between myotoxicity and pharmacokinetics. Six Cynomolgus monkeys were dosed with gemfibrozil twice daily at 600 mg/kg/day for the first two periods (P1 and P2, 8 days and 9 days respectively) and 300 mg/kg/day for the third period (P3, 14 days). Creatine kinase and myoglobin were measured, together with hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity markers. Behavioral responses were recorded for indication of toxicity. Pharmacokinetics was carried out following the 16th dosage of P1 and 17th dosage of P2 when myotoxicity was identified. Multivariable data analysis was employed to explore the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and myotoxicity markers. Consequently, myotoxicity occurred in monkey #2 () and M6 in P1, M3 and M4 in P2, M3 and M6 in P3. Data analysis showed T80-150 (sustained time above the given concentration) contributed for myotoxicity discriminance and correlated with myotoxicity risk. This study revealed Cynomolgus monkey may be a good animal model for myotoxicity evaluation with sensitivity, reproducibility and similarities to humans. More interestingly, they exhibited a much higher incidence of myotoxicity than that of humans. Sustained high drug concentration plays an important role for the occurrence of myotoxicity. This may suggest an influence of drug transport and metabolism on myotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29256535>Pioglitazone attenuates cardiometabolic risk factors in non-diabetic patients with dyslipidemia.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of pioglitazone on cardiometabolic risk factors in non-diabetic patients with dyslipidaemia.This prospective, randomised clinical trial was conducted at Sheikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan, from August to October 2016, and comprised non-diabetic patients with dyslipidaemia. They were randomly divided into three groups. First and second groups were given a daily dose of tab pioglitazone 30mg and gemfibrozil 600mg, respectively, while the third group served as the healthy control. Body weight, body mass index and serum lipid profile were analysed pre- and post-treatment. SPSS 16 was used for data analysis.Of the 135 participants, there were 45(33.3%) in each group. After 12 weeks' treatment, the pioglitazone group showed a highly significant reduction in body weight (83±10.5 to 76±13.5kg) and body mass index (27.7±4.4 to 25.5±6.4kg/) (p<0.01) compared to the gemfibrozil group. The pioglitazone group showed a significant improvement in serum lipid profile after 12 weeks (p<0.05) while the gemfibrozil group showed a highly significant improvement in serum lipid profile (p<0.01).Pioglitazone independently improved cardiometabolic risk factors, even in non-diabetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16513447>Telithromycin, but not montelukast, increases the plasma concentrations and effects of the cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C8 substrate repaglinide.</a></h2><p>The antidiabetic repaglinide is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4. Telithromycin, an antimicrobial agent, inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro and in vivo. Montelukast, an antiasthmatic drug, is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. We studied the effects of telithromycin, montelukast, and the combination of telithromycin and montelukast on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repaglinide.In a randomized 4-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received 800 mg telithromycin, 10 mg montelukast, both telithromycin and montelukast, or placebo once daily for 3 days. On day 3, they ingested a single 0.25-mg dose of repaglinide. Plasma and urine concentrations of repaglinide and its metabolites M1, , and M4, as well as blood glucose concentrations, were measured for 12 hours.Telithromycin alone raised the mean peak plasma repaglinide concentration to 138% (range, 91%-209%; P = .006) and the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 hours to infinity [AUC0-infinity] of repaglinide to 177% (range, 125%-257%; P < .001) of control (placebo). Telithromycin reduced the AUC0-infinity ratio of the metabolite M1 to repaglinide by 68% (P < .001) and the urinary excretion ratio of M1 to repaglinide by 77% (P = .001). In contrast to previous estimates based on in vitro CYP2C8 inhibition data, montelukast had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide or its metabolites and did not significantly alter the effect of telithromycin on repaglinide pharmacokinetics. Telithromycin, unlike montelukast, lowered the maximum blood glucose concentration (P = .002) and mean blood glucose concentration from 0 to 3 hours (P = .008) after repaglinide intake, as compared with placebo.Telithromycin increases the plasma concentrations and blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide by inhibiting its CYP3A4-catalyzed biotransformation and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Unexpectedly, montelukast has no significant effect on repaglinide pharmacokinetics, suggesting that it does not significantly inhibit CYP2C8 in vivo. The low free fraction of montelukast in plasma may explain the lack of effect on CYP2C8 in vivo, despite the low in vitro inhibition constant, highlighting the importance of incorporating plasma protein binding to interaction predictions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234825>Bindarit Attenuates Pain and Cancer-Related Inflammation by Influencing Myeloid Cells in a Model of Bone Cancer.</a></h2><p>C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) is a small cytokine that functions in inflammation and cancer development. Bindarit, a CCL2 inhibitor, is a small anti-inflammatory molecule proven safe by phase II trials in type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients. As cancer-related inflammation is a cause of pain, we investigated whether Bindarit suppresses cancer-related inflammation and pain. We established a bone-cancer mouse model by inoculating cancer cells. After applying Bindarit, we preformed pain sensitivity tests and checked cancer development by X-ray. Using flow cytometry and qRT-PCR assays, we assessed the effect of Bindarit on peripheral blood monocyte mobilization and  macrophage polarization. We also investigated the targets of Bindarit using western blotting and luciferase assay. Bindarit-treated mice performed better in pain sensitivity tests compare to control mice. X-ray imaging showed that Bindarit-treated mice had fewer cancer cell colonies and smaller overall tumor burden. Bindarit reduced the number of monocytes in peripheral blood and down-regulated the expression of  macrophage polarization makers. Bindarit also inhibited IKKβ phosphorylation. Bindarit efficiently relieves cancer-related pain and suppresses cancer development. Bindarit inhibits monocyte mobilization in peripheral blood as well as  macrophage polarization. IKKβ is identified as a target of Bindarit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28184907>Regulation of Nitrogen Mustard-Induced Lung Macrophage Activation by Valproic Acid, a Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Nitrogen mustard (NM)-induced lung injury is associated with an accumulation of proinflammatory/cytotoxic M1 and antiinflammatory/wound repair  macrophages, which have been implicated in tissue injury and repair. Herein, we analyzed the effects of valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with antiinflammatory and antioxidant activity, on lung macrophages responding to NM. Treatment of rats with NM (0.125 mg/kg, i.t.) resulted in structural alterations in the lung and a macrophage-rich inflammatory cell infiltrate, at 3 d and 7 d. This was accompanied by expression of PCNA, a marker of proliferation, and CYPb5, HO-1, and MnSOD, markers of oxidative stress. Administration of VPA (300 mg/kg/day; i.p.), beginning 30 min after NM, reduced increases in PCNA, CYPb5, HO-1, and MnSOD. This was associated with increases in immature CD11b+CD43+ M1 macrophages in the lung, and decreases in mature CD11b+CD43-  macrophages 3 d post NM, suggesting delayed maturation and phenotypic switching. VPA also attenuated NM-induced increases in lung iNOS+ and CCR2+ M1 macrophages, a response correlated with downregulation of NOS2, IL12B, PTGS2, MMP-9, and CCR2 expression. Conversely, numbers of CD68+, CD163+ , and ATR-1α+  macrophages increased after VPA, along with the expression of IL10, ApoE, and ATR-1A. NM exposure resulted in increased HDAC activity and upregulation of HDAC2 and acetylated H3K9 in the lung. Whereas VPA blunted the effects of NM on HDAC2 expression, histone H3K9 acetylation increased. These data suggest that alterations in the balance between histone acetylases and deacetylases contribute to lung macrophage maturation and activation following NM exposure.© The Author 2017.

Here, using 2-bromoacetophenone as the derivatization reagent (BP, 10 mg/mL, 40 °C for 20 min), a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method was established for the quantitative determination of seven short-chain   in plasma and feces. The analyses were performed on a C column in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. Specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, and stability were observed within the quantitative limits of biological sample analysis. The established method has largely improved the sensitivity by 200- to 2000-fold than that in gas chromatography (GC). Especially for butyrate, the lower quantitative limit of 1 ng/mL, 1600-fold higher in sensitivity than that of GC (1.6 μg/mL), ensured the accurate determination of its low level in blood or feces (88 ± 29 ng/mL in blood, 176 ± 18 μg/g in feces). Then, the validated method was applied for therapeutic studies of berberine in hyperlipidemia hamsters in vivo and screening of 13 compounds (including five metabolites of berberine and eight typical isoquinoline alkaloids) in vitro. After berberine treatment (oral, 200 mg/kg, 2 weeks) to hyperlipidemia hamsters, the levels of butyrate were significantly upregulated in blood (77 ± 10 ng/mL vs. 117 ± 13 ng/mL, *P < 0.05) and feces (132 ± 11 μg/g vs. 547 ± 57 μg/g, ***P < 0.001), which further verified butyrate as an active endogenous metabolite in coordination with berberine to lower the blood lipids. Additionally, the berberine metabolites (M1, , M3), as well as two isoquinoline alkaloids (tetrandrine and dauricine), could also obviously induce the production of SCFAs (butyrate, etc.) in gut microbiota. In total, we have successfully established a new derivative LC-MS/MS method for the targeted quantitative determination of seven SCFAs in biological samples.

The pentafluorobenzyl bromide derivatives of these very short chain   have high sensitivity of isotopoic enrichment due to their low natural isotopomer distribution in negative chemical ionization mass spectrometric mode. Pentafluorobenzyl bromide derivatization reaction was optimized in terms of pH, temperature, reaction time, and the amount of pentafluorobenzyl bromide versus sample. The precision, stability, and accuracy of this method for the isotopomer analysis were validated. This method was applied to measure the enrichments of formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid in the perfusate from rat liver exposed to Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer only, 0-1mM [3,4-(13)C(2)]-4-hydroxynonanoate, and 0-2mM [5,6,7-(13)C(3)]heptanoate. The enrichments of acetic acid and propionic acid in the perfusate are comparable to the labeling pattern of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA in the rat liver tissues. The enrichment of the acetic acid assay is much more sensitive and precise than the enrichment of acetyl-CoA by LC-MS/MS. The reversibility of propionyl-CoA from succinyl-CoA was confirmed by the low labeling of M1 and  of propionic acid from [5,6,7-(13)C(3)]heptanoate perfusates.2010 Elsevier Inc.

We examined patients with NIDDM to find whether maintaining plasma FFA levels in the fasting range with a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with an oral glucose load (clamp OGL) would affect insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake (PGU) and splanchnic glucose uptake (SGU). Nine NIDDM subjects (age, 55 +/- 3 years; duration of diabetes, 11 +/- 2 years; body mass index, 21.0 +/- 0.4 kg/; hemoglobin A1c, 9.0 +/- 0.3%; fasting plasma glucose, 9.4 +/- 3.0 mmol/l, means +/- SEM) were hospitalized and treated with diet, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin for at least 2 weeks to maintain fasting plasma glucose < 8 mmol/l. All the patients were subjected to two different protocols in a random order. On one protocol, under the hyperinsulinemic condition, FFAs were maintained at the their fasting levels (1.19 +/- 0.08) by triglyceride emulsion infusion (Lipid infusion study, L), and on the other protocol, FFAs were made to fall (0.26 +/- 0.06 mmol/l) with saline instead of triglyceride emulsion infusion (Saline infusion study, S). During euglycemic (L, 5.4 +/- 0.2; S, 5.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l) hyperinsulinemic (L, 1377 +/- 108; S, 1328 +/- 67 pmol/l) clamp, high FFA levels significantly reduced PGU (L, 26.7 +/- 3.6; S, 32.1 +/- 3.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P < 0.05) and SGU (L, 12.1 +/- 4.2; S, 27.5 +/- 5.6%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, high FFA levels in patients with NIDDM impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the splanchnic as well as peripheral tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10774885>Non-invasive estimation of myocardial efficiency using positron emission tomography and carbon-11 acetate--comparison between the normal and failing human heart.</a></h2><p>The clearance kinetics of carbon-11 acetate, assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), can be combined with measurements of ventricular function for non-invasive estimation of myocardial oxygen consumption and efficiency. In the present study, this approach was applied to gain further insights into alterations in the failing heart by comparison with results obtained in normals. We studied ten patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 11 healthy normals by dynamic PET with 11C-acetate and either tomographic radionuclide ventriculography or cine magnetic resonance imaging. A "stroke work index" (SWI) was calculated by: SWI = systolic blood pressure x stroke volume/body surface area. To estimate myocardial efficiency, a "work-metabolic index" (WMI) was then obtained as follows: WMI = SWI x heart rate/k(mono), where k(mono) is the washout constant for 11C-acetate derived from monoexponential fitting. In DCM patients, left ventricular ejection fraction was 19%+/-10% and end-diastolic volume was 92+/-28 ml/ (vs 64%+/-7% and 55+/-8 ml/ in normals, P<0.001). Myocardial oxidative metabolism, reflected by k(mono), was significantly lower compared with that in normals (0.040+/-0.011/min vs 0.060+/-0.015/min; P<0.003). The SWI (1674+/-761 vs 4736+/-895 mmHg x ml/; P<0.001) and the WMI as an estimate of efficiency (2.98+/-1.30 vs 6.20+/-2.25 x 10(6) mmHg x ml/; P<0.001) were lower in DCM patients, too. Overall, the WMI correlated positively with ejection parameters (r=0.73, P<0.001 for ejection fraction; r=0.93, P<0.001 for stroke volume), and inversely with systemic vascular resistance (r=-0.77; P<0.001). There was a weak positive correlation between WMI and end-diastolic volume in normals (r=0.45; P=0.17), while in DCM patients, a non-significant negative correlation coefficient (r=-0.21; P=0.57) was obtained. In conclusion non-invasive estimates of oxygen consumption and efficiency in the failing heart were reduced compared with those in normals. Estimates of efficiency increased with increasing contractile performance, and decreased with increasing ventricular afterload. In contrast to normals, the failing heart was not able to respond with an increase in efficiency to increasing ventricular volume. The present data support the usefulness of the WMI for non-invasive characterization of cardiac efficiency and may serve as a background for improved evaluation of medical therapy for heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15181047>Comparison of a low-fat diet to a low-carbohydrate diet on weight loss, body composition, and risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in free-living, overweight men and women.</a></h2><p>Overweight and obese men and women (24-61 yr of age) were recruited into a randomized trial to compare the effects of a low-fat (LF) vs. a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet on weight loss. Thirty-one subjects completed all 10 wk of the diet intervention (retention, 78%). Subjects on the LF diet consumed an average of 17.8% of energy from fat, compared with their habitual intake of 36.4%, and had a resulting energy restriction of 2540 kJ/d. Subjects on the LC diet consumed an average of 15.4% carbohydrate, compared with habitual intakes of about 50% carbohydrate, and had a resulting energy restriction of 3195 kJ/d. Both groups of subjects had significant weight loss over the 10 wk of diet intervention and nearly identical improvements in body weight and fat mass. LF subjects lost an average of 6.8 kg and had a decrease in body mass index of 2.2 kg/, compared with a loss of 7.0 kg and decrease in body mass index of 2.1 kg/ in the LC subjects. The LF group better preserved lean body mass when compared with the LC group; however, only the LC group had a significant decrease in circulating insulin concentrations. Group results indicated that the diets were equally effective in reducing systolic blood pressure by about 10 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by 5 mm Hg and decreasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 bioactivity. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were increased in the LC only, at the 2- and 4-wk time points. These data suggest that energy restriction achieved by a very LC diet is equally effective as a LF diet strategy for weight loss and decreasing body fat in overweight and obese adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9109895>A single-dose study to define tiagabine pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients with complex partial seizures.</a></h2><p>We report an open-label study of 25 children with complex partial seizures that assessed the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose of approximately 0.1 mg/kg tiagabine. The children received their usual individualized regimen of one concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) throughout the study. Seventeen children were receiving an inducing AED (carbamazepine or phenytoin); eight were receiving valproate. Tiagabine was well tolerated. Dose-normalized Cmax was higher in children taking valproate (18.2 +/- 5.0 ng/mL/mg) than in the induced children (14.8 +/- 6.9 ng/mL/mg), but the difference was not statistically significant. Dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time was significantly higher (p = 0.002) in children taking valproate (176.5 +/- 54.7 ng.hr/mL/mg) than in induced children (92.4 +/- 56.7 ng.hr/mL/mg). Similarly, oral clearance in the children taking valproate (96 +/- 39 mL/min) was half that of the induced children (207 +/- 91 mL/min). Half-life in children taking valproate (5.7 hr) was almost twice that for the induced children (3.2 hr), and the elimination rate constant was significantly lower (p < 0.02) for the children taking valproate than for the induced children. Volume of distribution was similar in the children taking valproate (52 +/- 9 L) and the induced children (59 +/- 29 L). This is consistent with observations in adults taking tiagabine with inducing AEDs or valproate. Exploratory regressions on these data in children and previous data in adults showed fairly strong relationships between body size and tiagabine clearance and volume of distribution, with body size explaining about 40 to 50% of the variability. When adjusted per kg body weight, clearance and volume were greater in children than adults. When adjusted per  body surface area, clearance and volume were more similar in adults and children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20374428>Restricted ketogenic diet enhances the therapeutic action of N-butyldeoxynojirimycin towards brain GM2 accumulation in adult Sandhoff disease mice.</a></h2><p>Sandhoff disease is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disease involving the storage of brain ganglioside GM2 and asialo-GM2. Previous studies showed that caloric restriction, which augments longevity, and N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, Miglustat), an imino sugar that hinders the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the first step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, both increase longevity and improve motor behavior in the beta-hexosaminidase (Hexb) knockout (-/-) murine model of Sandhoff disease. In this study, we used a restricted ketogenic diet (KD-R) and NB-DNJ to combat ganglioside accumulation. Adult Hexb-/- mice were placed into one of the following groups: (i) a standard diet (SD), (ii) a SD with NB-DNJ (SD + NB-DNJ), (iii) a KD-R, and (iv) a KD-R with NB-DNJ (KD-R + NB-DNJ). Forebrain GM2 content (mug sialic acid/100 mg dry wt) in the four groups was 375 +/- 15, 312 +/- 8, 340 +/- 28, and 279 +/- 26, respectively, indicating an additive interaction between NB-DNJ and the KD-R. Most interestingly, brain NB-DNJ content was 3.5-fold greater in the KD-R + NB-DNJ mice than in the SD + NB-DNJ mice. These data suggest that the KD-R and NB-DNJ may be a potential combinatorial therapy for Sandhoff disease by enhancing NB-DNJ delivery to the brain and may allow lower dosing to achieve the same degree of efficacy as high dose monotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22054065>Histone deacetylase inhibition by sodium valproate regulates polarization of macrophage subsets.</a></h2><p>Recent studies suggest that change of macrophage phenotype (M1/) is associated with autoimmune diseases. Sodium valproate (VPA) is a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which has immunomodulatory function in graft-versus-host disease. However, its impact on macrophage polarization has not been defined. We evaluated the effects of VPA on both mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and primary mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Exposure to VPA significantly repressed the production of interleukin 12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor α by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage activation, in contrast, promoted IL-10 expression. VPA also affected the costimulatory molecule expression on LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and BMMs (downregulation of CD40 and CD80, and upregulation of CD86). Specifically, VPA inhibited macrophage-mediated T helper 1 (Th1) effector but enhanced Th2 effector cell activation. Together, our preclinical study demonstrates that VPA significantly affects the phenotype and function of macrophage, indicating an important role of HDAC activity in immune regulation and inflammation. It also provides a rationale to evaluate VPA activity for the treatment of macrophage dysfunction-associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16256469>Oxidation of activated carbon: application to vinegar decolorization.</a></h2><p>This article reports studies on the feasibility of increasing the decoloring capacity of a granular activated carbon (GAC) by using oxidation with air at 350 degrees C to modify its surface activity and porosity. The GAC, obtained from olive stones, had a maximum decolorization capacity of 92% for doses of 20 g/l, while the maximum decolorization capacity of the modified granular activated carbon (MGAC) was about 96% at a dose of 10 g/l. The increase in decoloring capacity is thought to be due to an increase in mesopore area (from 129 to 340 /g) in the MGAC. The maximum decoloring values and the doses needed to attain them are very close to values obtained in previous studies using coconut shell powder-activated carbon (94 and 98% for red and white vinegar for a dose of 10 g/l, respectively).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646269>Effect of road transport for up to 24 hours followed by twenty-four hour recovery on live weight and physiological responses of bulls.</a></h2><p>The transport of livestock can have major implications for their welfare, and there is strong public interest and scientific endeavour aimed at ensuring that the welfare of transported animals is optimal. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of transport on live weight, physiological and haematological responses of bulls after road transport of 0, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours (h). Seventy-two Charolais bulls (mean weight (s.d.) 367 (35) kg), naïve to transport, were randomly assigned to one of six journey (J) times of 0 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h transport (n = 12 animals/treatment) at a stocking density of 1.02 /bull. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture before transport (-0.25 h), immediately after (0 h) and at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h relative to time 0 h. The bulls were weighed before transport (- 24 h and - 0.25 h), immediately after (0 h), and at 4 h, 12 h and 24 h relative to time 0 h. Control animals were blood sampled before assignment (-0.25 h) to novel pens, after (24 h), and at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h relative to the 24 h sampling time point.Bulls travelling for 6 h (280 km), 9 h (435 km), 12 h (582 km), 18 h (902 km) and 24 h (1192 km) lost 4.7, 4.5, 5.7 (P < 0.05), 6.6 (P < 0.05) and 7.5 (P < 0.05) percentage (%) live weight compared with baseline. Live weight re-gained to pre-transport levels during the 24 h recovery period. Lymphocyte percentages were lower (P < 0.05) and neutrophil percentages were greater (P < 0.05) in all animals. Blood protein, glucose and NEFA concentrations and creatine kinase activity were greater (P < 0.05) in the bulls following transport and returned to baseline within 24 h.Under the conditions of the present study, transport of bulls on journeys by road, ranging from 6 h (280 km) to 24 h (1192 km) duration, affected live weight, haematological and physiological measurements of metabolism and inflammation. Our findings showed that live weight and some physiological and haematological responses of bulls returned to pre-transport levels within 24 h with animals having had access to feed and water.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21963900>Continuous flow membrane-less air cathode microbial fuel cell with spunbonded olefin diffusion layer.</a></h2><p>The power production performance of a membrane-less air-cathode microbial fuel cell was evaluated for 53 days. Anode and cathode electrodes and the micro-fiber cloth separator were configured by sandwiching the separator between two electrodes. In addition, the air-facing side of the cathode was covered with a spunbonded olefin sheet instead of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating to control oxygen diffusion and water loss. The configuration resulted in a low resistance of about 4Ω and a maximum power density of 750 mW/. However, as a result of a gradual decrease in the cathode potential, maximum power density decreased to 280 mW/. The declining power output was attributed to loss of platinum catalyst (8.26%) and biomass growth (38.44%) on the cathode. Coulombic efficiencies over 55% and no water leakage showed that the spunbonded olefin sheet covering the air-facing side of the cathode can be a cost-effective alternative to PTFE coating.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Of these, 15/24 (22.1%) showed ammonia concentrations > 100 microgram/dl, even up to 194 micrograms/dl. In 48/69 patients, plasma carnitine concentrations could be determined. The plasma total carnitine (TC) concentrations were rather low (26.9 +/- 8.8 mumol/1) compared to normal values obtained in our laboratory (40.9 +/- 7.2 mumol/1). The percentage of free carnitine was considered decreased (< 75% TC) in 13/48 samples (27%). Fourteen hyperammonaemic patients and one with a plasma ammonia level of 60 micrograms/dl agreed to be supplemented with L-carnitine (1 g/ per day divided into two equal doses). Their plasma ammonia and carnitine concentrations were re-evaluated after a mean of 9.1 +/- 4.0 days (median 9.0 days) and in 9 patients again after a mean of 79.6 +/- 30.1 days (median 75 days) of L-carnitine supplementation. Plasma ammonia concentrations decreased in all 15 patients. The decrease was 25.4 +/- 11.2% (median 28.3%) after a mean of 9.1 +/- 4.0 days and amounted to 46.0 +/- 17.2% (median 48%) after 79.6 +/- 30.1 days. L-Carnitine supplementation led to an increase in plasma free carnitine of 11.6 +/- 13.0% (median 15.6%) and to a further increase of 11.1 +/- 8.4% (median 11.5%) when re-evaluated a second time. The plasma ammonia concentrations were significantly correlated with the percentage of free plasma carnitine (r = -0.67; p < 0.0001). The results show that carnitine supplementation is a means of normalizing elevated plasma ammonia concentrations. However, we cannot conclude from our results whether this lowers the risk of developing a VPA-induced Reye's-like syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581176>Development and validation of a continuous in vitro system reproducing some biotic and abiotic factors of the veal calf intestine.</a></h2><p>Following the January 2006 European ban of antibiotics used as growth promoters in the veal calf industry, new feed additives are needed in order to maintain animal health and growth performance. As an alternative to in vivo experiments in the testing of such additives, an in vitro system modeling the intestinal ecosystem of the veal calf was developed. Stabilization of the main cultured microbial groups and their metabolic activity were tracked in an in vitro continuous fermentor operated under anaerobiosis, at pH 6.5, and at a temperature of 38.5 degrees C and supplied with one of three different nutritive media (M1, , or M3). These media mainly differed in their concentrations of simple and complex carbohydrates and in their lipid sources. In vitro microbial levels and fermentative metabolite concentrations were compared to in vivo data, and the biochemical composition of the nutritive media was compared to that of the veal calf intestinal content. All three nutritive media were able to stabilize anaerobic and facultative anaerobic microflora, lactate-utilizing bacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, enterococci, and Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria at levels close to in vivo values. The microbiota was metabolically active, with high concentrations of lactate, ammonia, and short-chain   found in the fermentative medium. Comparison with in vivo data indicated that M3 outperformed M1 and  in simulating the conditions encountered in the veal calf intestine. This in vitro system would be useful in the prescreening of new feed additives by studying their effect on the intestinal microbiota levels and fermentative metabolite production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10946247>Phenolic  inhibit chloroplast mutagenesis in Euglena gracilis.</a></h2><p>The mutagenicity (bleaching activity) of ofloxacin (43 microM) and acridine orange (AO) (13.5 microM) in Euglena gracilis is inhibited by plant phenolics. Caffeic acid (CA), p-coumaric acid (PCA), ferulic acid (FA) and gentisic acid (GA) (25, 50, 100 and 250 microM) exhibited a significant concentration-dependent inhibitory effect against ofloxacin-induced mutagenicity, which was very effectively eliminated by the highest concentration of all four of those phenolic . The mutagenicity of AO was also significantly reduced in the presence of CA, PCA and FA (25, 50, 100 and 250 microM). However, GA exhibited no significant activity, even at the concentration of 250 microM. Based on the UV spectrophotometric measurements, we suggest that the antimutagenic effect of CA, PCA, FA and GA resulted from the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by ofloxacin. On the other hand, the reduction of AO-induced mutagenicity correlates with the binding capabilities of CA, PCA and FA, with the exception of GA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25421252>Phase 1/2 study of valproic acid and short-course radiotherapy plus capecitabine as preoperative treatment in low-moderate risk rectal cancer-V-shoRT-R3 (Valproic acid--short Radiotherapy--rectum 3rd trial).</a></h2><p>Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors where a risk-adapted therapeutic strategy is needed. Short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) is a more convenient option for LARC patients than preoperative long-course RT plus capecitabine. Histone-deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown activity in combination with RT and chemotherapy in the treatment of solid tumors. Valproic acid (VPA) is an anti-epileptic drug with HDACi and anticancer activity. In preclinical studies, our group showed that the addition of HDACi, including VPA, to capecitabine produces synergistic antitumour effects by up-regulating thymidine phosphorylase (TP), the key enzyme converting capecitabine to 5-FU, and by downregulating thymidylate synthase (TS), the 5-FU target.Two parallel phase-1 studies will assess the safety of preoperative SCRT (5 fractions each of 5 Gy, on days 1 to 5) combined with (a) capecitabine alone (increasing dose levels: 500-825 mg//bid), on days 1-21, or (b) capecitabine as above plus VPA (oral daily day -14 to 21, with an intra-patient titration for a target serum level of 50-100 microg/ml) followed by surgery 8 weeks after the end of SCRT, in low-moderate risk RC patients. Also, a randomized phase-2 study will be performed to explore whether the addition of VPA and/or capecitabine to preoperative SCRT might increase pathologic complete tumor regression (TRG1) rate. A sample size of 86 patients (21-22/arm) was calculated under the hypothesis that the addition of capecitabine or VPA to SCRT can improve the TRG1 rate from 5% to 20%, with one-sided alpha = 0.10 and 80% power.Several biomarkers will be evaluated comparing normal mucosa with tumor (TP, TS, VEGF, RAD51, XRCC1, Histones/proteins acetylation, HDAC isoforms) and on blood samples (polymorphisms of DPD, TS, XRCC1, GSTP1, RAD51 and XRCC3, circulating endothelial and progenitors cells; PBMCs-Histones/proteins acetylation). Tumor metabolism will be measured by 18FDG-PET at baseline and 15 days after the beginning of SCRT.This project aims to improve the efficacy of preoperative treatment of LARC and to decrease the inconvenience and the cost of standard long-course RT. Correlative studies could identify both prognostic and predictive biomarkers and could add new insight in the mechanism of interaction between VPA, capecitabine and RT.EudraCT Number: 2012-002831-28.ClinicalTrials.gov number, .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9223584>Antinociceptive profile of 3-alpha-tropanyl 2-(4-Cl-phenoxy)butyrate (SM-21) [corrected]: a novel analgesic with a presynaptic cholinergic mechanism of action.</a></h2><p>The antinociceptive effect of (+/-)-3-alpha-tropanyl 2-(4-Cl-phenoxy)butyrate [corrected] (SM-21) (10-40 mg kg(-1) s.c., 10-30 mg kg(-1) i.p., 20-60 mg kg(-1) p.o., 3-20 mg kg(-1) i.v. and 5-20 microg per mouse i.c.v.) was examined in rodents and guinea pigs by using the hot-plate, abdominal constriction, tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. The antinociception produced by (+/-)-SM-21 was prevented by atropine, pirenzepine and hemicholinium-3 but not by quinpirole, R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, [1-[2(methylsufonyl)amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl-5-floro++ +-2-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride, N6-cyclopentyladenosine, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine hydrobromide, naloxone, 3-aminopropyl-diethoxy-methyl-phosphinic acid or reserpine. On the basis of the above data, it can be postulated that (+/-)-SM-21 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission. Affinity profiles of (+/-)-SM-21 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for , guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4) have shown a selectivity ratio /M1 of 4.6 that, although very low, might be responsible for the antinociception induced by (+/-)-SM-21 through an increase in ACh extracellular levels.

The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between glycemia, ketonemia and ketonuria in children and adolescents in a summer camp under different conditions (fasting, casual hyperglycemia, moderate physical exercise) and to assess the utility of ketonemia determinations in diabetes control during this time.There were 47 participants (25 boys and 22 girls), with a mean HbA1c determination prior to enrollment of 7.7 +/- 1.5 %. The mean age was 11.7 +/- 1.8 years and the mean time from onset of diabetes was 3.0 +/- 2.7 years. The mean body mass index was 18.3 +/- 3.9 kg/ (SDS -0.16 +/- 0.44), the mean insulin dose was 0.8 +/- 0.4 U/kg/ day, and the number of doses per day was between 2 and 4 (median = 3). Blood glucose and ketones (both measured with the Optium system, Abbott Diabetes Care) and urine ketones (Ketodiastix, Bayer) were determined in different situations. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 11.5 program.Ketonemia results 45 minutes before and after moderate physical activity showed no significant increase in ketones (0.1 +/- 0.03 vs 0.23 +/- 0.07 mmol/l, ns). Preprandial blood ketone levels of > or = 0.5 mmol/l were found in 17.02 % of participants. Ketonemia was resolved during the first hour in all participants except one, in whom ketonemia resolved in 3 hours. Blood ketones were higher before breakfast than during the rest of the day (0.12 +/- 0.17 vs 0.02 +/- 0.05, p < 0.001). The mean glycemia level with ketosis (beta -HB > or = 0.5 mmol/l) was 174.5 +/- 64.7 mg/dl, a value slightly higher than the overall mean glycemia value (156.87 +/- 87.8 mg/dl). Ketonuria could not be measured in a high percentage of participants due to the difficulty of obtaining samples (between 24.5 % and 58.6 % in the different study groups).Measurement of glycemia together with ketonemia in a summer camp allows reliable follow-up of glycemic control to be performed. Ketonemia usually occurred before breakfast in parallel with slightly elevated glycemia, but resolved quickly. Moderate physical activity for 45 minutes does not seem to significantly increase blood ketones if metabolic control is normal. beta -HB is a useful parameter to determine whether moderate physical exercise is advisable or not. The lack of urinary ketone tests due to the difficulties of obtaining a sample can currently be solved by blood ketone measurement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075791>Enhancing factors of electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell using Geobacter sulfurreducens.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated various cultural and operational factors to enhance electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) using Geobacter sulfurreducens. The pure culture of G. sulfurreducens was cultivated using various substrates including acetate, malate, succinate, and butyrate, with fumarate as an electron acceptor. Cell growth was observed only in acetate-fed medium, when the cell concentrations increased 4-fold for 3 days. A high acetate concentration suppressed electricity generation. As the acetate concentration was increased from 5 to 20 mM, the power density dropped from 16 to 13 mW/, whereas the coulombic efficiency (CE) declined by about half. The immobilization of G. sulfurreducens on the anode considerably reduced the enrichment period from 15 to 7 days. Using argon gas to create an anaerobic condition in the anode chamber led to increased pH, and electricity generation subsequently dropped. When the plain carbon paper cathode was replaced by Pt-coated carbon paper (0.5 mg Pt/cm2), the CE increased greatly from 39% to 83%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30517973>Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of pemafibrate, a novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha modulator, in rats and monkeys.</a></h2><p>The metabolic profiles and pharmacokinetics of pemafibrate, a novel selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha modulator currently launched as an antidyslipidemic drug, were investigated in vitro using hepatocytes from rats, monkeys and humans and in vivo in rats and monkeys. Hepatocytes from rats, monkeys and humans all biotransformed pemafibrate to its demethylated form (M1). The bioavailabilities of pemafibrate in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys were 15% and 87%, respectively, after a single oral administration of pemafibrate (1 mg/kg). In rat plasma, unmetabolized pemafibrate was the major form, accounting for 29% of the area under the curve (AUC) of total radioactivity. In monkey plasma, in contrast, the major circulating metabolites were /3 (dearylated/dicarboxylic acid forms, 15%), M4 (N-dealkylated form, 21%) and M5 (benzylic oxidative form, 9%), but pemafibrate was the notable minor form (3%). These results, in combination with the reported findings in humans, suggest that the metabolite profile of pemafibrate in plasma was different for rats and monkeys, and that monkeys could be a suitable animal model for further pharmacokinetic studies of pemafibrate in humans.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565999>Presence or absence of carbohydrates and the proportion of fat in a high-protein diet affect appetite suppression but not energy expenditure in normal-weight human subjects fed in energy balance.</a></h2><p>Two types of relatively high-protein diets, with a normal or low proportion of carbohydrates, have been shown effective for weight loss. The objective was to assess the significance of the presence or absence of carbohydrates and the proportion of fat in high-protein diets for affecting appetite suppression, energy expenditure, and fat oxidation in normal-weight subjects in energy balance. Subjects (aged 23 (sd 3) years and BMI 22·0 (sd 1·9) kg/) were stratified in two groups. Each was offered two diets in a randomised cross-over design: group 1 (n 22) - normal protein (NP; 10, 60 and 30 % energy (En%) from protein, carbohydrate and fat), high protein (HP; 30, 40 and 30 En%); group 2 (n 23) - normal protein (NP-g; 10, 60 and 30 En%), high protein, carbohydrate-free (HP-0C; 30, 0 and 70 En%) for 2 d; NP-g and HP-0C were preceded by glycogen-lowering exercise (day 1). Appetite was measured throughout day 2 using visual analogue scales (VAS). Energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation (respiratory quotient; RQ) were measured in a respiration chamber (08.00 hours on day 2 until 07.30 hours on day 3). Fasting plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration was measured (day 3). NP-g and NP did not differ in hunger, EE, RQ and BHB. HP-0C and HP v. NP-g and NP, respectively, were lower in hunger (P < 0·05; P < 0·001) and RQ (P < 0·01; P < 0·001) and higher in EE (P < 0·05; P = 0·07) and BHB (P < 0·05; P < 0·001).

It has been well documented that butyrate, by serving as an energetic metabolite, promotes the proliferation of normal colonocytes while, by serving as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, epigenetically suppressing the proliferation of cancerous counterparts undergoing the Warburg effect. However, how butyrate interrupts the metabolism of colorectal cancer cells and ultimately leads to the suppression of cell proliferation remains unclear. Here, we employed a metabolomics-proteomics combined approach to explore the link between butyrate-mediated proliferation arrest and cell metabolism. A metabolomics study revealed a remodeled metabolic profile with pronounced accumulation of pyruvate, decreased glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate and reduced levels of nucleotides in butyrate-treated HCT-116 cells. Supplementation of key metabolite intermediates directly affected cancer-cell metabolism and modulated the suppressive effect of butyrate in HCT-116 cells. By a Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS)-based quantitative proteomics approach, we revealed the  isoform of a pyruvate kinase, PKM2, as a direct binding target of butyrate. Butyrate activates PKM2 via promoting its dephosphorylation and tetramerization and thereby reprograms the metabolism of colorectal cancer cells, inhibiting the Warburg effect while favoring energetic metabolism. Our study thus provides a mechanistic link between PKM2-induced metabolic remodeling and the antitumorigenic function of butyrate and demonstrates a widely applicable approach to uncovering unknown protein targets for small molecules with biological functions.© 2018 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20527162>[Concentrations and acidity contributions of acetate and formate in precipitation at 14 stations of China].</a></h2><p>To investigate the concentrations of organic  in precipitation in China and their contributions to the total acidity of precipitation, samples were taken at 14 stations of regional representativeness in 2007 and analyzed for acetate and formate using ion chromatography. In this paper, data of acetate and formate in precipitation at 14 stations are presented, wet depositions of these organic  are calculated, and contributions of them to the total free acidity (TFA) of precipitation are estimated. Based on the measurements, the mean concentrations of formate at different stations were in the range of 0.96-3.43 micromol/L, and those of acetate in the range of 0-5.13 micromol/L, close to the levels at remote sites in other countries and at the lower ends of concentration ranges from previous measurements in China. Comparisons indicate that the concentrations of the organic  at remote sites are lower than those at sites in the vicinity of urban areas. The annual wet depositions of formate and acetate were estimated to be in the ranges of 0.38-4.18 mmol/( x a) and 0.06-5.87 mmol/( x a), respectively, with larger depositions in southern China and smaller depositions in northern China. The relative contributions of the two organic  to the TFA of precipitation were estimated to be in the range of 0.02%-51.6%, with an overall average of 2.95%. This suggests that although acid rain in China is mainly caused by emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, organic  can significantly contribute to the acidification of precipitation in some regions and during some periods, hence need to be included in observational studies of acid rain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24350447>Integrated conversion of food waste diluted with sewage into  through fermentation and electricity through a fuel cell.</a></h2><p>In this study, domestic wastewater was given a second life as dilution medium for concentrated organic waste streams, in particular artificial food waste. A two-step continuous process with first   acid (VFA)/hydrogen production and second electricity production in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) was employed. For primary treatment, bioreactors were optimized to produce hydrogen and VFAs. Hydrolysis of the solids and formation of fermentation products and hydrogen was monitored. In the second step, MFCs were operated batch-wise using the effluent rich in VFAs specifically acetic acid from the continuous reactor of the first step. The combined system was able to reduce the chemical oxygen demand load by 90%. The concentration of VFAs was also monitored regularly in the MFCs and showed a decreasing trend over time. Further, the anode potential changed from -500 to OmV vs. Ag/AgCl when the VFAs (especially acetate) were depleted in the system. On feeding the system again with the effluent, the anode potential recovered back to -500 mV vs. Ag/AgCl.

Little is known, however, about bromoxynil exposure in humans. Results of previous research suggest a longer residence time in the body for bromoxynil compared to phenoxy herbicides [e.g., (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (2,4-D), 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA)] and that bromoxynil would tend to partition into  tissue more so than 2,4-D. In previous research, body mass index (BMI) was found to be an independent predictor of plasma concentrations of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), the persistent lipophilic metabolite of the chlorinated pesticide bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT). As part of the Prairie Ecosystem Study, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis was used to measure concentrations of bromoxynil and seven other herbicides (2,4-D, dicamba, fenoxaprop, MCPA, ethalfluralin, triallate, and trifluralin) in plasma from residents (104 men, 88 women, 24 youths age 12-17 yr) of a cereal-producing region in Saskatchewan, Canada, during spring herbicide application, 1996. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore whether BMI predicted detection of bromoxynil in plasma from the adults. The prevalence of detection (detection limits: 2-50 microg/L) was markedly higher for bromoxynil (men, 44.2%; women, 14.8%; youths, 20.8%) compared to each of the other herbicides including 2,4-D (men, 16.5%; women, 3.4%; youths, 12.5%) and MCPA (men, 6.8%; women, 1.1%; youths, 4.2%), although bromoxynil is commonly formulated or tank mixed with these herbicides. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the variables BMI, exposure group [bromoxynil applicators, non-applicator family members of bromoxynil applicators, all others (reference group)], and days elapsed since the last use of bromoxynil were found to be independent predictors of detection of bromoxynil, while age, gender, and farm residency were not statistically significant. With adjustment for exposure group [bromoxynil applicators: odds ratio (OR = 24.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.59-61.58; nonapplicator family members of bromoxynil applicators: OR = 3.53, 95% CI = 1.19-10.44; all others (reference group)], the OR for detection of bromoxynil was 2.35 (95% CI = 0.87-6.33) for participants in the middle (25.53-29.00 kg/) tertile (men: OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 0.75-10.82; women: OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.36-7.40) of BMI and 4.01 (95% CI = 1.46-11.03) for participants in the highest (> 29.00 kg/) tertile (men: OR = 4.67, 95% CI = 1.17-18.58; women: OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 0.44-10.99) with participants in the lowest (< 25.53 kg/) tertile as the reference group. Similar ORs were observed for BMI with adjustment for days elapsed since the last use of bromoxynil.

Experience from the Helsinki Heart Study.</a></h2><p>Coronary risk factors related to the insulin resistance syndrome tend to cluster in the same individual. Our previous studies have shown that the dyslipidemia characteristic of this syndrome--low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride (TG) levels--responds well to treatment with gemfibrozil. Most factors related to insulin-resistance syndrome decrease fibrinolytic capacity, whereas a recent study showed that gemfibrozil improves it and thus may attenuate thrombotic events. To discover whether subjects with clustering of factors related to this resistance might in particular benefit from gemfibrozil, we reanalyzed the Helsinki Heart Study data.We used Cox regression models to explore the effects of gemfibrozil among overweight subjects with additional coronary risk factors in this hypercholesterolemic male population of 2046 subjects randomized to gemfibrozil and 2035 to placebo. The effect of gemfibrozil was largely confined to overweight subjects: among those with body mass index (BMI) > 26 kg/, the net difference in cardiac end points between gemfibrozil and placebo groups was 21 (25 of 1119 versus 46 of 1081), and in those with BMI < or = 26 kg/, it was 7 (31 of 927 versus 38 of 954).

Among those with BMI > 26 kg/ and three or four of the following factors present--smoking, sedentary lifestyle, blood pressure > or = 140/90 mm Hg, or blood glucose > 4.4 mmol/L--the risk reduction was 68% (P = .03).Gemfibrozil reduced the coronary risk mainly in overweight subjects with additional risk factors known to contribute to the insulin-resistance syndrome or predispose to it.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10456757>Risk of excessive weight gain in epileptic children treated with valproate.</a></h2><p>We sought to identify factors associated with excessive weight gain in children treated with valproate, excluding patients fed by gastrostomy or treated with medications known to affect appetite (eg, stimulants). Weight and height were recorded before treatment and at the time of follow-up; a measure of adiposity, body mass index, was computed and expressed in kg/, and weight and height for age were converted to Z-score. Putative risk factors included sex, age at start of treatment, monotherapy at start of treatment, duration of follow-up, mental retardation, seizure type (generalized or partial), etiology (idiopathic or cryptogenic versus remote symptomatic), and dose of valproate. Fifty-five children (30 girls, 25 boys), ranging in age at the start of therapy from 1.8 to 16.9 years were followed for 8.6 to 33.8 months. Forty-three patients had primarily generalized seizures, 34 had idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy (including 30 with generalized idiopathic epilepsy), and 18 had mental retardation. Valproate was the first antiepileptic drug for 21 patients, and 43 were on monotherapy at the time of follow-up. Height Z-score decreased significantly in girls but was stable in boys. There was a significant increase in body mass index and in weight Z-score. Body mass index was greater than the 90th percentile for age in 14 patients at the start of treatment and in 20 patients at follow-up.

Histopathological examination revealed that hemorrhages were accompanied with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes both within and around the hemorrhages on the neck skin. Nodular glomerulosclerosis and many fat droplets in the cytoplasm of proximal tubule cells were found in the kidney. Postmortem blood analysis showed acetone (204.2 μg/ml), HbA1c (10.8%), acetoacetate (<2.0 μmol/l), 3-hydroxybutyrate (11,844 μmol/l), blood urea nitrogen (128.9 mg/dl), and creatinine (3.11 mg/dl). The glucose and acetone levels in the urine were 876.7 mg/dl and 201.4 μg/ml, respectively, suggesting that she suffered severe DKA. However, since hemorrhage of the neck could have developed only when she was still alive, asphyxia should have arisen antemortem. Based on these findings, we concluded that the direct cause of her death is positional asphyxia, which was resulted from DKA. It is difficult to diagnose the cause of death when the victim is in an unusual posture. To confirm a suspicion of positional asphyxia, photographs of the undisturbed scene are useful in addition to a precise autopsy and accurate examinations.2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A repeated-measures, randomized, crossover study was conducted in nine trained male cyclists (age, 26.7 ± 5.2 years; body mass, 69.6 ± 8.4 kg; height, 1.82 ± 0.09 m; body mass index, 21.2 ± 1.5 kg/; VO2peak,63.9 ± 2.5 ml·kg-1·min-1; Wmax, 389.3 ± 50.4 W). Participants ingested 0.35 g/kg of BD or placebo 30 min before and 60 min during 85 min of steady-state exercise, which preceded a ∼25- to 35-min TT (i.e., 7 kJ/kg). The ingestion of BD increased blood D-βHB concentration throughout exercise (0.44-0.79 mmol/L) compared with placebo (0.11-0.16 mmol/L; all p < .001), which peaked 1 hr following the TT (1.38 ± 0.35 vs. 0.34 ± 0.24 mmol/L; p < .001). Serum glucose and blood lactate concentrations were not different between trials (all p > .05). BD ingestion increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production after 20 min of steady-state exercise (p = .002 and p = .032, respectively); however, no further effects on cardiorespiratory parameters were observed. Within the BD trial, moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in five participants, and low levels of dizziness, nausea, and euphoria were reported in two participants. However, this had no effect on TT duration (placebo, 28.5 ± 3.6 min; BD, 28.7 ± 3.2 min; p = .62) and average power output (placebo, 290.1 ± 53.7 W; BD, 286.4 ± 45.9 W; p = .50). These results suggest that BD has no benefit for endurance performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27208988>Effect of adsorbent particle size on the relative merits of a non-triangular and a triangular separation region in the optimal design of a three-zone simulated moving bed chromatography for binary separation with linear isotherms.</a></h2><p>The design approaches for a three-zone simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography with linear isotherms can be classified into two categories, depending on whether the SMB design is based on a classical region (i.e., triangular region of the triangle theory) in the first quadrant (, m3) plane or on a non-triangular separation region in the third quadrant (, m3) plane. The SMBs based on the classical and the non-triangular design approaches, which are named here as (m(+))_SMB and (m(-))_SMB respectively, are compared in this study using the Pareto solutions from the simultaneous optimization of throughput and desorbent usage under the constraints on product purities and pressure drop. The results showed that the (m(-))_SMB approach led to significantly lower desorbent usage than the (m(+))_SMB approach, which was due to the fact that the flow-rate-ratios from the (m(-))_SMB approach are extremely lower than those from the (m(+))_SMB approach. This factor also enables the (m(-))_SMB to have a significantly lower pressure drop, thereby making its throughput less restricted by a pressure-drop constraint. Due to such advantage of the (m(-))_SMB, it can make a further substantial improvement in throughput by modulating its adsorbent particle size properly. This issue was investigated using a model separation system containing succinic acid and acetic acid. It was confirmed that if the adsorbent particle size corresponding to the boundary between a mass-transfer limiting region and a pressure-drop limiting region is adopted, the (m(-))_SMB can lead to 82% higher throughput and 73% lower desorbent usage than the (m(+))_SMB.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The plant had been designed to achieve at least 75% nitrogen removal. NH4-N input concentration was 240 (median) up to 290 mgl(-1) and COD concentration was 455 to 511 mgl(-1), respectively. A 14  vertical flow sand filter plus a 14  horizontal flow sand filter followed by a 3.3  vertical flow sand filter was chosen. Acetic acid was added to the horizontal flow system for denitrification. The results showed a very stable nitrification rate within the vertical flow system of 94% (median) at NH4-N loading rates of about 10 (median) up to 17 gm(-2)d(-1). Denitrification was mainly dependent on the dosing of acetic acid and could reach a maximum of 98%. One interesting effect was the production of nitrite in the horizontal flow sand filter. This could efficiently be eliminated by the subsequent vertical flow sand filter. The chosen concept proved to be very effective for nitrogen removal. In combination with a final activated carbon filter the COD effluent concentrations could be easily and safely controlled. The design of denitrification reed beds showed a further potential for optimization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1900343>Impaired activation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is unrelated to the degree of obesity.</a></h2><p>Twenty-five newly presenting, untreated, white, non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects were studied within 72 hours of diagnosis. They were allocated to three groups according to their body mass index [BMI] (lean BMI less than 25.0, n = 9; overweight BMI 25.0 to 30.0, n = 6; obese BMI greater than .30.0 kg/, n = 10). All three groups exhibited equivalent hyperglycemia. Eleven normal control subjects were also studied. The degree of activation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (GS) was used as an intracellular marker of insulin action, before and during a 240-minute insulin infusion (100 mU/kg/h). Fractional GS activity did not increase in the lean (change, -0.9 +/- 3.3%), the overweight (-1.9 +/- 2.7%), or the obese (+2.2 +/- 1.6%) NIDDM subjects during the insulin infusion and was markedly decreased compared with the control subjects (change, +14.6 +/- 2.4%, all P less than .001). Glucose requirement was also significantly decreased in all three NIDDM groups (103 +/- 23 v 81 +/- 14 v 53 +/- 14 mg//min, respectively) compared with the control subjects (319 +/- 18 mg//min, all P less than .001). There was a significant negative correlation with BMI (r = -.51, P less than .01), but the difference in glucose requirement between the lean and obese NIDDM groups was not significant. Muscle GS activity at the end of the euglycemic clamp correlated with glucose requirement (r = .53, P less than .001), and a similar correlation was observed between the insulin-induced change in muscle GS activity from basal and glucose requirement (r = .47, P less than .005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8809644>Clearance of phenytoin and valproic acid is affected by a small body weight reduction in an epileptic obese patient: a case study.</a></h2><p>The interaction between clearance of phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital and carbamazepine, and changes in body weight was determined in a 19-year-old obese woman with epilepsy (body weight 93 kg, BMI 36.3 kg/).

Zinc was readily acquired by all HAP samples in the absence of added calcium, the amount adsorbed being proportional to the HAP surface area; about 9 mumol Zn/ was adsorbed at high zinc concentrations. As zinc was acquired, calcium was released, consistent with 1:1 Ca:Zn exchange. Soluble calcium reduced zinc uptake and similarly, calcium post-treatment released zinc. Pretreatment of HAP with 0.5 mM zinc reduced its subsequent ability to undergo seeded crystal growth, as did extracts of a toothpaste containing 0.5% zinc citrate, even in the presence of saliva. The reverse reaction, i.e. displacement of adsorbed zinc by salivary levels of calcium, however, indicates the mechanism by which zinc can reduce calculus formation in vivo by inhibiting plaque mineralisation without adversely affecting the anti-caries effects of fluoride.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8808764>Effect of gemfibrozil on levels of lipoprotein[a] in type II hyperlipoproteinemic subjects.</a></h2><p>Plasma lipoprotein[a] (Lp[a]) levels are highly correlated with angiographically demonstrable coronary heart disease, and elevated Lp[a] is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Previous studies have provided evidence that the levels of Lp[a] and triglyceride are related, suggesting that Lp[a] might be altered by gemfibrozil, a drug well known for its efficacy in reducing plasma triglycerides. Accordingly, 18 type IIa and 16 type IIb hyperlipoproteinemic males aged 35-58 were treated for 3 months with 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily. The efficacy of the drug in altering lipid and lipoprotein levels was different in the two type groups. In type IIa and IIb subjects the respective changes in median levels were: total cholesterol, -7.5 and -8.5% triglycerides, -35.6 and -54.4%; HDL-cholesterol, +9.0 and +11.0%; and Lp[a], -17.2 and +6.1%. Before and after gemfibrozil treatment, 7 type IIa and 10 type IIB subjects were given a 100 g/2  oral-fat load; triglycerides and Lp[a] were measured post-prandially at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h. The differences between before- and after-gemfibrozil post-prandial curve integrated areas (PPCIA) were compared for triglycerides and Lp[a]. The changes in median PPCIA for triglycerides in types IIa and IIB were -54% and -53%, and for Lp[a] were -8% and +8%, respectively. These results indicate i) that the levels of Lp[a] are about 2 times higher in type IIa than IIb subjects, and ii) that although gemfibrozil elicits a rather uniform decrease in fasting and post-prandial triglyceride levels in type IIa and IIb patients, the drug causes heterogeneous changes in Lp[a], suggesting that different metabolic mechanisms may be dominant in subjects showing opposing effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625656>A pilot study of vitamin E versus vitamin E and pioglitazone for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We conducted a pilot study for the following reasons: (1) to test the hypothesis that a combination of an antioxidant (vitamin E) and an insulin sensitizer (pioglitazone) would be superior to vitamin E alone for the treatment of NASH, and (2) to define the effects of these interventions on insulin-sensitive metabolic functions and correlate the effects with changes in liver histology.A randomized prospective trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of vitamin E alone (400 IU/day) vs. vitamin E (400 IU/day) and pioglitazone (30 mg/day) in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic subjects with NASH. Metabolic functions were assessed by a 2-step, hyperinsulinemic (10 and 40 mU//min) euglycemic clamp.A total of 10 patients were randomized to each arm. Two patients on combination therapy discontinued treatment; one because of pregnancy and the other because of hepatotoxicity. Treatment with vitamin E only produced a significant decrease in steatosis (mean grade, 2.2 vs. 1.4; P < .02). Compared with baseline, combination therapy produced a significant decrease in steatosis (mean, 2.3 vs. 1; P < .002), cytologic ballooning (1.3 vs. 0.2; P < .01), Mallory's hyaline (0.7 vs. 0.2; P < .04), and pericellular fibrosis (1.2 vs. 0.6; P < .03). Although vitamin E had no significant effects, combination therapy produced a significant increase in metabolic clearance of glucose and a decrease in fasting free  acid (FFA) and insulin. The decrease in fasting FFA and insulin independently predicted improvement in hepatic steatosis and cytologic ballooning.A combination of vitamin E and pioglitazone produces a greater improvement in NASH histology. The improvement in steatosis and cytologic ballooning are related to treatment-associated decreases in fasting FFA and insulin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24028030>[Preparation of PVA-SA-PHB-AC composite carrier and m-cresol biodegradation by immobilized Lysinibacillus cresolivorans].</a></h2><p>Due to the effects of outer environment and concentration limit on the biodegradation of m-cresol, a carrier with adsorption ability was synthesized. A PVA-SA-PHB-AC composite membrane was prepared by adding SA, PHB and AC into PVA immobilization carrier using the combination of freezing-thawing and boric acid methods. A highly-effective m-cresol-degrading strain Lysinibacillus cresolivorans was entrapped in it and the effects of structural properties such as micro-structure, stability and diffusion coefficient on m-cresol biodegradation were investigated. The results showed that PVA-SA-PHB-AC composite membrane had uniform pore opening, of which the average pore size, specific surface area, m-cresol adsorption capacity and diffusion coefficient was 33.68 nm, 15.30  x g(-1), 3.86 mg x g(-1) and 5.62 x 10(-8)  x min(-1), respectively. It could be reused for more than two months, m-Cresol removal by immobilized L. cresolivorans was the coupling of adsorption and biodegradation, and the removal rate was jointly determined by mass-transfer rate and biodegradation rate. When the initial concentration of m-cresol was lower than 350 mg x L(-1), the mass-transfer rate of PVA-SA-PHB-AC was smaller than the biodegradation rate. The m-cresol removal rate depended on the mass-transfer rate, when the concentration was higher than 380 mg x L(-1), it was determined by the biodegradation rate. The addition of adsorbent could decrease the mass transfer coefficient in the carrier, while the higher concentration of substrate could be tolerated and the efficient biodegradation could be achieved in a wider range of concentrations. The biodegradation of m-cresol by immobilized microorganism showed that the modified carrier increased the reaction kinetics in a range of initial concentrations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16117104>Photodegradation of common environmental pharmaceuticals and estrogens in river water.</a></h2><p>Photodegradation rates of five pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and propranolol) and of four estrogens (estriol, estrone [E1], 17beta-estradiol [E2], and 17alpha-ethinylestradiol [EE2]), which are common contaminants in the aquatic environment, were measured in both purified and river water at environmentally relevant concentrations (1-2 microg/L) and different oxygen concentrations. Solutions were irradiated with a xenon arc lamp (765 W/; 290 nm < lambda < 700 nm) and analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method with electrospray ionization for pharmaceuticals and atmospheric pressure photoionization for estrogens. In river water, half-lives were 4.1 min [corrected] for ketoprofen, 1.1 h [corrected] for propranolol, 1.4 h for naproxen, 2 to 3 h for estrogens, and 15 h for gemfibrozil and ibuprofen. In air-saturated purified water, rates generally were slower except for that of ketoprofen, which reacted with a half-life of 2.5 min. Naproxen, propranolol, and E1 reacted with half-lives of 1.9, 4.4, and 4.7 h, respectively. The EE2, estriol, E2, gemfibrozil, and ibuprofen reacted with half-lives of 28.4, 38.2, 41.7, 91.4, and 205 h, respectively.

The mushroom samples taken at all three consecutive production flushes following single or split applications of the fungicides were extracted with solvents and the residues were determined by using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). Recoveries from the fortified control samples ranged from 87 to 105%. Following drench applications at 0.1-1 g/ of culture bed area, the highest famoxadone residue determined in basidiocarps was 0.1447 mg/kg. Analysis of trifloxystrobin revealed a quantitative relationship between the application rate (0.8-1.8 g/) and the residue levels of both the parent compound and its acid metabolite. The maximal combined residues of trifloxystrobin and its metabolite were 0.1313 mg/kg. Short- and long-term dietary risk assessment for both fungicides was carried out using consumption data from World Health Organization and the UK Pesticide Safety Directorate's Ten Consumer Model.

There was no difference in the two diabetic groups in age (FCPD 24 +/- 2, IDDM 21 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SEM), BMI (FCPD 16.0 +/- 0.6, IDDM 15.7 +/- 0.4 kg/), triceps skinfold thickness (FCPD 8 +/- 1, IDDM 7 +/- 1 mm), glycaemic status (fasting plasma glucose, FCPD 12.5 +/- 1.5, IDDM 14.5 +/- 1.2 mmol/l), fasting plasma C-peptide (FCPD 0.13 +/- 0.03, IDDM 0.08 +/- 0.01 nmol/l), peak plasma C-peptide during OGTT (FCPD 0.36 +/- 0.10, IDDM 0.08 +/- 0.03 nmol/l) and fasting plasma glucagon (FCPD 35 +/- 4, IDDM 37 +/- 4 ng/l). FCPD patients, however, showed lower circulating concentrations of non-esterified   (0.73 +/- 0.11 mmol/l), glycerol (0.11 +/- 0.02 mmol/l) and 3-hydroxybutyrate (0.15 +/- 0.03 mmol/l) compared to IDDM patients (1.13 +/- 0.14, 0.25 +/- 0.05 and 0.29 +/- 0.08 mmol/l, respectively). This could be due to enhanced sensitivity of adipose tissue lipolysis to the suppressive action of circulating insulin and possibly also to insensitivity of hepatic ketogenesis to glucagon.

The aim of the study was to examine whether IGF-I alters the metabolic response to a GH pulse. Seven healthy male subjects (age 27 +/- 4 years, BMI 21.8 +/- 1.7 kg/) were treated with NaCl 0.9% (saline) or IGF-I (8 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) for 5 days by continuous subcutaneous infusion in a randomized, crossover fashion while receiving an isocaloric diet (30 kcal.kg-1.day-1). On the third treatment day an intravenous bolus of 0.5 U GH was administered. Forearm muscle metabolism was examined by measuring arterialized and deep venous blood samples, forearm blood flow by occlusion plethysmography and substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry. IGF-I treatment significantly reduced insulin concentrations by 80% (p < 0.02) and C-peptide levels by 78% (p < 0.02), as assessed by area under the curve. Non-esterified  acid (NEFA), glycerol and 3-OH-butyrate levels were elevated and alanine concentration decreased. Forearm blood flow rose from 2.10 +/- 0.43 (saline) to 2.79 +/- 0.37 ml.100ml-1. min-1 (IGF-I) (p < 0.02). GH-pulse: 10 h after i.v. GH injection serum GH peaked at 40.9 +/- 7.4 ng/ml. GH did not influence circulating levels of total IGF-I, C-peptide, insulin or glucose, but caused a further increase in NEFA, glycerol and 3-OH-butyrate levels, indicating enhanced lipolysis and ketogenesis. This effect of GH was much more pronounced during IGF-I: NEFA rose from 702 +/- 267 (saline) and 885 +/- 236 (IGF-I) to 963 +/- 215 (saline) (p < 0.05) and 1815 +/- 586 mumol/l (IGF-I) (p < 0.02), respectively; after 5 h, 3-OH-butyrate rose from 242 +/- 234 (saline) and 340 +/- 280 (IGF-I) to 678 +/- 638 (saline) (p < 0.02) and 1115 +/- 578 mumol/l (IGF-I) (p < 0.02) respectively. After injection of GH, forearm uptake of 3-OH-butyrate was markedly elevated only in the subjects treated with IGF-I: from 44 +/- 195 to 300 +/- 370 after 20 min (p < 0.03) and to 287 +/- 91 nmol.100 ml-1. min-1 after 120 min (p < 0.02).

In melanoma, it has been previously shown that variable levels of MCP-1/CCL2 appear to correlate with infiltrating macrophages and tumor fate, with low to intermediate levels of the chemokine contributing to melanoma development. To work under such conditions, a poorly tumorigenic human melanoma cell line was transfected with an expression vector encoding MCP-1. We found that  macrophages are associated to MCP-1+ tumors, triggering a profuse vascular network. To target the protumoral macrophages recruitment and reverting tumor growth promotion, clodronate-laden liposomes (Clod-Lip) or bindarit were administered to melanoma-bearing mice. Macrophage depletion after Clod-Lip treatment induced development of smaller tumors than in untreated mice. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-CD31 antibody revealed scarce vascular structures mainly characterized by narrow vascular lights. Pharmacological inhibition of MCP-1 with bindarit also reduced tumor growth and macrophage recruitment, rendering necrotic tumor masses. We suggest that bindarit or Clod-Lip abrogates protumoral-associated macrophages in human melanoma xenografts and could be considered as complementary approaches to antiangiogenic therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23570552>Retention and release of cinnamaldehyde from wheat protein matrices.</a></h2><p>Cinnamaldehyde treatment of gliadin films provided a means of decreasing their solubility, increasing their molecular weight profile, and reducing their overall migration into food simulants as a consequence of the high degree of polymerization achieved. Despite losses incurred in the film manufacturing process, and the amount that remained covalently bonded with protein because of cross-linking, the addition of 1.5, 3, and 5% of cinnamaldehyde (g/100 g protein) to gliadins at pH 2 rendered 1.8, 4.8, and 11.0 mg cinnamaldehyde/g film, respectively, available to be released, and therefore to exert antimicrobial activity. Cinnamaldehyde diffusivity was largely dependent on environmental conditions, increasing from 0.49×10(-15) /s at 30% relative humidity (RH) to 13.1×10(-15) /s at 90% RH and 23 °C. This water sensitivity of films provides a mechanism with a noteworthy potential to retain the compound before its use, to trigger its release when needed, and to modulate the release rate according to the product humidity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28551188>Regulatory effect of dietary intake of chromium propionate on the response of monocyte-derived macrophages from Holstein cows in mid lactation.</a></h2><p>Chromium (Cr) has been reported to enhance immune function and improve insulin sensitivity and performance in beef and dairy cattle. However, its effect on bovine macrophage inflammatory and metabolic response is unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of dietary Cr on the inflammatory and metabolic response of polarized macrophages ex vivo. Twelve primiparous and 16 multiparous healthy Holstein cows in mid lactation (143 ± 37 d in milk) were enrolled in this study. Cows were fed a common total mixed ration once per day that was top-dressed with 200 g of ground corn containing 1 of 2 dietary treatments: control (CTL, no Cr supplementation) or Cr propionate (CrP, 8 mg of Cr/cow per day) for 35 d. At d 1, 17, and 35 of treatment, blood monocytes were isolated and cultured to obtain 3 monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) phenotypes: M0 (non-polarized), M1 (pro-inflammatory; IFN-γ polarized) and  (anti-inflammatory; IL-4 polarized). The experiment was set in a randomized complete block design. Neither dry matter intake nor milk yield was affected by treatment. Plasma concentrations of metabolites and the metabolic and inflammatory response of MDM in spent media were not affected by treatment. Neither the whole blood cell population nor the specific proportion of leukocytes was affected by the main effect of treatment. However, we did observe a trend for fewer circulating neutrophils in cows fed CrP than in cows fed CTL for 35 d, which may be partly attributable to a greater influx of neutrophils into peripheral tissues, a reduced pro-inflammatory response during disease, or both; this warrants future study. Expression of IGFI was increased in MDM-M0, and expression of CXCL11 tended to increase in MDM- from cows fed CrP compared with cows fed CTL. Expression of SLC2A3 also tended to increase in MDM- from cows fed CrP compared with cows fed CTL at 17 d. Our results suggest that CrP has minimal effect on the inflammatory and metabolic response of MDM for Holstein dairy cows in mid lactation. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the differential regulation of Cr on the inflammatory and metabolic response of leukocytes from dairy cows at different stages of lactation and parity.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

IMCL-(CH2)n/water and IMCL-(CH2)n/total creatine ratios increased from 0.00623 +/- 0.00065 to 0.0142 +/- 0.0015 (P = 0.002) and 6.82 +/- 0.87 to 14.96 +/- 1.73 (P = 0.001), respectively. Plasma free  acid (FFA), serum triglyceride, and whole blood 3-hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased (P < 0.001, <0.05, <0.03, respectively), whereas plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations decreased (both P < 0.001) during fasting. In conclusion, 72-h water-only fasting produces a large increase in plasma FFA concentration, a drop in serum insulin concentration, and accumulation of IMCL in the vastus lateralis muscle of nondiabetic, physically fit men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186174>Impact of epilepsy and antiepileptic medications on the metabolic profile in adults with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities.</a></h2><p>Epilepsy is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). Antiepileptic medications, such as valproic acid (VPA), were associated with changes in BMI, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hyperinsulinemia. This study aimed to investigate how epilepsy and antiepileptic treatments affect BMI, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and total cholesterol of individuals with ASD or ID. Data on epilepsy diagnoses, treatment with VPA, carbamazepine or other antiepileptics, BMI, FBG, and total cholesterol levels were obtained from the medical charts of 80 adults with ASD and 77 adults with ID and analyzed using appropriate statistical tools. Participants with epilepsy had lower BMI and FBG than participants without epilepsy (BMI: 23.18 ± 5.43 vs. 25.61 ± 5.74 kg/, respectively, F = 6.64, d.f. = 1.140; P = 0.011, FBG: 72.53 ± 11.26 vs. 79.98 ± 14.64 mg/dl, respectively, F = 10.46, d.f. = 1.135 P = 0.002). Those treated with VPA had lower total cholesterol levels compared with those untreated (156.56 ± 26.13 vs. 172.42 ± 33.82 mg/dl, respectively, F = 7.44, d.f. = 1.150; P = 0.007), but did not differ in BMI and FBG. Individuals with ASD or ID, and epilepsy were leaner and had lower FBG than those without epilepsy. In addition, total cholesterol levels were lower in VPA-treated participants than in untreated ones, but BMI and FBG levels were similar.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313735>Spatial uniformity of microbial diversity in a continuous bioelectrochemical system.</a></h2><p>Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are emerging as a technology with diverse future applications. Anode-associated microbial diversity and activity are known to change over time, but the consequences of these dynamics on BES functioning are poorly understood. A novel BES with exchangeable anodic electrodes that facilitates characterisation of microbial communities over time was constructed. The BES, received a mixture of  and produced 0.13 mA cm(-2) of anodic electrode surface, leading to the removal of 14 g chemical oxygen demand per  electrode per day at a coulombic efficiency of 76%. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed no differences in the diversity of microbial communities associated with different electrodes within a single time point. This finding validates the design for temporal studies as changes in microbial diversity observed over time can be related to community development rather than spatial variation within the reactor.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the LOCAT Study. Lopid Coronary Angiography Trial.</a></h2><p>Several clinical trials have shown that reducing serum cholesterol levels retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis assessed by serial angiography. By contrast, as yet no studies have addressed the impact of increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels on progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). As HDL cholesterol is inversely related to the risk of CAD, we hypothesize that an intervention that raises low HDL cholesterol concentrations may have a beneficial effect on the course of CAD. Lopid Coronary Angiography Trial (LOCAT) was designed to test this hypothesis. Three hundred and ninety-five men, aged < or = 70 years, all of whom had previously undergone coronary bypass surgery, were randomly assigned to receive either slow-release gemfibrozil, 1200 mg once daily, or a matching placebo for on average 2 1/2 years. The lipid inclusion criteria were HDL cholesterol concentration < or = 1.1 mmol/L, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol < or = 4.5 mmol/L, and serum triglyceride < or = 4.0 mmol/L. Subjects were not accepted if they had manifest diabetes, body mass index > 30 kg/, uncontrolled hypertension, or if they were regular smokers. All randomized subjects underwent baseline coronary angiography, which will be repeated at the end of the study. The angiograms will be analyzed using the Cardiovascular Measurement System, a validated computer-assisted image-analysis and quantitation package. The primary endpoints are the changes in the per-patient mean of 1) the average diameter of evaluable native coronary segments, and 2) the minimal luminal diameter of evaluable stenoses, and 3) the appearance of new lesions. Extensive lipoprotein and other metabolic studies and analyses of genetic polymorphisms are carried out to study the determinants of CAD progression. At baseline, the study subjects were 59.1 +/- 6.8 (mean +/- standard deviation) years old, had a body mass index 26.4 +/- 2.2 kg/, and serum triglyceride, serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol concentrations 1.64 +/- 0.64, 5.17 +/- 0.64, 0.82 +/- 0.14, and 3.61 +/- 0.53 mmol/L, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7842770>Inhaled diuretics attenuate acid-induced cough in children with asthma.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of inhaled diuretics, furosemide and amiloride, on cough induced by acid inhalation challenge in asthmatic children, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted. On separate days, 12 asthmatic children (10.3 +/- 0.7 [SEM] years) underwent acetic acid (AD) inhalation challenge after inhalation of furosemide (10 mg/ of body) amiloride (0.3 mg/ of body), or placebo (0.9% saline solution). Bronchoconstriction was not observed after administration of furosemide and amiloride. Both inhaled furosemide and amiloride exerted a protective effect against AA-induced cough in asthmatic children (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), while there was little correlation between the individual protective potency of furosemide and amiloride against AA-induced cough (rs = 0.344, p = 0.255). These results demonstrate that both furosemide and amiloride can attenuate AA-induced cough, although, this protective effect of inhaled diuretics may not necessarily be dependent on Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransporter or Na+ channel in airway epithelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11349847>Fate and kinetics of carfentrazone-ethyl herbicide in California, USA, flooded rice fields.</a></h2><p>Little is known of the environmental fate of the aryltriazolinone herbicide carfentrazone-ethyl (compound I). Rice field applications of Shark 40D commercial formulation to duplicate 5.7  rings (119 g a.i./ha) and 464  commercial basins (224 g a.i./ha) produced pseudo-first-order half-lives (t1/2) of 6.5 to 11.1 h in water and 37.9 to 174 h in sediment. The rapid dissipation from water was due to its hydrolysis to the chloropropionic acid (compound II), which further degraded to its propionic, cinnamic, and benzoic . Compound I degraded similarly in soil, but propionic and cinnamic acid levels were higher. Compound I was only weakly adsorbed, but lateral movement of compound II through soil occurred. Laboratory hydrolysis produced quantitative yields of compound II, t1/2 values of 131 h at pH 7 and 3.36 h at pH 9, and slow dissipation at pH 5 (43% at 830 h). Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of compound I in pH 7 buffer gave dissipation rates similar to those in dark controls (t1/2 113 h vs 128 h), while compound II was comparatively stable to photolysis (t1/2 765 h) and also did not volatilize from water. Ester hydrolysis followed by off-site movement of the acid (compound II) account for the dissipation of compound I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28767045>Acetic acid and pepsin result in high yield, high purity and low macrophage response collagen for biomedical applications.</a></h2><p>Collagen based devices are frequently associated with foreign body response. Although several pre- (e.g. species, state of animal, tissue) and post- (e.g. cross-linking, scaffold architecture) extraction method factors have a profound effect on foreign body response, little is known about which and how during the extraction process factors mediate foreign body response. In this study, we assessed the influence of acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the utilisation or not of pepsin or salt precipitation during collagen extraction on the yield, purity, free amines, denaturation temperature, resistance to collagenase degradation and macrophage response. Acetic acid/pepsin extracted collagen exhibited the highest yield, purity and free amine content and the lowest denaturation temperature. No differences in resistance to collagenase digestion were detected between the groups. Although all treatments exhibited similar macrophage morphology comprised of round cells (M1 phenotype), elongated cells ( phenotype) and cell aggregates (foreign body response), significantly more elongated cells were observed on HC films. Although no differences in metabolic activity were observed between the groups, the DNA concentration was significantly lower for the hydrochloric acid treatments. Further, cytokine analysis revealed that hydrochloric acid treatments induced significantly higher IL-1β and TNF-α release with respect to acetic acid treatments. Salt precipitation did not influence the parameters assessed. Collectively, these data suggest that during the collagen extraction process variables should also be monitored as, evidently, they affect the physicochemical and biological properties of collagen preparations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25889021>Attenuation of inflammatory and neuropathic pain behaviors in mice through activation of free  acid receptor GPR40.</a></h2><p>The G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) is suggested to function as a transmembrane receptor for medium- to long-chain free   and is implicated to play a role in free  -mediated enhancement of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreas. However, the functional role of GPR40 in nervous system including somatosensory pain signaling has not been fully examined yet.Intrathecal injection of GPR40 agonist (MEDICA16 or GW9508) dose-dependently reduced ipsilateral mechanical allodynia in CFA and SNL models and thermal hyperalgesia in carrageenan model. These anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects were almost completely reversed by a GPR40 antagonist, GW1100. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GPR40 is expressed in spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglion neurons, and immunoblot analysis showed that carrageenan or CFA inflammation or spinal nerve injury resulted in increased expression of GPR40 in these areas. Patch-clamp recordings from spinal cord slices exhibited that bath-application of either MEDICA16 or GW9508 significantly decreased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in the substantia gelatinosa neurons of the three pain models.Our results indicate that GPR40 signaling pathway plays an important suppressive role in spinal nociceptive processing after inflammation or nerve injury, and that GPR40 agonists might serve as a new class of analgesics for treating inflammatory and neuropathic pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24611010>Fabrication of nanoadjuvant with poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) for developing a single-shot vaccine providing prolonged immunity.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to load a model antigen, tetanus toxoid (TT), in poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (PCL NPs) of two size ranges, ie, mean 61.2 nm (small) and 467.6 nm (large), and study its effect on macrophage polarization as well as antigen presentation in human monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro, along with humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) response generated in Swiss albino mice following immunization with the TT-loaded NPs.PCL NPs were synthesized by solvent evaporation. The antigen-loaded PCL NPs were characterized for size, zeta potential, and protein-release kinetics. Swiss albino mice were immunized with the antigen-loaded PCL NPs. Flow cytometry was used to quantify interferon-γ- and interleukin-4-secreting cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify anti-TT antibody levels in the serum of immunized mice.Small PCL NPs generated an M1/ type polarization of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and T helper (Th)1/Th2 polarization of autologous CD4(+) T cells. Efficient CD8(+) T-cell responses were also elicited. Large PCL NPs failed to cause any type of macrophage polarization. They did not elicit efficient CD8(+) T-cell responses.TT-loaded small PCL NPs were able to generate persistent and strong CMI and humoral responses against TT 2 months after single injection in mice without booster dose. This biodegradable nanoadjuvant system may help to develop single-shot immunization for prolonged immunity without booster doses.

Many of these compounds are involved in inborn errors of metabolism. In the present study, we examined the potential of proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy as a tool to identify and quantify N-acetylated metabolites in urine of patients with various inborn errors of metabolism.We performed (1)H-NMR spectroscopy on a 500 MHz spectrometer. Using a combination of one- and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (COSY) (1)H-NMR spectra, we were able to assign and quantify resonances of characteristic N-acetylated compounds products in urine of patients with 13 inborn errors of metabolism.The disease-specific N-acetylated metabolites were excreted at concentrations >100 micromol/mmol of creatinine in the patients' urine. In control urine samples, the concentration of individual N-acetyl-containing compounds was <40 micromol/mmol of creatinine. The combination of one- and two-dimensional COSY NMR spectroscopy led to the correct diagnosis of nine different inborn errors of metabolism. No abnormalities were observed in the spectra of urine from patients with G(M1)- or G()-gangliosidosis. We also determined the (1)H-NMR characteristics of N-acetylated metabolites that may be relevant to human metabolism.(1)H-NMR spectroscopy may be used to identify and quantify N-acetylated metabolites of diagnostic importance for the field of inborn errors of metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261817>Use of Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation products in bread-making to prevent Bacillus subtilis ropy spoilage.</a></h2><p>Four fermentation products (FPs) of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum ITM21B were screened for their anti-Bacillus activity in vitro and in bread-making trials. Results of the storage tests performed with loaves prepared with an FP or calcium propionate demonstrated that after 3 days at 30 degrees C, gross spoilage was evident in only the control loaves, which contained Bacillus subtilis at numbers of about 10(9) cfu/g. The highest inhibitory activity was shown by DM-FP obtained by growing L. plantarum in a defined medium (DM). Significantly, this medium contained an amino acceptor of the aminoacid transamination, namely alpha-ketoglutaric acid, and an aminoacid pool. With loaves prepared using the DM-acid mixture which simulated the DM-FP composition, the same reduction of ropy spoilage as with DM-FP was obtained after 3 days, while the efficacy of the mixture decreased after 7 days. This result suggests the potential involvement of some unknown metabolites in the inhibitory activity of DM-FP. In baked products made with flour based media (M1-FP, -FP, M3-FP), no ropy symptoms were noticeable after 3 days storage although a considerable Bacillus count was detected. DM-FP was as effective as calcium propionate (0.3% w/w, based on flour mass) in prolonging the Bacillus free-shelf life of yeast-leavened bread for 7 days.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15301879>Phase II trial of the histone deacetylase inhibitor pivaloyloxymethyl butyrate (Pivanex, AN-9) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>This multicenter phase II trial evaluated the therapeutic activity and safety profile of pivaloyloxymethyl butyrate (Pivanex, AN-9) as a single agent in refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Pivanex (2.34 g/ per day) was administered as a 6-h continuous intravenous infusion, daily for 3 days, and repeated every 21 days until disease progression. Forty-seven patients were treated. More than 90% of patients had received both a platinum compound and a taxane and 32% had received three or more prior chemotherapy regimens. The most common toxicities were transient grade 1-2 fatigue (34%), nausea (17%), and dysgeusia (11%). Three patients had partial responses (6.4 and 95%; CI 1.4-18.7%) and 14 patients had stable disease for > or =12 weeks (30%). Median survival for all patients was 6.2 months with 1-year survival of 26%. For patients who received fewer than three prior chemotherapy regimens, median survival was 7.8 months and 1-year survival was 31%. Pivanex is well tolerated and appears to be active as a single agent in patients with advanced NSCLC refractory to previous chemotherapy. Based on its therapeutic activity and favorable safety profile, further studies of Pivanex in NSCLC, particularly in combination with current chemotherapeutic agents, are warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24551115>Ovariectomy and subsequent treatment with estrogen receptor agonists tune the innate immune system of the hippocampus in middle-aged female rats.</a></h2><p>The innate immune system including microglia has a major contribution to maintenance of the physiological functions of the hippocampus by permanent monitoring of the neural milieu and elimination of tissue-damaging threats. The hippocampus is vulnerable to age-related changes ranging from gene expression to network connectivity. The risk of hippocampal deterioration increases with the decline of gonadal hormone supply. To explore the impact of hormone milieu on the function of the innate immune system in middle-aged female rats, we compared mRNA expression in the hippocampus after gonadal hormone withdrawal, with or without subsequent estrogen replacement using estradiol and isotype-selective estrogen receptor (ER) agonists. Targeted profiling assessed the status of the innate immune system (macrophage-associated receptors, complement, inhibitory neuronal ligands), local estradiol synthesis (P450 aromatase) and estrogen reception (ER). Results established upregulation of macrophage-associated (Cd45, Iba1, Cd68, Cd11b, Cd18, Fcgr1a, Fcgr2b) and complement (C3, factor B, properdin) genes in response to ovariectomy. Ovariectomy upregulated Cd22 and downregulated semaphorin3A (Sema3a) expression, indicating altered neuronal regulation of microglia. Ovariectomy also led to downregulation of aromatase and upregulation of ERα gene. Of note, analogous changes were observed in the hippocampus of postmenopausal women. In ovariectomized rats, estradiol replacement attenuated Iba1, Cd11b, Fcgr1a, C3, increased mannose receptor Mrc1, Cd163 and reversed Sema3a expression. In contrast, reduced expression of aromatase was not reversed by estradiol. While the effects of ERα agonist closely resembled those of estradiol, ERβ agonist was also capable of attenuating the expression of several macrophage-associated and complement genes. These data together indicate that the innate immune system of the aging hippocampus is highly responsive to the gonadal hormone milieu. In ovariectomized female rats, estradiol replacement exerts potent immunomodulatory effects including attenuation of microglia sensitization, initiation of -like activation and modulation of complement expression by targeting hippocampal neurons and glial cells through ERα and ERβ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651362>Changes in myocardial oxidative metabolism after biventricular pacing as evaluated by [11C]acetate positron emission tomography.</a></h2><p>A 70-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy and recurrent severe heart failure was admitted for biventricular pacing (BVP), which was recently reported to have clinical efficacy for severe heart failure with intraventricular conduction delay. An electrocardiogram showed complete left bundle branch block, and the QRS interval was markedly prolonged at 195 msec. Echocardiogram showed marked dilatation, diffuse hypokinesis and dyssynchrony of the left ventricle, and grade III mitral valve regurgitation. The patient underwent implantation of an atriobiventricular pacemaker and three pacing leads transvenously. The QRS interval shortened to 165 msec immediately after the BVP therapy, and improvements in echocardiographic parameters were seen at 5 months after BVP therapy. Myocardial oxidative metabolism was assessed by the monoexponential clearance rate of [11C]acetate (Kmono) as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), and myocardial efficiency was assessed by the work metabolic index (WMI) at 1 and 5 months after the BVP therapy. The PET images obtained 5 months after BVP therapy showed a decrease in the clearance of [11C]acetate compared with that obtained 1 month after BVP therapy. The Kmono of the whole left ventricle decreased from 0.051 at 1 month to 0.038 min-1 at 5 months after BVP therapy, and that of the septum, anterior wall, lateral wall and posterior wall also decreased. The WMI increased from 4.2 x 10(6) to 6.8 x 10(6) mmHg. ml/. These results suggest that BVP improved left ventricular function without increasing myocardial oxidative metabolism, resulting in improved myocardial efficiency, and that BVP may improve the long-term prognosis of heart failure patients with ventricular dyssynchrony. [11C]acetate PET is a useful method of evaluating global and regional myocardial oxidative metabolism in patients who have undergone BVP therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11045976>Partitioning of pyruvate between oxidation and anaplerosis in swine hearts.</a></h2><p>The goal of this study was to measure flux through pyruvate carboxylation and decarboxylation in the heart in vivo. These rates were measured in the anterior wall of normal anesthetized swine hearts by infusing [U-(13)C(3)]lactate and/or [U-(13)C(3)] pyruvate into the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. After 1 h, the tissue was freeze-clamped and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the mass isotopomer distribution of citrate and its oxaloacetate moiety. LAD blood pyruvate and lactate enrichments and concentrations were constant after 15 min of infusion. Under near-normal physiological concentrations of lactate and pyruvate, pyruvate carboxylation and decarboxylation accounted for 4.7 +/- 0.3 and 41.5 +/- 2.0% of citrate formation, respectively. Similar relative fluxes were found when arterial pyruvate was raised from 0.2 to 1.1 mM. Addition of 1 mM octanoate to 1 mM pyruvate inhibited pyruvate decarboxylation by 93% without affecting carboxylation. The absence of M1 and  pyruvate demonstrated net irreversible pyruvate carboxylation. Under our experimental conditions we found that pyruvate carboxylation in the in vivo heart accounts for at least 3-6% of the citric acid cycle flux despite considerable variation in the flux through pyruvate decarboxylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19675162>Compound A, a plant origin ligand of glucocorticoid receptors, increases regulatory T cells and  macrophages to attenuate experimental autoimmune neuritis with reduced side effects.</a></h2><p>Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is a helper T cell-mediated autoimmune demyelinating inflammatory disease of the peripheral nervous system and serves as the animal model for human inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies. Compound A, a plant-derived phenyl aziridine precursor, was reported to activate glucocorticoid receptors to exert transrepression but not transactivation properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of Compound A in EAN rats. Compound A greatly suppressed paraparesis in EAN, even when administrated after the appearance of the first neurological signs. Accumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes, demyelination, and mRNA levels of inflammatory molecules in sciatic nerves of EAN were greatly attenuated by Compound A. In addition, Compound A inhibited progression of neuropathic pain and repressed microglia but not astrocyte activation and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha up-regulation in EAN spinal cords. In EAN sciatic nerves, Compound A treatment increased numbers of anti-inflammatory  macrophages. Furthermore, Compound A induced the switch of macrophages from inflammatory M1 type to anti-inflammatory  type in vitro. In lymph nodes of EAN rats, Compound A depressed Th1 and Th17 cytokines, but increased Th2 cytokine and Foxp3 expression. An increase of Foxp3(+)/CD4(+) regulatory T cells was seen in peripheral blood of EAN rats following Compound A treatment. In addition, Compound A did not cause a hyperglycemia effect in EAN rats as compared with the immunosuppressive steroid prednisolone. Therefore, our data demonstrated that Compound A could effectively suppress EAN with reduced side effects by attenuating inflammation, suggesting that Compound A could be a potent candidate for treatment of autoimmune neuropathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22071785>Phase I clinical study of the angiogenesis inhibitor TSU-68 combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>TSU-68 is an oral small-molecule inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1.

No dose-limiting toxicities were observed with TSU-68 at the 200 mg twice a day dose level. At 400 mg twice a day, one of six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (anorexia of grade 3) during the first cycle. The 400 mg twice a day dose level was determined to be the recommended dose, and a total of 34 patients were treated at this dose. Overall, adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, with the most frequently observed such events being myelosuppression, neuropathy, and gastrointestinal disorders. No drug-related bleeding was observed. The objective response rate was 39.4% (95% confidence interval, 22.9-57.9%), and median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval, 3.6-7.2 months).

Because physical exercise and hypoglycemia share multiple counterregulatory mechanisms, we hypothesized that prior exercise may also result in gender-specific blunting of counterregulatory responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. Thirty healthy subjects (15 women and 15 men; age, 28 +/- 3 yr; body mass index, 23 +/- 1 kg/) were studied during 2-d experiments. Day 1 consisted of either identical 90-min morning and afternoon cycle exercise at 50% maximum oxygen expenditure or two 2-h episodes of hyperinsulinemic euglycemia. Day 2 consisted of a 2-h morning hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp. Endogenous glucose production was measured using [3-(3)H]glucose. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was measured using microneurography. Day 2 insulin (540 +/- 36 pmol/liter) and plasma glucose (2.9 +/- 0.06 pmol/liter) levels were similar in men and women during the last 30 min of hypoglycemia. Compared with antecedent euglycemia, d 1 exercise produced significant blunting of d 2 counterregulatory responses to hypoglycemia. Several key d 2 counterregulatory responses were blunted to a greater extent in men than in women: glucagon (men, -105 +/- 14; women, -25 +/- 7 ng/liter; P < 0.0001), epinephrine (men, -2625 +/- 257 pmol/liter; women, -212 +/- 573; P < 0.001), norepinephrine (men, -0.50 +/- 0.12 nmol/liter; women, -0 +/- 0.11; P < 0.001), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (men, -13 +/- 4; women, -4 +/- 4 bursts/min; P < 0.01). Cardiovascular responses (heart rate and systolic and mean arterial blood pressures) were also more blunted by antecedent exercise in men than in women. After d 1 exercise, the amount of glucose infused during d 2 hypoglycemia in men was increased 6-fold compared with that after d 1 euglycemia.

Addition of novel fibres to food products may increase fibre intake and improve gut health. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of three novel fibres on GI outcomes in healthy human subjects. A total of twenty healthy participants (ten men and ten women) with normal BMI (23 (sem 2) kg/) participated in the present randomised, double-blind, cross-over study with five treatment periods. Participants consumed a maltodextrin control or 20–25 g/d fibre from soluble maize fibre (SCF) or resistant starch (RS), alone or in combination with pullulan (SCF+P and RS+P). The treatment periods were 7 d with a 3-week washout between the periods. Stool samples were collected on day 7 of each period, and GI tolerance was assessed via a questionnaire on days 1 and 6. There were no treatment differences in stool weight or consistency. SCF significantly reduced stool pH and increased total  production compared with RS and control. RS+P significantly increased the percentage of butyrate compared with all the other treatments. Overall, GI symptoms were minimal. SCF+P led to the highest GI score on day 1, while RS+P had the highest score on day 6. Both SCF treatments caused a significant shift in the gut microbial community. These functional fibres are generally well tolerated, have minimal effects on laxation and may lead to beneficial changes in  production in healthy adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10417862>Binding profiles of a series of 2-arylpropionic acid esters on cloned human muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1-m5) and their relationship to nootropic activity.</a></h2><p>The muscarinic binding profile of a series of 2-arylpropionic acid esters on cloned human muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1-m5) was determined to investigate whether there is a correlation between pharmacological activity and muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity.

Montelukast (trade name Singulair) is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist used for asthma treatment. Mirroring Th1-Th2 polarization, two distinct states of macrophages have been recognized: the classically activated (M1) macrophages and the alternatively activated () macrophages.  polarization is known to be a response to the Th2 cytokines; however, the effects of montelukast on  macrophages have not been well characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of montelukast on the expression of cytokines and chemokines in -like macrophages, and to explore possible intracellular signaling pathways.The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and human monocytes from healthy donors were cultured with interleukin-4 for  polarization, and then the cells were pretreated with or without montelukast before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Supernatants were collected to determine interleukin-10, I-309/CCL1, and MDC/CCL22 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular signaling was investigated using nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, and western blot analysis.LPS-induced interleukin-10 and I-309/CCL1 expression was significantly suppressed by montelukast in THP-1-derived and human monocyte-derived  macrophages after LPS stimulation. MDC/CCL22 expression was only significantly suppressed by montelukast in THP-1-derived  macrophages after 48 hours of incubation. In western blot analysis, montelukast was able to suppress LPS-induced MAPK-phospho-p38 and NF-κB-phospho-p65 expression.Montelukast suppressed LPS-induced -related cytokines and chemokines in alternatively activated macrophages, and the effects might be mediated through the MAPK-p38 and NF-κB-p65 pathways.Copyright © 2016.

Persons with bipolar disorder are frequently treated with these and other agents known to impart substantial weight gain. We sought to describe the influence of adjunctive risperidone and olanzapine on body weight, body mass index (BMI, kg/) and serum leptin levels over a prospective observation period of 6 months. Throughout the 6-month investigation, significant increases from baseline to end point in weight were noted with both agents; with significantly greater weight gain with olanzapine (t(10) = 2.761, P = 0.023; t(9) = 4.783, P = 0.001). Leptin levels were highly correlated with increases in weight and were significantly elevated from baseline at 4 months (r = 0.658, P < 0.05). Significant increases in weight and body mass index were apparent at 3 months (P < 0.05). The temporal association between weight increase and leptin changes does not support the notion that leptin is a primary promoter of antipsychotic-induced weight gain; however, a secondary perpetuating role cannot be ruled out.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512440>Ascending dose-controlled trial of beloranib, a novel obesity treatment for safety, tolerability, and weight loss in obese women.</a></h2><p>Evaluate the safety and tolerability of beloranib, a fumagillin-class methionine aminopetidase-2 (MetAP2) inhibitor, in obese women over 4 weeks.Thirty-one obese (mean BMI 38 kg/) women were randomized to intravenous 0.1, 0.3, or 0.9 mg/ beloranib or placebo twice weekly for 4 weeks (N = 7, 6, 9, and 9).The most frequent AEs were headache, infusion site injury, nausea, and diarrhea. Nausea and infusion site injury occurred more with beloranib than placebo. The most common reason for discontinuation was loss of venous access. There were no clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings. In subjects completing 4 weeks, median weight loss with 0.9 mg/ beloranib was -3.8 kg (95% CI -5.1, -0.9; N = 8) versus -0.6 kg with placebo (-4.5, -0.1; N = 6). Weight change for 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ beloranib was similar to placebo. Beloranib (0.9 mg/) was associated with a significant 42 and 18% reduction in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol, as well as improvement in C-reactive protein and reduced sense of hunger. Changes in β-hydroxybutyrate, adiponectin, leptin, and fibroblast growth factor-21 were consistent with the putative mechanism of MetAP2 inhibition.

To assess the metabolism and excretion of montelukast, six healthy subjects received single oral doses of 102 mg of [14C]montelukast, and the urine and feces were collected. Most of the radioactivity was recovered in feces, with </=0.2% appearing in urine. Based on these results and the reported modestly high oral bioavailability of montelukast, it could be concluded that a major part of the radioactivity was excreted via bile. A second clinical study was conducted to identify biliary metabolites of montelukast. The bile was aspirated using a modified procedure involving a nasogastric tube placed fluoroscopically near the ampulla of Vater, after an oral dose of 54.8 mg of [14C]montelukast. This technique appears to be a new application for drug metabolism studies. The study was conducted with fasted and nonfasted subjects, with the bile being aspirated continuously under suction over periods of 2-8 hr and 8-12 hr after the dose, respectively. Two hours before the end of the collection procedure, cholecystokinin carboxyl-terminal octapeptide was administered iv to stimulate gallbladder contraction. Plasma samples also were collected periodically over 10 hr. Due to the nature of the collection procedure and the limited sampling time, recovery of radioactivity in bile was incomplete and varied from 3 to 20% of the dose. Radiochromatographic and LC-MS/MS analyses of bile showed the presence of one major and several minor metabolites, along with small amounts of unchanged parent drug. The minor metabolites were identified, by LC-MS/MS comparison with synthetic standards or by NMR, as acyl glucuronide (M1), sulfoxide (), 25-hydroxy (a phenol, M3), 21-hydroxy (diastereomers of a benzylic alcohol, M5a and M5b), and 36-hydroxy (diastereomers of a methyl alcohol, M6a and M6b) analogs of montelukast. The major metabolite was characterized as a dicarboxylic acid (M4), a product of further oxidation of the hydroxymethyl metabolite M6. Chiral LC-MS/MS analyses of M4 revealed that this diacid, like M5 and M6, was formed in both diastereomeric forms. The levels of metabolites in the systemic circulation were low in the fed as well as fasted subjects, with <2% of the circulating radioactivity being due to metabolites M5a, M5b, M6a, and M6b. Overall, this bile aspiration technique, which is less invasive than either T-tube drainage or fine-needle percutaneous puncture, provided a convenient and expedient means of identifying the biliary metabolites of montelukast, relatively free of contributions from colonic microflora.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238605>Transcriptome sequencing of the anterior cingulate in bipolar disorder: dysregulation of G protein-coupled receptors.</a></h2><p>Gene expression dysregulation in the brain has been associated with bipolar disorder through candidate gene and microarray expression studies, but questions remain about isoform-specific dysregulation and the role of noncoding RNAs whose importance in the brain has been suggested recently but not yet characterized for bipolar disorder.The authors used RNA sequencing, a powerful technique that captures the complexity of gene expression, in postmortem tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex from 13 bipolar disorder case subjects and 13 matched comparison subjects. Differential expression was computed, and a global pattern of downregulation was detected, with 10 transcripts significant at a false discovery rate ≤5%. Importantly, all 10 genes were also replicated in an independent RNA sequencing data set (N=61) from the anterior cingulate cortex.Among the most significant results were genes coding for class A G protein-coupled receptors: SSTR2 (somatostatin receptor 2), CHRM2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2), and RXFP1 (relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1). A gene ontology analysis of the entire set of differentially expressed genes pointed to an overrepresentation of genes involved in G protein-coupled receptor regulation. The top genes were followed up by querying the effect of treatment with mood stabilizers commonly prescribed in bipolar disorder, which showed that these drugs modulate expression of the candidate genes.By using RNA sequencing in the postmortem bipolar disorder brain, an interesting profile of G protein-coupled receptor dysregulation was identified, several new bipolar disorder genes were indicated, and the noncoding transcriptome in bipolar disorder was characterized. These findings have important implications with regard to fine-tuning our understanding of the bipolar disorder brain, as well as for identifying potential new drug target pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11300327>Nitroso-urea-cisplatin-based chemotherapy associated with valproate: increase of haematologic toxicity.</a></h2><p>The incidence of haematologic toxicity of valproate (VPA) ranges from 1% to 32% and consists mainly of asymptomatic, dose-dependent thrombopenia. We describe a potentiation of haematologic side-effects of nitroso-urea (NU) when prescribed in association with VPA.We followed a cohort of 70 patients (58 men, 22 women, mean age: 56 years, range 20-75 years). Patients with high-grade gliomas were treated with up-front chemotherapy regimen consisting of fotemustine (d3: 100 mg/), cisplatin (d1-3: 33 mg/) and etoposide (d1-3: 75 mg/) followed by whole brain radiotherapy at progression. Sixty patients required anti-epileptic drugs (AED) for either a single, well-documented epileptic seizure, or immediatly initiated after neurosurgical procedures. AED included VPA (35 of 60), phenobarbital (PB) (17 of 60), carbamazepine (CBZ) (2 of 60) and phenytoin (PHT) (3 of 60). Two patients had both PB and CBZ and one PB and PHT.Haematologic toxicity (grade 3-4 thrombopenia, neutropenia or both) was observed in 37 of 70 (52.85%) patients. Among them 24 (65%) had VPA. Group C were patients treated with fotemustine alone with or without VPA (23 patients).When prescribed in association with a fotemustine-cisplatin regimen, VPA treatment results in a three-fold higher incidence of reversible thrombopenia, neutropenia or both. Haematologic side-effects decrease after AED modification during the continued chemotherapy. This adverse event should be managed with caution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10955805>P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein activities in relation to treatment outcome in acute myeloid leukemia.</a></h2><p>Despite treatment with intensive chemotherapy, a considerable number of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) die from their disease due to the occurrence of resistance. Overexpression of the transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1 has been identified as a major cause of cross-resistance to functionally and structurally unrelated drugs. In the present study, the functional activity of P-gp and MRP was determined in 104 de novo AML patients with a flow cytometric assay using rhodamine 123 (Rh123) in combination with PSC833 and carboxyfluorescein (CF) in combination with MK-571. The results were compared with clinical outcome and with known prognostic factors. The functional activity of P-gp and MRP, expressed as Rh123 efflux blocking by PSC833 and CF efflux blocking by MK-571, demonstrated a great variability in the AML patients. A strong negative correlation was observed between Rh123 efflux blocking by PSC833 and Rh123 accumulation (r(s) = -0.69, P < 0.001) and between CF efflux blocking by MK-571 and CF accumulation (r(s) = -0.59, P < 0.001). A low Rh123 accumulation and a high Rh123 efflux blocking by PSC833 were associated with a low complete remission (CR) rate after the first cycle of chemotherapy (P = 0.008 and P = 0.01, respectively). Patients with both low Rh123 and CF accumulation (n = 16) had the lowest CR rate (6%), whereas patients with both high Rh123 and CF accumulation (n = 11) had a CR rate of 73%. AML patients with French-American-British classification M1 or  showed a lower Rh123 accumulation than patients with French-American-British classification M4 or M5 (P = 0.02). No association was observed between the multidrug resistance parameters and overall survival of the AML patients.

An oral supplement containing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, glutamine, and arginine (HMB/Glu/Arg) has helped to restore LBM in cachexia due to cancer and in critically ill trauma patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral HMB/Glu/Arg on LBM and RMR following laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB).Patients who underwent LGB were randomized to receive 24 g of HMB/Glu/Arg dissolved in water twice daily for 8 weeks or to receive no supplement. Weight loss, LBM, and RMR were assessed preoperatively, 2 and 8 weeks postoperatively. LBM was determined by dual emission x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry.Thirty patients were enrolled: 80% white; 20% African American; 96.7% women; mean age 46.9±8.4 years; mean weight 113.4±11.6 kg; and mean body mass index (BMI) 43.3±4.1 kg/. The experimental and control groups included 14 and 16 patients, respectively, and there was no difference in baseline demographics and characteristics between the two groups. At 8 weeks, weight, BMI, LBM, and RMR significantly decreased by 15.7±2.5 kg, 6.0±1.0 kg/, 7.8±4.0 kg, and 290.6±234.9 kcal/day, respectively (P<0.0001 for each variable). However, when comparing these changes between the two groups, no statistical significance was observed.There is a significant decrease in weight, BMI, LBM, and RMR in all subjects after LGB, and these changes were not affected by the use of HMB/Glu/Arg. Potential preservation of LBM as a result of HMB/Glu/Arg requires further investigation. However, its consumption (78 calories per serving) did not adversely affect weight loss in the experimental group.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12720578>Effect of 4-coumaric and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid on oxidative DNA damage in rat colonic mucosa.</a></h2><p>The effect of 4-coumaric and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic (protocatechuic) acid on the basal oxidative DNA damage of rat colonic mucosa in vivo was studied, relative to vitamin E. F344 rats were treated with 4-coumaric or protocatechuic acid mixed in the diet (25 or 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks). It was observed that 4-coumaric acid (50 mg/kg) significantly decreased the basal level of the oxidative damage assessed as 8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in DNA and by the comet assay. Moreover, it was found that vitamin E (10 mg/kg) had no effect on colonic mucosa oxidation damage, whereas at a higher dose (55 mg/kg) it actually enhanced oxidative stress. The effect of 4-coumaric acid (50 mg/kg) on the expression of some glutathione-related enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-P, GST-, GST-M1, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione peroxidase (GSPX)1 and GSPX4) was also investigated at the level of the colonic mucosa. Only the expression of GST- was significantly induced by 4-coumaric acid, while protocatechuic acid was inactive.

Potential explanation for the inhibitor action involves among others reduced inflammation. We therefore anticipated that SB will provide a suitable option for brain injury in immature animals. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms of protection afforded by SB after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is associated with anti-inflammatory action. We examined the effect of SB on the production of inflammatory factors including analysis of the microglial and astrocytic cell response. We also examined the effect of SB on molecular mediators that are crucial for inducing cerebral damage after ischemia (transcription factors, HSP70, as well as pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins).Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by 60 min of hypoxia (7.6% O). SB (300 mg/kg) was administered in a 5-day regime with the first injection given immediately after hypoxic exposure. The damage of the ipsilateral hemisphere was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) 6 days after the insult. Samples were collected at 24 and 48 h and 6 days. Effects of SB on hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced inflammation (cytokines and chemokine) were assessed by Luminex assay and immunohistochemistry. Expression of molecular mediators (NFκB, p53, HSP70, COX-2, pro- and anti-apoptotic factors Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3) were assayed by Western blot analysis.SB treatment-reduced brain damage, as assessed by HE staining, suppressed the production of inflammatory markers-IL-1β, chemokine CXCL10, and blocked ischemia-elicited upregulation of COX-2 in the damaged ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, administration of SB promoted the conversion of microglia phenotype from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory . None of the investigated molecular mediators that are known to be affected by HDACis in adults were modified after SB administration.Administration of SB is neuroprotective in neonatal hypoxia-ischemia injury. This neuroprotective activity prevented the delayed rise in chemokine CXCL10, IL-1β, and COX-2 in the ipsilateral hemisphere. SB appears to exert a beneficial effect via suppression of HI-induced cerebral inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16340214>Individual igf-I responsiveness to a fixed regimen of low-dose growth hormone replacement is increased with less variability in obese compared to non-obese adults with severe growth hormone deficiency.</a></h2><p>Decreased GH and IGF-I levels and increased GH responsiveness are frequently reported in obesity. As GH-deficient adults are commonly obese, the role of obesity in affecting hepatic responsiveness of IGF-I generation to GH stimulation is unclear in severe GH-deficient states. To address this question, we challenged a cohort of severely GH-deficient non-obese and obese adults with a fixed low GH dose (0.2 mg/day), and examined the relationship of body mass index (BMI) with IGF-I response.12 non-obese (6 males, median BMI 24.7 kg/) and 14 obese (7 males, median BMI 45.2 kg/) adults with severe GH deficiency were studied for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline, and weeks 4 and 8.There was a larger increment and reduced variability of IGF-I levels in obese compared to non-obese GH-deficient adults at week 8, but not at week 4. A similar but smaller increment and less variability was observed with IGFBP-3. Increment IGF-I positively correlated with baseline BMI at weeks 4 (r=0.49, p<0.02) and 8 (r=0.47, p<0.02). No gender differences were observed with the IGF-I and IGFBP-3 response.This study demonstrates that there is a larger increment and deceased individual variability of IGF-I to the low GH replacement dose in obese compared to non-obese adults with severe GH deficiency, regardless of gender. The positive association of IGF-I increment with BMI implies a greater impact of obesity rather than GH deficiency in enhancing hepatic sensitivity to GH. These findings, thus, question the reliability of interpreting single serum IGF-I levels in non-obese adults with severe GH deficiency treated with low GH replacement doses.Copyright (c) 2006 S.

On each night somatostatin (50-100 micrograms.-1.h-1) and glucagon (1 ng.kg-1.min-1) were infused continuously and 18 mU/kg of growth hormone was given as either: three discrete pulses of 6 mU.kg-1.h-1 at 180-min intervals or a 12-h infusion (1.5 mU.kg-1.h-1) or buffer solution only on a control night. Euglycaemia was maintained by an insulin-varying clamp. Blood samples were taken every 15 min for glucose and growth hormone and every hour for intermediate metabolites and non-esterified  . Comparable normoglycaemic conditions were achieved on all three nights. Growth hormone levels achieved (mean +/- SEM) on study nights were: 32.8 +/- 2.2 mU/l (peak level during growth hormone pulses); 9.8 +/- 0.8 mU/l (continuous growth hormone) and 1.1 +/- 0.3 mU/l (control level).

However, potential disadvantages include ultrafilter fouling, decreasing flux, and high VFA concentrations. In this study, a thermophilic anaerobic digester coupled to a sintered titanium, cross-flow ultrafilter was operated for over five months. Dairy manure was digested (HRT of 23 days). The filtrate VFA concentration was low (220 mg/L as HAc), average VS destruction was 49%, and a low average effluent fecal coliform concentration of 10(2) MPN/100 mL was observed. The low coliform value may be beneficial if dewatered biosolids are used for livestock bedding since low pathogen counts help prevent mastitis. Ultrafilter fluxes of 40-80 L/-hr were maintained by cleaning using caustic (3.5% NaOH) followed by water and acid (3% phosphoric acid). Sand from livestock bedding was found to damage the pump and ultrafilter.

FA, GA and CA exhibited a significant concentration-dependent protective effect against the genotoxicity of AO and ofloxacin, with the exception of PA, which at all concentrations tested abolished the AO and ofloxacin genotoxicity. UV spectrophotometric measurements showed the interaction of PA, FA, GA and CA with AO but not with ofloxacin; this interaction is obviously responsible for the reduction of AO-induced S. typhimurium mutagenicity. In the case of ofloxacin the antimutagenic effect of PA, FA, GA and CA is assumed to be a result of their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by ofloxacin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9284733>Effect of aging on the sensitivity of growth hormone secretion to insulin-like growth factor-I negative feedback.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of aging on the suppression of GH secretion by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, we studied 11 healthy young adults (6 men, 5 women, mean +/- SD: 25.2 +/- 4.6 yr old; body mass index 23.7 +/- 1.8 kg/) and 11 older adults (6 men, 5 women, 69.5 +/- 5.8 yr old; body mass index 24.2 +/- 2.5 kg/). Saline (control) or recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) (2 h baseline then, in sequence, 2.5 h each of 1, 3, and 10 micrograms/kg.h) was infused iv during the last 9.5 h of a 40.5-h fast; serum glucose was clamped within 15% of baseline. Baseline serum GH concentrations (mean +/- SE: 3.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/L, P = 0.02) and total IGF-I concentrations (219 +/- 15 vs. 103 +/- 19 micrograms/L, P < 0.01) were higher in the younger subjects. In both age groups, GH concentrations were significantly decreased by 3 and 10 micrograms/kg.h, but not by 1 microgram/kg.h rhIGF-I. The absolute decrease in GH concentrations was greater in young than in older subjects during the 3 and 10 micrograms/kg.h rhIGF-I infusion periods, but both young and older subjects suppressed to a similar GH level during the last hour of the rhIGF-I infusion (0.78 +/- 0.24 microgram/L and 0.61 +/- 0.16 microgram/L, respectively). The older subjects had a greater increase above baseline in serum concentrations of both total (306 +/- 24 vs. 244 +/- 14 micrograms/L, P = 0.04) and free IGF-I (8.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L, P = 0.01) than the young subjects during rhIGF-I infusion, and their GH suppression expressed in relation to increases in both total and free serum IGF-I concentrations was significantly less than in the young subjects. We conclude that the ability of exogenous rhIGF-I to suppress serum GH concentrations declines with increasing age. This suggests that increased sensitivity to endogenous IGF-I negative feedback is not a cause of the decline in GH secretion that occurs with aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24683595>Sorption and solubility of self-etching adhesives immersed in organic  present in oral biofilm.</a></h2><p>This study evaluated the sorption and solubility of self-etching adhesive systems after immersion in distilled water, lactic acid, and propionic acid.Specimens of 2 two-step (P90 System Adhesive [P90], Clearfil SE Bond [CSE]) and 1 single-step (Adper Easy One [AEO]) adhesive systems were prepared and divided into 4 groups: P90 primer ( P90-P), P90 bond (P90-B), AEO, and CSE bond (CSE-B). Specimens were placed in a desiccator and weighed daily until achieving a constant mass (m1). The specimens (n = 5) were then immersed in the respective media and weighed until a achieving a constant mass (). The specimens were again desiccated (m3). Sorption and solubility data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Turkey's test. Specimens were also observed using SEM without immersion, after 24 h, and at the end of the respective total time of immersion.For all immersion media, the highest sorption values were obtained for AEO and P90-P, followed by CSE-B and P90-B, which presented the lowest sorption. The time required for adhesives to absorb the solutions was: 11 to 19 days for P90-P, 12 to 13 days for P90-B, 15 to 19 days for AEO, and 14 to 18 days for CSE-B. The highest values of solubility were shown for AEO and P90-P in all immersion media. In water and propionic acid, the adhesives with the lowest solubility values were CSE-B and P90-B. CSE-B had the lowest solubility in lactic acid.The greatest surface degradation was observed after each respective total time of immersion. AEO specimens presented more evident surface degradation and the highest sorption and solubility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21384402>AST-120 (spherical carbon adsorbent) lowers ammonia levels and attenuates brain edema in bile duct-ligated rats.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is multifactorial, involving gut-derived toxins such as ammonia, which has been demonstrated to induce oxidative stress. Therefore, a primary hepatic encephalopathy treatment target is reducing ammonia production in the gastrointestinal tract. AST-120, an oral adsorbent of engineered activated carbon microspheres with surface areas exceeding 1600 /g, acts as a sink for neurotoxins and hepatotoxins present in the gut. We evaluated the capacity of AST-120 to adsorb ammonia in vitro and to lower blood ammonia, oxidative stress and brain edema in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis was induced in rats by bile duct ligation for 6 weeks. AST-120 was administered by gavage preventively for 6 weeks (0.1, 1, and 4 g/kg/day). In addition, AST-120 was evaluated as a short-term treatment for 2 weeks and 3 days (1 g/kg/day) and as a sink to adsorb intravenously infused ammonium acetate. In vitro, AST-120 efficiently adsorbed ammonia. Ammonia levels significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner for all AST-120-treated bile duct-ligated rats (nontreated: 177.3 ± 30.8 μM; AST-120, 0.1 g/kg/day: 121.9 ± 13.8 μM; AST-120, 1 g/kg/day: 80.9 ± 30.0 μM; AST-120, 4 g/kg/day: 48.8 ± 19.6 μM) and significantly correlated with doses of AST-120 (r = -0.6603). Brain water content and locomotor activity normalized after AST-120 treatments, whereas arterial reactive oxygen species levels remained unchanged. Furthermore, AST-120 significantly attenuated a rise in arterial ammonia after ammonium acetate administration (intravenously).AST-120 treatment decreased arterial ammonia levels, normalized brain water content and locomotor activity but did not demonstrate an effect on systemic oxidative stress. Also, AST-120 acts as an ammonia sink, efficiently removing blood-derived ammonia. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of AST-120 on hepatic encephalopathy in patients with advanced liver disease.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9725642>Peripheral fat metabolism during infusion of an exogenous triacylglycerol emulsion.</a></h2><p>To test the hypothesis that intravenous infusion of lipid would bring about changes in adipose tissue metabolism, which would tend to spare net fat mobilization, and to attempt to identify the mediators of such responses.The triacylglycerol (TG) emulsion, Intralipid, was infused and metabolic changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue and forearm muscle were assessed by measurements of arterio-venous differences.Six normal male subjects aged 21-37 y, with body mass index (BMI) 23.0-25.9 kg/.Plasma TG and non-esterified  acid (NEFA) concentrations rose during infusion as expected. The rise in systemic plasma NEFA concentration occurred despite decreased NEFA release from adipose tissue. Intralipid infusion resulted in a suppression of intracellular lipolysis in adipose tissue, by mechanisms which are not clear. Plasma leptin concentrations, measured in a search for the regulator of lipolysis, showed consistent leptin release from adipose tissue which did not change significantly with time.The suppression of intracellular lipolysis in adipose tissue during Intralipid infusion is a new observation and may reflect a novel mechanism for regulation of fat storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10598744>In vitro metabolism of mifepristone (RU-486) in rat, monkey and human hepatic S9 fractions: identification of three new mifepristone metabolites.</a></h2><p>1. In vitro metabolism of the antiprogestin drug mifepristone (RU-486) was studied after incubation with rat, monkey and human hepatic S9 fractions in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. 2. Unchanged mifepristone (approximately 45% of the sample(s) in rat; approximately 70% in monkey; approximately 65% in human) plus six metabolites, three known and three new, were profiled, quantified and tentatively identified on the basis of MS and MS/MS data. 3. The proposed metabolic pathways for mifepristone are proposed, and the two metabolic steps are (A) N-demethylation and (B) methyl oxidation. 4. Step A formed N-desmethyl mifepristone (M1) in major amounts (approximately 35% s in rat, 16% in monkey and human) and N,N-didesmethyl mifepristone () in minor amounts (< 5% s in all species). Step B, or in conjunction with step A, produced four minor/trace metabolites, namely hydroxymethyl mifepristone (M3), hydroxymethyl M1 (M4), hydroxymethyl  (M5) and formyl mifepristone (M6).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18502064>Micronization of gemfibrozil by reactive precipitation process.</a></h2><p>Ultrafine gemfibrozil (GEM) was prepared by reactive precipitation process in which methyl cellulose (MC) was employed to inhibit the growth and the agglomeration of particles. The impact of NaOH concentrations on bulk GEM consumption was explored. The effects of H2SO4 concentrations and the drying methods on the particle size and morphology were also discussed. The produced ultrafine powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, specific surface area analysis and dissolution test. XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra showed that the as-obtained ultrafine GEM was a crystalline powder with the structure and components similar to those of bulk GEM. The ultrafine GEM had a mean particle size of about 1.25 microm with a narrow distribution from 0.6 to 3 microm. The specific surface area reached up to 11.01 /g, which was about 6 times as large as that of bulk GEM. In the dissolution tests, about 91.2% of ultrafine GEM was dissolved after 120 min, while there was only 23.6% of bulk GEM dissolved, proving that the dissolution property of ultrafine GEM was significantly enhanced when compared to commercial GEM owing to a decreased particle size and an increased specific surface area.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29776446>Valproic acid attenuates traumatic spinal cord injury-induced inflammation via STAT1 and NF-κB pathway dependent of HDAC3.</a></h2><p>Microglial polarization with M1/ phenotype shifts and the subsequent neuroinflammatory responses are vital contributing factors for spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced secondary injury. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is considered the central transcription factor of inflammatory mediators, which plays a crucial role in microglial activation. Lysine acetylation of STAT1 seems necessary for NF-kB pathway activity, as it is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). There have been no studies that have explained if HDAC inhibition by valproic acid (VPA) affects the NF-κB pathway via acetylation of STAT1 dependent of HDAC activity in the microglia-mediated central inflammation following SCI. We investigated the potential molecular mechanisms that focus on the phenotypic transition of microglia and the STAT1-mediated NF-κB acetylation after a VPA treatment.The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotion scale, the inclined plane test, the blood-spinal cord barrier, and Nissl staining were employed to determine the neuroprotective effects of VPA treatment after SCI. Assessment of microglia polarization and pro-inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and interferon (INF)-γ was used to evaluate the neuroinflammatory responses and the anti-inflammatory effects of VPA treatment. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were used to detect HDAC3 nuclear translocation, activity, and NF-κB signaling pathway activation to evaluate the effects of VPA treatment. The impact of STAT1 acetylation on NF-kB pathway and the interaction between STAT1 and NF-kB were assessed to evaluate anti-inflammation effects of VPA treatment and also whether these effects were dependent on a STAT1/NF-κB pathway to gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of the neuroinflammatory response after SCI.The results showed that the VPA treatment promoted the phenotypic shift of microglia from M1 to  phenotype and inhibited microglial activation, thus reducing the SCI-induced inflammatory factors. The VPA treatment upregulation of the acetylation of STAT1/NF-κB pathway was likely caused by the HDAC3 translocation to the nucleus and activity. These results indicated that the treatment with the VPA suppressed the expression and the activity of HDAC3 and enhanced STAT1, as well as NF-κB p65 acetylation following a SCI. The acetylation status of NF-kB p65 and the complex with NF-κB p65 and STAT1 inhibited the NF-kB p65 transcriptional activity and attenuated the microglia-mediated central inflammatory response following SCI.These results suggested that the VPA treatment attenuated the inflammatory response by modulating microglia polarization through STAT1-mediated acetylation of the NF-κB pathway, dependent of HDAC3 activity. These effects led to neuroprotective effects following SCI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21175442>Repaglinide-gemfibrozil drug interaction: inhibition of repaglinide glucuronidation as a potential additional contributing mechanism.</a></h2><p>To further explore the mechanism underlying the interaction between repaglinide and gemfibrozil, alone or in combination with itraconazole.Repaglinide metabolism was assessed in vitro (human liver subcellular fractions, fresh human hepatocytes, and recombinant enzymes) and the resulting incubates were analyzed, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and radioactivity counting, to identify and quantify the different metabolites therein. Chemical inhibitors, in addition to a trapping agent, were also employed to elucidate the importance of each metabolic pathway. Finally, a panel of human liver microsomes (genotyped for UGT1A1*28 allele status) was used to determine the importance of UGT1A1 in the direct glucuronidation of repaglinide.The results of the present study demonstrate that repaglinide can undergo direct glucuronidation, a pathway that can possibly contribute to the interaction with gemfibrozil. For example, [³H]-repaglinide formed glucuronide and oxidative metabolites ( and M4) when incubated with primary human hepatocytes. Gemfibrozil effectively inhibited (∼78%) both glucuronide and M4 formation, but had a minor effect on  formation. Concomitantly, the overall turnover of repaglinide was also inhibited (∼80%), and was completely abolished when gemfibrozil was co-incubated with itraconazole. These observations are in qualitative agreement with the in vivo findings. UGT1A1 plays a significant role in the glucuronidation of repaglinide. In addition, gemfibrozil and its glucuronide inhibit repaglinide glucuronidation and the inhibition by gemfibrozil glucuronide is time-dependent.Inhibition of UGT enzymes, especially UGT1A1, by gemfibrozil and its glucuronide is an additional mechanism to consider when rationalizing the interaction between repaglinide and gemfibrozil.© 2010 The Authors.

Whether the microbial metabolites influence macrophage polarization, however, is poorly understood. Here, we show that the large bowel microbial fermentation product, butyrate, facilitates  macrophage polarization, in vitro and in vivo. The supernatant from butyrate-treated  macrophage increased the migration and enhanced the wound closure rate of MLE-12 cells. Butyrate attenuated intestinal inflammation in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, with a significant increase in colonic expression of the  macrophage-associated protein, Arg1.  macrophage treated with butyrate, had increased activation of the H3K9/STAT6 signaling pathway, suggesting a mechanism for butyrate facilitated  macrophage polarization. Collectively, our study indicated that commensal microbe-derived butyrate is a novel activator of STAT6-mediated transcription through H3K9 acetylation driving  macrophage polarization, and delineated new insights into the immune interplay underlying inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7889636>Effect of glucocorticoid replacement therapy on glucose tolerance and intermediary metabolites in hypopituitary adults.</a></h2><p>Excess impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus have been reported in hypopituitary adults on conventional replacement therapy including glucocorticoids. We investigated the effect of the glucocorticoid component on glucose tolerance and intermediary metabolites in hypopituitary adults.A 3-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed on two study days, at least one week apart. On one study day, the glucocorticoid replacement morning dose was taken 60 minutes before the OGTT, and on the other it was left until after the OGTT. All other pituitary replacement therapies were kept unchanged on the two study days.Eight hypopituitary adults (3 males and 5 females; aged 46-76 years) on conventional replacement therapy were studied. Their duration of hypopituitarism was mean (range) 15 (5-31) years. Their mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.4 (24.1-35.1) kg/. Their total daily cortisol dose was 26 (15-30) mg.Plasma glucose, insulin, non-esterified   (NEFA), glycerol and 3-hydroxybutyrate were measured at 30-minute intervals and plasma cortisol levels were measured hourly.Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were similar on the glucocorticoid day (GD) and the non-glucocorticoid day (NGD) (glucose (mean +/- SD) 4.9 +/- 0.9 vs 4.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; insulin (median (range)) 5 (1-17) vs 2 (1-15) mU/l, respectively). Post-glucose glycaemia was higher on the GD than on the NGD with a significantly higher glucose area under the curve (AUC) (45.0 +/- 8.2 vs 38.9 +/- 11.7 mmol/l h, P < 0.05). Post-glucose insulinaemia was also higher on the GD than on the NGD with significantly higher insulin AUC (270 (47-909) vs 207 (46-687) mU/l h, P < 0.02). Impaired glucose tolerance was found in three patients on the GD, one of whom continued to have impaired glucose tolerance on the NGD. The areas under the curves of NEFA, glycerol and 3-hydroxybutyrate were not significantly different on the two days. On the NGD, plasma cortisol levels were undetectable (< 50 nmol/l) in all patients and on the GD the median (range) peak was 500 (330-740) nmol/l dropping to 125 (60-330) nmol/l at 180 minutes. The difference in glucose AUC between the two days correlated with the maximal plasma cortisol levels (Spearman's p = 0.83, P < 0.01).Glucocorticoid replacement therapy taken pre-prandially in hypopituitary adults induces mild elevations in circulating glucose and insulin levels even with acceptable plasma cortisol concentrations. Optimal regimens for glucocorticoid replacement require more study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23771776>Improvement of whole crop rice silage nutritive value and rumen degradability by molasses and urea supplementation.</a></h2><p>Whole crop rice was harvested 120 days after planting and chopped to 2-3-cm length for silage making. The whole crop rice silage (WCRS) was supplemented with different levels of molasses and urea to study nutritive value and in situ rumen degradability. The ensiling study was randomly assigned according to a 6 × 5 factorial arrangement, in which the first factor was molasses (M) supplementation at M0, M1, , M3, M4, and M5 %, and the second was urea (U) supplementation at U0, U0.5, U1.0, U1.5, and U2.0 % of the crop dry mater (DM), respectively. After 45 days of ensiling, temperature, pH, chemical composition, and fermentation end products of the silages were measured. Ten U and M treatment combinations of WCRS were subsequently selected to study rumen degradability by nylon bag technique. The results showed that temperature and pH of the silages linearly increased with U supplementation level, while total   acid (TVFA), acetic acid (C2) and propionic acid (C3) decreased. In contrast, increasing level of M supplementation decreased WCRS temperature and pH, whereas TVFA, C2, and C3 concentrations increased dramatically. Both M and U supplementation increased concentration of butyric acid (C4). Dry matter, organic matter (OM), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents of the silages were not influenced by either M or U supplementation. Increasing U supplementation increased crude protein (CP) content, while M level did not show any effect. Furthermore, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content in silage was decreased by both M and U supplementation. The results of the in situ study showed that M and U supplementation increased both ruminal DM and OM degradation. The water-soluble fraction (a) was the highest in WCRS U1.5M3 and lowest in U0M0. Increasing M and U supplementation levels increased the potentially degradable fraction (b) of both DM and OM. Total rumen degradable fraction (a + b) was highest in WCRS U1.5M3, whereas OM degradability was highest in U0M3. However, effective degradation of both DM and OM were the highest in WCRS U1.5M3 and the lowest in U0M0. We conclude that supplementation of U and M increases WCRS quality and rumen degradability. Supplementation of U at 1.5 and M at 3-4 % of the crop DM is recommended for lactating dairy cows and fattening beef cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17183730>A proof-of-principle study of epigenetic therapy added to neoadjuvant doxorubicin cyclophosphamide for locally advanced breast cancer.</a></h2><p>Aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation participate in cancer development and progression; hence, their reversal by inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylases (HDACs) is at present undergoing clinical testing in cancer therapy. As epigenetic alterations are common to breast cancer, in this proof-of-concept study demethylating hydralazine, plus the HDAC inhibitor magnesium valproate, were added to neoadjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in locally advanced breast cancer to assess their safety and biological efficacy.This was a single-arm interventional trial on breast cancer patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ). After signing informed consent, patients were typed for acetylator phenotype and then treated with hydralazine at 182 mg for rapid-, or 83 mg for slow-acetylators, and magnesium valproate at 30 mg/kg, starting from day -7 until chemotherapy ended, the latter consisting of four cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg/ and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/ every 21 days. Core-needle biopsies were taken from primary breast tumors at diagnosis and at day 8 of treatment with hydralazine and valproate.16 patients were included and received treatment as planned. All were evaluated for clinical response and toxicity and 15 for pathological response. Treatment was well-tolerated. The most common toxicity was drowsiness grades 1-2. Five (31%) patients had clinical CR and eight (50%) PR for an ORR of 81%. No patient progressed. One of 15 operated patients (6.6%) had pathological CR and 70% had residual disease <3 cm. There was a statistically significant decrease in global 5mC content and HDAC activity. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate up- and down-regulated at least 3-fold, 1,091 and 89 genes, respectively.Hydralazine and magnesium valproate produce DNA demethylation, HDAC inhibition, and gene reactivation in primary tumors. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide treatment is safe, well-tolerated, and appears to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. A randomized phase III study is ongoing to support the efficacy of so-called epigenetic or transcriptional cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137481>A Ketogenic Diet Reduces Central Obesity and Serum Insulin in Women with Ovarian or Endometrial Cancer.</a></h2><p>The glycolytic nature of cancer cells presents a potential treatment target that may be addressed by a ketogenic diet (KD).We hypothesized that a KD would improve body composition and lower serum insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in women with ovarian or endometrial cancer.In this randomized controlled trial, women with ovarian or endometrial cancer [age: ≥19 y; body mass index (kg/): ≥18.5] were randomly assigned to a KD (70:25:5 energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate) or the American Cancer Society diet (ACS; high-fiber, low-fat). Body composition (DXA) and fasting serum insulin, IGF-I, and β-hydroxybutyrate were obtained at baseline and at 12 wk; urinary ketones were also measured throughout the intervention. We assessed differences between the diets with ANCOVA and independent t tests. We used correlation analyses to estimate associations between changes in serum analytes and body composition.After 12 wk, the KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted total (35.3 compared with 38.0 kg, P < 0.05) and android (3.0 compared with 3.3 kg, P < 0.05) fat mass. Percentage of change in visceral fat was greater in the KD group (compared with the ACS group; -21.2% compared with -4.6%, P < 0.05). Adjusted total lean mass did not differ between the groups. The KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted fasting serum insulin (7.6 compared with 11.2 µU/mL, P < 0.01). There was a significant inverse association between the changes in serum β-hydroxybutyrate and IGF-I concentrations (r = -0.57; P < 0.0001).In women with ovarian or endometrial cancer, a KD results in selective loss of fat mass and retention of lean mass. Visceral fat mass and fasting serum insulin also are reduced by the KD, perhaps owing to enhanced insulin sensitivity. Elevated serum β-hydroxybutyrate may reflect a metabolic environment inhospitable to cancer proliferation.

Infusions were maintained for 6 hr, and at the end of the 3rd hour, a 0.8 g/kg iv ethanol load was administered in 20 min. Leucine flux, nonoxidative disposal and oxidation rates, and glucose rate of appearance were calculated during the 3rd and 6th hours of infusion. Ethanol disappearance rate and the percentage completely metabolized to CO2 and H2O in 3 hr were also calculated. Compared with controls, alcoholics had significantly higher basal leucine flux (55.6 +/- 12 vs. 37.3 +/- 9.3 microM//min) and nonoxidative disposal (48.7 +/- 8.7 vs. 31.1 +/- 7.5 microM//min). No differences were observed in basal glucose appearance rates in alcoholics and controls (397.6 +/- 115.2 vs. 349.4 +/- 120.6 microM//min). Compared with controls, alcoholics had a higher alcohol disappearance rate (2.72 +/- 0.59 vs. 1.84 +/- 0.43 mM/kg/min) and percentage of ethanol metabolized to CO2 and H2O in 3 hr (40.6 +/- 10.2 vs. 22.9 +/- 6.9%). After the ethanol load, both leucine turnover and glucose rate of appearance decreased significantly only in alcoholics. There was a positive correlation between the change in leucine flux and ethanol disappearance rate and percentage metabolized to CO2 and H2O in alcoholics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9193347>Phase I trial of PN401, an oral prodrug of uridine, to prevent toxicity from fluorouracil in patients with advanced cancer.</a></h2><p>We performed a phase I study to determine the appropriate dose of PN401, a uridine (URD) prodrug, to use as a rescue agent for fluorouracil (FU) and than to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of FU when given with PN401.Patients with advanced cancer received oral PN401 as either a suspension or a tablet in escalating doses. A pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to determine which dose best achieved a target value of sustained levels of URD > or = 50 mumol/L. In the first phase of the study, all patients received a fixed dose of FU 600 mg/ as a rapid intravenous bolus followed by 10 doses of PN401 given at 6-hour intervals. PN401 therapy commenced 24 hours after FU. After determination of the appropriate dose of PN401, a second group of patients received escalating doses of FU with a fixed dose of PN401.Thirty-eight patients with advanced cancer received PN401 and FU. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that either 6.6 g of PN401 as an oral suspension or 6 g given in tablet form resulted in high bioavailability of URD, with sustained plasma concentrations greater than 50 mumol/L. In the second phase of the study, FU doses were escalated from 600 to 1,000 mg/. FU was given as a rapid intravenous bolus weekly for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest. The MTD of FU given in this fashion with PN401 rescue was 1,000 mg/, at which level two of six patients had neutropenic fever. FU at doses of 800 mg/ for 6 weeks was well tolerated without significant toxicity when given with PN401 rescue.Oral PN401 is well tolerated and total doses of 6 g every 6 hours yield sustained levels of URD in the target range of 50 mumol/L. The MTD of FU with PN401 rescue is 1,000 mg/ and the recommended dose for phase II trials is 800 mg/ given weekly for 6 weeks with dose escalation. Further studies to define better the appropriate interval for PN401 rescue and the appropriate dose of FU when given with biochemical modulation, such as with leucovorin, are indicated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672239>Mapping property distributions of molecular surfaces: algorithm and evaluation of a novel 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship technique.</a></h2><p>A novel molecular descriptor called MaP (mapping property distributions of molecular surfaces) is presented. It combines facile computation, translational and rotational invariance, and straightforward interpretability of the computed models. A three-step procedure is used to compute the MaP descriptor. First, an approximation to the molecular surface with equally distributed surface points is computed. Next, molecular properties are projected onto this surface. Finally, the distribution of surface properties is encoded into a translationally and rotationally invariant molecular descriptor that is based on radial distribution functions (distance-dependent count statistics). The calculated descriptor is correlated with biological data through chemometric regression techniques in combination with a variable selection. The latter is used to identify variables that are highly relevant for the model and hence for its interpretation. Three applications of the new descriptor are presented, each representing a different area of 3D-QSAR. For reasons of comparability, the new descriptor was tested on the steroid "benchmark" data set. Furthermore, a highly diverse data set with potentially eye-irritating compounds was studied, and third, a set of flexible structures with a modulating effect on the muscarinic M(2) receptor were studied. Not only were all models highly predictive but interpretation of the back-projected variables into the original molecular space led to biologically and chemically relevant conclusions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30060484>Decursinol Angelate Inhibits LPS-Induced Macrophage Polarization through Modulation of the NFκB and MAPK Signaling Pathways.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is considered the root cause of various inflammatory diseases, including cancers. Decursinol angelate (DA), a pyranocoumarin compound obtained from the roots of , has been reported to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of DA on the MAP kinase and NFκB signaling pathways and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were investigated in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage (Raw 264.7) cell lines. PMA induced the activation of the MAP kinase-NFκB pathway and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in differentiated monocytes. Treatment with DA inhibited the activation of MAP kinases and the translocation of NFκB, and decreased the expression and exogenous secretion of IL-1β and IL-6. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells were found to have increased expression of M1 macrophage-associated markers, such as NADPH oxidase (NOX) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the  macrophage-associated marker CD11b. LPS also activated pro-inflammatory cytokines and Erk-NFκB. Treatment with DA suppressed LPS-induced macrophage polarization and the inflammatory response by blocking Raf-ERK and the translocation of NFκB in Raw 264.7 cells. Treatment with DA also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6, NOX, and iNOS in Raw 264.7 cells. These results suggest that DA has the potential to inhibit macrophage polarization and inflammation by blocking the activation of pro-inflammatory signals. These anti-inflammatory effects of DA may contribute to its potential use as a therapeutic strategy against various inflammation-induced cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075175>Effects of Weight-Loss Interventions on Short-Chain  Acid Concentrations in Blood and Feces of Adults: A Systematic Review.</a></h2><p>Short-chain   (SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate), which are primarily derived from the gut microbiome, may exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and regulate energy homeostasis. It has been suggested that weight loss may affect  metabolism, but a systematic review of intervention studies is lacking. We aimed to systematically assess the effects of dietary, physical activity-based, and surgical weight-loss interventions among overweight [body mass index (BMI) 25-29.9 kg/)] or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/) adults (≥18 y) on concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total SCFAs in blood, urine, or feces. We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to April 30, 2018 for randomized and nonrandomized weight-loss trials among overweight or obese adults, in which the concentrations of individual and total SCFAs were assessed. A total of 9 studies consisting of 2 randomized parallel-arm trials, 4 crossover trials, and 3 nonrandomized clinical or surgical trials were included. In the majority of studies, changes in fecal  concentrations were assessed, whereas changes in serum SCFAs were reported from 1 trial. Individual and total  concentrations either remained unchanged or decreased significantly following weight loss. Three of the dietary interventions that resulted in decreased  concentrations were low (≤5% of energy) in total carbohydrates. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias. Decreases in  concentrations may accompany weight loss induced by bariatric surgery or dietary restriction among overweight or obese adults, particularly when carbohydrate intake is reduced. However, findings were inconsistent and based on studies with high to unclear risk of bias, and small sample sizes. Because measurements of fecal SCFAs may not be ideal due to limited sample standardization, well-powered trials with repeated blood measurements of SCFAs are required.

They ranged in age from 19 to 79 years and had a mean body mass index (SEM) of 32.35 +/- 1.26 kg/. Between 8 AM and 9 AM, blood samples were collected for 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate, 11-deoxycortisol, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (in reproductive age women), estrone, estradiol (in reproductive age women), free testosterone (in women), deoxycorticosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which were measured by radioimmunoassay, after chromatography if necessary. For intact, premenopausal women, measurement of the abnormal steroid metabolite or SHBG level was repeated during prednisone therapy (5 mg at bedtime) to document the likely adrenal origin of the abnormality. Men, women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy, and postmenopausal women had hyperandrogenism of adrenal origin by default. Clinical features included central obesity, acanthosis, hirsutism, alopecia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and oligomenorrhea.We found reversed estrone/estradiol ratios in 4 patients, decreased SHBG in 4, increased 17-hydroxy-pregnenolone in 8, increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone in 2, increased deoxycorticosterone in 2, increased DHEA sulfate in 1, increased 11-deoxycortisol in 4, increased androstenedione in 1, and reversed ratios of luteinizin hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone in 2. The bio-chemical abnormalities were corrected in 8 of 8 patients receiving metformin and in 2 of 2 patients receiving rosiglitazone.Insulin resistance caused by antipsychotic agents and divalproex is associated with adrenal hyperandrogenism. Metformin and rosiglitazone correct the biochemical abnormalities detected without compromising their psychotropic effect. Adrenal androgen synthesis may be increased by hyperinsulinemia-induced hyperphosphorylation of P450c17 alpha, resulting in an increase in its 17,20-lyase activity, which magnifies the effects of any distal steroidogenic enzyme defects. Treatment with metformin or rosiglitazone prevents excess adrenal androgen synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29196891>Sodium valproate modulates immune response by alternative activation of monocyte-derived macrophages in systemic lupus erythematosus.</a></h2><p>The anti-inflammatory role of macrophages in apoptotic cells (ACs) clearance is involved in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. The efferocytic capability of macrophages is altered by M1/ polarization. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are proposed to enhance the expansion of  macrophages. Sodium valproate (VPA) is an HDACi with different anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of HDACi by VPA on the polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines in SLE. We studied the ex vivo alterations of MDMs among 15 newly diagnosed SLE patients and 10 normal subjects followed by ACs and VPA treatments. M1/ polarization was assessed by expression of CD86/CD163, IL1-β, IDO-1, and MRC-1 among treated and non-treated MDMs. We also evaluated the production of IL-10, IL-12, TGF-β1, and TNF-α cytokines in the cell culture supernatants. CD163 was overexpressed upon VPA treatment, while CD86 showed no significant change. IL1-β and IDO-1 genes were significantly downregulated, and the mRNA expression of MRC-1 was increased among VPA-treated MDMs of SLE patients. The anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β1) were overproduced while TNF-α level was decreased in response to VPA. The population of classically activated macrophages was more prevalent among SLE patients and efferocytosis was defected. VPA could successfully enhance the anti-inflammatory immune response through alternative activation of MDMs in SLE patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16598797>Diffusivity of oxygen in aerobic granules.</a></h2><p>This work for the first time estimated apparent oxygen diffusivity (D(app)) of two types of aerobic granules, acetate-fed and phenol-fed, by probing the dissolved oxygen (DO) level at the granule center with a sudden change in the DO of the bulk liquid. With a high enough flow velocity across the granule to minimize the effects of external mass transfer resistance, the diffusivity coefficients of the two types of granules were estimated with reference to a one-dimensional diffusion model. The carbon source has a considerable effect on the granule diameter (d) and the oxygen diffusivity. The diffusivity coefficients were noted 1.24-2.28 x 10(-9) /s of 1.28-2.50 mm acetate-fed granules, and 2.50-7.65 x 10(-10) /s of 0.42-0.78 mm phenol-fed granules. Oxygen diffusivity declined with decreasing granule diameter, in particular, the diffusivity of acetate-fed granules is proportional to the size, whereas the diffusivity of phenol-fed granules is proportional to the square of granule diameter. The existence of large pores in granule, evidenced by FISH-CLSM imaging, was proposed to correspond to the noted size-dependent oxygen diffusivity. The phenol-fed granules exhibited a higher excellular polymer (ECP) content than the acetate-fed granules, hence yielding a lower oxygen diffusivity.2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25158597>Compound A, a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist, inhibits immunoinflammatory diabetes, induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin in mice.</a></h2><p>Type 1 diabetes is a multifactorial inflammatory disease that develops as a result of deregulated immune responses, causing progressive autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of pancreas. 2-((4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methyl) ethylammonium chloride, compound A (CpdA), is a selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist that displays strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. We investigated the therapeutic effectiveness of CpdA in a pharmacological model of type 1 diabetes in mice.The utility of CpdA in diabetes prevention was evaluated in vivo through its prophylactic administration to male C57BL/6 mice that received multiple low doses of streptozotocin for immunoinflammatory diabetes induction. The effect of CpdA on disease development was studied by measuring blood glucose and insulin level, histopathological examination, determination of the nature of infiltrating cells, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production, and signalling pathways.Prophylactic in vivo therapy with CpdA conferred protection against development of immunoinflammatory diabetes in mice by dampening the M1/Th1/Th17 immune response and switching it towards an anti-inflammatory /Th2/Treg profile, thus preserving beta cell function.Anti-diabetic properties of CpdA are mediated through modulation of immune cell-mediated pathways, but without triggering adverse events. These findings provide basic information for the therapeutic use of selective GR agonists in the amelioration of islet-directed autoimmunity.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19432306>[Low molecular weight carboxylic  in precipitation during the rainy season in the rural area of Anshun, West Guizhou Province].</a></h2><p>40 rainwater samples were collected at Anshun from June 2007 to October 2007 and analysed in terms of pH values, electrical conductivity, major inorganic anions and soluble low molecular weight carboxylic . The results showed that pH of individual precipitation events ranged from 3.57-7.09 and the volume weight mean pH value was 4.57. The most abundant carboxylic  were acetic (volume weight mean concentration 6.75 micromol x L(-1)) and formic (4.61 micromol x L(-1)) followed by oxalic (2.05 micromol x L(-1)). The concentration levels for these three species during summer especially June and July were comparatively high; it implied that organic  in Anshun may came primarily from emissions from growing vegetations or products of the photochemical reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Carboxylic  were estimated to account for 32.2% to the free acidity in precipitation. The contribution was higher than in Guiyang rainwater, which indicated contamination by industry in Guiyang was more than in Anshun. The remarkable correlation(p = 0.01) between formic acid and acetic acid suggest that they have similar sources or similar intensity but different sources. And the remarkable correlation (p = 0.01) between and formic acid and oxalic acid showed that the precursors of oxalic acid and formic acid had similar sources. During this period, the overall wet deposition of carboxylic  were 2.10 mmol/. And it appeared mainly in the summer, during which both concentration and contribution to free acidity were also relatively high. Consequently, it was necessary to control emission of organic  in the summer to reduce frequence of acid rain in Anshun.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10363631>Improved cardiovascular variables during acetate free biofiltration.</a></h2><p>Acetate free biofiltration (AFB) provides a well-tolerated and efficient renal replacement therapy. Replacement of most of the acetate by bicarbonate in standard hemodialysis has resulted in a decrease in intradialytic hypotensive episodes. This has been attributed to a decrease in the acetate-induced impairment of myocardial contractility. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the total absence of acetate in AFB would further enhance dialysis stability and improve cardiovascular status.In a long-term, randomized trial we included 11 patients on AFB and 9 patients on bicarbonate hemodialysis (HD) for one year. Patients were matched for age, sex and urea reduction rate, but not for the presence of hypertension or cardiovascular history. During each dialysis session blood pressure was measured automatically and the presence of significant hypotension was recorded. Antihypertensive medication was registered every three months. Before and at the end of the study M-mode echocardiography was performed and left ventricular mass index (LVMi) was calculated. Every six months serum lipids were measured.At baseline, mean arterial pressure (MAP) before and after dialysis, the percentage of hypotensive dialyses, LVMi and serum lipids did not differ between AFB and HD. Pre-dialysis MAP decreased in AFB (from 112.5 to 107 mmHg) and increased in HD (from 101.7 to 105.3 mmHg; p = 0.01, HD versus AFB). Postdialysis MAP remained stable in both groups (AFB 91.6 mmHg at 0 months and 90.6 mmHg at 12 months, for HD respectively 83.9 and 86.5 mmHg, NS). The percentage of hypotensive dialyses did not differ significantly between the groups during the study. LVMi decreased in AFB from 195.4 to 162.1 gr/ and increased in HD patients from 153.8 to 182.5 gr/ (p = 0.03 HD versus AFB). The number of antihypertensive medications per patient did not differ between groups. Serum lipids remained unchanged during the trial.In conclusion, AFB provided better control of pre-dialysis MAP compared to HD, and stable postdialysis MAP. The percentage of dialysis sessions with hypotension did not differ. LVMi decreased significantly in AFB, but rose in HD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969403>Effects of the roots of Liriope Platyphylla Wang Et tang on gastrointestinal motility function.</a></h2><p>Liriope platyphylla Wang et Tang continues to be used in Korea as a traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders related to constipation and abnormal GI motility.Because GI disorders, especially GI motility dysfunctions, are major lifelong problems, the authors investigated the effects of a water extract of the roots of L. platyphylla Wang et Tang (LPE) on the pacemaker potentials (PPTs) of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and on GI motility in male ICR mice.Enzymatic digestions were used to dissociate ICCs from small intestines, and the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was used to record PPTs generated by cultured ICCs in vitro. In vivo effects of LPE on GI motility were investigated by measuring intestinal transit rates (ITRs) of Evans blue in normal mice and in acetic acid (AA) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse models of GI motility dysfunction.LPE dose-dependently depolarized PPTs in ICCs. Pretreatment with methoctramine (a muscarinic  receptor antagonist) did not block LPE-induced PPT depolarization. However, pretreatment with 4-DAMP (a muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist) blocked LPE-induced PPT depolarization. In addition, treatment with LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) also blocked LPE-induced PPT depolarization. Intracellular GDPβS inhibited LPE-induced PPT depolarization, and LPE-induced PPT depolarization was found to occur in a phospholipase C (PLC)- and a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. Pretreatment with Ca(2+)free solution or thapsigargin (a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor in endoplasmic reticulum) abolished PPTs, and under these conditions, LPE did not depolarize ICC PPTs. In normal mice, ITRs were significantly and dose-dependently increased by LPE (0.01-1g/kg administered intragastrically (i.g.)). In addition, LPE (i.g.) significantly recovered GI motility dysfunctions in both animal models.LPE dose-dependently depolarizes ICC PPTs through M3 receptors via external and internal Ca(2+)regulation and via G protein-, PI3K-, PLC- and PKC- dependent pathways in vitro. Also, in vivo, LPE increased ITRs in treatment naïve mice and our two mouse models of GI dysfunction. Therefore, this study shows that LPE offers a basis for the development of a prokinetic agent that prevents or alleviates GI motility dysfunctions.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In rodent islets, PGD2 is produced in response to glucose, suggesting that the PGD2-GPR44/DP2 axis may play a role in human islet function during hyperglycemia. Consequently, the aim of this work was to elucidate the insulinotropic role of GPR44 antagonism in vitro in human beta-cells and in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.We determined the drive on PGD2 secretion by glucose and IL-1beta, as well as, the impact on insulin secretion by pharmacological GPR44/DP2 antagonism (AZD1981) in human islets and beta-cells in vitro. To test if metabolic control would be improved by antagonizing a hyperglycemia-driven increased PGD2 tone, we performed a proof-of-mechanism study in 20 T2DM patients (average 54 years, HbA1c 9.4%, BMI 31.6 kg/). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study consisted of two three-day treatment periods (AZD1981 or placebo) separated by a three-day wash-out period. Mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) and intravenous graded glucose infusion (GGI) was performed at start and end of each treatment period. Assessment of AZD1981 pharmacokinetics, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and PGD2 pathway biomarkers were performed.We found (1) that PGD2 is produced in human islet in response to high glucose or IL-1beta, but likely by stellate cells rather than endocrine cells; (2) that PGD2 suppresses both glucose and GLP-1 induced insulin secretion in vitro; and (3) that the GPR44/DP2 antagonist (AZD1981) in human beta-cells normalizes insulin secretion. However, AZD1981 had no impact on neither glucose nor incretin dependent insulin secretion in humans (GGI AUC C-peptide 1-2h and MMTT AUC Glucose 0-4h LS mean ratios vs placebo of 0.94 (80% CI of 0.90-0.98, p = 0.12) and 0.99 (90% CI of 0.94-1.05, p = 0.45), despite reaching the expected antagonist exposure.Pharmacological inhibition of the PGD2-GPR44/DP2 axis has no major impact on the modulation of acute insulin secretion in T2DM patients.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16180406>Simultaneous wastewater treatment and biological electricity generation.</a></h2><p>It is possible to directly generate electricity using bacteria while accomplishing wastewater treatment in processes based on microbial fuel cell technologies. When bacteria oxidize a substrate, they remove electrons. Current generation is made possible by keeping bacteria separated from oxygen, but allowing the bacteria growing on an anode to transfer electrons to the counter electrode (cathode) that is exposed to air. In this paper, several advances are discussed in this technology, and a calculation is made on the potential for electricity recovery. Assuming a town of 100,000 people generate 16.4 x 10(6) L of wastewater, a wastewater treatment plant has the potential to become a 2.3 MW power plant if all the energy is recovered as electricity. So far, power densities are low, resulting in power generation rates of 150 kW/. Progress is being made that we believe may result in as much as 0.5 MW from wastewater treatment. The generation of electricity during wastewater treatment may profoundly affect the approach to anaerobic treatment technologies used in wastewater treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29343083>Polarized macrophage subsets differentially express the drug efflux transporters MRP1 and BCRP, resulting in altered HIV production.</a></h2><p>Introduction Macrophages play an important role in HIV, where they are a cellular reservoir. Macrophages are polarized into two phenotypes: pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and anti-inflammatory  macrophages, which may have altered expression of drug efflux transporters, including BCRP and MRP1. These differences may result in subtherapeutic concentrations of antiretrovirals inside of macrophages and viral replication. Methods U937 and U1 cells were polarized to the M1 or  phenotype via IFN-γ and LPS, or IL-4, IL-13, and LPS. Transporter expression was assessed via PCR and Western blotting, and transporter function was assessed via fluorescent dye assays. Transporter function was blocked with the inhibitors MK571 or KO143. Protein expression was confirmed in monocyte-derived macrophages. p24 production was assessed in U1 cells via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results mRNA and protein analysis demonstrated higher expression of MRP1 in M1 macrophages, while BCRP expression was downregulated in M1 macrophages. Treatment with inhibitors of transporter function decreased the difference in intracellular fluorescence between polarized macrophages. Differences in protein expression, which were observed with U937 cells, were confirmed in monocyte-derived macrophages. M1, but not  cells treated with MK571, showed decreased p24 production, consistent with reported MRP1 transporter expression. Conclusions These results support our hypothesis that there is differential expression of MRP1 and BCRP on M1 and  polarized macrophages and suggests that these differences may result in altered intracellular concentrations of antiretrovirals in macrophages and alter viral production in these cells. Targeting these differences may be a strategy to decrease viral replication in HIV-infected individuals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17612189>Substrate-enhanced microbial fuel cells for improved remote power generation from sediment-based systems.</a></h2><p>A sediment microbial fuel cell (MFC) produces electricity through the bacterial oxidation of organic matter contained in the sediment. The power density is limited, however, due in part to the low organic matter content of most marine sediments. To increase power generation from these devices, particulate substrates were added to the anode compartment. Three materials were tested: two commercially available chitin products differing in particle size and biodegradability (Chitin 20 and Chitin 80) and cellulose powder. Maximum power densities using chitin in this substrate-enhanced sediment MFC (SEM) were 76 +/- 25 and 84 +/- 10 mW/ (normalized to cathode projected surface area) for Chitin 20 and Chitin 80, respectively, versus less than 2 mW/ for an unamended control. Power generation over a 10 day period averaged 64 +/- 27 mW/  (Chitin 20) and 76 +/- 15 mW/ (Chitin 80). With cellulose, a similar maximum power was initially generated (83 +/- 3 mW/), but power rapidly decreased after only 20 h. Maximum power densities over the next 5 days varied substantially among replicate cellulose-fed reactors, ranging from 29 +/- 12 to 62 +/- 23 mW/. These results suggest a new approach to power generation in remote areas based on the use of particulate substrates. While the longevity of the SEM was relatively short in these studies, it is possible to increase operation times by controlling particle size, mass, and type of material needed to achieve desired power levels that could theoretically be sustained over periods of years or even decades.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8196158>Haemo-dialysis/-filtration using sodium bicarbonate depresses cardiac function in critically ill patients with acute renal failure.</a></h2><p>The effect of sodium bicarbonate haemodialysis or haemofiltration on cardiac function was prospectively studied in 8 patients with acute renal failure. All of the patients exhibited consciousness disturbance and seven patients were on mechanical ventilation. All but one of the patients demonstrated moderate hyperlactataemia and seven patients were receiving vasoactive amine support. Arterial and mixed venous gas analysis and haemodynamic measurements were performed before and after haemodialysis/-filtration treatment. The buffer was changed in a randomised order between bicarbonate and acetate and 11 crossover studies were completed. After treatment with bicarbonate, the cardiac index and stroke index decreased significantly (4.0 +/- 0.3 to 3.4 +/- 0.4 L/ min/, p < 0.05 and 39.6 +/- 2.5 to 32.9 +/- 1.8 L/, p < 0.05), whereas no significant changes were observed in cardiac index or stroke index after treatment with acetate. Therefore, the post-dialytic percent changes of cardiac index, stroke index and left ventricular stroke work index were significantly decreased after bicarbonate sessions, as compared to after acetate sessions. Haemo-dialysis/-filtration using sodium bicarbonate can depress cardiac function in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with disturbed consciousness, and in those who are receiving vasoactive amine support due to uncompromised haemodynamics associated with hyperlactataemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542165>Methanol-induced chain termination in poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) biopolymers: molecular weight control.</a></h2><p>A systematic study was performed to demonstrate the impact of methanol (MeOH) on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthesis and molecular weight (MW). Glycerine was used as the primary carbon source with varying concentrations of MeOH. Methanol retarded but did not completely inhibit growth and PHB production in Pseudomonas oleovorans. Proton NMR analysis revealed that the PHB polymers were end-capped with methoxy chemical groups causing MW reductions. The MW decreases were contingent upon the initial MeOH media concentration and the duration of the fermentations. The largest impact occurred at an initial MeOH concentration of 0.10% (w/v) where the number average molecular weights (Mn) decreased by 39%, 55%, and 72% in the 48, 72 and 96 h cultures, respectively. Diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy revealed a diffusivity (D) increase in the smaller molecular weight polymers with the PHB synthesized in the presence of 0.85% MeOH (72 h post-inoculation) having a D value of 0.66×10(-10) /s. Diffusivity increases indicate a reduction in hydrodynamic radii (Rhz) consistent with shorter chain-lengths.

Serial abdominal PET scans were performed on normal and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2)-deficient rats after intravenous injection of (15R)-16-m-[(11)C]tolyl-17,18,19,20-tetranorisocarbacyclin methyl ester (15R-[(11)C] TIC-Me) as a radiotracer. 15R-[(11)C]TIC-Me was rapidly converted to its acid form in blood within 10 s. PET scans revealed that 15R-[(11)C]TIC was localized mainly in the liver within 5 min of injection. By 90 min, total radioactivity in bile of Mrp2-deficient rats was significantly reduced compared with controls. Metabolite analysis by thin-layer chromatography autoradiography showed that 15R-[(11)C]TIC is converted to at least three metabolites (M1, , and M3), and  and M3 are the major metabolites in plasma and bile, respectively. Hepatic uptake clearance of total radioactivity in normal rats was close to the hepatic blood flow rate and slightly higher than that in Mrp2-deficient rats. The intrinsic canalicular efflux clearance of M3 (CL(int,bile,M3)) in Mrp2-deficient rats was decreased to 12% of controls, whereas clearance of  was moderately decreased (54%). An in vitro transport assay detected ATP-dependent uptake of both  and M3 by rat Mrp2-expressing membrane vesicles. These results demonstrated that M3 is excreted primarily into the bile by Mrp2 in normal rats.

The VPA-exposed animals had revealed late effects on granule cell lineages, involving progenitor cell proliferation and synaptic plasticity. To investigate the possibility whether hippocampal neurogenesis in postpubertal rats in a protocol of 28-day repeated exposure is affected in relation with the property of a developmental neurotoxicant by developmental exposure, VPA was orally administered to 5-week-old male rats at 0, 200, 800 and 900 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. At 900 mg/kg, GFAP cells increased in number, but DCX cells decreased in number in the granule cell lineages. Moreover, CHRNB2 cells and NeuN postmitotic neurons decreased in number in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Transcript level examined at 900 mg/kg in the dentate gyrus was increased with Kit, but decreased with Dpsyl3, Btg2, Pvalb and Chrnb2. These results suggest that VPA increased type-1 stem cells in relation to the activation of SCF-KIT signaling and suppression of BTG2-mediated antiproliferative effect on stem cells. VPA also decreased type-3 progenitor cells and immature granule cells probably in relation with PVALB interneuron hypofunction and reduced CHRNB2 interneuron subpopulation in the hilus, as well as with suppression of BTG2-mediated terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Thus, the disruption pattern of VPA by postpubertal exposure was different from developmental exposure. However, disruption itself can be detected, suggesting availability of hippocampal neurogenesis in detecting developmental neurotoxicants in a 28-day toxicity study.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, we have shown that activation of p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB is necessary but not sufficient for triggering efficient HIV gene expression in response to UV. Here we demonstrate that St. John's wort is a potent inhibitor of the UV-induced activation of HIV gene expression in HeLa cells. Stably transfected HIVcat/HeLa cells were preincubated with different amounts (25-100 microl) of St. John's wort or gingko biloba extracts for 30 min, then irradiated with UV (30 J/). In contrast to ginkgo biloba, St. John's wort inhibited the UV-induced HIV gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, preincubation with St. John's wort (10, 20, and 30 microl) for 30 min before UV (30 J/) irradiation, PMA- and UV-induced NF-kappaB activation was completely blocked, whereas ginkgo biloba did not affect the PMA- and UV-induced NF-kappaB activation in HeLa cells. UV activation of p38 MAP kinase was not inhibited by St. John's wort or by ginkgo biloba. However, we found that p38 MAP kinase and JNK1 and -2 were activated by St. John's wort, but p44/42 MAP kinase was not activated by St. John's wort in HeLa cells. Hypericin an active ingredient in St. John's wort also inhibited the UV activation of HIV gene expression in HeLa cells. These results firmly confirm that St. John's wort is a potent inhibitor of the UV-induced activation of HIV gene expression in HeLa cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12656935>Valproate, bipolar disorder and polycystic ovarian syndrome.</a></h2><p>Persons with bipolar disorder are often overweight and cluster risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Some antibipolar agents adversely impact upon weight and the lipid milieu. Recent data suggest that valproic acid, a commonly prescribed mood stabilizer, may be associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This adverse event has not been systematically studied in bipolar disorder.Thirty-eight female subjects, aged 18-50 years, meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or II disorder, in any phase of illness were evaluated. Eighteen females received valproate (sodium valproate and valproic acid) and 20 females received lithium. Patients completed questions regarding their menstrual, reproductive and medical histories. During the follicular phase they were assessed for weight, body mass index (BMI kg/), and changes in the reproductive endocrine milieu that included morning estradiol, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, free testosterone, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The blood was also analyzed for fasting metabolic parameters which included total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding-protein 1 (IGFBP-1), fasting blood glucose and morning leptin.Nine (50%) of the valproate-treated females had menstrual abnormalities versus three (15%) of the lithium-treated females (p < 0.05). Valproate-treated females had significantly higher levels of follicular phase androgen concentrations than lithium-treated females (p < 0.05). Nine (50%) of females who were overweight (BMI > or = 25 kg/) and with a history of menstrual irregularities also exhibited laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism (p < 0.05). Persons receiving valproate exhibited significant increases in fasting biochemical parameters suggestive of an adverse metabolic syndrome (p < 0.05). Leptin levels were significantly elevated in the valproate-treated females (p < 0.05).In this pilot, open-label cross-sectional study, valproate-treated females exhibited higher rates of menstrual abnormalities and biochemical evidence of both hyperandrogenism and adverse metabolic parameters when compared with lithium-treated females. These preliminary data suggest that valproate may, in some predisposed females, adversely impact upon the reproductive endocrine milieu and result in aspects of the metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2020339>Effect of acetate on blood metabolites and glucose tolerance during haemodialysis in uraemic non-diabetic and diabetic subjects.</a></h2><p>We examined changes in blood concentrations of glucose, acetate and other blood intermediary metabolites as well as the disposal of an intravenous glucose load during successive glucose-free acetate and control bicarbonate haemodialysis in random order, in non-diabetic and diabetic subjects. Plasma acetate levels increased about 10-fold in both the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects during the 1st hour of acetate dialysis. This was accompanied by about 5-fold increase in the levels of the ketone bodies-acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Ketone body levels did not change during bicarbonate dialysis. Additionally, the changes in blood levels of glucose, non-esterified  , pyruvate, lactate, glycerol and insulin were similar with either bicarbonate or acetate treatment in each subject group. The KG rate constant of glucose disposal after intravenous glucose (10 g/ body surface area) given after the 1st hour of a 5-hour haemodialysis was similarly unchanged with acetate or bicarbonate dialysis, despite the additional caloric load likely from the high blood levels of acetate obtained during acetate haemodialysis. We conclude that the major metabolic effect of acetate during haemodialysis is an increase in blood ketone body levels. Glucose utilisation, as assessed from the KG rate constant of glucose disposal or changes in blood lactate and pyruvate levels, was not affected by the high acetate levels attained during dialysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1928339>Use of mass isotopomer distributions in secreted lipids to sample lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool in vivo in humans.</a></h2><p>Measurement of hepatic  acid (FA) and cholesterol synthesis has been limited by lack of access to the precursor pool, cytosolic acetyl-CoA. We present a method for inferring the enrichment of the true hepatic lipogenic precursor pool in humans using the frequency distribution of mass isotopomers within enriched circulating polymers of acetyl-CoA [very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-palmitate, VLDL-stearate]. Human subjects were infused intravenously (n = 16) with [1-13C]- or [2-13C]acetate. Oral sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was administered concurrently, and the acetylated conjugate (SMX acetate) was used to estimate independently the hepatic cytosolic acetyl-CoA enrichment. Isotopomer frequencies in VLDL-FA were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, whereas high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure enrichments in SMX acetate. Based on the excess /excess M1 ratio in VLDL-FA, calculated acetyl-CoA enrichments were 5.59 +/- 0.33 molar percent excess (MPE), whereas SMX acetate enrichments were 5.38 +/- 0.31 MPE (the 2 methods were not significantly different). Mass isotopomer-calculated and SMX acetate-measured estimates of acetyl-CoA enrichments correlated very closely in individual subjects (r2 = 0.93; P less than 0.0001). De novo hepatic lipogenesis can be measured using isotopomer-calculated precursor enrichments compared with measured incorporation in specific isotopomers of VLDL-FA. In summary, excess isotopomer frequencies in secreted lipids provide a non-invasive technique for estimating hepatic cytosolic acetyl-CoA enrichments in humans in vivo and correlate closely with enrichments observed using the xenobiotic probe technique. Isotopomeric distributions represent a new strategy for accurate measurement of macromolecule synthesis that may be applicable to other classes of molecules besides lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11926382>Alterations of the sympathetic nervous system and metabolic performance of the cardiomyopathic heart.</a></h2><p>Little is known about the effects of altered sympathetic innervation on the efficiency of the cardiomyopathic heart. Thus, it was the aim of this study to determine non-invasively the relationship between the metabolic cost of cardiac work and alterations of the sympathetic nervous system. In ten patients with chronic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular function and geometry were assessed by tomographic radionuclide angiography. Myocardial oxidative metabolism was quantified by the clearance constant k(mono) for carbon-11 acetate, determined by positron emission tomography (PET). Cardiac efficiency was then estimated by the work-metabolic index [WMI = stroke volume index x heart rate x systolic pressure/k(mono)]. Additionally, myocardial presynaptic sympathetic innervation was investigated in the same PET session using 11C-hydroxyephedrine, and plasma norepinephrine levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The WMI was 3.0+/-1.3 mmHg x ml x 10(6)/ and correlated significantly with left ventricular ejection fraction (19%+/-10%; r=0.66, P<0.04) and peripheral vascular resistance (3,638+/-1,085 dynes x s/cm5; r=-0.75, P<0.01). Cardiac hydroxyephedrine retention, reflecting integrity of presynaptic innervation, was abnormally low in 58%+/-38% of the left ventricle. Cardiac hydroxyephedrine retention (r=0.65, P<0.05) and plasma norepinephrine concentration (r=-0.80, P<0.01) both correlated significantly with the WMI. At multivariate stepwise linear regression, only plasma norepinephrine and peripheral vascular resistance were independent determinants of the WMI. In conclusion, metabolic performance of the cardiomyopathic heart decreases with increasing alterations of the sympathetic nervous system. Increasing afterload and effects of systemic sympathetic activation, however, seem to play a dominant role while direct alterations of cardiac presynaptic sympathetic innervation are not independently associated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27165547>Increased olfactory bulb acetylcholine bi-directionally modulates glomerular odor sensitivity.</a></h2><p>The glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb (OB) receives heavy cholinergic input from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and expresses both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. However, the effects of ACh on OB glomerular odor responses remain unknown. Using calcium imaging in transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP2 in the mitral/tufted cells, we investigated the effect of ACh on the glomerular responses to increasing odor concentrations. Using HDB electrical stimulation and in vivo pharmacology, we find that increased OB ACh leads to dynamic, activity-dependent bi-directional modulation of glomerular odor response due to the combinatorial effects of both muscarinic and nicotinic activation. Using pharmacological manipulation to reveal the individual receptor type contributions, we find that  muscarinic receptor activation increases glomerular sensitivity to weak odor input whereas nicotinic receptor activation decreases sensitivity to strong input. Overall, we found that ACh in the OB increases glomerular sensitivity to odors and decreases activation thresholds. This effect, along with the decreased responses to strong odor input, reduces the response intensity range of individual glomeruli to increasing concentration making them more similar across the entire concentration range. As a result, odor representations are more similar as concentration increases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16674697>Comparison of three methods for enamel protein extraction in different developmental phases of rat lower incisors.</a></h2><p>Protein extraction methods [urea, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and acetic acid] were compared for protein recovery from rat incisor developing enamel in the S phase (intermediate/late secretion), M1 phase (early maturation),  phase (intermediate maturation), and M3 phase (final maturation). We compared the protein recoveries with the percentage of enamel matrix dry weight burnt off by incineration. Our results indicate that TCA and urea were equally efficient for the extraction of S-stage proteins (85% and 90% recovery, respectively), while urea was the best for M1-stage proteins (92% recovery), and TCA the best for -stage (99% recovery) and M3-stage (60% recovery) proteins. The other methods yielded less than 30% recovery in comparison to incineration for  and M3 stages. The fact that urea extraction works well in the S and M1 stages and not thereafter is probably related to the changes in the proteins during enamel development and the amount of mineral that needs to be dissolved. TCA is the single method that effectively recovered proteins from all developmental stages of the rat incisor enamel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692672>The short chain  acid receptor GPR43 regulates inflammatory signals in adipose tissue -type macrophages.</a></h2><p>The regulation of inflammatory responses within adipose tissue by various types of immune cells is closely related to tissue homeostasis and progression of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43), which is activated by short-chain   (SCFAs), is known to be most abundantly expressed in white adipose tissue and to modulate metabolic processes. Although GPR43 is also expressed in a wide variety of immune cells, whether and how GPR43 in adipose tissue immune cells regulates the inflammatory responses and metabolic homeostasis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of GPR43 in adipose tissue macrophages by using Gpr43-deficient mice and transgenic mice with adipose-tissue-specific overexpression of GPR43. We found that GPR43 activation by  resulted in induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in anti-inflammatory -type macrophages within adipose tissue. By contrast, this effect was not noted in inflammatory M1-type macrophages, suggesting that GPR43 plays distinct functions depending on macrophage types. Local TNF-α signaling derived from steady-state adipose tissue is associated with proper tissue remodeling as well as suppression of fat accumulation. Thus, GPR43-involving mechanism that we have identified supports maintenance of adipose tissue homeostasis and increase in metabolic activity. This newly identified facet of GPR43 in macrophages may have clinical implications for immune-metabolism related episodes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705237>β-Hydroxybutyrate protects from alcohol-induced liver injury via a Hcar2-cAMP dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation resulting in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs unpredictably after many years of excess alcohol intake. The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease.We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection.Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the  phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of  related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards  related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by BHB.Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH.Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and β-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone in serum were measured every 2 weeks, and phosphate binder dosages were adjusted, if needed. Serum lipid and vitamin concentrations were measured at the beginning and end of each treatment period. The primary end point was the decrease in serum phosphorus levels after 8 weeks of treatment.Forty-four patients were screened. Altogether, data for 18 patients (5 girls) aged 12.4 +/- 4.1 years were used for the crossover analysis. There was no significant difference in serum phosphorus levels at 8 weeks after the start of treatment in both groups. Total cholesterol (-27%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-34%) levels decreased significantly with sevelamer treatment (P < 0.02 and P < 0.005). An increased incidence of hypercalcemia (P < 0.0005) was observed with calcium acetate treatment, whereas metabolic acidosis was more frequent with sevelamer treatment (P < 0.005).Treatment of children with CKD with sevelamer and calcium acetate provides similar phosphorus level control. The marked decrease in lipid levels and lower rate of hypercalcemia may augment the long-term benefit of sevelamer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15520475>The antidepressant effects of risperidone and olanzapine in bipolar disorder.</a></h2><p>To describe the antidepressant effectiveness of olanzapine and risperidone and compare their tolerability when employed adjunctively in bipolar I/II disorder.In an observational study, twenty-one ambulatory subjects with DSM-IV defined bipolar I/II disorder, in any phase of the illness, openly received adjunctive risperidone or olanzapine. The primary efficacy parameters were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and the Maier and Philips Severity Subscale. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) along with the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). Response was defined as a significant change from baseline to endpoint in the total mean HDRS-17 score. The primary tolerability parameters were the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) along with changes in weight and body mass index (BMI-kg/). Patients were evaluated prospectively with repeated monthly assessments for up to 6 months.Eleven patients openly received risperidone; 10 received olanzapine adjunctive to either lithium or divalproex. Total mean HDRS-17 scores significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint in both groups (p=0.001), with the mean HDRS-17 total scores falling from 17(SD=3.2) to 5(SD=1.5) by 6 months in the risperidone-treated group and from 18 (SD=1.9) to 7 (SD=2.0) in the olanzapine-treated group. Differences between the risperidone-treated group and the olanzapine-treated group were not significant at 6 months (p=0.754). The mean doses of study medication were 2.88 (SD=1.6) mg/day for the risperidone-treated group and 12.69 (SD=2.3) mg/day for the olanzapine-treated group. Both risperidone and olanzapine were generally well tolerated. No patients developed tardive dyskinesia. Significant weight gain was experienced by patients in both groups [mean weight gain at endpoint was 5.9 kg in risperidone (p=0.023) and 11.3 kg in olanzapine (p=0.001)]. There was a significant difference in weight gain between the risperidone-treated group and the olanzapine-treated group (p=0.001).These pilot data, from the first prospective comparison study of risperidone and olanzapine in bipolar disorder, suggest that adjunctive administration of either agent may reduce depressive symptom severity. No subjects receiving risperidone or olanzapine developed tardive dyskinesia. Both compounds imparted substantial weight gain with significantly more weight gain accrual with olanzapine. As this was an observational study, the antidepressant effect and tolerability profile of these compounds requires validation via double-blind placebo controlled investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2040609>Relationship between precursor enrichment and ratio of excess /excess M1 isotopomer frequencies in a secreted polymer.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9558882>[A case of anticonvulsive drug-induced liver injury accompanied by a transient appearance of antimitochondrial antibody, ].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23271642>The effect of hexose ratios on metabolite production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains obtained from the spontaneous fermentation of mezcal.</a></h2><p>Mezcal from Tamaulipas (México) is produced by spontaneous alcoholic fermentation using Agave spp. musts, which are rich in fructose.

Roles of enteric neurons, cholinergic receptors, calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and extracellular calcium in the -induced responses were investigated by incubating muscle strips with tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L), atropine (1 micromol/L), ryanodine (10 micromol/L), nifedipine (1 micromol/L), ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetate (EGTA; 0.1 mmol/L), or an extracellular calcium-depleted (zero extracellular calcium) solution prior to the addition of propionate or butyrate.Incubation with  elicited isometric stress responses (0.25 to 2.15 x 10(4) N/) in colonic longitudinal smooth muscle. Maximal responses to butyrate and propionate (50 mmol/L) were 37 and 23%, respectively, of the maximal AMCh response. Acetate was least effective in stimulating contractile responses. Tetrodotoxin and atropine did not affect -induced contractions. Nifedipine and zero extracellular calcium solution abolished responses to butyrate and propionate, whereas EGTA attenuated (> 60%) but did not abolish those responses. Ryanodine did not affect -induced contractile responses. The  did not affect colonic circular smooth muscle.

A dispersed phase consisting of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and ethyl acetate was emulsified in a poly(vinyl alcohol) aqueous solution for a predetermined time ranging from 2 to 9, 16, 23, 30, 40, 50, or 60 minutes. Ethyl acetate was then quickly extracted to transform emulsion droplets into solidified microspheres, and their size distribution was determined. This experimental design allowed quantification of the size distribution of emulsion droplets over the course of emulsification. When emulsification time was extended from 2 to 60 minutes, the emulsion droplets decreased in size from 98.1 to 50.3 microm and their surface area increased from 0.07 to 0.29 /g. Overall, prolonging emulsification time up to 60 minutes resulted in the progressive evolution of smaller emulsion droplets (1-60 microm) and the simultaneous disappearance of larger ones (> 81 microm). Increases in the total number of microspheres and their surface area were caused mainly by continuous fragmentation of emulsion droplets before ethyl acetate extraction. The increase in the smaller microsphere population might also be due in part to shrinkage of microspheres. These results show that the onset of ethyl acetate extraction influenced the kinetics of the breakup and formation of emulsion droplets, thereby affecting to a great extent the size distribution of microspheres.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10509770>Effect of consumption of a ready-to-eat breakfast cereal containing inulin on the intestinal milieu and blood lipids in healthy male volunteers.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of a breakfast cereal containing inulin on blood lipids and colonic ecosystem in normolipidemic young men.Department of Food Science and Microbiology,University of Milan, Italy.Twelve healthy male volunteers, age 23.3 +/- 0.5 y, body mass index (BMI) 25.7 +/- 1.2 kg/ (mean +/- s.e.m.).Subjects consumed daily, for three periods of four weeks, 50 g of a rice-based ready-to-eat cereal (placebo) and the same cereal containing 18% inulin (test) in substitution of their habitual breakfast, then returned to the habitual diet (wash-out). They followed no other dietary restrictions.No changes in body weight, dietary habits, faecal and bile acid output, faecal short-chain  acid () and faecal pH, were observed at the end of each period, whereas plasma total cholesterol and triacylglycerols significantly decreased at the end of test period by 7.9 +/- 5.4 (P < 0.05) and 21.2 +/- 7.8% (P < 0.005) respectively.

Both drugs were taken until intracavitary therapy was finished. Pelvic external beam radiation and low-dose rate brachytherapy were administered at a total cumulative dose to point A of at least 85 Gy. Weekly cisplatin at 40 mg/ was delivered for six cycles.Twenty-two patients were included and 18 (82%) patients completed treatment. Mean dose to point A was 84.6 + 2.2.

Since off-patent chemotherapeutic drugs can be used and given the low toxicity profile of this approach, metronomics appears to be an invaluable alternative to bring affordable targeted therapies in low-income countries.The aim of this study was to report on the preliminary efficacy and safety of a metronomic vincristine/cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/valproic acid regimen given to children with refractory cancer of various tumor types or with a very advanced disease.This prospective, single-center study evaluated the use of a metronomics protocol, consisting of a first cycle of weekly vincristine 1.5 mg/ (days: 1, 8, 15 and 22), daily cyclophosphamide 25 mg/ (days: 1-21), twice weekly methotrexate 15 mg/m² (days: 21-42) and daily valproic acid (30 mg/kg/d) followed by a 1-week break. For the following cycles, vincristine was administrated only at week 1 and 5 of the cycle. This treatment was proposed to children with refractory disease and patients who were not eligible for the protocols available in the hospital. Adverse events were determined through laboratory analyses and investigator observations.From January 2010 to January 2011, 7 children (mean age: 5.4 ± 3 years old) were treated. Most frequent diagnosis was retinoblastoma. Two partial responses were observed in patients with neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma. These two patients are alive with stable disease at last follow-up (6 and 26 months, respectively) after stopping treatment.Metronomics allows treating patients with advanced or refractory or relapsing disease and the introduction of targeted treatments in low-income countries. The potential of metronomics in children and young adults living in middle- and low-income countries warrants further larger studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23435514>Potassium, zinc, and magnesium complexes of a bulky OOO-tridentate bis(phenolate) ligand: synthesis, structures, and studies of cyclic ester polymerisation.</a></h2><p>Reaction of the OOO-coordinating tridentate bis(phenolate) protio-ligand 2,2'-{oxybis(methylene)}bis{4,6-di(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)phenol} (L(O3)-H2), with 1 equiv. of KN(SiMe3)2 in toluene or THF yielded [K(L(O3)-H)] (1) or [K(L(O3)-H)(THF)] (2), respectively. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of 1 and 2 revealed mononuclear structures with the phenyl rings of the bulky ligand displaying stabilising π-interactions to the potassium centre. L(O3)-H2 also reacts with 1 equiv. of ZnEt2 or Mg(n)Bu2 to give [(L(O3))2] (M = Zn (3) or Mg (4)) in good yield. The molecular structures of complex 3 and 4 reveal dinuclear species in which the metal centres are tetra-coordinated to the three oxygen atoms of one L(O3) ligand, and to the bridging oxygen atom of one phenolate group of another. Complexes 1-4 are catalysts for ring-opening polymerisation of ε-caprolactone and L- and rac-lactide in the presence of benzyl alcohol (BnOH) and also other initiators to give the corresponding polyesters. Kinetic studies for the ROP of ε-caprolactone using 3 and BnOH gives an unusual rate expression R(p) = -d[CL]/dt = k(p)[BnOH]0[3]0(0.5) for which a tentative kinetic model is proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233455>Hepatic metabolic response of Holstein cows in early and mid lactation is altered by nutrient supply and lipopolysaccharide in vitro.</a></h2><p>The metabolic response of the liver during periods of inflammation is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of nutrient supply and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge on hepatic intermediate metabolism of early- and mid-lactation cows by employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with stable isotope tracer. Twelve multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in early (n = 6; 12 ± 4.2 d in milk) and mid (n = 6; 115 ± 13.5 d in milk) lactation were used for this study. Liver biopsies were performed on all cows. Liver slices (40-60 mg) were incubated in a 37°C water bath for 2 h with either control (phosphate buffered saline), pyruvate (PYR; 1mM unlabeled pyruvate and 1mM [(13)C3]pyruvate), pyruvate + propionate (PYR+PRO; 1mM unlabeled pyruvate, 1mM [(13)C3]pyruvate, and 2mM sodium propionate), or pyruvate + AA (PYR+AA; 1mM unlabeled pyruvate, 1mM [(13)C3]pyruvate, and 2mM AA solution), and LPS (0.0 or 0.2 μg/mL) was added to flasks per treatment. Enrichment of isotopomers in metabolic equilibrium with Krebs cycle intermediates was assessed. Pyruvate fluxes and the enzymatic activity of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) versus pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were calculated. Media were analyzed for concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), glucose, and haptoglobin. Data were analyzed as randomized block (stage of lactation) design in a factorial arrangement of nutrient treatments by LPS dose. Challenge with LPS increased the mRNA abundance of TNF-α, haptoglobin, and serum amyloid A 2, and the concentration of TNF-α in media. Challenge with LPS increased mRNA abundance of PC but reduced the enrichment of (13)C1[M1] and (13)C2[]alanine and tended to reduce the enzymatic activity of PEPCK. Incubation with PYR+PRO and PYR+AA increased the flux of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. However, only PYR+PRO increased the enzymatic activity of PEPCK and PDH versus PC and decreased the mRNA abundance of PC. Cows in early lactation tended to receive a greater contribution of pyruvate to the oxaloacetate flux via the lower PDH versus PC activity and a higher mRNA abundance of PC than cows in mid lactation. Our results suggest that regardless of stage of lactation and nutrient supplement, hepatic gluconeogenesis was impaired during inflammation. Further research examining how various nutrients support liver function and improve the immunometabolic response of liver during inflammation is warranted.Copyright © 2015 American Dairy Science Association.

Previously, we have identified heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A (HSPA1A, also known as HSP72) as the most overexpressed protein in valproic acid (VPA)-resistant cell lines. KNK437, an inhibitor of heat shock proteins, enhanced the cytotoxic effects of not only VPA but also vorinostat, another HDACi. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of HSP72 in resistance against HDACi remain largely unknown.The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms underlying the role of HSP72 in HDACi resistance.We established an HSP72-overexpressing Jurkat cell line and used it to assess the functional role of HSP72 following treatment with the HDACi vorinostat and VPA.HDACi-induced apoptosis, assessed using annexin V assays, sub-G1 fraction analysis, and PARP cleavage, was significantly lower in HSP72-overexpressing cells than in control cells. The HDACi-induced upregulation in caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity, as well as the HDACi-induced reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, were also suppressed following HSP72 overexpression. The basal expression levels of Bcl-2, phosphorylated Bad, and XIAP increased in HSP72-overexpressing cells, whereas HDACi-induced Bid truncation and the suppression of Bad expression. Furthermore, vorinostat-induced histone hyperacetylation was also diminished in HSP72-overexpressing cells.These findings clearly demonstrate that HSP72 inhibits HDACi-induced apoptosis.Copyright © 2018 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

It has also been suggested that, in addition to its well known suppressive effects, somatostatin per se may increase insulin sensitivity. In order to examine this suggestion, we gave six healthy male volunteers (age 33 +/- 1 yr, mean +/- SEM; body mass index, 24.1 +/- 0.6 kg/) either a local intraarterial (brachial artery) or a systemic venous infusion of 25 micrograms/h somatostatin twice. The study consisted of a 1-h basal period and a 2-h systemic hyperinsulinemic (0.4 mU/kg.min) euglycemic clamp. Compared with the systemic control infusion, local forearm perfusion with somatostatin caused a 55% increase in insulin-stimulated forearm glucose uptake (0.74 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.19 mmol/L, P < 0.05). Intraarterial somatostatin perfusion did not alter basal forearm glucose uptake (0.14 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.12 mmol/L), the amount of glucose administered during the clamp (M-value, 3.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.0 +/- 0.6 mg/kg.min), or the levels of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, or GH. Intermediary metabolite exchange across the forearm, total forearm blood flow, and oxygen saturations also remained stable. Glucose concentrations were slightly higher (0.06 +/- 0.01 mmol/L) in arterial than in arterialized blood, whereas lactate concentrations were comparatively decreased (108 +/- 51 mumol/L) in arterial blood. Our data suggest that somatostatin increases insulin-stimulated muscle utilization of glucose through local mechanisms. Although the nature of this increase remains to be established, it should be taken into consideration in metabolic studies using somatostatin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111928>Electrospun poly(hydroxybutyrate) scaffolds promote engraftment of human skin equivalents via macrophage  polarization and angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>Human dermo-epidermal skin equivalents (DE) comprising in vitro expanded autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts are a good option for massive burn treatment. However, the lengthy expansion time required to obtain sufficient surface to cover an extensive burn together with the challenging surgical procedure limits their clinical use. The integration of DE and biodegradable scaffolds has been proposed in an effort to enhance their mechanical properties. Here, it is shown that poly(hydroxybutyrate) electrospun scaffolds (PHB) present good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo and are superior to poly-ε-caprolactone electrospun scaffolds as a substrate for skin reconstruction. Implantation of PHB scaffolds in healthy rats polarized macrophages to an -type that promoted constructive in vivo remodelling. Moreover, implantation of DE-PHB composites in a NOD/SCID mouse xenograft model resulted in engraftment accompanied by an increase in angiogenesis that favoured the survival of the human graft. Thus, PHB scaffolds are an attractive substrate for further exploration in skin reconstruction procedures, probably due in part to their greater angiogenic and  macrophage polarization properties.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10926318>Determinants of within-subject variation of fasting serum leptin concentrations in healthy subjects.</a></h2><p>The hormone leptin is considered to contribute to body weight regulation through modulation of feeding behavior and energy expenditure. The aim of the present study was 1) to assess the day-to-day within-subject variation (biovariability) of serum leptin concentrations in healthy subjects and 2) to investigate whether this variation is associated with food intake, exercise, anthropometric measurements or various metabolic covariates (insulin, C-peptide and glucagon, glucose, lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB), triglycerides, non-esterified-  and glycerol). Serum leptin levels were taken daily on 12 consecutive days after an overnight fast in 12 healthy subjects with a mean (SD) age of 22.7 (1.5) yr. and a BMI of 22.8 (1.6) kg/. Food intake, exercise, anthropometric measurements and various metabolic covariates were also determined during this period. The overall mean of serum leptin concentration was 33.3 pmol/L with a within-subject SD range of 27-41 pmol/L and a between-subject SD range of 18-61 pmol/L. The within-subject variance of serum leptin as a proportion of total variance was 9.5%. Within-subject variation of serum leptin concentrations is small in relation to between-subject variation in healthy, normal weight subjects. This has implications for the power of interventional or prospective studies. In men, 6.7% of the variation in serum leptin concentration was associated with body weight measured on the same day (p= 0.037). In women, however, 66% of the variation was negatively associated with 3-OHB measured on both the same and the previous day (p=0.0003 and 0.002), and positively associated with triglyceride concentration measured on the previous day (p=0.0017) and insulin measured on the same day (p=0.0002). Within-subject associations in women could be due to phasic changes in unmeasured variables, possibly related to the menstrual cycle or might suggest that energy balance may exert a delayed influence on serum leptin levels, with plasma 3-OHB and triglycerides acting as markers for the state of the fat stores that regulate leptin secretion. The differences between the genders remain unexplained, however.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814018>PPARα and  acid oxidation mediate glucocorticoid resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</a></h2><p>High-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) can be a useful treatment for aggressive forms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, their mechanism of action is not well understood, and resistance to GCs is inevitable. In a minimal, serum-free culture system, the synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) was found to decrease the metabolic activity of CLL cells, indicated by down-regulation of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) expression and activity, decreased levels of pyruvate and its metabolites, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This metabolic restriction was associated with decreased size and death of some of the tumor cells in the population. Concomitant plasma membrane damage increased killing of CLL cells by DEX. However, the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), which regulates  acid oxidation, was also increased by DEX, and adipocyte-derived lipids, lipoproteins, and propionic acid protected CLL cells from DEX. PPARα and  acid oxidation enzyme inhibitors increased DEX-mediated killing of CLL cells in vitro and clearance of CLL xenografts in vivo. These findings suggest that GCs prevent tumor cells from generating the energy needed to repair membrane damage,  acid oxidation is a mechanism of resistance to GC-mediated cytotoxicity, and PPARα inhibition is a strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24564648>A comparison of electrospun polymers reveals poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) fiber as a superior scaffold for cardiac repair.</a></h2><p>The development of biomaterials for myocardial tissue engineering requires a careful assessment of their performance with regards to functionality and biocompatibility, including the immune response. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), silk, poly-lactic acid (PLA), and polyamide (PA) scaffolds were generated by electrospinning, and cell compatibility in vitro, and immune response and cardiac function in vitro and in vivo were compared with a noncrosslinked collagen membrane (Col) control material. Results showed that cell adhesion and growth of mesenchymal stem cells, cardiomyocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts in vitro was dependent on the polymer substrate, with PHB and PCL polymers permitting the greatest adhesion/growth of cells. Additionally, polymer substrates triggered unique expression profiles of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Implantation of PCL, silk, PLA, and PA patches on the epicardial surface of healthy rats induced a classical foreign body reaction pattern, with encapsulation of polymer fibers and induction of the nonspecific immune response, whereas Col and PHB patches were progressively degraded. When implanted on infarcted rat heart, Col, PCL, and PHB reduced negative remodeling, but only PHB induced significant angiogenesis. Importantly, Col and PHB modified the inflammatory response to an  macrophage phenotype in cardiac tissue, indicating a more beneficial reparative process and remodeling. Collectively, these results identify PHB as a superior substrate for cardiac repair.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21962536>Anaerobic submerged membrane bioreactor (AnSMBR) for municipal wastewater treatment under mesophilic and psychrophilic temperature conditions.</a></h2><p>A pilot scale anaerobic submerged membrane bioreactor (AnSMBR) with an external filtration unit for municipal wastewater treatment was operated for 100 days. Besides gas sparging, additional shear was created by circulating sludge to control membrane fouling. During the first 69 days, the reactor was operated under mesophilic temperature conditions. Afterwards, the temperature was gradually reduced to 20 °C. A slow and linear increase in the filtration resistance was observed under critical flux conditions (7 L/( h)) at 35 °C. However, an increase in the fouling rate probably linked to an accumulation of solids, a higher viscosity and soluble COD concentrations in the reactor was observed at 20 °C. The COD removal efficiency was close to 90% under both temperature ranges. Effluent COD and BOD5 concentrations were lower than 80 and 25 mg/L, respectively. Pathogen indicator microorganisms (fecal coliforms bacteria) were reduced by log(10)5. Hence, the effluent could be used for irrigation purposes in agriculture.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
