The resulting ketone was condensed with hydrazine to form the azaphthalazinone core. The azaphthalazinone cores were alkylated with N-Boc-D-prolinol at N-2 by Mitsunobu reaction, de-protected, and then alkylated at the pyrrolidine nitrogen to provide the target H(1) receptor antagonists. All four mono-azaphthalazinone series had higher affinity (pK(i)) for the human H(1) receptor than azelastine, but were not as potent as the parent non-aza phthalazinone. The 5,8-diazaphthalazinone was equipotent with azelastine. The least potent series were the 7-azaphthalazinones, whereas the 5-azaphthalazinones were the most lipophilic. The more hydrophilic series were the 8-aza series. Replacement of the N-methyl substituent on the pyrrolidine with the n-butyl group caused an increase in potency (pA(2)) and a corresponding increase in lipophilicity. Introduction of a β-ether oxygen in the n-butyl analogues (2-methoxyethyl group) decreased the H(1) pA(2) slightly, and increased the selectivity against hERG. The duration of action in vitro was longer in the 6-azaphthalazinone series. The more potent and selective 6-azaphthalazinone core was used to append an H(3) receptor antagonist fragment, and to convert the series into the long acting single-ligand, dual H(1) H(3) receptor antagonist 44. The pharmacological profile of 44 was very similar to our intranasal clinical candidate 1.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Forty-eight lambs were assigned (n = 16) to either a grain-based diet at moderate (MOD, 42 mg∙kg VitE as all-rac α-tocopheryl ) or supranutritional (SUP, 285 mg∙kg of vitE) levels of synthetic VitE or a lucerne hay-based diet (LUC; 37 mg∙kg VitE) for 8 weeks. Meat from the LUC group had lower muscle n-6 and PUFA levels compared to meat from the MOD and SUP groups. Despite a similar VitE intake, muscle VitE was higher for LUC compared to MOD, while SUP lambs showed the highest VitE. Lipid oxidation did not differ between groups. For fresh meat, redness tended to be higher in LUC fed lambs than the other two groups, but brownness formation was only lower than the SUP group. For aged meat colour stability, redness tended to be higher in lambs fed SUP and LUC, whereas highest  occurred in the MOD group.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using BCBL-1 cells that harbour HHV-8 but lack Epstein-Barr virus, we demonstrate that sodium butyrate is much more effective than the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13- (TPA) at inducing high levels of class II and III virus transcription and viral DNA replication, but also initiates apoptosis. Apoptosis occurs prior to assembly of virions when high concentrations of butyrate (1-3 mM) are used, whereas reduction of butyrate concentration to 0.3 mM decreases the rate of apoptosis and results in production and secretion of enveloped virions that are visualized at high number by electron microscopy in approximately 20% of BCBL-1 cells. Butyrate induces much higher levels of multiple class II and class III transcripts than does TPA, including v-MIPI, v-IL-6, v-Bcl-2, vGPCR and ORF26. A decrease in concentration of butyrate from 3 to 0.3 mM delays the peak induction of these genes, but peak levels remain higher than peak levels in response to TPA. These studies indicate that the massive apoptosis induced by 3 mM butyrate could be diminished and delayed by reduction of butyrate concentration to 0.3 mM, thereby allowing expression of high levels of lytic-associated genes and production of high yields of HHV-8 virions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733671>Short-chain fatty acids and inulin, but not guar gum, prevent diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance through differential mechanisms in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of dietary fibre and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in obesity development is controversially discussed. Here, we investigated how various types of dietary fibre and different SCFA ratios affect metabolic syndrome-related disorders. Male mice (B6) were fed high-fat diets supplemented with dietary fibres (either cellulose, inulin or guar gum) or different Ac:Pr ratios (high  (HAc) or propionate (HPr)) for 30 weeks. Body-fat gain and insulin resistance were greatly reduced by inulin, but not by guar gum, and completely prevented by SCFA supplementation. Only inulin and HAc increased body temperature, possibly by the induction of beige/ markers in WAT. In addition, inulin and SCFA lowered hepatic triglycerides and improved insulin sensitivity. Both, inulin and HAc reduced hepatic fatty acid uptake, while only inulin enhanced mitochondrial capacity and only HAc suppressed lipogenesis in liver. Interestingly, HPr was accompanied by the induction of Nrg4 in BAT. Fermentable fibre supplementation increased the abundance of bifidobacteria; B. animalis was particularly stimulated by inulin and B. pseudolongum by guar gum. We conclude that in contrast to guar gum, inulin and SCFA prevent the onset of diet-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis by different mechanisms on liver and adipose tissue metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29715602>Characterization of spoilage markers in modified atmosphere packaged iceberg lettuce.</a></h2><p>Fresh cut iceberg lettuce spoilage was studied considering the microbial and biochemical activity, the formation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and consumer acceptability. Lettuce was packaged under three different packaging conditions and stored at 4 °C for 10 days: anaerobic packaging (ANAER), equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging with 3% O (EMAP) and perforated packages (AIR). Results indicated a clear distinction between packaging conditions. EMAP and AIR resulted in a short shelf life (≤5.6 days) which was limited due to , leading to consumer rejection as assessed via the Weibull hazard analysis method, while no off-odors were detected. Culture- independent 16 s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed Pseudomonas spp. as the dominating species. In contrast, under ANAER conditions, lactic acid bacteria dominated with genera of Leuconostoc spp. and Lactococcus spp. proliferating, while also oligotypes of Pseudomonas spp. were found. Spoilage under ANAER occurred after 6.6 days and it was related to strong fermentative-like off-odors that were present by the end of storage. As revealed by selective ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), these odors were associated with several VOCs such as: ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2,3-butanediol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, hexanal, acetic acid, ethyl  and dimethyl sulfide. Panelists rejected the iceberg lettuce due to the formation of off-odors while the overall appearance remained good throughout the study. Hence a sensor based technology incorporated in the packaging, detecting VOCs and in particular ethanol as dominant compound, could serve as a spoilage indicator for ANAER packed lettuce, which proved to have the longest shelf life.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The cell surface form of LT-alpha is assembled during biosynthesis as a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), a type II transmembrane protein that is another member of the TNF ligand family. Secreted LT-alpha is a homotrimer that binds to distinct TNF receptors of 60 and 80 kilodaltons; however, these receptors do not recognize the major cell surface LT-alpha-LT-beta complex. A receptor specific for human LT-beta was identified, which suggests that cell surface LT may have functions that are distinct from those of secreted LT-alpha.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11325479>Chemical reactivity in solid-state pharmaceuticals: formulation implications.</a></h2><p>Solid-state reactions that occur in drug substances and formulations include solid-state phase transformations, dehydration/desolvation, and chemical reactions. Chemical reactivity is the focus of this chapter. Of particular interest are cases where the drug-substance may be unstable or react with excipients in the formulation. Water absorption can enhance molecular mobility of solids and lead to solid-state reactivity. Mobility can be measured using various methods including glass transition (T(g)) measurements, solid-state NMR, and X-ray crystallography. Solid-state reactions of drug substances can include oxidation, cyclization, hydrolysis, and deamidation. Oxidation studies of vitamin A, peptides (DL-Ala-DL-Met, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe methyl ester, and Met-enkaphalin  salt), and steroids (hydrocortisone and prednisolone derivatives) are discussed. Cyclization reactions of crystalline and amorphous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (spirapril hydrochloride, quinapril hydrochloride, and moexipril) are presented which investigate mobility and chemical reactivity. Examples of drug-excipient interactions, such as transacylation, the Maillard  reaction, and acid base reactions are discussed for a variety of compounds including aspirin, fluoxitine, and ibuprofen. Once solid-state reactions are understood in a pharmaceutical system, the necessary steps can be taken to prevent reactivity and improve the stability of drug substances and products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26396380>Plantain peel - a potential source of antioxidant dietary fibre for developing functional cookies.</a></h2><p>Plantain cultivar Nendran is popular as a staple food in many parts of India and deep fried chips made from raw matured Nendran are one of the popular snack items in India. This study aims to utilize peel from Nendran variety- the main byproduct of banana chips industry- to develop high fibre cookies with enhanced bioactive content. Proximate analysis indicated that peels are rich in total dietary fibre (64.33 g/100 g), vitamins (Folic acid- 33.12 mg/100 g) and minerals (Potassium- 35.61 mg/100 g). Nendran Peel Flour (NPF) was extracted with hexane, ethyl  and methanol. Phenolic and flavonoid content was high for ethyl  extract (15.21 and 9.39 mg QE/g dry weight). Methanol extract was more potent in reducing Copper ion (2.36 μM TR/g dry weight) and scavenging NO (IC50-381.71 μg/mL). Ethyl  extract was capable of scavenging DPPH and hydroxyl radical. HPLC profiling showed presence of gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, rutin hydrate and quercetin in ethyl  extract and gallic acid, chlorogenic acid and vanillic acid in methanol extract. Cookies prepared with NPF possess higher total dietary fibre content. There was a decrease in spread ratio, breaking strength and  index of cookies as the percentage of NPF increased. NPF incorporation gradually increased the phenolic content from 4.36 to 5.28 mg GAE, compared to control cookie (3.21 mg GAE). DPPH scavenging activity also increased with increase in NPF. Hence NPF is a very good source of antioxidant dietary fibre and acceptable cookies can be produced by replacing wheat flour with 10 % NPF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11929525>Independent regulation of the divergent Escherichia coli nrfA and acsP1 promoters by a nucleoprotein assembly at a shared regulatory region.</a></h2><p>Expression from the Escherichia coli nrfA promoter (pnrfA) is activated by both the FNR protein (an anaerobically triggered transcription activator) and the NarL or NarP proteins (transcription activators triggered by nitrite and nitrate). Under anaerobic conditions, FNR binds to a site centred at position -41.5 at pnrfA and activates transcription. Further activation, induced by the presence of nitrite, results from the binding of NarL and NarP to a site centred at position -74.5. A second promoter (pacsP1), which directs transcription into the adjacent gene encoding acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (acs), is overlapping and divergent to pnrfA. Despite extensive overlap of regulatory elements, pnrfA and pacsP1 are regulated independently. We demonstrate that at least two nucleoid-associated factors bind to the nrfA-acs intergenic region. The Fis protein binds to a site centred at position -15 (in relation to pnrfA transcription), whereas the IHF protein binds to a site centred at position -54. Both Fis and IHF repress in vivo expression from pacsP1, but have smaller repressive effects on expression from pnrfA. Gel retardation assays were used to investigate the pairwise binding of FNR, NarL, Fis and IHF proteins to the nrfA-acs intergenic region. The binding of NarL and IHF is mutually exclusive, whereas all other combinations can bind simultaneously. Experiments in which deletions and point mutations were introduced into the upstream region of pnrfA demonstrated that an additional factor must bind upstream to inhibit FNR-dependent transcription. We conclude that the nrfA-acs intergenic region is folded into an ordered nucleoprotein structure that permits the two divergent promoters to be regulated independently in response to different physiological signals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16657121>Effects of Phenylmercuric  on Stomatal Movement and Transpiration of Excised Retula papyrifera Marsh. Leaves.</a></h2><p>Effects of 10(-3)m, 10(-4)m, and 10(-5)m phenylmercuric  (PMA) on stomatal movement and transpiration of excised Betula papyrifera leaves were investigated. Duco cement leaf prints and transpiration decline curves were used for the analysis of stomatal condition. PMA induced stomatal closure and decreased transpiration. Stomata of leaves treated with any of the 3 PMA concentrations closed earlier and at a higher relative water content than did stomata of untreated leaves. As determined from transpiration decline curves, PMA at 10(-3)m caused an increase in apparent "cuticular" transpiration. However, the increase appeared to result largely from some PMA-poisoned stomata which remained open for prolonged periods. Considerable PMA toxicity was observed, with 10(-3)m and 10(-4)m concentrations causing  of leaves. PMA treatment caused a decrease in chlorophyll content, even at a low PMA concentration (10(-5)m) which influenced stomatal response only slightly and did not cause evident  of leaves. The time and degree of stomatal opening varied with stomatal size. Large stomata tended to open earlier and close later than small stomata. Hence, in Betula papyrifera stomata of various size classes were considered as physiologically different populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195513>Glycation of fish protein impacts its fermentation metabolites and gut microbiota during in vitro human colonic fermentation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation properties of fish protein (FP) glycated with glucose at two different heating time (24 h and 48 h, 50 °C, GFP24 and GFP48), using an in vitro batch fermentation model of human distal colon. The heated fish protein in absent of glucose was also as controls. The lower glycation extent of fish protein, with a lower  intensity and bound sugar, enhanced the production of  and propionate. The formation of indole and ammonia was inhibited by the glycation of fish protein, but less affected by its glycation extent. Compared to FP, the glycation of fish protein significantly increased (p < .05) the relative abundance of genera Lactococcus for GFP24 (47%) and GFP48 (71%), whereas decreased dominant genera Bacteroides for GFP24 (32%) and GFP48 (23%). Compared to GFP24, GFP48 indicated significantly higher relative abundance of Holdemania, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus, and lower amounts of Parabacteroides (p < .05). In the meantime, the heated treatments in the absent of glucose resulted in the increase of some genera Dialister, Arobacter, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Phascolarctobacterium and Veillonella, and also ammonia production. Furthermore, the correlation analysis confirmed that the glycation of fish protein for the decrease of ammonia and indole production was associated with the changes of some proteolytic bacteria genera, including Bacteroides, Dialister and Parabacteroides. Thus, the glycated fish protein rich in Amadori products greatly change the profiles of fermentation metabolite and gut microbiota, and these changes can have a potential impact on host health.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of specific monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors.</a></h2><p>Lymphotoxin (LT) is a cytokine related to TNF, found in human systems in both secreted and membrane bound forms. The well characterized secreted form is a trimer of a single protein, LT-alpha, whereas the surface form is composed of a complex between two related molecules, LT-alpha and LT-beta. Because there is a distinct receptor for the complex, the membrane form is believed to signal via events different from those elicited by TNF and secreted LT-alpha. By using a battery of anti-LT-alpha and LT-beta mAbs, it is clear that two LT surface forms exist on the surface of PMA-activated II-23 cells, a human T cell hybridoma. Assuming that these surface forms are trimers, a minor form appears early after induction having an apparent stoichiometry of LT-alpha 2/beta 1 and is recognized by one group of anti-LT-alpha mAbs and the p55-TNF receptor. The second and predominant form has an apparent LT-alpha 1/beta 2 composition and is recognized by a second group of pantrophic anti-LT-alpha mAbs and the LT-beta receptor. Neither of the heteromeric forms nor a putative LT-beta homotrimeric form were found to be secreted. The properties of surface LT on the II-23 cell system were similar to those of the surface LT forms on Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with both LT-alpha and LT-beta genes and a number of lymphoid tumor lines. These experiments point toward the LT-alpha 1/beta 2 complex as the predominant membrane form of LT on the lymphocyte surface, and this complex is the primary ligand for the LT-beta receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19576165>Development of an amperometric assay for phosphate ions in urine based on a chemically modified screen-printed carbon electrode.</a></h2><p>An amperometric assay for the determination of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in urine has been developed without the need for sample preparation. A screen-printed carbon electrode modified with the electrocatalyst cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC-SPCE) and covered with a cellulose  membrane (CAM) serves as the sensor. The sensor detects hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which is produced as a result of the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate oxidase (PyOd), in the presence of Pi, oxygen, and cofactors. Following optimization of solution conditions, and in the presence of a urine sample, a linear range was found to exist between the rate of current increase and phosphate concentration over the range of 2.27 x 10(-5) to 1.81 x 10(-4)M, and the limit of detection was found to be 4.27 x 10(-6)M. The assay was applied to the determination of phosphate ions in the urine of a normal subject, and the mean concentration in unspiked urine was found to be 3.40 x 10(-5)M with a coefficient of variation of 8.0% (n=5). The mean recovery of phosphate added to urine samples was 98.7% with a coefficient of variation of 5.5% (n=3). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an amperometric assay for Pi that incorporates a CoPC-SPCE as the sensing device.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28873599>Peptides derived from tryptic hydrolysate of Bacillus subtilis culture suppress fungal spoilage of table grapes.</a></h2><p>This study confirmed the anti-fungal effect of trypsin-treated Bacillus subtilis culture (BC) (tryptic hydrolysate, TH) on mold growth on Kyoho grapes. We examined the anti-fungal activity of TH by identifying TH peptides and performing a computational docking analysis. TH was more potent than untreated BC in suppressing fungal growth on grapes. Specifically, TH maintained grape freshness by inhibiting respiration and rachis , maintaining firmness, and preventing weight loss. Thirty-six inhibitory peptides against β-1,3-glucan synthase (GS) were screened from 126 TH peptides identified through proteomic analysis. Among them, 13 peptides bound tightly to GS active pockets with lower binding energies than that of GppNHp. The most potent peptides, LFEIDEELNEK and FATSDLNDLYR, were synthesized, and further experiments showed that these peptides had a highly suppressive effect on GS activity and Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum growth. Our results confirm that tryptic treatment is effective for improving the anti-fungal activity of BC.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This physiological disorder is characterized by internal  of the fruit tissue and the development of cavities. Suitable protein phenol extraction/ammonium -methanol precipitation and 2-DE protocols for a wide pH range were established for pear tissue. The protein expression profiles of healthy, sound (intact tissue of pears with core breakdown) and brown tissue were analyzed with the univariate non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and partial least square discriminant analysis. Both statistical approaches revealed interesting differentially expressed proteins between healthy and disordered pears. LC-ESI-MS/MS identification of differentially expressed proteins between healthy and sound tissue revealed their participation in the energy metabolism, the antioxidant system and ethylene biosynthesis. Up-regulated characteristic proteins in brown tissue were mainly involved in energy metabolism and defense mechanisms. Proteomics coupled to univariate and multivariate statistical techniques seems to be an efficient approach to get a better insight into the different mechanisms and pathways leading to the core breakdown disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28131896>Quercetin, a functional compound of onion peel, remodels white adipocytes to brown-like adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Adipocyte  is a promising strategy for obesity prevention. Using onion-peel-derived extracts and their bioactive compounds, we demonstrate that onion peel, a by-product of onion, can change the characteristics of white adipocytes to those of brown-like adipocytes in the white adipose tissue of mice and 3T3-L1 cells. The expression of the following brown adipose tissue-specific genes was increased in the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissues of 0.5% onion-peel-extract-fed mice: PR domain-containing 16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α, uncoupling protein 1, fibroblast growth factor 21 and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, onion peel extract induced the expression of brown adipose tissue-specific genes and increased the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α. This effect was supported by decreased lipid levels and multiple small-sized lipid droplets. The ethyl  fraction of the onion peel extract that contained the highest proportion of hydrophobic molecules showed the same  effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A high-performance liquid chromatography analysis further identified quercetin as a functional compound in the  effect of onion peel. The quercetin-associated  effect was mediated in part by the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. In summary, our study provides the first demonstration of the  effects of onion peel and quercetin using both animal and cell models. This result indicates that onion peel has the potential to remodel the characteristics of white adipocytes to those of brown-like adipocytes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These signs are associated with decreased plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a major mediator of growth. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between decreased plasma IGF-I and the impairment of appetite and growth in zinc deficiency. Immature male rats were fed free choice a low zinc (<1 mg/kg) diet (-Zn) or a zinc adequate (100 mg/kg) control diet (+Zn). Plasma IGF-I concentrations were normalized in zinc-deficient rats by the following two methods: osmotic pump infusion of IGF-I (2.4 mg/kg body weight daily) and oral administration (50 mg/kg body weight twice daily) of the synthetic progestin, megestrol  (MA). Infusion of IGF-I for 8 d sustained plasma IGF-I concentrations in zinc-deficient rats at control levels but had no effect on either food intake or growth rate. MA administration for 8 d maintained the plasma IGF-I of deficient rats and significantly increased food intake. The early aspects of cyclic food intake were eliminated, and, after a few days, food intake of deficient rats given MA was not different than that of controls. MA increased food intake and fat deposition regardless of zinc status, but it had no effect on the growth rate of deficient rats. MA significantly decreased body weight of controls, uncoupling energy intake and gain. The results suggest that reduced food intake precedes the decreased plasma IGF-I concentration and that IGF-I is not responsible for the decreased growth and food intake of zinc-deficient rats. The appetite and growth impairment of zinc-deficient rats may arise from disrupted function of IGF-I receptors in the brain and peripheral tissues, but not from low circulating levels of IGF-I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18207029>Phenotypic and functional differentiation of KG-1 into dendritic-like cells.</a></h2><p>The cell line KG-1 has been used as an in vitro model for human dendritic cell (DC) differentiation.

A pharmacological approach indicates that, while it may have some role, calcium is not the trigger for this cannibalistic phagocytic process. Of several agents that perturb intracellular calcium levels [A23187, LaCl, 8-diethylamino-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxylbenzoate (TMB-8), and chlorotetracycline], only A23187 had an effect in reducing amoebal ingestion. In keeping with this, agents which interfered with downstream effectors of calcium function did not alter sexual phagocytosis.

Intermittent fasting is an effective and natural strategy for weight control, but the mechanism for its efficacy is poorly understood. Here, we show that an every-other-day fasting (EODF) regimen selectively stimulates beige fat development within white adipose tissue and dramatically ameliorates obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. EODF treatment results in a shift in the gut microbiota composition leading to elevation of the fermentation products  and lactate and to the selective upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 1 expression in beige cells. Microbiota-depleted mice are resistance to EODF-induced beiging, while transplantation of the microbiota from EODF-treated mice to microbiota-depleted mice activates beiging and improves metabolic homeostasis.

Peach fruit from three cultivars ('Red Haven', RH, 'Regina di Londa', RL, and 'Flaminia', FL) were stored for 4 weeks under low temperatures (0.5 and 5.5°C). GC-MS was employed to study changes in both metabolome and volatilome induced by cold storage in the mesocarp. CIs were assessed both at the end of each week of storage and after subsequent shelf-life (SL) at 20°C. Flesh browning and mealiness appeared to be more related to 5.5°C storage, while flesh bleeding revealed high incidence following 0.5°C storage. Compared to RL and FL, RH showed a marked lower incidence of CIs. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that RH peaches indeed differ from RL and FL in particular when considering data from samples collected at the end of the cold storage. Common and divergent responses have been identified in terms of metabolic responses to the applied low temperatures. In all three cultivars raffinose, glucose-6P, fucose, xylose, sorbitol, GABA, epicatechin, catechin, and putrescine markedly increased during cold storage, while citramalic, glucuronic, mucic and shikimic acids decreased. Among volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aldehydes and alcohols generally accumulated more under low temperature conditions while esters and lactones evolved during subsequent SL. The main cultivar differences developed after cold storage during SL although some common responses (e.g., an increased production of ethyl ) were observed. The lower levels of flesh browning and bleeding displayed by RH peaches were related to compounds with antioxidant activity, or acting as osmotic protectants and membrane stabilizer. Indeed, RH showed higher levels of amino acids and urea, together with a marked increase in putrescine, sorbitol, maltitol, myoinositol and sucrose detected during storage and SL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16620926>A model for cystic endometrial hyperplasia/pyometra complex in the bitch.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to develop a reliable model for the study of the cystic endometrial hyperplasia and pyometra complex (CEH/P) in the bitch. Greyhound bitches (n = 15) were ovariectomised and allocated into three groups (Group 1, n = 5; Group 2, n = 5; Group 3, n = 10, including 5 used from Group 1). Simulated proestrus, estrus and diestrus were induced by treatment with estradiol benzoate and megestrol . The duration of cervical opening during estrus was determined by the intra-vaginal infusion of radio-opaque medium and subsequent radiography of the uterus (Group 1). One milliliter of a culture of Escherichia coli (with five uro-pathogenic virulence factors as identified by PCR: pap, sfa, hlyA, cnf1 and fim) was inoculated intra-vaginally daily throughout the simulated estrus (Group 2).

As they divide exponentially, these cells excrete  via the phosphotransacetylase- kinase pathway.

Here, we present evidence that this switch occurs primarily through the induction of acs and that the timing and magnitude of this induction depend, in part, on the direct action of the carbon regulator cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) and the oxygen regulator FNR. It also depends, probably indirectly, upon the glyoxylate shunt repressor IclR, its activator FadR, and many enzymes involved in  metabolism. On the basis of these results, we propose that cells induce acs, and thus their ability to assimilate , in response to rising cyclic AMP levels, falling oxygen partial pressure, and the flux of carbon through -associated pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11897258>Megestrol  increases short-term food intake in zinc-deficient rats.</a></h2><p>Rats offered a zinc-deficient (-Zn) diet voluntarily reduce their food intake within 3-4 days. Megestrol  (MA) is an appetite-stimulating drug used to treat cachexia of chronic diseases. In previous work, we found MA administration to male rats increased consumption of a -Zn diet. This approach would provide a useful tool for nutritional studies in which nutrient intake, except for zinc, would be maintained. The present study further examined the use of MA to increase consumption of a -Zn diet over a longer time period in both male and female rats. Rats were fed either a -Zn or a zinc-adequate (+Zn) diet. In Experiment 1, rats were treated orally with 0, 20, 50 or 100 mg MA/kg BW in corn oil for 21 days. MA stimulated intake of the -Zn diet in a linear manner. In Experiments 2 and 3, male and female rats, respectively, were fed the -Zn or +Zn diets and treated with 100 mg MA/kg BW for 21 days. In both experiments, MA administration increased intake of the -Zn diet to levels similar to the +Zn diet through Day 14. MA increased the hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) concentration in male rats, but did not affect serum IGF-I. MA administration improved growth of female but not male rats fed the -Zn diet. In females, serum IGF-I was not lower in zinc-deficient rats, which may have allowed the improved growth response with MA. Hence, MA administration may be a useful tool to increase consumption of a -Zn diet in short-term studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941950>Thyroid hormone status defines brown adipose tissue activity and  of white adipose tissues in mice.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to determine the effect of thyroid hormone dysfunction on brown adipose tissue activity and white adipose tissue  in mice. Twenty randomized female C57BL/6NTac mice per treatment group housed at room temperature were rendered hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. In-vivo small animal F-FDG PET/MRI was performed to determine the effects of hypo- and hyperthyroidism on BAT mass and BAT activity. Ex-vivoC- loading assay and assessment of thermogenic gene and protein expression permitted analysis of oxidative and thermogenic capacities of WAT and BAT of eu-, hyper and hypothyroid mice. F-FDG PET/MRI revealed a lack of brown adipose tissue activity in hypothyroid mice, whereas hyperthyroid mice displayed increased BAT mass alongside enhanced F-FDG uptake. In white adipose tissue of both, hyper- and hypothyroid mice, we found a significant induction of thermogenic genes together with multilocular adipocytes expressing UCP1. Taken together, these results suggest that both the hyperthyroid and hypothyroid state stimulate WAT thermogenesis most likely as a consequence of enhanced adrenergic signaling or compensation for impaired BAT function, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923087>Cyclic AMP receptor protein-dependent activation of the Escherichia coli acsP2 promoter by a synergistic class III mechanism.</a></h2><p>The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) activates transcription of the Escherichia coli acs gene, which encodes an -scavenging enzyme required for fitness during periods of carbon starvation. Two promoters direct transcription of acs, the distal acsP1 and the proximal acsP2. In this study, we demonstrated that acsP2 can function as the major promoter and showed by in vitro studies that CRP facilitates transcription by "focusing" RNA polymerase to acsP2. We proposed that CRP activates transcription from acsP2 by a synergistic class III mechanism. Consistent with this proposal, we showed that CRP binds two sites, CRP I and CRP II. Induction of acs expression absolutely required CRP I, while optimal expression required both CRP I and CRP II. The locations of these DNA sites for CRP (centered at positions -69.5 and -122.5, respectively) suggest that CRP interacts with RNA polymerase through class I interactions. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that acs transcription requires the surfaces of CRP and the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase holoenzyme (alpha-CTD), which is known to participate in class I interactions: activating region 1 of CRP and the 287, 265, and 261 determinants of the alpha-CTD. Other surface-exposed residues in the alpha-CTD contributed to acs transcription, suggesting that the alpha-CTD may interact with at least one protein other than CRP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25308684>Characterization of polyphenol oxidase activity in Ataulfo mango.</a></h2><p>Crude extracts of Ataulfo exhibited polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity with pyrogallol, 3-methylcatechol, catechol, gallic acid, and protocatechuic acid.

Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) and 3-amino-1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-pyrazoline hydrochloride (BW755C) delayed the response to AA. Inhibition by eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) was more persistent. These results are consistent with previous reports that SHAM and BW755C are reversible inhibitors of lipoxygenase and easily oxidized by potato while ETYA acts as an irreversible inhibitor. Disulfiram (tetraethylthiuram disulfide) also inhibited AA elicitor activity. SHAM was most effective if applied at the time of AA treatment, having no effect if applied 6 hours afterward.

In response to cold or other adrenergic stimuli, brown adipocytes increase their substrate uptake and oxidative activity while uncoupling ATP synthesis from the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. Brown adipocytes are found in classic depots such as in the interscapular BAT (iBAT). They can also develop in white adipose tissue (WAT), such as in the inguinal WAT (iWAT), where their presence has been associated with metabolic improvements. We previously reported that the induction of oxidative  in iWAT is low compared with that of iBAT, even after sustained adrenergic stimulation. One explanation to this apparent lack of thermogenic ability of iWAT is the presence of an active iBAT, which may prevent the full activation of iWAT. In this study, we evaluated whether iBAT denervation-induced browning of white  enhanced the thermogenic activity of iWAT following cold acclimation, under beta-3 adrenergic stimulation (CL 316,243). Following a bilateral denervation of iBAT, we assessed energy balance, evaluated the oxidative activity of iBAT and iWAT using C-, and quantified the dynamic glucose uptake of those tissues using 2-deoxy-2-[F]- fluoro-d-glucose. Our results indicate that despite portraying marked browning and mildly enhanced glucose uptake, iWAT of cold-adapted mice does not exhibit significant oxidative activity following beta-3 adrenergic stimulation in the absence of a functional iBAT. The present results suggest that iWAT is not readily recruitable as a thermogenic organ even when functional iBAT is lacking.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/832008>Effect of oral contraceptives on plasma testosterone concentration.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651625>Modulation of CRP-dependent transcription at the Escherichia coli acsP2 promoter by nucleoprotein complexes: anti-activation by the nucleoid proteins FIS and IHF.</a></h2><p>acs encodes acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, a high-affinity enzyme that allows cells to scavenge for  during carbon starvation.

AA is formed in foods during the  process by the Maillard reaction of glucose (GL) with asparagine (AS). For the first time, the simultaneous online preconcentration and separation of AA, AS and GL using analyte focusing by ionic liquid micelle collapse capillary electrophoresis (AFILMC) was presented. Samples were prepared in a 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BMIMBr) micellar matrix with a conductivity 4 times greater than that of the running buffer (12.5 mmol L(-1) phosphate buffer at pH 8.5). Samples were hydrodynamically injected into a fused silica capillary at 25.0 mbar for 25.0 s. Separations were performed by applying a voltage of 25.0 kV and a detection at 200.0 nm. To sufficiently reduce BMIMBr adsorption on the interior surface of capillary, an appropriate rinsing procedure by hydrochloric acid and water was optimized. AFILMC measurements of analytes within the concentration range of 0.05-10.0 μmol L(-1) achieved adequate reproducibility and accuracy with RSD 1.14-3.42% (n=15) and recovery 98.0-110.0%, respectively. Limits of detections were 0.71 ng g(-1) AA, 1.06 ng g(-1) AS and 27.02 ng g(-1) GL with linearity ranged between 2.2 and 1800 ng g(-1). The coupling of AFILMC with IL based ultrasonic assisted extraction (ILUAE) was successfully applied to the efficient extraction and determination of AA, AS and GL in bread samples. The structure of ILs has significant effects on the extraction efficiency of analytes. The optimal extraction efficiency (97.8%) was achieved by an aqueous extraction with 4:14 ratio of sample: 3.0 mol L(-1) BMIMBr followed by sonication at 35 °C.

In the present study, PPO and its endogenous substrates were extracted from rambutan pericarp tissues (RPT). The substrate extracts were sequentially partitioned with ethyl  and n-butanol. The analysis of total phenolic content showed that the most phenolic compounds were distributed in ethyl  fraction. By high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), (-)-epicatechin (EC) and proanthocyanidin A2 (PA2) were identified from this fraction. After reacting with rambutan PPO, EC turned brown rapidly within 10 min, indicating that it was a significant endogenous substrate. Although PA2 could also be oxidized by the PPO, it turned brown very slowly. In addition, because EC and PA2 were continually catalyzed into  products by PPO during storage of the fruit at 4 and 25 degrees C, their contents in RPT gradually declined with the extended storage time. It was further observed that both substrate contents in rambutan fruit storing at 25 degrees C decreased more rapidly than that storing at 4 degrees C, suggesting that low temperature inhibited the catalytic oxidation of substrates so as to slow down pericarp . Practical Application: Pericarp  is a serious problem to storage and transport of harvested rambutan fruit. A generally accepted opinion on the  mechanism is the oxidation of phenolic substrates by PPO. Ascertaining PPO substrates will effectively help us to control enzymatic reaction by chemical methods so as to delay or even prevent pericarp  of harvested rambutan fruit.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11158244>Protein kinase C activation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor.</a></h2><p>The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is an ionotropic glutamate receptor, which plays crucial roles in synaptic plasticity and development. We have recently shown that potentiation of NMDA receptor function by protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be mediated via activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. The aim of this study was to test whether this effect could be mediated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2A or NR2B subunits of the receptor. Following treatment of rat hippocampal CA1 mini-slices with 500 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) for 15 min, samples were homogenized, immunoprecipitated with anti-NR2A or NR2B antibodies and the resulting pellets subjected to Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both NR2A (76 +/- 11% above control) and NR2B (41 +/- 11%) was observed. This increase was blocked by pretreatment with the selective PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lavendustin A or with the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. PMA treatment also produced an increase in the phosphorylation of serine 890 on the NR1 subunit, a known PKC site, at 5 min with phosphorylation returning to near basal levels by 10 min while tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B was sustained for up to 15 min. These results suggest that the modulation of NMDA receptor function seen with PKC activation may be the result of tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and/or NR2B.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105287>Gut Microbiota Interacts with Markers of Adipose Tissue , Insulin Action and Plasma  in Morbid Obesity.</a></h2><p>To examine the potential relationship among gene expression markers of adipose tissue , gut microbiota, and insulin sensitivity in humans.Gut microbiota composition and gene markers of  are analyzed in subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue from morbidly obese subjects (n = 34).

This study was aimed at identifying the signalling pathways involved in the activation of volume-regulatory mechanisms of human cervical cancer cells. 2. Osmotic swelling of human cervical cancer cells induced a substantial increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by the activation of Ca2+ entry across the cell membrane, as well as Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This Ca2+ signalling was critical for the normal regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response. 3. The activation of swelling-activated ion and taurine transport was significantly inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and tyrphostin AG 1478) and potentiated by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4. However, the Src family of tyrosine kinases was not involved in regulation of the swelling-activated Cl- channel. 4. Cell swelling triggered mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) and p38 kinase. The volume-responsive ERK1/ERK2 signalling pathway linked with the activation of K+ and Cl- channels, and taurine transport. However, the volume-regulatory mechanism was independent of the activation of p38 MAP kinase. 5. The phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 expression following a hypotonic shock was up-regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) and down-regulated by PKC inhibitor staurosporine. The response of ERK activation to hypotonicity also required Ca2+ entry and depended on tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated/ERK-activating kinase (MEK) activity. 6. Considering the results overall, osmotic swelling promotes the activation of tyrosine kinase and ERK1/ERK2 and raises intracellular Ca2+, all of which play a crucial role in the volume-regulatory mechanism of human cervical cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27348268>An essential role of Ffar2 (Gpr43) in dietary fibre-mediated promotion of healthy composition of gut microbiota and suppression of intestinal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Composition of the gut microbiota has profound effects on intestinal carcinogenesis. Diet and host genetics play critical roles in shaping the composition of gut microbiota. Whether diet and host genes interact with each other to bring specific changes in gut microbiota that affect intestinal carcinogenesis is unknown. Ability of dietary fibre to specifically increase beneficial gut microbiota at the expense of pathogenic bacteria in vivo via unknown mechanism is an important process that suppresses intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2 or GPR43) is a receptor for short-chain fatty acids (, propionate and butyrate), metabolites of dietary fibre fermentation by gut microbiota. Here, we show FFAR2 is down modulated in human colon cancers than matched adjacent healthy tissue. Consistent with this, Ffar2(-/-) mice are hypersusceptible to development of intestinal carcinogenesis. Dietary fibre suppressed colon carcinogenesis in an Ffar2-dependent manner. Ffar2 played an essential role in dietary fibre-mediated promotion of beneficial gut microbiota, Bifidobacterium species (spp) and suppression of Helicobacter hepaticus and Prevotellaceae. Moreover, numbers of Bifidobacterium is reduced, whereas those of Prevotellaceae are increased in human colon cancers than matched adjacent normal tissue. Administration of Bifidobacterium mitigated intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis in Ffar2(-/-) mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that interplay between dietary fibre and Ffar2 play a key role in promoting healthy composition of gut microbiota that stimulates intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19592459>Mutation of protein kinase C phosphorylation site S1076 on alpha-subunits affects BK(Ca) channel activity in HEK-293 cells.</a></h2><p>Large conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels are important modulators of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle membrane potential, and phosphorylation of BK(Ca) channels by protein kinases regulates pulmonary arterial smooth muscle function. However, little is known about the effect of phosphorylating specific channel subunits on BK(Ca) channel activity. The present study was done to determine the effect of mutating protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site serine 1076 (S1076) on transfected human BK(Ca) channel alpha-subunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, a heterologous expression system devoid of endogenous BK(Ca) channels. Results showed that mutating S1076 altered the effect of PKC activation on BK(Ca) channels in HEK-293 cells. Specifically, the phospho-deficient mutation BK(Ca)-alpha(S1076A)/beta(1) attenuated the excitatory effect of the PKC activator phorbol myristate  (PMA) on BK(Ca) channels, whereas the phospho-mimetic mutation BK(Ca)-alpha(S1076E)/beta(1) increased the excitatory effect of PMA on BK(Ca) channels. In addition, the phospho-null mutation S1076A blocked the activating effect of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) on BK(Ca) channels. Collectively, these results suggest that specific putative PKC phosphorylation site(s) on human BK(Ca) channel alpha-subunits influences BK(Ca) channel activity, which may subsequently alter pulmonary vascular smooth muscle function and tone.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26910302>Beta3 adrenergic receptor is involved in vascular injury in deoxycorticosterone -salt hypertensive mice.</a></h2><p>Beta3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) mediates vessel relaxation in the endothelium while it modulates lipolysis in the adipose tissue. However, the function and regulation mechanism of ADRB3 in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), especially in hypertension, is still unclear. We show that ADRB3 protein is upregulated in the PVAT of deoxycorticosterone -salt (DOCA-salt) hypertensive mice, with the characteristics of PVAT  and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Inhibition of ADRB3 with selective antagonist SR59230A caused serious vascular injury in vivo, even though UCP1 expression was downregulated. ADRB3 protein was regulated by let-7b, which was decreased in the PVAT of the DOCA-salt group. These data reveal that ADRB3 in PVAT contributes to vascular function in the progression of hypertension.© 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7556527>Functional and phenotypic upregulation of CD13/aminopeptidase-N on precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia after in vitro stimulation.</a></h2><p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells of precursor-B type were assessed for expression of the cell surface peptidase CD13 (aminopeptidase-N) after 72 hours' culture in 10% B cell growth factor (BCGF), TPA, or medium alone. CD13 was analyzed phenotypically using a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) by flow cytometry, and also with a spectrophotometric enzyme assay to measure the cleavage of specific peptide substrates. CD13 antigen was induced in all 10 cases of precursor-B ALL after culture with BCGF, with weaker expression seen in cells incubated with TPA or in medium alone. Aminopeptidase-N-like enzymatic activity was also demonstrated in cultured cells, particularly after BCGF exposure. Using the mAb WM-15, which specifically inhibits aminopeptidase-N function, we demonstrated that induction of true aminopeptidase-N activity was largely restricted to BCGF-treated cells, in which approximately 20% of total aminopeptidase activity was due to aminopeptidase-N. Phenotypic expression of the peptidase CD10 (neutral endopeptidase) was not altered on cultured cells. These findings indicate that CD13 expression can be selectively upregulated on ALL cells in response to proliferative stimuli. This peptidase, in cooperation with CD10 and perhaps other surface enzymes, may act to regulate the concentration of molecules at the cell surface which influence the growth of precursor-B ALL cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25654596>Limitations of detection of anaplerosis and pyruvate cycling from metabolism of [1-(13)C] .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609995>Activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by protein kinase C.</a></h2><p>The cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) are emerging as important components of mainstream signal transduction pathways. Nitric oxide-induced cGMP formation by stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase is generally accepted as being the most widespread mechanism underlying PKG activation. In the present study, PKG was found to be a target for phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA)-responsive protein kinase C (PKC). PKG1alpha became phosphorylated in HEK-293 cells stimulated with PMA and also in vitro using purified components. PKC-dependent phosphorylation was found to activate PKG as measured by phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, and by in vitro kinase assays. Although there are 11 potential PKC substrate recognition sites in PKG1alpha, threonine 58 was examined due to its proximity to the pseudosubstrate domain. Antibodies generated against the phosphorylated form of this region were used to demonstrate phosphorylation in response to PMA treatment of the cells with kinetics similar to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation. A phospho-mimetic mutation at this site (T58E) generated a partially activated PKG that was more sensitive to cGMP levels. A phospho-null mutation (T58A) revealed that this residue is important but not sufficient for PKG activation by PKC. Taken together, these findings outline a novel signal transduction pathway that links PKC stimulation with cyclic nucleotide-independent activation of PKG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/544414>[Influence of food  on nutrition. III. Effect of brown substances on digestive enzyme activity (author's transl)].</a></h2><p>In the present study, we separated and partially purified brown substances from eggplants and examined their inhibitory action on trypsin activity. The following results were obtained: 1. The first half of the elute after passing ethanol-extractable brown substances through DEAE-cellulose column showed no inhibitory action on trypsin, whereas the middle portion of the elute contained a trypsin inhibitor(s). Similar results were obtained after fractionation with Sephadex G-25. The degree of inhibition was increased after purification. 2. Both crude ethanol extracts of eggplant brown substances and  buffer extracts from eggplant exocarps showed similarly an enzyme inhibition of competitive type. 3. Both nondialyzable portion of ethanol extracts and purified fraction after Sephadex G-25 passage showed a noncompetitive type of inhibition. DOPA-melanin and chlorogenic acid-melanin as model substances exhibited a similar noncompetitive inhibition. Purified ethanol extracts of eggplant brown substances showed an ultraviolet absorption spectrum similar to that of chlorogenic acid. From these findings it is concluded that both eggplant brown substances and polyphenol substances play an essential role in the inhibition of digestive enzymes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10391148>An in vitro study on the role of metal catalyzed oxidation in glycation and crosslinking of collagen.</a></h2><p>The present investigation was carried out to understand the effect of metal catalyzed oxidation on glycation and crosslinking of collagen. Tail tendons obtained from rats weighing 200-225 g were incubated with glucose (250 mM) and increasing concentrations of copper ions (5, 25, 50 and 100 microM) under physiological conditions of temperature and pH. Early glycation, crosslinking and late glycation (fluorescence) of collagen samples were analyzed periodically. Early glycation was estimated by phenol sulfuric acid method, and the crosslinking was assessed by pepsin and cyanogen bromide digestion. A concentration-dependent effect of metal ions on the rate of glycation and crosslinking of collagen was observed. Tendon collagen incubated with glucose and 100 microM copper ions showed 80% reduction in pepsin digestion within seven days, indicating extensive crosslinking, whereas collagen incubated with glucose alone for the same period showed only 7% reduction. The presence of metal ions in the incubation medium accelerated the development of Maillard reaction fluorescence on collagen, and the increase was dependent on the concentration of metal ions used. The metal chelator diethylene triamine penta- significantly prevented the increase in collagen crosslinking by glucose and copper ions. Free radical scavengers benzoate and mannitol effectively prevented the increased crosslinking and  of collagen by glucose. The results indicate that the metal catalyzed oxidation reactions play a major role in the crosslinking of collagen by glucose. It is also suggested that the prevention of increased oxidative stress in diabetes may prevent the accelerated advanced glycation and crosslinking of collagen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1281193>Expression of surface lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor on activated T, B, and natural killer cells.</a></h2><p>The expression of membrane-associated forms of lymphotoxin (LT) and TNF were examined on cell lines of T, B, and myeloid origin, IL-2 dependent T cell clones, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Inducible and constitutive patterns of surface LT expression were found on T cells as exemplified by the II-23.D7, a CD4+T cell hybridoma, and HUT-78, a T cell lymphoma. Phorbol ester induced surface LT expression on Ramos, an EBV transformed B cell line, but at a slower rate of appearance when compared to the II-23.D7. Secretion of LT was rapidly inducible by phorbol ester in II-23.D7 and also in HUT-78 but with slower kinetics; surface LT expression continued in both lines after secretion had ceased. Low levels of membrane TNF were transiently induced on II-23.D7 and HUT-78, but none was observed on Ramos. Peripheral blood monocytes and some myeloid tumor lines did not express surface LT. Several T cell clones expressed surface LT after Ag-specific stimulation, and expression persisted several days. Stimulation through the TCR or by IL-2 rapidly induced surface LT on resting peripheral T cells and CD56+ NK cells; pokeweed mitogen activation induced expression on CD20+ B cells. Consistent with previous results, immunoprecipitation with anti-LT mAb showed that LT was complexed with a distinct 33 kDa glycoprotein (p33) on cells that expressed surface LT, whereas secreted LT was not associated with p33. Surface and secreted modes of LT expression by activated T, B, and NK cells suggests that LT can be utilized as either a localized or diffusible mediator in immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28911400>Effects of calcium supplements on the quality and acrylamide content of puffed shrimp chips.</a></h2><p>The quality and acrylamide content of deep-fried and microwave-puffed shrimp chips fortified with 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1.0% calcium salts (calcium lactate, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, or calcium ) were investigated. Microwave-puffed shrimp chips contained higher amounts of acrylamide (130.43 ppb) than did deep-fried shrimp chips. The greatest mitigation of acrylamide formation in overfried chips was obtained with 0.1% calcium lactate. All  indexes of fortified shrimp chips, whether deep-fried or microwave-puffed, were reduced. L* values of microwave-puffed shrimp chips were higher than those of deep-fried shrimp chips, whereas a* and b* values and  indexes were lower. Color differences (ΔE) between deep-fried puffed shrimp chips fortified with calcium salts and a control sample were higher than 5, and the sensory scores of shrimp chips were significantly decreased by the addition of calcium lactate.Copyright © 2015.

Five autochthonous strains were selected based on the kinetics of growth and acidification on prickly pear fruit juice, and the capacity to synthesize exo-polysaccharides. All selected Leuc. mesenteroides strains showed an in vitro mucilage-degrading capability. A protocol for processing and storage of fermented prickly pear fruit puree (FP) was set up. Unstarted FP and chemically acidified FP were used as the controls. Starters grew and remained viable at elevated cell numbers during 21 days of storage at 4 °C. Contaminating Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts were found only in the controls. Viscosity and serum separation distinguished started FP compared to the controls. Colour parameters,  index, sensory attributes, antimicrobial activity, vitamin C and betalains levels were positively affected by lactic acid fermentation. Increase of free radical scavenging activity in ethyl  soluble extract suggested an effect of selected strains on phenolic profiles. Started FP markedly inhibited the inflammatory status of Caco-2/TC7 cells, and also contributed to maintaining the integrity of tight junctions. Started FP scavenged the reactive oxygen species generated by H2O2 on Caco-2 cells. All selected strain variously affected the immunomodulatory activity towards anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Aspergillus flavus group has traditionally been used in the production of a number of foods, including miso (soybean paste), shoyu (soy sauce), and sake. Kojic acid is widely used as a food additive for preventing enzymatic , and in cosmetic preparations as a skin-lightening or bleaching agent. Because kojic acid is often produced during the fermentation of historically used dietary staples, it has a long history of consumption. Various types of compounds, such as glucose, sucrose, , ethanol, arabinose, and xylose, have been used as carbon sources for kojic acid production. Different Aspergillus species are known to produce variable amounts of kojic acid. The mechanism of action of kojic acid is well defined and it has been shown to act as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of animal and plant polyphenol oxidases, xanthine oxidase, and D- and some L-amino acid oxidases. The structure of kojic acid indicates a relatively simple route of metabolism much like dietary hexoses. Acute or subchronic toxicity resulting from an oral dose has not been reported, but convulsions may occur if kojic acid is injected. Results of mutagenicity studies are mixed, but in the in vivo mammalian dominant lethal assay, kojic acid was proven negative. Continuous administration of high doses of kojic acid in mice resulted in induction of thyroid adenomas in both sexes. Kojic acid reversibly affects thyroid function primarily by inhibiting iodine uptake, leading to decreases in T3 and T4 and increase in TSH. Increased TSH from pituitary gland in turn stimulates thyroid hyperplasia. Several lines of evidence indicate that the proliferative effects of kojic acid on thyroid are not related to a genotoxic pathway. The risk of functional inhibition of iodine uptake and its metabolism (organification) and thyroid tumor induction by kojic acid in humans appears to be extremely low. Based on the literature reviewed and discussed here, consumption of kojic acid at levels normally found in food does not present a concern for safety.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.</p></html>
