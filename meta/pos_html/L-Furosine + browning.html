A tyrosinase inhibitor was purified from Camellia pollen using high-speed countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and was identiﬁed as caffeine by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. It showed strong mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity with an IC of 18.5 ± 2.31μg/mL in a noncompetitive model. The caffeine did not interact with copper ions in the active center of the enzyme but could quench ﬂuorescence intensity and change the secondary conformation of this tyrosinase. A molecular dynamics simulation showed that caffeine bound this tyrosinase via Lys379, Lys 376, Asp357, Glu356, Thr308, Gln307, Asp312 and Trp358, thus changing the binding sites of  and the loop conformation adjacent to the active center. In vitro cell model analysis revealed that caffeine exhibited significant inhibitory effects on both intracellular tyrosinase activity and melanin production of B16-F10 melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. These comprehensive results suggest that caffeine is a strong tyrosinase inhibitor that has the potentials to be developed as skin-whitening agents in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries or as anti- agents in food industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414329>Alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis.</a></h2><p>Adaptive thermogenesis is the process of heat generation in response to cold stimulation. It is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, whose chief effector is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE). NE enhances thermogenesis through β3-adrenergic receptors to activate brown adipose tissue and by '' white adipose tissue. Recent studies have reported that alternative activation of macrophages in response to interleukin (IL)-4 stimulation induces the expression of  hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway, and that this activation provides an alternative source of locally produced catecholamines during the thermogenic process. Here we report that the deletion of Th in hematopoietic cells of adult mice neither alters energy expenditure upon cold exposure nor reduces  in inguinal adipose tissue. Bone marrow-derived macrophages did not release NE in response to stimulation with IL-4, and conditioned media from IL-4-stimulated macrophages failed to induce expression of thermogenic genes, such as uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in adipocytes cultured with the conditioned media. Furthermore, chronic treatment with IL-4 failed to increase energy expenditure in wild-type, Ucp1 and interleukin-4 receptor-α double-negative (Il4ra) mice. In agreement with these findings, adipose-tissue-resident macrophages did not express TH. Thus, we conclude that alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize relevant amounts of catecholamines, and hence, are not likely to have a direct role in adipocyte metabolism or adaptive thermogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15805475>Betaxanthins as substrates for tyrosinase. An approach to the role of tyrosinase in the biosynthetic pathway of betalains.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinase or polyphenol oxidase (EC 1.14.18.1) is the key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis and in the enzymatic  of fruits and vegetables. The role of tyrosinase in the secondary metabolism of plants still remains unclear, but its implication in betalain biosynthesis has been proposed. Betalains are an important class of water-soluble pigments, characteristic of plants belonging to the order Caryophyllales. In this article, the betaxanthins, -betaxanthin (portulacaxanthin II) and dopaxanthin, are reported to be physiological substrates for tyrosinase. The direct activity of tyrosinase on selected betaxanthins is characterized in depth, and conversion of -betaxanthin to dopaxanthin and its further oxidation to a series of compounds are described. Identity of the reaction products was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Masses determined for the reaction products were the same in all cases, 389 m/z ([M + H]+) and equal to that determined for betanidin. Data indicate that dopaxanthin-quinone is obtained and evolves to more stable species by intramolecular cyclization. Kinetic parameters for tyrosinase acting on dopaxanthin were evaluated, showing a high affinity for this substrate (K(m) = 84.3 microM). The biosynthetic scheme of betalains is reviewed and a branch is proposed based on the description of physiological substrates for tyrosinase. Lampranthus productus, Glottiphylum oligocarpum, and Glottiphylum pigmaeum are described as sources of stereopure (2S/S)-dopaxanthin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21680777>Functional adaptation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor to inhibition by ethanol is modulated by striatal-enriched protein  phosphatase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.</a></h2><p>The hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity plays important roles in cognition and is a major substrate for ethanol-induced memory dysfunction. This receptor is a glutamate-gated ion channel, which is composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits in various brain areas. Although homomeric NR1 subunits form an active ion channel that conducts Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ currents, the incorporation of NR2 subunits allows this channel to be modulated by the Src family of kinases, phosphatases, and by simple molecules such as ethanol. We have found that short-term ethanol application inhibits the NMDAR activity via striatal enriched protein  phosphatase (STEP)-regulated mechanisms. The genetic deletion of the active form of STEP, STEP61, leads to marked attenuation of ethanol inhibition of NMDAR currents. In addition, STEP61 negatively regulates Fyn and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and these proteins are members of the NMDAR super molecular complex. Here we demonstrate, using whole-cell electrophysiological recording, Western blot analysis, and pharmacological manipulations, that neurons exposed to a 3-h, 45 mM ethanol treatment develop an adaptive attenuation of short-term ethanol inhibition of NMDAR currents in brain slices. Our results suggest that this adaptation of NMDAR responses is associated with a partial inactivation of STEP61, an activation of p38 MAPK, and a requirement for NR2B activity. Together, these data indicate that altered STEP61 and p38 MAPK signaling contribute to the modulation of ethanol inhibition of NMDARs in brain neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922125>An ERβ agonist induces  of subcutaneous abdominal fat pad in obese female mice.</a></h2><p>Estrogen, via estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), exerts several beneficial effects on metabolism and energy homeostasis by controlling size, enzymatic activity and hormonal content of adipose tissue. The actions of estrogen on sympathetic ganglia, which are key players in the  process, are less well known. In the present study we show that ERβ influences  of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) via its actions both on sympathetic ganglia and on the SAT itself. A 3-day-treatment with a selective ERβ agonist, LY3201, induced  of SAT in 1-year-old obese WT and ERα female mice.  was associated with increased expression of ERβ in the nuclei of neurons in the sympathetic ganglia, increase in  hydroxylase in both nerve terminals in the SAT and sympathetic ganglia neurons and an increase of β3-adrenoceptor in the SAT. LY3201 had no effect on  in young female or male mice. In the case of young females  was already maximal while in males there was very little expression of ERβ in the SAT and very little expression of the β3-adrenoceptor. The increase in both sympathetic tone and responsiveness of adipocytes to catecholamines reveals a novel role for ERβ in controlling  of adipose tissue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9706790>Pigment producing yeasts involved in the brown surface discoloration of ewes' cheese.</a></h2><p>The appearance of a brown surface discoloration on Portuguese ewes' cheese has never previously been reported on. The regular occurrence of this defect over the past few years has caused serious financial losses to producers, which has led to growing interest in its study. This paper describes a preliminary approach to the problem, based on the hypothesis that pigment producing yeasts are involved. From a group of 51 yeast strains isolated from a number of brown cheese rinds, it was possible to distinguish four pigment producing groups: group I (12 strains), produced an extracellular brown pigment from  and alkalised the tested media; group II (21 strains), produced a diffusible, reddish-brown pigment from resorcinol and alkalised the tested media; group III (three strains), alkalised the tested media without producing any pigments; group IV (15 strains), neither produced pigments nor alkalised the media. Yarrowia lipolytica and Candida catenulata type strains were also tested and their behaviour was similar to the strains in groups I and IV, respectively. The Filobasidiella neoformans type strain was distinct from all the other groups. The identification methods used for some strains in groups I, II and III suggest that Yarrowia lipolytica species is common to all strains in group I, and that Debaryomyces hansenii is present in both groups II and III. A study of the effect of several metal ions on the production of the brown pigment from  indicated Mn2+ to be a strong activator. Evidence is provided suggesting that the  process may be related to  Yarrowia lipolytica metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6437166>Relation between structure of polyphenol oxidase and prevention of .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23934488>Monitoring the metabolic state of fungal hyphae and the presence of melanin by nonlinear spectral imaging.</a></h2><p>Label-free nonlinear spectral imaging microscopy (NLSM) records two-photon-excited fluorescence emission spectra of endogenous fluorophores within the specimen. Here, NLSM is introduced as a novel, minimally invasive method to analyze the metabolic state of fungal hyphae by monitoring the autofluorescence of NAD(P)H and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Moreover, the presence of melanin was analyzed by NLSM. NAD(P)H, FAD, and melanin were used as biomarkers for freshness of mushrooms of Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) that had been stored at 4°C for 0 to 17 days. During this period, the mushrooms did not show changes in morphology or color detectable by eye. In contrast, FAD/NAD(P)H and melanin/NAD(P)H ratios increased over time. For instance, these ratios increased from 0.92 to 2.02 and from 0.76 to 1.53, respectively, at the surface of mushroom caps that had been harvested by cutting the stem. These ratios were lower under the skin than at the surface of fresh mushrooms (0.78 versus 0.92 and 0.41 versus 0.76, respectively), indicative of higher metabolism and lower pigment formation within the fruiting body. Signals were different not only between tissues of the mushroom but also between neighboring hyphae. These data show that NLSM can be used to determine the freshness of mushrooms and to monitor the postharvest  process at an early stage. Moreover, these data demonstrate the potential of NLSM to address a broad range of fundamental and applied microbiological processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21544943>Screening of marine algae for potential tyrosinase inhibitor: those inhibitors reduced tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>In order to find new anti- and whitening agents in this study, we investigated 43 indigenous marine algae for tyrosinase inhibitory activity. The extracts from Endarachne binghamiae, Schizymenia dubyi, Ecklonia cava (EC) and Sargassum silquastrum (SS) evidenced potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity similar to that of positive control, kojic acid. Among those marine algae, EC and SS are distributed abundantly on Jeju Island. Therefore, we selected those two species for further studies. Our results evidenced that both species reduced cellular melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity. On the other hand, we utilized zebrafish as an alternative in vivo model. All the tested samples evidenced excellent inhibitory effects on the pigmentation of zebrafish, most likely due to their potential tyrosinase inhibitory activity. In simultaneous in vivo toxicity tests, no toxicity was observed in either algal species, on the other hand, toxicity was observed in positive controls. These results provided that EC and SS extract could be used as an ingredient for whiting cosmetics and that zebrafish is an alternative in vivo model.© 2010 Japanese Dermatological Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186846>Shelf life, physicochemical, microbiological and antioxidant properties of purple cactus pear (Opuntia ficus indica) juice after thermoultrasound treatment.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in color, betalain content,  index, viscosity, physical stability, microbiological growth, antioxidant content and antioxidant activity of purple cactus pear juice during storage after thermoultrasonication at 80% amplitude level for 15 and 25 min in comparison with pasteurized juice. Thermoultrasound treatment for 25 min increased color stability and viscosity compared to treatment for 15 min (6.83 and 6.72 MPa, respectively), but this last parameter was significantly lower (p<0.05) compared to the control and pasteurized juices (22.47 and 26.32 MPa, respectively). Experimental treatment reduced significantly (p<0.05) sediment solids in juices. Total plate counts decreased from the first day of storage exhibiting values of 1.38 and 1.43 logCFU/mL, for 15 and 25 min treatment, respectively. Compared to the control, both treatments reduced enterobacteria counts (1.54 logCFU/mL), and compared to pasteurized juice decreased pectinmethylesterase activity (3.76 and 3.82 UPE/mL), maintained high values of ascorbic acid (252.05 and 257.18 mg AA/L) and antioxidant activity (by ABTS: 124.8 and 115.6 mg VCEAC/100 mL; and DPPH: 3114.2 and 2757.1 μmol TE/L). During storage thermoultrasonicated juices had a minimum increase in pectinmethylesterase activity (from day 14), and exhibited similar total plate counts to pasteurized juice. An increase of phenolic content was observed after 14 days of storage, particularly for treatment at 80%, 25 min, and an increase in antioxidant activity (ABTS, DPPH) by the end of storage.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Adult female sheep were given an acute (over 30 min) or chronic (over 1 week) injection of MPTP (0.4-5.0 mg/kg) via the common carotid artery. Both methods produced parkinsonian-like behavior. Turning contralateral to the side of injection was induced by apomorphine (APO) in both groups. However, amphetamine (AMP) induced ipsilateral turning only in the chronic treatment group. Acute and chronic MPTP treatment resulted in a loss of substantia nigra  hydroxylase immunoreactive (THIR) neurons with a significantly greater loss ipsilateral to the injection in each treatment group (acute p < 0.05; chronic p < 0.01). Caudate dopamine (DA) was depleted in both treatment groups, although the difference between ipsilateral and contralateral DA content was significant only in the chronic treatment group (p < 0.05). The best results were seen in those animals with chronic infusion with the occipital artery occluded to prevent entry of drug into the posterior circulation with subsequent bilateral distribution. Use of slow and continuous intracarotid administration of MPTP with the ipsilateral occipital artery occluded can prevent some of the bilateral effects of acute treatment, and results in statistically significant ipsilateral reduction of THIR neurons in the substantia nigra and reduction of tissue levels of DA in the caudate nucleus. Such treatment produces appropriate turning responses to both AMP and APO challenge not seen in the acute treatment group, and appears to be an effective method of producing parkinsonian-like behavior in a large animal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8330260>Properties of the genus Tatlockia.

Except for catalase activity, Tatlockia strains were relatively inert in the biochemical tests commonly used in clinical laboratories. Phenotypically, the two Tatlockia species could be distinguished from other legionellae by the presence of yersiniose A, by their inability to hydrolyze hippurate or starch, by the absence of colony or media fluorescence, and by the absence of distinct  of -containing medium. These two species differed from one another by the production of acetoin by T. micdadei but not by T. maceachernii. Gelatinase activity, which had been reported in T. maceachernii, was observed in only one of the four strains studied. The 16S-rRNA sequences and carbohydrate profiles of T. maceachernii and T. micdadei were essentially identical. In preparing the RNA for study, it was noted that the 23S rRNA was fragmented in all T. maceachernii strains tested, while the 23S rRNA of T. micdadei strains was intact.

Although the function of tyrosinase in the secondary metabolism of plants remains unclear, it has been proposed that the enzyme plays a role in the betalain biosynthetic pathway. Betalains are an important class of water-soluble pigments, characteristic of plants belonging to the order Caryophyllales. In the present work, the betaxanthins tyramine-betaxanthin (miraxanthin III) and dopamine-betaxanthin (miraxanthin V) are reported as new natural substrates for tyrosinase. The result of the diphenolase activity of the enzyme on dopamine-betaxanthin was a series of products identified by HPLC and ESI-MS as quinone-derivatives. Data indicate that dopamine-betaxanthin-quinone is obtained and evolves to more stable species by intramolecular cyclization. The kinetic parameters evaluated for the diphenolase activity were V(m) = 74.4 microM min(-1), K(m) = 94.7 microM. Monophenolase activity on tyramine-betaxanthin yielded the same compounds in the absence of a reducing agent, but when ascorbic acid was present enzymatic conversion to dopamine-betaxanthin could be found. For the first time, kinetic characterization of the monophenolase activity of tyrosinase on betaxanthins is provided (V(m) = 10.4 microM min(-1) and K(m) = 126.9 microM) and a lag period is described and analyzed according to the mechanism of action of the enzyme. The high affinity shown by tyrosinase for these substrates may be indicative of a previously unconsidered physiological role in betalain metabolism. A possible mechanism for the formation of 2-descarboxy-betacyanins from tyramine-betaxanthin by tyrosinase is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518367>Electric stimulation of ears accelerates body weight loss mediated by high-fat to low-fat diet switch accompanied by increased white adipose tissue  in C57BL/6 J mice.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction frequently occurs in patients receiving vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy.

Some of the flavonoids mostly found in herbal plants and fruits are revealed as tyrosinase inhibitors. We studied the inhibitory effects of one such flavonoid, hesperetin, on mushroom tyrosinase using inhibition kinetics and computational simulation. Hesperetin reversibly inhibited tyrosinase in a competitive manner with K(i)=4.03±0.26 mM. Measurements of ANS-binding fluorescence showed that hesperetin induced the hydrophobic disruption of tyrosinase. For further insight, we used the docking algorithms to simulate binding between tyrosinase and hesperetin. Simulation was successful (binding energies for Dock6.3: -34.41 kcal/mol and for AutoDock4.2: -5.67 kcal/mol) and showed that a copper ion coordinating with 3 histidine residues (HIS61, HIS85, and HIS259) within the active site pocket was chelated via hesperetin binding. Our study provides insight into the inhibition of tyrosinase in response to flavonoids. A combination of inhibition kinetics and computational prediction may facilitate the identification of potential natural tyrosinase inhibitors such as flavonoids and the prediction of their inhibitory mechanisms.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of telmisartan on macrophage polarization in association with its  capacity, because PPARγ plays a key role in M2 polarization and in the  of white adipocytes. Telmisartan induced M2 marker expression in murine macrophages concentration dependently, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Both PPARγ and PPARδ activations appear to be responsible for telmisartan-induced M2 polarization. Telmisartan-treated conditioned medium (Tel-CM) of RAW264.7 cells and of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) induced the expressions of  markers in fully differentiated white adipocytes with reduced lipid droplets, and increased oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial biogenesis. Levels of catecholamines (CA) released into the conditioned medium as well as intracellular  hydroxylase (TH) mRNAs were found to be increased by telmisartan, and  effects of Tel-CM were lessened by β3 receptor antagonist (L-748,337), suggesting CA secreted into CM play a role in Tel-CM-induced adipocyte . Acute administration of telmisartan (2 weeks, p.o.) to C57BL/6J mice increased the expressions of  markers and M2 markers in white adipose tissues, whereas macrophage depletion by clodronate liposome pretreatment attenuated the telmisartan-induced expressions of  markers.

FMRP, p70-S6 kinase (S6K) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are thought to cooperate as a dynamic signaling complex. In our prior work, adult rats have enhanced CA1 hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) following an early life seizure (ELS). We now show that mGluR-mediated LTD (mLTD) is specifically enhanced following ELS, similar to FMRP knock-outs. Total FMRP expression is unchanged but S6K is hyperphosphorylated, consistent with S6K overactivation. We postulated that either disruption of the FMRP-S6K-PP2A complex and/or removal of this complex from synapses could explain our findings. Using subcellular fractionation, we were surprised to find that concentrations of FMRP and PP2A were undisturbed in the synaptosomal compartment but reduced in parallel in the cytosolic compartment. Following ELS FMRP phosphorylation was reduced in the cytosolic compartment and increased in the synaptic compartment, in parallel with the compartmentalization of S6K activation. Furthermore, FMRP and PP2A remain bound following ELS. In contrast, the interaction of S6K with FMRP is reduced by ELS. Blockade of PP2A results in enhanced mLTD; this is occluded by ELS. This suggests a critical role for the location and function of the FMRP-S6K-PP2A signaling complex in limiting the amount of mLTD. Specifically, non-synaptic targeting and the function of the complex may influence the "set-point" for regulating mLTD. Consistent with this, striatal-enriched protein  phosphatase (STEP), an FMRP "target" which regulates mLTD expression, is specifically increased in the synaptosomal compartment following ELS. Further, we provide behavioral data to suggest that FMRP complex dysfunction may underlie altered socialization, a symptom associated and observed in other rodent models of autism, including FXS.© 2013.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28801784>Prior Repeated Stress Attenuates Cold-Induced Immunomodulation Associated with "" in Mesenteric Fat of Rats.</a></h2><p>Continuous exposure to cold leads to activation of adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue but also to induction of brown/beige cell phenotype in white adipose tissue.

Induction of non-sympathetic catecholamine production demonstrated by elevated TH and PNMT (phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) mRNAs was observed after 7-day cold; however, prior IMO attenuated this response. 7-day cold-induced gene expression of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, adiponectin), markers of M2 macrophages (Arg1, Retnlα), and eosinophil-associated molecules (eotaxin, IL-5), while inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17) and monocytes (MCP-1, Ly6C). This immune response was accompanied by elevated expression of uncoupling protein-1 and other thermogenic factors. Rats exposed to prior IMO exhibited inhibition of cold-induced immune and ""-related expression pattern. Overall, we demonstrated that 7-day cold-induced "-associated changes in rat mWAT, while prior history of repeated stress prevented this response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/404775>[Studies on enzymic  of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum).

This study investigated whether phyllodulcin could improve metabolic abnormalities in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Animals were fed a 60% HFD for 6 weeks to induce obesity, followed by 7 weeks of supplementation with phyllodulcin (20 or 40 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)/day). Stevioside (40 mg/kg b.w./day) was used as a positive control. Phyllodulcin supplementation reduced subcutaneous fat mass, levels of plasma lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and improved the levels of leptin, adiponectin, and fasting blood glucose. In subcutaneous fat tissues, supplementation with stevioside or phyllodulcin significantly decreased mRNA expression of lipogenesis-related genes, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1C () compared to the high-fat group. Phyllodulcin supplementation significantly increased the expression of fat -related genes, including PR domain containing 16 (), uncoupling protein 1 (), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (), compared to the high-fat group. Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF-TrkB) signaling was upregulated by phyllodulcin supplementation. In conclusion, phyllodulcin is a potential sweetener that could be used to combat obesity by regulating levels of leptin, fat -related genes, and hypothalamic BDNF-TrkB signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21598351>A randomized two-by-two comparison of high-dose bolus tirofiban versus abciximab and unfractionated heparin versus bivalirudin during percutaneous coronary revascularization and stent placement: the tirofiban evaluation of novel dosing versus abciximab with clopidogrel and inhibition of thrombin (TENACITY) study trial.</a></h2><p>In the absence of high-dose thienopyridines, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated a reduction in ischemic events with intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). One head-to-head trial comparing abciximab and tirofiban among PCI patients found tirofiban to be inferior, and laboratory evidence confirmed that the bolus dose of tirofiban tested in that trial to be less effective than abciximab. Whether a higher bolus dose of tirofiban would be as efficacious as abciximab during PCI is uncertain.Patients undergoing PCI were randomized equally to abciximab or to tirofiban, given as high-dose bolus (25 μg/kg) plus 12-hr infusion (0.15 μg/kg/min). All patients received aspirin and clopidogrel and were additionally randomized to unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin. Approximately 8,000 patients were to be studied, but after 383 were enrolled, the study sponsor discontinued the trial for financial reasons. The primary endpoint of 30-day death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularization occurred in 8.8% of patients randomized to abciximab and 6.9% of those randomized to tirofiban. The respective rates of major bleeding were 1.5 and 1.6%. Additionally, the primary endpoint occurred in 8.1% of patients randomized to unfractionated heparin and 7.6% of those randomized to bivalirudin. The respective rates of major bleeding were 2.5% and 0.5%.With limited assessment, this direct comparison of high-dose bolus tirofiban versus abciximab produced encouraging results and suggests that further study of this tirofiban dose regimen is warranted. The limited assessments comparing heparin and bivalirudin are consistent with prior observations.Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1674695>Intracerebral grafting of fetal dorsal pons in genetically epilepsy-prone rats: effects on audiogenic-induced seizures.</a></h2><p>The present experiments investigated if dorsal pontine tissue obtained from 16-day postconception rat fetuses and stereotaxically transplanted into the dorsal hippocampus or third ventricle of genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs) would alter the expression of audiogenic seizures.

Dietary copper limitation is known to result in noninflammatory atrophy of pancreatic acinar tissue. Our recent studies have suggested that vagal motoneurons regulate pancreatic exocrine secretion (PES) by activating selective subpopulations of neurons within vagovagal reflexive neurocircuits. We used a combination of in vivo, in vitro, and immunohistochemistry techniques in a rat model of copper deficiency to investigate the effects of a copper-deficient diet on the neural pathways controlling PES. Duodenal infusions of Ensure or casein, as well as microinjections of sulfated CCK-8, into the dorsal vagal complex resulted in an attenuated stimulation of PES in copper-deficient animals compared with controls. Immunohistochemistry of brain stem slices revealed that copper deficiency reduced the number of  hydroxylase-immunoreactive, but not neuronal nitric oxide synthase- or choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive, neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Moreover, a copper-deficient diet reduced the number of large (>11 neurons), but not small, intrapancreatic ganglia. Electrophysiological recordings showed that DMV neurons from copper-deficient rats are less responsive to CCK-8 or pancreatic polypeptide than are DMV neurons from control rats. Our results demonstrate that copper deficiency decreases efferent vagal outflow to the exocrine pancreas. These data indicate that the combined selective loss of acinar pancreatic tissue and the decreased excitability of efferent vagal neurons induce a deficit in the vagal modulation of PES.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21464302>Alcohol inhibition of the NMDA receptor function, long-term potentiation, and fear learning requires striatal-enriched protein  phosphatase.</a></h2><p>Alcohol's deleterious effects on memory are well known. Acute alcohol-induced memory loss is thought to occur via inhibition of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. We reported previously that ethanol inhibition of NMDAR function and long-term potentiation is correlated with a reduction in the phosphorylation of Tyr(1472) on the NR2B subunit and ethanol's inhibition of the NMDAR field excitatory postsynaptic potential was attenuated by a broad spectrum  phosphatase inhibitor. These data suggested that ethanol's inhibitory effect may involve protein  phosphatases. Here we demonstrate that the loss of striatal-enriched protein  phosphatase (STEP) renders NMDAR function, phosphorylation, and long-term potentiation, as well as fear conditioning, less sensitive to ethanol inhibition. Moreover, the ethanol inhibition was "rescued" when the active STEP protein was reintroduced into the cells. Taken together, our data suggest that STEP contributes to ethanol inhibition of NMDAR function via dephosphorylation of  sites on NR2B receptors and lend support to the hypothesis that STEP may be required for ethanol's amnesic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24449710>Novel roles for the polyphenol oxidase enzyme in secondary metabolism and the regulation of cell death in walnut.</a></h2><p>The enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzes the oxidation of phenolic compounds into highly reactive quinones. Polymerization of PPO-derived quinones causes the postharvest  of cut or bruised fruit, but the native physiological functions of PPOs in undamaged, intact plant cells are not well understood. Walnut (Juglans regia) produces a rich array of phenolic compounds and possesses a single PPO enzyme, rendering it an ideal model to study PPO. We generated a series of PPO-silenced transgenic walnut lines that display less than 5% of wild-type PPO activity. Strikingly, the PPO-silenced plants developed spontaneous necrotic lesions on their leaves in the absence of pathogen challenge (i.e. a lesion mimic phenotype). To gain a clearer perspective on the potential functions of PPO and its possible connection to cell death, we compared the leaf transcriptomes and metabolomes of wild-type and PPO-silenced plants. Silencing of PPO caused major alterations in the metabolism of phenolic compounds and their derivatives (e.g. coumaric acid and catechin) and in the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. Several observed metabolic changes point to a direct role for PPO in the metabolism of  and in the biosynthesis of the hydroxycoumarin esculetin in vivo. In addition, PPO-silenced plants displayed massive (9-fold) increases in the -derived metabolite tyramine, whose exogenous application elicits cell death in walnut and several other plant species. Overall, these results suggest that PPO plays a novel and fundamental role in secondary metabolism and acts as an indirect regulator of cell death in walnut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16257472> phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor is enhanced in synaptic membrane fractions of the adult rat hippocampus.</a></h2><p>Hippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) contribute to the expression of certain types of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP). It is well documented that  kinases increase NMDAR phosphorylation and potentiate NMDAR function. However, it is unclear how these phosphorylation changes result in enhanced NMDAR activity. We previously reported that NMDAR surface expression can be increased by LTP-inducing stimulation via  kinase-dependent mechanisms in the adult hippocampus [D.R. Grosshans, D.A. Clayton, S.J. Coultrap, M.D. , Nat. Neurosci., 5 (2002) 27-33]. We therefore hypothesized that  phosphorylation of the NMDAR may enhance the trafficking of the receptor to the synaptic membrane. Here, we show that the stoichiometry of NR2A and NR2B  phosphorylation is significantly higher in synaptosomal membranes than intracellular microsomal/light membranes. Interestingly, NR2B -1472, but not NR1 serine-896 or -897, phosphorylation is significantly higher in synaptosomal membranes than intracellular microsomal/light membranes. Furthermore, treatment of hippocampal slices with either a  phosphatase inhibitor or a  kinase inhibitor alters NMDAR  phosphorylation and produces a corresponding change in the concentration of NMDARs in the synaptosomal membrane fraction. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that  phosphorylation may enhance NMDAR activity by increasing the number of NMDARs at the synaptic membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31344959>Phlorotannins with Potential Anti-tyrosinase and Antioxidant Activity Isolated from the Marine Seaweed .</a></h2><p>Compounds were isolated from  Okamura, a marine brown alga widely consumed as food.

Molecular docking simulations clarified that the hydroxyl residues of the isolated compounds formed hydrogen bonds with residues at the catalytic and allosteric sites of tyrosinase, while other residues participated in hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, 974-A, phlorofucofuroeckol-A and eckol reduced the cellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity, and downregulated the expression of melanogenesis enzymes including tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 in B16F10 melanoma cells.

Increased c-Fes expression is associated with differentiation in normal myeloid cells and cell lines. Our hypothesis was that primary leukemia cells would show a similar pattern of increased expression in more differentiated cells. Therefore, we compared c-Fes expression in cells with an undifferentiated, blast phenotype (acute myelogenous leukemia--AML) to cells with a differentiated phenotype (chronic myelogenous leukemia--CML). Instead of differences in p93 expression levels, we found complex patterns of c-Fes immunoreactive proteins that corresponded with differentiation in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. The "blast" pattern consisted of c-Fes immunoreactive proteins p93, p74, and p70; the "differentiated" pattern showed two additional c-Fes immunoreactive proteins, p67 and p62. Using mRNA from mouse and human cell lines, we found deletion of one or more exons in the c-fes mRNA. Those deletions predicted truncation of conserved domains (CDC15/FCH and SH2) involved in protein-protein interactions. No deletions were found, however, within the kinase domain. We infer that alternative splicing generates a family of c-Fes proteins. This may be a mechanism to direct the c-Fes kinase domain to different subcellular locations and/or substrates at specific stages of myeloid cell differentiation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6547453>Clinical laboratory differentiation of Legionellaceae family members with pigment production and fluorescence on media supplemented with aromatic substrates.</a></h2><p>A systematic study of pigment production () and fluorescence (extracellular yellow-green and intracellular blue-white) by nine Legionellaceae species was performed.

This study aimed to identify the gastric projections of  hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) DMV neurons, whether such neurons colocalize NOS-IR, and if they are activated after esophageal distension. Gastric-projecting neurons were identified after injection of retrograde tracers into the muscle wall of the gastric fundus, corpus, or antrum/pylorus before removal and processing of the brain stems for TH- and NOS-IR. A significantly higher proportion of corpus- compared with fundus- and antrum/pylorus-projecting neurons were TH-IR (14% compared with 4% and 2%, respectively, P < 0.05). Colocalization of NOS- and TH-IR was never observed in gastric-projecting neurons. In rats tested for c-Fos activation after intermittent esophageal balloon distension, no colocalization with TH-IR was observed in DMV neurons. These findings suggest that TH-IR neurons in the caudal DMV project mainly to the gastric corpus, constitute a subpopulation distinct from that of nitrergic vagal neurons, and are not activated on esophageal distension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21384380>Tyrosinase inhibition by water and ethanol extracts of a far eastern sea cucumber, Stichopus japonicus.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinase plays a key role in hyperpigmentaion and enzymatic . The present study was aimed at investigating the inhibitory effects of water and 70% aqueous ethanol extracts of Stichopus japonicus, a sea cucumber long consumed as a tonic food and traditional medicine, on the diphenolase activity of tyrosinase.In the tyrosinase inhibition study, high-performance liquid chromatography completely separated L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopachrome from other compounds present in the extracts, and provided more reliable results than the commonly used spectrophotometry. The ethanol extract (IC(50)=0.49-0.61 mg mL(-1)) showed higher inhibitory activity than the water extract (IC(50)=1.80-1.99 mg mL(-1)). Enzyme inhibition by the extracts was reversible and of mixed type. For both extracts, the dissociation constants for binding to free enzyme were significantly smaller than those for binding to enzyme-substrate complex. Ethyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (IC(50)=0.19 mg mL(-1)), isolated for the first time from sea cucumber, and adenosine (IC(50)=0.13 mg mL(-1)), were identified as key tyrosinase inhibitors.The sea cucumber extracts were demonstrated to possess considerable inhibitory potency against the diphenolase activity of tyrosinase, suggesting that the sea cucumber may be a good source of safe and effective tyrosinase inhibitors.Copyright © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28108609>Visualization and Quantification of  Using a Ucp1-2A-Luciferase Knock-in Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Both mammals and adult humans possess classic brown adipocytes and beige adipocytes, and the amount and activity of these adipocytes are considered key factors in combating obesity and its associated metabolic diseases. Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) is the functional marker of both brown and beige adipocytes.

This peptide was followed by the luciferase coding sequence to recapitulate the expression of the Ucp1 gene at the transcriptional and translational levels. With this mouse, we discovered a cold-sensitive brown/beige adipose depot underneath the skin of the ears, which we named uBAT. Because of the sensitivity and high dynamic range of luciferase activity, the Ucp1-2A-luciferase mouse is useful for both in vitro quantitative determination and in vivo visualization of nonshivering thermogenesis.

Stomatal opening as a result of the electrical treatment of leaves was observed, presumably due to the differential influence of the electrical treatment on guard cell turgor pressure versus turgor pressure of the surrounding epidermal cells. In addition, leakage of minerals from the treated leaves was detected (higher contents of potassium, sodium, calcium and sulfur), as was leakage of betanin from electrically treated red beet roots (higher OD value of the immersion solution with increasing time of applied electrical field). Application of such a treatment can be used for initial drying or as part of another more drastic drying method.

A modest, transient reduction in blood pressure and adverse events consistent with vasodilatory activity of AKB-9778 emerged at doses of 22.5 mg or more twice daily.

Since the major fatty acid α-eleostearic acid (α-ESA) in BMSO is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) activator, the objective was to investigate the role of PPARα in BMSO-modulated lipid disorders and α-ESA metabolism. C57BL/6J wild (WD) and PPARα knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet containing BMSO (15% soybean oil + 15% BMSO, HB) or not (30% soybean oil, HS) for 5 weeks. The HB diet significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations and increased acyl-CoA oxidase activity in WD, but not in KO mice. However, regardless of genotype, body fat percentage was lowered along with upregulated protein levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and  hydroxylase, as well as signaling pathway of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase in the white adipose tissue of HB-treated groups compared to HS cohorts. In WD-HB and KO-HB groups, white adipose tissue had autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, and  characteristics. Without PPARα, in vivo reduction of α-ESA into rumenic acid was slightly but significantly lowered, along with remarkable reduction of hepatic retinol saturase () expression. We concluded that BMSO-mediated anti-steatosis depended on PPARα, whereas the anti-adiposity effect was PPARα-independent.

In neurons from mice lacking c-Src, PKC-dependent upregulation was absent. Thus, G-protein-coupled receptors can regulate NMDA receptor function indirectly through a PKC-dependent activation of the non-receptor  kinase (Src) signaling cascade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409609>Identifying an isoflavone from the root of Pueraria lobata as a potent tyrosinase inhibitor.</a></h2><p>Traditionally, the root of Pueraria lobata are widely used as a functional food. It was observed that a 70% ethanol extract showed a dose-dependent inhibition towards mushroom tyrosinase. Among the different isolated compounds, calycosin demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against substrates  and l-DOPA, with IC of 1.45 ± 0.03 and 7.02 ± 0.46 µM, respectively. Conversely, formononetin and daidzein exhibit weak inhibition. Moreover, kinetic studies revealed calycosin to be a competitive inhibitor for both substrates. Additionally, molecular docking simulation showed that the hydroxyl groups at C-3' and C-7 positions interacted with the catalytic site and peripheral residues, demonstrating a higher affinity toward mushroom tyrosinase. Accordingly, our results suggest that, rather than a mono-substituted hydroxyl or methoxyl group, the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-3' and a methoxyl group at C-4' position of the isoflavone skeleton plays an essential role in the manifestation of anti- activity in food products.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Enzymatic browning occurring during grinding of insect and subsequent extraction of proteins can influence the proteins' properties, but it is unclear which enzymes are responsible for this phenomenon. This study was performed on larvae of three commonly used insect species, namely Tenebrio molitor, Alphitobius diaperinus and Hermetia illucens. Oxygen consumption measurements on protein extracts showed activity on , L-3,4-di-hydroxy-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) and L-dopamine, indicating phenoloxidase as a key player in browning. Furthermore, no reaction on 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) was observed, ruling out an important contribution of laccase to browning. The browning reaction was most prominent at pH 6 for T. molitor and A. diaperinus, and 7 for H. illucens. As the enzyme activity of H. illucens was the lowest with the darkest color formation, this was likely caused by another factor. The activity of phenoloxidase was confirmed for T. molitor and A. diaperinus by activity measurements after fractionation by anion-exchange chromatography. Color measurements showed the presence of activity on both L-DOPA and  in the same fractions. Both substrates were converted into dopachrome after incubation with enzyme-enriched fractions. No DOPA-decarboxylase,  hydroxylase and peroxidase activities were observed. By using native PAGE with L-DOPA as staining-solution, active T. molitor protein bands were resolved and characterized, identifying a tyrosinase/phenoloxidase as the active enzyme species. All together, these data confirmed that tyrosinase is an important enzyme in causing enzymatic browning in T. molitor and likely in A. diaperinus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27200287>Durable Response of Spinal Chordoma to Combined Inhibition of IGF-1R and EGFR.</a></h2><p>Chordomas are rare primary malignant bone tumors arising from embryonal notochord remnants of the axial skeleton. Chordomas commonly recur following surgery and radiotherapy, and there is no effective systemic therapy. Previous studies implicated receptor  kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), in chordoma biology. We report an adult female patient who presented in 2003 with spinal chordoma, treated with surgery and radiotherapy. She underwent further surgery for recurrent chordoma in 2008, with subsequent progression in pelvic deposits. In June 2009, she was recruited onto the Phase I OSI-906-103 trial of EGFR inhibitor erlotinib with linsitinib, a novel inhibitor of IGF-1R/insulin receptor (INSR). Treatment with 100 mg QD erlotinib and 50 mg QD linsitinib was well-tolerated, and after 18 months a partial response was achieved by RECIST criteria. From 43 months, a protocol modification allowed intra-patient linsitinib dose escalation to 50 mg BID. The patient remained stable on trial treatment for a total of 5 years, discontinuing treatment in August 2014. She subsequently experienced further disease progression for which she underwent pelvic surgery in April 2015. Analysis of DNA extracted from 2008 (pre-trial) tissue showed that the tumor harbored wild-type EGFR, and a PIK3CA mutation was detected in plasma, but not tumor DNA. The 2015 (post-trial) tumor harbored a mutation of uncertain significance in ATM, with no detectable mutations in other components of a 50 gene panel, including EGFR, PIK3CA, and TP53. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor was positive for brachyury, the molecular hallmark of chordoma, and showed weak-moderate membrane and cytoplasmic EGFR. IGF-1R was detected in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm and was expressed more strongly in recurrent tumor than the primary. We also noted heterogeneous nuclear IGF-1R, which has been linked with sensitivity to IGF-1R inhibition. Similar variation in IGF-1R expression and subcellular localization was noted in 15 further cases of chordoma. In summary, this exceptionally durable response suggests that there may be merit in evaluating combined IGF-1R/INSR and EGFR inhibition in patients with chordomas that recur following failure of local treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22662188>Radiation induces acute alterations in neuronal function.</a></h2><p>Every year, nearly 200,000 patients undergo radiation for brain tumors. For both patients and caregivers the most distressing adverse effect is impaired cognition. Efforts to protect against this debilitating effect have suffered from inadequate understanding of the cellular mechanisms of radiation damage. In the past it was accepted that radiation-induced normal tissue injury resulted from a progressive reduction in the survival of clonogenic cells. Moreover, because radiation-induced brain dysfunction is believed to evolve over months to years, most studies have focused on late changes in brain parenchyma. However, clinically, acute changes in cognition are also observed. Because neurons are fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, little information exists on the acute effects of radiation on synaptic function. The purpose of our study was to assess the potential acute effects of radiation on neuronal function utilizing ex vivo hippocampal brain slices. The cellular localization and functional status of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors was identified by immunoblotting. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained both for populations of neuronal cells and individual neurons. In the dentate gyrus region of isolated ex vivo slices, radiation led to early decreases in  phosphorylation and removal of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) from the cell surface while simultaneously increasing the surface expression of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)Rs). These alterations in cellular localization corresponded with altered synaptic responses and inhibition of long-term potentiation. The non-competitive NMDAR antagonist memantine blocked these radiation-induced alterations in cellular distribution. These findings demonstrate acute effects of radiation on neuronal cells within isolated brain slices and open new avenues for study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803745>Antityrosinase mechanism of omeprazole and its application on the preservation of fresh-cut Fuji apple.</a></h2><p>Omeprazole was first evaluated for its antityrosinase activity and preservation of fresh-cut apples. The results obtained from enzymic analyses showed that the omeprazole inhibited tyrosinase activity (IC = 40 ± 1.2 μM) with a reversible and competitive mechanism. Fluorescence quenching assays demonstrated that the interaction between omeprazole and tyrosinase was driven by hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds in a static procedure. Molecular docking further revealed that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces were generated by omeprazole with the amino acid residues located in the A chain of tyrosinase. Moreover, the results from preservation assays showed that omeprazole could inhibit the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD), prevent the oxidation of total phenolics and flavonoid, thereby delay the browning of fresh-cut apples. Hence, this work identified a novel tyrosinase inhibitor and expands its feasible application as a food preservative.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although a cold environment is the physiologic stimulus for inducing beige fat in mice and humans, the events that lead from the sensing of cold to the development of beige fat remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the efferent beige fat thermogenic circuit, consisting of eosinophils, type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/13, and alternatively activated macrophages. Genetic loss of eosinophils or IL-4/13 signaling impairs cold-induced biogenesis of beige fat. Mechanistically, macrophages recruited to cold-stressed subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) undergo alternative activation to induce  hydroxylase expression and catecholamine production, factors required for  of scWAT. Conversely, administration of IL-4 to thermoneutral mice increases beige fat mass and thermogenic capacity to ameliorate pre-established obesity. Together, our findings have uncovered the efferent circuit controlling biogenesis of beige fat and provide support for its targeting to treat obesity.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The IC50 of HQ17(1) as a tyrosinase inhibitor was 37 microM versus 70 microM for hydroquinone (HQ), a known inhibitor of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. For the inhibition of melanin production in mouse B16 melanoma cells, the EC50 of HQ17(1) was 40 microM versus 124 microM for HQ. HQ17(1) induced much less oxidative stress than did HQ. The effectiveness in inhibiting melanin production could be mimicked by intermittent exposure of cells to HQ17(1). The potent inhibitory effects of HQ17(1) on tyrosinase activity and melanin production are likely due to its heptadecenyl chain, which facilitates retention of the compound in cell membrane compartments and may impede oxidation of the hydroquinone ring. As tyrosinase activity accounts for postharvest  of botanical products and animal skin melanogenesis, HQ17(1) could be useful for the preservation of these products or as a skin-whitening cosmetic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26026062>The Tec Kinase-Regulated Phosphoproteome Reveals a Mechanism for the Regulation of Inhibitory Signals in Murine Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Previous work has shown conflicting roles for Tec family kinases in regulation of TLR-dependent signaling in myeloid cells. In the present study, we performed a detailed investigation of the role of the Tec kinases Btk and Tec kinases in regulating TLR signaling in several types of primary murine macrophages. We demonstrate that primary resident peritoneal macrophages deficient for Btk and Tec secrete less proinflammatory cytokines in response to TLR stimulation than do wild-type cells. In contrast, we found that bone marrow-derived and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages deficient for Btk and Tec secrete more proinflammatory cytokines than do wild-type cells. We then compared the phosphoproteome regulated by Tec kinases and LPS in primary peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages. From this analysis we determined that Tec kinases regulate different signaling programs in these cell types. In additional studies using bone marrow-derived macrophages, we found that Tec and Btk promote phosphorylation events necessary for immunoreceptor-mediated inhibition of TLR signaling. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model where Tec kinases (Btk, Tec, Bmx) are required for TLR-dependent signaling in many types of myeloid cells. However, our data also support a cell type-specific TLR inhibitory role for Btk and Tec that is mediated by immunoreceptor activation and signaling via PI3K.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987950>AHNAK deficiency promotes  and lipolysis in mice via increased responsiveness to β-adrenergic signalling.</a></h2><p>In adipose tissue, agonists of the β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) regulate lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and thermogenesis. The deficiency in the thermogenesis induced by neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK in white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that AHNAK may stimulate energy expenditure via development of beige fat. Here, we report that AHNAK deficiency promoted  and thermogenic gene expression in WAT but not in brown adipose tissue of mice stimulated with the ADRB3 agonist CL-316243. Consistent with the increased thermogenesis, Ahnak(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in energy expenditure, accompanied by elevated mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT depots in response to CL-316243. Additionally, AHNAK-deficient WAT contained more eosinophils and higher levels of type 2 cytokines (IL-4/IL-13) to promote  of WAT in response to CL-316243. This was associated with enhanced sympathetic tone in the WAT via upregulation of adrb3 and  hydroxylase (TH) in response to β-adrenergic activation. CL-316243 activated PKA signalling and enhanced lipolysis, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and release of free glycerol in Ahnak(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice. Overall, these findings suggest an important role of AHNAK in the regulation of thermogenesis and lipolysis in WAT via β-adrenergic signalling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26333206>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of hydroxy substituted amino chalcone compounds for antityrosinase activity in B16 cells.</a></h2><p>A series of hydroxy substituted amino chalcone compounds have been synthesized. These compounds were then evaluated for their inhibitory activities on tyrosinase and melanogenesis in murine B16F10 melanoma cell lines. The structures of the compounds synthesized were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, FTIR and HRMS. Two novel amino chalcone compounds exhibited higher tyrosinase inhibitory activities (IC50 values of 9.75μM and 7.82μM respectively) than the control kojic acid (IC50: 22.83μM). Kinetic studies revealed them to act as competitive tyrosinase inhibitors with their Ki values of 4.82μM and 1.89μM respectively. Both the compounds inhibited melanin production and tyrosinase activity in B16 cells. Docking results confirm that the active inhibitors strongly interact with mushroom tyrosinase residues. This study suggests that the depigmenting effect of novel amino chalcone compounds might be attributable to inhibition of tyrosinase activity, suggesting amino chalcones to be a promising candidate for use as depigmentation agents or as anti- food additives.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These monophenols inhibit melanogenesis because they act as alternative substrates to  and L-Dopa in the monophenolase and diphenolase activities, respectively, despite the steric hindrance on the part of the substituent in ortho position with respect to the hydroxyl group. We kinetically characterize the action of tyrosinase on these substrates and assess its possible effect on  and melanognesis. In general, these compounds are poor substrates of the enzyme, with high Michaelis constant values, K(m), and low catalytic constant values, k(cat), so that the catalytic efficiency k(cat)/K(m) is low: thymol, 161 ± 4 M(-1) s(-1); carvacrol, 95 ± 7 M(-1) s(-1); guaiacol, 1160 ± 101 M(-1) s(-1).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21265541>Tetrahydrofolic Acid is a potent suicide substrate of mushroom tyrosinase.</a></h2><p>The coenzyme tetrahydrofolic acid is the most rapid suicide substrate of tyrosinase that has been characterized to date.

From these values, it is possible to establish the ratio λ(max)/K(m), which represents the potency of the inactivation process.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol affects NMDARs are not well understood. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of ethanol, phosphorylation of the NMDAR potentiates channel currents (Lu, W. Y., Xiong, Z. G., Lei, S., Orser, B. A., Dudek, E., , M. D., and MacDonald, J. F. (1999) Nat. Neurosci. 2, 331-338). We have previously shown that protein kinase C activators induce  phosphorylation and potentiation of the NMDAR (Grosshans, D. R., Clayton, D. R., Coultrap, S. J., and , M. D. (2002) Nat. Neurosci. 5, 27-33). We therefore hypothesized that the ethanol inhibition of NMDARs might be due to changes in  phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits. In support of this hypothesis, we found that  phosphorylation of both NR2A and NR2B subunits was significantly reduced following in situ exposure of hippocampal slices to 100 mm ethanol. Specifically, phosphorylation of  1472 on NR2B was reduced 23.5%. These data suggest a possible mechanism by which ethanol may inhibit the NMDAR via activation of a  phosphatase. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that ethanol inhibited NMDAR field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and amplitude to a similar degree as previously reported by our laboratory and others (Schummers, J., Bentz, S., and , M. D. (1997) Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 21, 404-408). Inclusion of bpV(phen), a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, in the recording chamber prior to and during ethanol exposure significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of ethanol on NMDAR field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of NMDAR subunits may play an important role in mediating the inhibitory effects of ethanol on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/706811>Studies on enzymic  of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum).

Stimulating beige adipocyte development, or WAT , increases energy expenditure and holds potential for combating metabolic disease and obesity. Here, we report that insulin and leptin act together on hypothalamic neurons to promote WAT  and weight loss. Deletion of the phosphatases PTP1B and TCPTP enhanced insulin and leptin signaling in proopiomelanocortin neurons and prevented diet-induced obesity by increasing WAT  and energy expenditure. The coinfusion of insulin plus leptin into the CNS or the activation of proopiomelanocortin neurons also increased WAT  and decreased adiposity. Our findings identify a homeostatic mechanism for coordinating the status of energy stores, as relayed by insulin and leptin, with the central control of WAT .Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aimed to anatomically and functionally characterize melanin-concentrating hormone innervation of the rat caudal brainstem, as this brain area plays an important role in the neural control of ingestive behavior and autonomic outflow. Using retrograde tracing we demonstrate that a significant proportion (5-15%) of primarily perifornical and far-lateral hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone neurons projects to the dorsal vagal complex. In the caudal brainstem, melanin-concentrating hormone-ir axon profiles are distributed densely in most areas including the nucleus of the solitary tract, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and sympathetic premotor areas in the ventral medulla. Close anatomical appositions can be demonstrated between melanin-concentrating hormone-ir axon profiles and  hydroxylase, GABA, GLP-1, NOS-expressing, and nucleus of the solitary tract neurons activated by gastric nutrient infusion. In medulla slice preparations, bath application of melanin-concentrating hormone inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by solitary tract stimulation via a pre-synaptic mechanism. Fourth ventricular administration of melanin-concentrating hormone (10 microg) in freely moving rats decreased core body temperature but did not change locomotor activity and food and water intake. We conclude that the rich hypothalamo-medullary melanin-concentrating hormone projections in the rat are mainly inhibitory to nucleus of the solitary tract neurons, but are not involved in the control of food intake. Projections to ventral medullary sites may play a role in the inhibitory effect of melanin-concentrating hormone on energy expenditure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9461515>Presence of dopa and amino acid hydroperoxides in proteins modified with advanced glycation end products (AGEs): amino acid oxidation products as a possible source of oxidative stress induced by AGE proteins.</a></h2><p>Glycation and subsequent Maillard or  reactions of glycated proteins, leading to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), are involved in the chemical modification of proteins during normal aging and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Oxidative conditions accelerate the  of proteins by glucose, and AGE proteins also induce oxidative stress responses in cells bearing AGE receptors. These observations have led to the hypothesis that glycation-induced pathology results from a cycle of oxidative stress, increased chemical modification of proteins via the Maillard reaction, and further AGE-dependent oxidative stress. Here we show that the preparation of AGE-collagen by incubation with glucose under oxidative conditions in vitro leads not only to glycation and formation of the glycoxidation product Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), but also to the formation of amino acid oxidation products on protein, including m-, dityrosine, dopa, and valine and leucine hydroperoxides. The formation of both CML and amino acid oxidation products was prevented by anaerobic, anti-oxidative conditions. Amino acid oxidation products were also formed when glycated collagen, prepared under anti-oxidative conditions, was allowed to incubate under aerobic conditions that led to the formation of CML. These experiments demonstrate that amino acid oxidation products are formed in proteins during glycoxidation reactions and suggest that reactive oxygen species formed by redox cycling of dopa or by the metal-catalysed decomposition of amino acid hydroperoxides, rather than by redox activity or reactive oxygen production by AGEs on protein, might contribute to the induction of oxidative stress by AGE proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28768176>A Hypothalamic Phosphatase Switch Coordinates Energy Expenditure with Feeding.</a></h2><p>Beige adipocytes can interconvert between white and brown-like states and switch between energy storage versus expenditure.

A fasting-induced and glucocorticoid-mediated induction of TCPTP, inhibited insulin signaling in AgRP/NPY neurons, repressed the  of white fat and decreased energy expenditure. Conversely feeding reduced hypothalamic TCPTP, to increase AgRP/NPY neuronal insulin signaling, white adipose tissue  and energy expenditure. The feeding-induced repression of hypothalamic TCPTP was defective in obesity. Mice lacking TCPTP in AgRP/NPY neurons were resistant to diet-induced obesity and had increased beige fat activity and energy expenditure. The deletion of hypothalamic TCPTP in obesity restored feeding-induced  and increased energy expenditure to promote weight loss.

The effects of signalling agonists were assessed by measuring the diameters of visible rings formed by the outward migration of amoebae up radial gradients of chemoattractant. This rapid and simple bioassay method yields chemotactic rates equivalent to more complex assay systems. In support of previous studies, chemotaxis toward both cAMP and folic acid was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by LaCl3, EDTA, chlorotetracycline and A1F3, supporting the importance of calcium ions and G protein-mediated signalling in both chemotactic events. The work was extended by examining the effects of the protein  kinase inhibitor genistein. This agent inhibited chemotaxis to folate in a dose-dependent manner but had no observable effect on chemotaxis toward cAMP. The notion that phosphorylation of proteins on  residues is critical for chemotaxis to folic acid was supported by Western blotting experiments with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies which detected two candidate proteins of M(r) 52,000 and 38,000 in the membranes of folate-responsive amoebae. These two bands disappeared with starvation which leads to the loss of responsiveness of folic acid and the acquisition of responsiveness to cAMP. Time-lapse videomicrography also revealed some unique differences in chemotactic response. Starved cells responded to cAMP as individuals but feeding cells chemoattracted to folic acid on a populational basis. The ability to compare two different types of chemotaxis using a simple, rapid and accurate bioassay system should enhance future studies of chemotaxis in wild-type and mutant strains of D. discoideum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20831600>Correlated changes in NMDA receptor phosphorylation, functional activity, and sedation by chronic ethanol consumption.</a></h2><p>Alcohol abuse leads to tolerance, dependence, and memory impairments that involve excitatory glutamatergic NMDA synaptic transmission. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is known to undergo activity-dependent adaptive functional changes. Since we observed that acute ethanol inhibition of the NMDAR was regulated by protein  phosphorylation, we investigated the role of protein  kinases and phosphatases on the NMDAR functions by chronic ethanol treatment. We carried out whole-cell recording, western blotting, and behavioral righting reflex measurements to assess the impact of chronic ethanol treatment on NMDAR function. Our results indicated that these receptors became resistant to the acute ethanol inhibition following chronic ethanol consumption. This resistance occurred without an increase in the NMDAR subunit expression but was associated with decreases in the levels of phospho-Y-1472 NR2B, increases in the levels of STEP33, increases in phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (pp38 MAPK), and acquisition of tolerance to the sedative effects of ethanol. These data suggested that altered protein  phosphorylation of the NMDAR subunits significantly contributes to functional changes of this receptor by chronic ethanol ingestion. Therefore, preservation of the integrity of  phosphorylation mechanisms of the NMDAR may be important in controlling the progression of alcohol tolerance and dependence.Journal of Neurochemistry © 2010 International Society for Neurochemistry.

The aim of the present work is to provide a systematic investigation of the OXT-immunoreactive innervation of dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons involved in the control of gastrointestinal (GI) function.We studied DMV neurons identified by (i) prior injection of retrograde tracers in the stomach, ileum, or cervical vagus or (ii) induction of c-fos expression by glucoprivation with 2-deoxyglucose. Another subgroup of DMV neurons was identified electrophysiologically by stimulation of the cervical vagus and then juxtacellularly labeled with biotinamide. We used two- or three-color immunoperoxidase labeling for studies at the light microscopic level.Close appositions from OXT-immunoreactive varicosities were found on the cell bodies, dendrites, and axons of DMV neurons that projected to the GI tract and that responded to 2-deoxyglucose and juxtacellularly labeled DMV neurons. Double staining for OXT and choline acetyltransferase revealed that OXT innervation was heavier in the caudal and lateral DMV than in other regions.

Subsequent to grafting, rats were subjected to 3 additional AGS tests. 53% (10/19) of 6-OHDA treated GEPRs showed a significant reduction in seizure severity following transplantation of fetal LC tissue. In contrast, only 20% (1/5) of GEPRs infused with saline rather than 6-OHDA showed a reduction of seizure severity following fetal LC transplantation. NE content in the cortex and pons/medulla was decreased by 78% and 46% respectively following 6-OHDA microinfusion into the LC. Prominent grafts with numerous TH positive neurons and neurites were present within the third ventricle of grafted animals, while cortex grafts contained no TH immunostained structures. These findings suggest that the efficacy of fetal LC tissue to promote reductions in seizure severity in GEPRs is increased following depletion of central NE by microinfusion of 6-OHDA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552523>Dose rate effect of gamma irradiation on phenolic compounds, polyphenol oxidase, and  of mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus).</a></h2><p>To enhance the shelf life of edible mature mushrooms, Agaricus bisporus, 2 kGy ionizing treatments were applied at two different dose rates: 4.5 kGy/h (I(-)) and 32 kGy/h (I(+)). Both I(+) and I(-) showed a 2 and 4 day shelf-life enhancement compared to the control (C). Before day 9, no significant difference (p>0.05) in L value was detected in irradiated mushrooms. However, after day 9, the highest observed L value (whiteness) was obtained for the mushrooms irradiated in I(-). Analyses of phenolic compounds revealed that mushrooms in I(-) contained more phenols than I(+) and C, the latter containing the lower level of phenols. The fluctuation of the precursors of glutaminyl-4-hydroxyaniline (GHB) was less in I(-) than in I(+). The polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities of irradiated mushrooms, analyzed via catechol oxidase, dopa oxidase, and  hydroxylase substrates, were found to be significantly lowered (p = 0.05) compared to C, with a further decrease in I(+). Analyses of the enzymes indicated that PPO activity was lower in I(+), contrasting with its lower phenols concentration. The observation of mushrooms' cellular membranes, by electronic microscopy, revealed a better preserved integrity in I(-) than in I(+). It is thus assumed that the  effect observed in I(+) was caused by both the decompartmentation of vacuolar phenol and the entry of molecular oxygen into the cell cytoplasm. The synergetic effect of the residual active PPO and the molecular oxygen, in contact with the phenols, allowed an increased oxidation rate and, therefore, a more pronounced  I(+) than in I(-).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26450473>Kinetic characterization of oxyresveratrol as a tyrosinase substrate.</a></h2><p>Oxyresveratrol is a stilbenoid described as a powerful inhibitor of tyrosinase and proposed as skin-whitening and anti- agent. However, the enzyme is capable of acting on it, considering it as a substrate, as it has been proved in the case of its analogous resveratrol. Tyrosinase hydroxylates the oxyresveratrol to an o-diphenol and oxidizes the latter to an o-quinone, which finally isomerizes to p-quinone. For these reactions to take place the presence of the Eox (oxy-tyrosinase) form is necessary. The kinetic analysis of the proposed mechanism has allowed the kinetic characterization of this molecule as a substrate of tyrosinase, affording a catalytic constant of 5.39 ± 0.21 sec(-1) and a Michaelis constant of 8.65 ± 0.73 µM.© 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21863871>Inhibitory effect of mimosine on polyphenoloxidase from cephalothoraxes of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).</a></h2><p>The inhibitory effect of mimosine on polyphenoloxidase (PPO) from the cephalothorax of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was studied.

In total, 34 phenolic compounds were detected. Only small differences in the total phenolic content between bruising-tolerant and -sensitive strains were observed. The contents of γ-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene (GHB) and γ-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene (GDHB) correlated with bruising sensitivity; for example, R(2) values of 0.85 and 0.98 were found for nonbruised brown strains, respectively. In nonbruised skin tissue of the strains with brown caps, the GHB and GDHB contents in sensitive strains were on average 20 and 15 times higher, respectively, than in tolerant strains.

Fluorescence intensities reported in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU) were correlated with standard five day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD(5)) values which were used as an indicator of the amount of biodegradable organic material present. Tryptophan-like fluorescence, which has been found to relate to the activity of the biological community, showed the strongest correlation with BOD(5). Fluorescence analysis of the tryptophan-like peak (excitation/emission wavelength region 275/340 nm) is found to provide an accurate indication of the presence, and relative proportions of bioavailable organic material present (natural or anthropogenic). It therefore provides an insight relating to its oxygen depleting potential. Thus fluorescence spectroscopy is recommended as a portable or laboratory tool for the determination of the presence of biodegradable organic matter with intrinsic oxidising potential in natural waters. The novel application of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to the data illustrates that strong local relationships exist between the two parameters and that site specific character may be a strong factor in the strength of the tryptophan-like fluorescence/BOD(5) relationship.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17098249>The proximate control of pupal color in swallowtail butterflies: implications for the evolution of environmentally cued pupal color in butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae).</a></h2><p>The environmentally cued production of cryptic green/yellow or brown/melanized pupae is widespread in butterflies, occurring in the Nymphalidae, Pieridae, and the Papilionidae subfamily Papilioninae. The dimorphism is controlled by the hormone pupal melanization reducing factor (PMRF). In the nymphalid Inachis io dibutryl cAMP mimics PMRF, and inhibits pupal melanization. However, in the papilionid Papilio polyxenes PMRF stimulates , suggesting that the control of pupal color by PMRF has evolved independently in the swallowtail and nymphalid-pierid lineages. We examined this hypothesis by using ligatures to prevent hormone release in five species representing three Papilioninae tribes. One species, Papilio glaucus, produces only brown pupae. Ligatures resulted in green cuticle posterior to the ligature in all five swallowtail species, including P. glaucus, suggesting that the mode of action of PMRF is the same in the three tribes. We also found that in P. polyxenes injections of dibutryl cAMP into prepupal larvae mimic the effect of PMRF, by causing dose-dependent pupal . Our results support the hypothesis that the control of pupal color by PMRF has evolved independently in the two lineages. The observation that green pupal color can be induced in P. glaucus by ligature indicates that environmentally cued pupal color could evolve by facultative inhibition of PMRF release.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535678>Effects of argon enriched low-oxygen atmospheres and of high-oxygen atmospheres on the kinetics of polyphenoloxidase (PPO).</a></h2><p>The reported benefits of enrichment of air atmospheres with argon or oxygen for control of enzymatic  were investigated by determining the effects of these atmospheres on PPO kinetics. Kinetics of purified apple PPO and a commercially available mushroom PPO were studied in an in vitro model system. Enrichment with argon produced greater inhibitory effects than the current industry practice of enrichment with nitrogen. Km(app) values (mM) for apple PPO in 3%O(2)/97%Ar, 3%O(2)/97%N(2), and air, were 133, 87, and 48, respectively. The data indicate that inhibition by both gases is competitive, and also support the hypothesis that the greater inhibitory effect of argon was proportional to the size of the Van der Waals radius of argon against nitrogen (1.91 Å against 1.54 Å). Much smaller inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of 80% O(2) (Km(app) 57 mM), and the nature of this inhibition was less clear. The results suggest that the benefits of argon enrichment may be relatively small, and may require critical enzyme, substrate, and gas levels to be successful. However, these benefits may be exploitable commercially in some fresh-cut products, and may allow less anoxic atmospheres to be used.

In particular, this deficiency includes reduced numbers of norepinephrine (NE) synaptic terminals in several brain areas and distinctly fewer NE axons within the auditory tectum. Two strains of GEPRs have been developed: GEPR-3s that have moderately severe clonic seizures and GEPR-9s that have severe tonic seizures culminating in complete hindlimb extension. Seizures in animals of each substrain are preceded by a brief episode of wild running. The developmental profile of NE axonal growth in GEPRs compared to control rats is not known, but may be causally related to NE deficiencies in this seizure model. The present study compared developmental neurite extension of fetal NE neurons in vitro between GEPR-3s and Sprague-Dawley control rats, the strain from which GEPR-3s were originally derived. Neurite arborization of individual NE neurons was assessed by quantitative morphometry following immunocytochemical identification of  hydroxylase (TH). Preliminary studies using explant and dispersed-cell cultures of control-rat tissues showed that optimal culture parameters to support neuritogenesis of LC neurons included the use of dispersed-cell cultures, Pronectin-F substrate, day-14 gestation donor-tissue, no use of cytosine-arabinofuranoside (ARA-c, a glial mitotic inhibitor) and the presence of co-cultured tectal tissue. Compared to fetal control-rat NE neurons co-cultured with fetal control-rat tectum, NE neurons derived from fetal GEPR-3 LC in co-culture with GEPR-3 tectum exhibited only 30% of the neurite extension of control-rat LC neurons and GEPR-3 LC neurons had a similarly deficient amount of branching. This study suggests, but does not prove, that deficiency in tectal NE in GEPR-3s involves a developmental deficiency in neurite extension from GEPR-3 LC neurons. Hypothetically, this deficiency may also contribute to the well described NE deficiency in other regions of the adult GEPR brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9639252>Penetration of dynorphin 1-13 across the blood-brain barrier.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated neuroprotective effects of the opioid peptide dynorphin (dyn) 1-13 in focal cerebral ischemia.

In the rat, dyn 1-13 penetration of the BBB could not be detected by this technique, even in the presence of peptidase inhibitors.

The passage of dyn 1-13 across the BBB was greater in cats with experimentally induced focal cerebral ischemia. Some of the tritium-labeled material which crossed the BBB was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography to be dyn 1-13.

Electrophysiological recordings showed that co-application of ethanol with submaximal kainate concentrations resulted in similar inhibition of kainate-gated currents in both expression systems. Manipulation of intracellular phosphorylation pathways by intracellular dialysis with a solution without ATP and GTP did not modify the inhibitory effects of ethanol. Moreover, co-transfection of GluR6 receptor subunits with PKA-alpha catalytic subunit or the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) catalytic fragment did not change the sensitivity of the receptor to ethanol. Treatment of Xenopus oocytes with specific inhibitors of PKC, PKA, CamKII,  kinases, and serine-threonine protein phosphatases did not affect the 100 mM ethanol-induced inhibition of GluR6 receptor-mediated currents. Biochemical experiments with transiently transfected HEK 293 cells confirmed published reports that GluR6 receptors are minimally phosphorylated under basal conditions in these cells and also revealed that acute ethanol did not increase GluR6 phosphorylation.

Five active fragments have been analyzed in detail. The smallest is an 18-kDa fragment derived from the amino-terminal half of lipocortin. Three of the larger fragments contain this region. The fifth fragment is missing 83 amino acids from the amino terminus. A region common to all the active fragments (amino acid residues 97-178) is 70% homologous with the corresponding region from a second member of the lipocortin family which recently was cloned (Huang, K-S., Wallner, B.P., Mattaliano, R.J., Tizard, R., Burne, C., Frey, A., Hession, C., McGray, P., Sinclair, L.K., Chow, E.P., , J.L., Ramachandran, K.L., Tang, J., Smart, J.E., and Pepinsky, R.B.

Electrophysiological experiments have demonstrated that three distinct classes of protein kinases, i.e., cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and CaM kinase II, modulate physiological processes in neurons. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and kinase C have been shown to modify potassium and calcium channels, and CaM kinase II has been shown to enhance neurotransmitter release. A large number of substrates for these protein kinases have been found in neurons. In some cases (e.g.,  hydroxylase, acetylcholine receptor, sodium channel) these proteins have a known function, whereas most of these proteins (e.g., synapsin I) had no known function when they were first identified as phosphoproteins. In the case of synapsin I, evidence now suggests that it regulates neurotransmitter release. These studies of synapsin I suggest that the characterization of previously unknown neuronal phosphoproteins will lead to the elucidation of previously unknown regulatory processes in neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4990583>The purification and properties of a ribonucleoenzyme, o-diphenol oxidase, from potatoes.</a></h2><p>1. o-Diphenol oxidase was isolated from potato tubers by a new approach that avoids the  due to autoxidation. 2. There are at least three forms of the enzyme, of different molecular weights. The major form, of highest molecular weight, was separated from the others in good yield and with high specific activity by gel filtration through Bio-Gel P-300. 3. The major form is homogeneous by disc electrophoresis but regenerates small amounts of the species of lower molecular weight, as shown by rechromatography on Bio-Gel P-300. 4. There is an equal amount of RNA and protein by weight in the fully active enzyme. The RNA cannot be removed without loss of activity, and is not attacked by ribonuclease. 5. The pH optimum of the enzyme is at pH5.0 when assayed with 4-methylcatechol as substrate. It is ten times more active with this substrate than with chlorogenic acid or catechol. The enzyme is fully active in 4m-urea. 6. A minimal molecular weight of 36000 is indicated by copper content and amino acid analysis of the protein component of the enzyme. 7. The protein contains five half-cystinyl residues per 36000 daltons, a value similar to that found in o-diphenol oxidase from mushrooms. It also contains  residues although, when pure, it does not turn brown by autoxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27990249>Sex differences in sympathetic innervation and  of white adipose tissue of mice.</a></h2><p>The higher prevalence of obesity-related metabolic disease in males suggests that female sex hormones provide protective mechanisms against the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Because  of white adipose tissue (WAT) is protective against obesity-related metabolic disease, we examined sex differences in β3-adrenergic remodeling of WAT in mice.Effects of the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 (CL) on  of white adipose tissue were investigated in male and female C57BL mice. The role of ovarian hormones in female-specific  was studied in control female C57BL mice and mice with ovarian failure induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide treatment for 15 days.We found that treatment with CL-induced upregulation of brown adipocyte markers and mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins in gonadal WAT (gWAT) of female mice, but was without effect in males. In contrast, CL treatment was equally effective in males and females in inducing brown adipocyte phenotypes in inguinal WAT. The tissue- and sex-specific differences in brown adipocyte recruitment were correlated with differences in sympathetic innervation, as determined by  hydroxylase immunostaining and western blotting. Levels of the neurotrophins NGF and BDNF were significantly higher in gWAT of female mice. CL treatment significantly increased NGF levels in gWAT of female mice but did not affect BDNF expression. In contrast, estradiol treatment doubled BDNF expression in female adipocytes differentiated in vitro. Ovarian failure induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide treatment dramatically reduced BDNF and TH expression in gWAT, eliminated induction of UCP1 by CL, and reduced tissue metabolic rate.Collectively, these data demonstrate that female mice are more responsive than males to the recruitment of brown adipocytes in gonadal WAT and this difference corresponds to greater levels of estrogen-dependent sympathetic innervation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24444880>Evaluation of crocin and curcumin affinity on mushroom tyrosinase using surface plasmon resonance.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinase inhibitors have potential applications in the cosmetics and food industries for preventing  reactions and also as therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. In this article, crocin and curcumin were evaluated as mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors. Results showed that, both compounds strongly inhibited the diphenolase activity than monophenolase. The IC50 values for diphenolase activity were estimated to be 0.11 mM and 0.18 mM for crocin and curcumin respectively. The binding kinetics of crocin and curcumin was studied with mushroom tyrosinase using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Tyrosinase was immobilized on the gold surface of a Biacore sensor chip through amine coupling. Binding of inhibitors was analyzed by SPR without the need to further modify the surface or the use of other reagents. The binding constant KD (M) for mushroom tyrosinase obtained was 1.21×10(-4) M for crocin and 1.64×10(-4) M for curcumin, while showing a higher affinity for L-DOPA 1.95×10(-8) M, a substrate for tyrosinase (positive control). The study reveals the SPR sensor's ability to detect binding of the inhibitors.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Phosphorylation of  residues, especially NR2B  1472, appears to be a mechanism by which NMDAR endocytosis is prevented, suggesting that the  phosphorylation and surface expression of NMDARs are positively correlated. Previous work from our laboratory and others has confirmed that modulation of  phosphatase and kinase activity alters the surface expression of NMDARs. However, the changes in NMDAR surface expression described in those studies were in terms of total surface membrane versus intracellular receptors. Within the plasma membrane of glutamatergic synapses, distinct populations of NMDARs exist. Namely, receptors at the surface can be differentiated into synaptic and extrasynaptic pools based on their association with the post-synaptic density (PSD) and availability to glutamate. In the present study, we utilized a subcellular fractionation approach coupled with detergent extraction to prepare synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs from adult rat hippocampal slices. Using this method, we examined how  phosphatase and Src-family  kinase (SFK) inhibitors modulate the phosphorylation and localization of these different pools of NMDARs. We found that both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs were modulated by  phosphatase and SFK inhibitors; however subunit- and residue-specific effects were observed. Specifically, phosphorylation of NR2B  1472 was associated with enrichment of synaptic NMDARs, whereas phosphorylation of NR2B  1336 was associated with enrichment of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Using electrophysiological methods, we also reveal that the biochemical modifications produced by these inhibitors were associated with corresponding changes in NMDAR function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21347448>Polymorphisms in the receptor  kinase MERTK gene are associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating, chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system affecting over 2 million people worldwide. The TAM family of receptor  kinases (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) have been implicated as important players during demyelination in both animal models of MS and in the human disease. We therefore conducted an association study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes encoding the TAM receptors and their ligands associated with MS. Analysis of genotype data from a genome-wide association study which consisted of 1618 MS cases and 3413 healthy controls conducted by the Australia and New Zealand Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (ANZgene) revealed several SNPs within the MERTK gene (Chromosome 2q14.1, Accession Number NG_011607.1) that showed suggestive association with MS. We therefore interrogated 28 SNPs in MERTK in an independent replication cohort of 1140 MS cases and 1140 healthy controls. We found 12 SNPs that replicated, with 7 SNPs showing p-values of less than 10(-5) when the discovery and replication cohorts were combined. All 12 replicated SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. In combination, these data suggest the MERTK gene is a novel risk gene for MS susceptibility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11141266>Biochemical and microbial changes during the storage of minimally processed cantaloupe.</a></h2><p>The effect of storage time on pH, titratable acidity, degrees Brix, organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and color of minimally processed cantaloupe melon (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus Naud. cv. Mission) was determined at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Changes in most of the biochemical parameters with storage time were relatively slow at the lower temperature. At 20 degrees C, a 17% loss in soluble solids and a 2-fold increase in acidity occurred after 2 days. Organic acid content also increased considerably with time at this temperature as a result of the production of lactic acid. Oxalic, citric, malic, and succinic acids were the organic acids, and glucose, fructose, and sucrose were the sugars present in the freshly cut cantaloupe. Malic acid concentration decreased concurrently with lactic acid production indicating the possible involvement of anaerobic malo-lactic fermentation along with sugar utilization by lactic acid bacteria. The effect of storage on microbial growth was determined at 4, 10, and 20 degrees C. Gram-negative stained rods grew at a slower rate at 4 degrees C and 10 degrees C than the Gram-positive mesophilic bacteria that dominated microorganism growth at 20 degrees C. Eighteen amino acids were identified in fresh cantaloupe: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, serine, glutamine, glycine, histidine, arginine, threonine, alanine, proline, , valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, phenyl alanine, and lysine. The dominant amino acids were aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, and alanine. Total amino acid content decreased rapidly at 20 degrees C, but only a slight decrease occurred at 4 degrees C after prolonged storage. Changes in lightness (L), chroma, and hue at both temperatures indicate the absence of  reactions. The results indicate the potential use of lactic acid and lactic acid bacteria as quality control markers in minimally processed fruits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3532121>"Replacement" of COOH-terminal truncation of v-fms with c-fms sequences markedly reduces transformation potential.</a></h2><p>Protooncogenes when transduced by retroviruses may undergo structural modifications that render their gene products oncogenic. The c-fms gene encodes a transmembrane protein with  kinase activity that is very similar or identical to the receptor for the monocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Its transforming homologue (v-fms) in the Susan McDonough strain feline sarcoma virus causes fibrosarcomas in cats. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA that encodes the cytoplasmic domain of the human c-fms gene shows that the product of the transduced viral homologue, v-fms, is truncated at the COOH-terminal end. The COOH-terminal 40 amino acids of the c-fms gene product are replaced in the v-fms gene product by 11 amino acids encoded by the retroviral genome. Hybrid v-fms/c-fms genes, in which either the entire cytoplasmic domain or the COOH-terminal coding sequences of the v-fms gene were replaced by the corresponding segments of the c-fms gene, had a reduced ability to transform fibroblasts despite a high level of encoded protein on the cell surface. These data indicate that the COOH-terminal modifications contribute to the transforming potential of the v-fms viral oncogene product.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12028580>Molecular anatomy of tyrosinase and its related proteins: beyond the histidine-bound metal catalytic center.</a></h2><p>The structure of tyrosinase (Tyr) is reviewed from a double point of view. On the one hand, by comparison of all Tyr found throughout nature, from prokaryotic organisms to mammals and on the other, by comparison with the tyrosinase related proteins (Tyrps) that appeared late in evolution, and are only found in higher animals. Their structures are reviewed as a whole rather than focused on the histidine (His)-bound metal active site, which is the part of the molecule common to all these proteins. The availability of crystallographic data of hemocyanins and recently of sweet potato catechol oxidase has improved the model of the three-dimensional structure of the Tyr family. Accordingly, Tyr has a higher structural disorder than hemocyanins, particularly at the CuA site. The active site seems to be characterized by the formation of a hydrophobic pocket with a number of conserved aromatic residues sited close to the well-known His. Other regions specific of the mammalian enzymes, such as the cytosolic C-terminal tail, the cysteine clusters, and the N-glycosylation sequons, are also discussed. The complete understanding of the Tyr copper-binding domain and the characterization of the residues determinant of the relative substrate affinities of the Tyrps will improve the design of targeted mutagenesis experiments to understand the different catalytic capabilities of Tyr and Tyrps. This may assist future aims, from the design of more efficient bacterial Tyr for biotechnological applications to the design of inhibitors of undesirable fruit  in vegetables or of color skin modulators in animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2447483> phosphorylations in vivo associated with v-fms transformation.</a></h2><p>The role of -specific phosphorylation in v-fms-mediated transformation was examined by immunoblotting techniques together with a high-affinity antibody that is specific for phosphotyrosine. This antiphosphotyrosine antibody detected phosphorylated  residues on the gp140v-fms molecule, but not gP180v-fms or gp120v-fms, in v-fms-transformed cells. This antibody also identified a number of cellular proteins that were either newly phosphorylated on  residues or showed enhanced phosphorylation on  residues as a result of v-fms transformation. However, the substrates of the v-fms-induced  kinase activity were not the characterized pp60v-src substrates. The phosphorylation of some of these cellular proteins and of the gp140fms molecule was found to correlate with the ability of v-fms/c-fms hybrids to transform cells. In addition, immunoblotting with the phosphotyrosine antibody allowed a comparison to be made of the substrates phosphorylated on  residues in various transformed cell lines. This study indicates that the pattern of  phosphorylation in v-fms-transformed cells is strikingly similar to that in v-sis-transformed cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10398045>Regional differences in the sympathetic innervation of the guinea pig large intestine by neuropeptide Y- and  hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerves of divergent extrinsic origin.</a></h2><p>Region-specific patterns of nerves with immunoreactivity to neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been described previously in the submucous plexus of guinea pig large intestine. Because these may have functional significance, the possibility of similar, characteristic variations of NPY-like immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) in the myenteric plexus was explored. Regional differences were found in the occurrence and pattern of distribution of NPY-ir in the myenteric plexus of the guinea pig large intestine. NPY-ir was present rarely within neuron somata in any region of the large intestine, and NPY-ir nerve fibers were present only within the distal large intestine, increasing progressively in density from the distal spiral to the rectum. Lesion of the colonic nerves, but not the hypogastric, intermesenteric, or lumbar splanchnic nerves, resulted in a loss of NPY-ir in the distal spiral and transverse colon but not in the descending colon or rectum. Ring myotomies in the descending colon resulted in a loss of NPY-ir proximal to the lesion. Dual-labeling immunohistochemical studies revealed that the NPY-ir nerve fibers rarely contained immunoreactivity for  hydroxylase (TH). Extrinsic nerve lesions resulted in an unequivocal reduction in NPY-ir in intraganglionic fibers of the submucosal plexuses of the transverse colon and a partial loss in the distal spiral and descending colon: the rectum was unaffected; in only a minority of guinea pigs, however, was any decrease in the NPY-ir innervation of submucosal blood vessels detected. The principal projections of NPY-ir nerves were from and through the inferior mesenteric ganglion; however, NPY-ir was not colocalized with TH-ir. It is proposed that nonnoradrenergic, NPY-containing neurons located in the inferior mesenteric ganglion project through the colonic nerves and that these proximally directed fibers innervate the transverse colon and the distal spiral. Nonnoradrenergic, NPY-ir neurons lying in the pelvic ganglia or sacral sympathetic chain may make an important contribution to the innervation of the myenteric plexus of the rectum and the descending colon.Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4151549>The spontaneous firing pattern of forebrain neurons.

In this study we provide conclusive evidence of the inhibition mechanism of two well studied tyrosinase inhibitors, KA (kojic acid) and HQ (hydroquinone), which are extensively used in hyperpigmentation treatment. KA is reported in the literature with contradicting inhibition mechanisms, while HQ is described as both a tyrosinase inhibitor and a substrate. By visualization of KA and HQ in the active site of TyrBm crystals, together with molecular modeling, binding constant analysis and kinetic experiments, we have elucidated their mechanisms of inhibition, which was ambiguous for both inhibitors.

The action of tyrosinase on caffeic acid and its n-nonyl ester (n-nonyl caffeate) was characterized kinetically in this work. The results lead us to propose that both compounds are suicide substrates of tyrosinase, for which we establish the catalytic and inactivation efficiencies. The ester is more potent as inactivator than the caffeic acid and the number of turnovers made by one molecule of the enzyme before its inactivation (r) is lower for the ester.

Viral protein 2 (VP2) of chicken anemia virus (CAV) and ORF2 of TT virus have been shown to possess DSP activity in vitro. CAV VP2 is unusual in possessing two vicinal cysteines within the protein phosphatase signature motif. The first cysteine residue (C95) within the motif has been identified by mutagenesis as the essential catalytic cysteine. In this study, it was shown that virus mutated at this residue displayed a marked inhibition of growth, with titres reduced 10(4)-fold, and reduced cytopathogenic effect in cell culture, indicating that viral DSP activity may be significant during infection. As with virus mutated at the first cysteine residue, mutation of the second cysteine (C97) within the motif resulted in a marked reduction in viral growth and attenuation of cytopathogenicity in infected cell cultures. However, mutagenesis of this second cysteine only reduced phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity to 70 % of that of wild-type VP2, but increased phosphoserine/phosphothreonine phosphatase activity by as much as 700 %. The differential effect of the C97S mutation on VP2 activity does not appear to have parallels in other DSPs and suggests a unique role for the second cysteine in the function of these viral proteins, particularly in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11158244>Protein kinase C activation induces  phosphorylation of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor.</a></h2><p>The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is an ionotropic glutamate receptor, which plays crucial roles in synaptic plasticity and development. We have recently shown that potentiation of NMDA receptor function by protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be mediated via activation of non-receptor  kinases. The aim of this study was to test whether this effect could be mediated by direct  phosphorylation of the NR2A or NR2B subunits of the receptor. Following treatment of rat hippocampal CA1 mini-slices with 500 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 15 min, samples were homogenized, immunoprecipitated with anti-NR2A or NR2B antibodies and the resulting pellets subjected to Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. An increase in  phosphorylation of both NR2A (76 +/- 11% above control) and NR2B (41 +/- 11%) was observed. This increase was blocked by pretreatment with the selective PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, with the  kinase inhibitor Lavendustin A or with the Src family  kinase inhibitor PP2. PMA treatment also produced an increase in the phosphorylation of serine 890 on the NR1 subunit, a known PKC site, at 5 min with phosphorylation returning to near basal levels by 10 min while  phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B was sustained for up to 15 min. These results suggest that the modulation of NMDA receptor function seen with PKC activation may be the result of  phosphorylation of NR2A and/or NR2B.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3988905>A new biotype of Legionella dumoffii.</a></h2><p>A new biotype of L. dumoffii was isolated from lung and sputum samples of an immunosuppressed patient with pneumonia.

This study was aimed at identifying the signalling pathways involved in the activation of volume-regulatory mechanisms of human cervical cancer cells. 2. Osmotic swelling of human cervical cancer cells induced a substantial increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by the activation of Ca2+ entry across the cell membrane, as well as Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This Ca2+ signalling was critical for the normal regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response. 3. The activation of swelling-activated ion and taurine transport was significantly inhibited by  kinase inhibitors (genistein and tyrphostin AG 1478) and potentiated by the  phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4. However, the Src family of  kinases was not involved in regulation of the swelling-activated Cl- channel. 4. Cell swelling triggered mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) and p38 kinase. The volume-responsive ERK1/ERK2 signalling pathway linked with the activation of K+ and Cl- channels, and taurine transport. However, the volume-regulatory mechanism was independent of the activation of p38 MAP kinase. 5. The phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 expression following a hypotonic shock was up-regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and down-regulated by PKC inhibitor staurosporine. The response of ERK activation to hypotonicity also required Ca2+ entry and depended on  kinase and mitogen-activated/ERK-activating kinase (MEK) activity. 6.

In addition, lenalidomide enhanced upregulation of functional IL21 receptor (IL21R) on the cell surface and increased receptor mRNA in vitro The in vitro combination of IL21 and lenalidomide enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity toward CLL cells through a variety of mechanisms. We show association of cell death with upregulation of Bid by IL21, enhanced upregulation of Bid by the combination therapy, and diminished Lck and downstream BCR signaling activation of Syk and PLCG2.

Inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and mechanism of action.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinase is responsible for the molting process in insects, undesirable  of fruits and vegetables, and coloring of skin, hair, and eyes in animals. To clarify the mechanism of the depigmenting property of hydroxystilbene compounds, inhibitory actions of oxyresveratrol and its analogs on tyrosinases from mushroom and murine melanoma B-16 have been elucidated in this study. Oxyresveratrol showed potent inhibitory effect with an IC(50) value of 1.2 microm on mushroom tyrosinase activity, which was 32-fold stronger inhibition than kojic acid, a depigmenting agent used as the cosmetic material with skin-whitening effect and the medical agent for hyperpigmentation disorders. Hydroxystilbene compounds of resveratrol, 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene, and rhapontigenin also showed more than 50% inhibition at 100 microm on mushroom tyrosinase activity, but other methylated or glycosylated hydroxystilbenes of 3,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene, trimethylresveratrol, piceid, and rhaponticin did not inhibit significantly. None of the hydroxystilbene compounds except oxyresveratrol exhibited more than 50% inhibition at 100 microm on  oxidation by murine tyrosinase activity; oxyresveratrol showed an IC(50) value of 52.7 microm on the enzyme activity. The kinetics and mechanism for inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase exhibited the reversibility of oxyresveratrol as a noncompetitive inhibitor with  as the substrate. The interaction between oxyresveratrol and tyrosinase exhibited a high affinity reflected in a K(i) value of 3.2-4.2 x 10(-7) m. Oxyresveratrol did not affect the promoter activity of the tyrosinase gene in murine melanoma B-16 at 10 and 100 microm. Therefore, the depigmenting effect of oxyresveratrol works through reversible inhibition of tyrosinase activity rather than suppression of the expression and synthesis of the enzyme. The number and position of hydroxy substituents seem to play an important role in the inhibitory effects of hydroxystilbene compounds on tyrosinase activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151384>Chicken anemia virus VP2 is a novel dual specificity protein phosphatase.</a></h2><p>The function of viral protein 2 (VP2) of the immunosuppressive circovirus chicken anemia virus (CAV) has not yet been established. We show that the CAV VP2 amino acid sequence has some similarity to a number of eukaryotic, receptor, protein- phosphatase (PTPase) alpha proteins as well as to a cluster of human TT viruses within the Sanban group. To investigate if CAV VP2 functions as a PTPase, purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-VP2 fusion protein was assayed for PTPase activity using the generalized peptide substrates ENDpYINASL and DADEpYLIPQQG (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. CAV GST-VP2 was shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of both substrates. CAV GST-VP2 PTPase activity for the ENDpYINASL substrate had a V(max) of 14,925 units/mg.min and a K(m) of 18.88 microm. Optimal activity was observed between pH 6 and 7, and activity was specifically inhibited by 0.01 mm orthovanadate. We also show that the ORF2 sequence of the CAV-related human virus TT-like minivirus (TLMV) possessed PTPase activity and steady state kinetics equivalent to CAV GST-VP2 when expressed as a GST fusion protein. To establish whether these viral proteins were dual specificity protein phosphatases, the CAV GST-VP2 and TLMV GST-ORF2 fusion proteins were also assayed for serine/threonine phosphatase (S/T PPase) activity using the generalized peptide substrate RRApTVA, with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. Both CAV GST-VP2 and TLMV GST-ORF2 fusion proteins possessed S/T PPase activity, which was specifically inhibited by 50 mm sodium fluoride. CAV GST-VP2 exhibited S/T PPase activity with a V(max) of 28,600 units/mg.min and a K(m) of 76 microm. Mutagenesis of residue Cys(95) to serine in CAV GST-VP2 abrogated both PTPase and S/T PPase activity, identifying it as the catalytic cysteine within the proposed signature motif. These studies thus show that the circoviruses CAV and TLMV encode dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSP) with an unusual signature motif that may play a role in intracellular signaling during viral replication. This is the first DSP gene to be identified in a small viral genome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27560796>Continuous cold exposure induces an anti-inflammatory response in mesenteric adipose tissue associated with catecholamine production and thermogenin expression in rats.</a></h2><p>Continuous exposure to cold leads to an activation of adaptive thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue and induction of brown/beige cell phenotype in the white adipose tissue.

Catecholamines production and gene expressions of inflammatory and other factors, related to adipocyte "", were analyzed in the homogenized mWAT samples using 2-CAT ELISA kits.Cold exposure induced a sympathetic response in the mWAT, evidenced by the  hydroxylase (TH) protein level rise. Induction of non-sympathetical catecholamine production was observed 7 days after cold exposure by elevated TH and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) expression, leading to an increased epinephrine levels. Cold exposure for 7 days stimulated the infiltration of macrophages, evaluated by F4/80 and CD68 expressions, and expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, while pro-inflammatory cytokines were inhibited. Anti- inflammatory response, accompanied by de novo catecholamine production and up-regulation of β3-adrenergic receptors, led to the stimulation of UCP-1 and PGC1α expression, suggesting a cold-induced "" of the mWAT, mediated by alternatively activated macrophages.The present data indicate that prolonged cold exposure may induce anti-inflammatory response in mWAT associated with induction of UCP-1 expression. Although functional thermogenesis in the mWAT is most likely redundant, a highly efficient dissipation of energy by UCP1 may affect the energy homeostasis in this visceral fat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577083>Functionality study of Na6PMo11FeO40 as a mushroom tyrosinase inhibitor.</a></h2><p>The inhibitory effects of iron-substituted phosphomolybdic acid (Na6PMo11FeO40, abbreviated as PMo11Fe) on mushroom tyrosinase were investigated. The Native-PAGE results show that PMo11Fe has an inhibitory effect on tyrosinase. A spectrophotometric analysis shows that PMo11Fe is a reversible and noncompetitive inhibitor with KI=KIS=0.47 mmol L(-1). The effects of PMo11Fe on the preservation of lotus root slices were studied. The results show that PMo11Fe can significantly slow the  rate of lotus root slices, inhibit the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), enhance the activity of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), maintain high levels of glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (ASA) and sucrose and control the peroxidation degree of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. This study may help to elucidate the design of mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors of polyoxometalates (abbreviated as POMs) and a theoretical basis for the use of POMs to inhibit fruit spoilage.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, BIC and antioxidant capacity, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and Fe reducing power activity, of the MRPs derived from 12 different amino acids and three reducing sugars were investigated.The MRPs of cysteine (Cys), cystine, arginine (Arg) and histidine (His) showed higher BIC compared to other amino acids. Lysine (Lys)-MRPs showed the highest absorbance value at 420 nm (A ) but very limited BIC, whereas Cys-MRPs, showed the highest BIC and the lowest A . The A can roughly reflect the trend of BIC of MRPs from different amino acids, except Cys and Lys. MRPs from  (Tyr) showed the most potent antioxidant capacity but very limited BIC, whereas Cys-MRPs showed both higher antioxidant capacity and BIC compared to other amino acids. Partial least squares regression analysis showed positive and significant correlation between BIC and Fe reducing power of MRPs from 12 amino acids with glucose or fructose, except Lys, Cys and Tyr. The suitable pH for generating efficient  inhibition compounds varies depending on different amino acids: acidic pH was favorable for Cys, whereas neutral and alkaline pH were suitable for His and Arg, respectively. Increasing both heating temperature and time over a certain range could improve the BIC of MRPs of Cys, His and Arg, whereas any further increase deteriorates their  inhibition efficiencies.The types of amino acid, initial pH, temperature and time of the Maillard reaction were found to greatly influence the BIC and antioxidant capacity of the resulting MRPs. There is no clear relationship between BIC and the antioxidant capacity of MRPs when reactant type and processing parameters of the Maillard reaction are considered as variables. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28158719>Genome-wide association of white blood cell counts in Hispanic/Latino Americans: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos.</a></h2><p>Circulating white blood cell (WBC) counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils) differ by ethnicity. The genetic factors underlying basal WBC traits in Hispanics/Latinos are unknown. We performed a genome-wide association study of total WBC and differential counts in a large, ethnically diverse US population sample of Hispanics/Latinos ascertained by the Hispanic Community Health Study and Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We demonstrate that several previously known WBC-associated genetic loci (e.g. the African Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines null variant for neutrophil count) are generalizable to WBC traits in Hispanics/Latinos. We identified and replicated common and rare germ-line variants at FLT3 (a gene often somatically mutated in leukemia) associated with monocyte count. The common FLT3 variant rs76428106 has a large allele frequency differential between African and non-African populations. We also identified several novel genetic loci involving or regulating hematopoietic transcription factors (CEBPE-SLC7A7, CEBPA and CRBN-TRNT1) associated with basophil count. The minor allele of the CEBPE variant associated with lower basophil count has been previously associated with Amerindian ancestry and higher risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Hispanics. Together, these data suggest that germline genetic variation affecting transcriptional and signaling pathways that underlie WBC development and lineage specification can contribute to inter-individual as well as ethnic differences in peripheral blood cell counts (normal hematopoiesis) in addition to susceptibility to leukemia (malignant hematopoiesis).© The Author 2017.

The inhibition of benzylideneacetone, benzylacetone, and 4-phenyl-2-butanol on mushroom tyrosinase was first investigated. The results shown that these three compounds could effectively inhibit the enzyme activity sharply and the inhibitory effects were determined to be reversible. Their inhibitor concentrations leading to 50% activity lost values were determined to be 1.5, 2.8, and 1.1 mM for monophenolase and 2.0, 0.6, and 0.8 mM for diphenolase, respectively. For the monophenolase activity, all of these three compounds were mixed-type inhibitors, however, only 4-phenyl-2-butanol obviously lengthened the lag time. For the diphenolase activity, benzylideneacetone and benzylacetone were mixed-type inhibitors, while 4-phenyl-2-butanol was a noncompetitive type inhibitor. In conclusion, these compounds exhibited potent antityrosinase activities. This research would provide scientific evidence for the use of benzylideneacetone, benzylacetone, and 4-phenyl-2-butanol as antityrosinase agents.Copyright © 2014 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

However, whether alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamine and substantially promote adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue remains controversial. Here, we show that  hydroxylase (TyrH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was expressed and phosphorylated in adipose-resident macrophages. In addition, the plasma level of adrenaline was increased by cold stress in mice, and treatment of macrophages with adrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TyrH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII or PKA signaling diminished adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of TyrH in primary macrophages. Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII upregulated basal TyrH phosphorylation, while suppressing the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on TyrH in macrophages. Myeloid-specific disruption of CaMKIIγ suppressed both the cold-induced production of norepinephrine and adipose UCP1 expression in vivo and the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on macrophage-dependent activation of brown adipocytes in vitro. Lack of CaMKII signaling attenuated catecholamine production mediated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key inducers of type 2 immune response in primary macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest a feedforward mechanism of adrenaline in adipose-resident macrophages, and that myeloid CaMKII signaling plays an important role in catecholamine production and subsequent beige fat activation.© The Author (2017).

Age-related declines in the expression of both NMDAR-dependent LTP and NMDAR subunit proteins in the CA1 region of the hippocampus have been well characterized and likely underlie age-related memory impairment. In the current study, we examined NMDAR-dependent LTP in young Fischer 344 rats (4 months old) and aged rats (24 months old) given either a control diet or a diet supplemented with blueberry extract for 6-8 weeks. NMDAR-dependent LTP was evoked by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the presence of nifedipine, to eliminate voltage-gated calcium channel LTP. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were increased by 57% 1 h after HFS in young animals, but this potentiation was reduced to 31% in aged animals. Supplementation of the diet with blueberry extract elevated LTP (63%) in aged animals to levels seen in young. The normalization of LTP may be due to the blueberry diet preventing a decline in synaptic strength, as measured by the slope of the fEPSP for a given fiber potential. The blueberry diet did not prevent age-related declines in NMDAR protein expression. However, phosphorylation of a key  residue on the NR2B subunit, important for increasing NMDAR function, was enhanced by the diet, suggesting that an increase in NMDAR function might overcome the loss in protein. This report provides evidence that dietary alterations later in life may prevent or postpone the cognitive declines associated with aging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11982435>Phenolic compounds and related enzymes are not rate-limiting in  development of fresh-cut potatoes.</a></h2><p>The effect of minimal processing on polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and phenolic compounds was studied in five potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and Spunta). Minimal processing caused an overall increase in PPO, POD, and PAL activities. The isoform pattern of PPO was the same for all of the cultivars before and after processing. No latent PPO was detected. The isoperoxidase pattern was approximately the same among cultivars. An increase in POD activity was related to the specific induction of an acidic isoperoxidase. PAL showed an induction pattern characterized by the presence of a maximum peak of activity after 4 days of processing for all of the cultivars. The sequence of  susceptibility of potato cultivars was as follows: Monalisa > Spunta > Liseta > Cara > Agria.  development was only partially correlated to PAL activity (only during the first 4 days after wounding). However, this correlation could not explain the above sequence of  susceptibility. Minimal processing caused an increase of chlorogenic acid, whereas  content remained unchanged.

Here, we report that mice without CDP138 develop obesity under normal chow diet (NCD) or high- diet (HFD) conditions. CDP138 mice have lower energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, and body temperature than wild-type (WT) mice. CDP138 is exclusively expressed in adrenal medulla and is colocalized with  hydroxylase (TH), a marker of sympathetic nervous terminals, in the inguinal . Compared with WT controls, CDP138 mice had altered catecholamine levels in circulation, adrenal gland, and inguinal . Adrenergic signaling on cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation induced by cold challenge but not by an exogenous β3 adrenoceptor against CL316243 were decreased in adipose tissues of CDP138 mice. Cold-induced beige  browning, fatty acid oxidation, thermogenesis, and related gene expression were reduced in CDP138 mice. CDP138 mice are also prone to HFD-induced insulin resistance, as assessed by Akt phosphorylation and glucose transport in skeletal muscles. Our data indicate that CDP138 is a regulator of stress response and plays a significant role in adipose tissue browning, energy balance, and insulin sensitivity through regulating catecholamine secretion from the sympathetic nervous terminals and adrenal gland.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6808881>Maillard reaction VII-- of glucose with lysine, glycine and glutamic acid.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10801799>Activation of NF-kappa B by bradykinin through a Galpha(q)- and Gbeta gamma-dependent pathway that involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt.</a></h2><p>Recent work has suggested a role for the serine/threonine kinase Akt and IkappaB kinases (IKKs) in nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. In this study, the involvement of these components in NF-kappaB activation through a G protein-coupled pathway was examined using transfected HeLa cells that express the B2-type bradykinin (BK) receptor. The function of IKK2, and to a lesser extent, IKK1, was suggested by BK-induced activation of their kinase activities and by the ability of their dominant negative mutants to inhibit BK-induced NF-kappaB activation. BK-induced NF-kappaB activation and IKK2 activity were markedly inhibited by RGS3T, a regulator of G protein signaling that inhibits Galpha(q), and by two Gbetagamma scavengers. Co-expression of Galpha(q) potentiated BK-induced NF-kappaB activation, whereas co-expression of either an activated Galpha(q)(Q209L) or Gbeta(1)gamma(2) induced IKK2 activity and NF-kappaB activation without BK stimulation. BK-induced NF-kappaB activation was partially blocked by LY294002 and by a dominant negative mutant of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), suggesting that PI3K is a downstream effector of Galpha(q) and Gbeta(1)gamma(2) for NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, BK could activate the PI3K downstream kinase Akt, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant of Akt inhibited BK-induced NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that BK utilizes a signaling pathway that involves Galpha(q), Gbeta(1)gamma(2), PI3K, Akt, and IKK for NF-kappaB activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17524123>A hydroquinone formulation with increased stability and decreased potential for irritation.</a></h2><p>Long-term treatment with a high-strength hydroquinone (HQ) cream (usually 4% HQ) is the mainstay therapy for hyperpigmentation disorders.

Insects for food/feed uses are currently slowly killed through freezing by most insect rearing companies, and typically, enzymatic  takes place in the insect proteins fractions. However, very little is known about the influence of these enzymatic reactions on the protein physical, chemical, nutritional and technological properties. In this work a metabolomics and proteomic study was conducted on Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) prepupae, killed by two different methods: freezing (commonly used), and blanching (with the aim to inhibit the enzymatic activities). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) metabolomics demonstrated that slow killing method by freezing, compared with blanching, elicits the activation of several enzymatic pathways, among them melanisation with  consumption, energetic metabolism and lipolysis. These metabolic changes have an impact also on protein nutritional quality, with a loss of cysteine and lysine, likely involved in the process of melanisation and enzymatic . A strong effect was also observed on protein extractability: proteins from prepupae killed by blanching were found to be more extractable in milder conditions by chemical methods, and more prone to enzymatic digestion (97% of proteins released in solution upon proteolysis) than proteins from prepupae killed by freezing. All these data indicate that killing by blanching inhibits the  reaction and other enzymatic changes occurring during slow killing by freezing, increasing the extractability of proteins in aqueous solutions, avoiding essential amino acid loss, and improving enzymatic digestibility.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high- diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against  hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/544414>[Influence of food  on nutrition.

Several lines of evidence have also suggested that Tks4 has a role in adipocyte biology; however, its roles in the various types of adipocytes at the cellular level and in transcriptional regulation have not been studied. Therefore, we hypothesized that Tks4 functions as an organizing molecule in signaling networks that regulate adipocyte homeostasis. Our aims were to study the white and brown adipose depots of Tks4 knockout (KO) mice using immunohistology and western blotting and to analyze gene expression changes regulated by the white, brown, and beige adipocyte-related transcription factors via a PCR array. Based on morphological differences in the Tks4-KO adipocytes and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of Tks4-KO mice, we concluded that the beigeing process was more robust in the WAT of Tks4-KO mice compared to the wild-type animals. Furthermore, in the Tks4-KO WAT, the expression profile of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-regulated adipogenesis-related genes was shifted in favor of the appearance of beige-like cells.

Conversely, abnormal accumulation of melanin is responsible for hyper pigmentary disorders such as melasma, senile lentigines and freckles. Because of the visible nature of dermatologic diseases, they have a considerable psychosomatic effect on affected patients. Tyrosinase inhibitors are molecules that interrelate in some way with the enzyme to prevent it from working in the normal manner. Past many decades witnessed the quest for the development of natural tyrosinase inhibitors due to imperative role played by tyrosinase in the process of melanogenesis and fungi or fruit enzymatic . Mechanism of pigmentation is characterized by the intact process of the synthesis of specialized black pigment within melanosomes. Melanin is synthesized by a cascade of enzymatic and chemical reactions. For this reason, melanin production is mainly controlled by the expression and activation of tyrosinase.

However, how ILC2 in adipose tissue is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, our study shows that ILC2s are present in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as well as subcutaneous and epididymal WAT (sWAT and eWAT). The fractions of ILC2s, natural killer T (NKT) cells and eosinophils in sWAT, eWAT and BAT are significantly decreased by high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding and leptin deficiency-induced obesity. Consistent with this, the adipose expression and circulating levels of IL-33, a key inducing cytokine of ILC2, are significantly downregulated by obesity. Furthermore, administration of IL-33 markedly increases the fraction of ILC2 and eosinophil as well as the expression of UCP1 and  hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. On the other hand, cold exposure induces the expression levels of IL-33 and UCP1 and the population of ILC2 and eosinophil in sWAT, and these promoting effects of cold stress are reversed by neutralization of IL-33 signaling in vivo Moreover, the basal and cold-induced IL-33 and ILC2/eosinophil pathways are significantly suppressed by sympathetic denervation via local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in sWAT. Taken together, our data suggest that the ILC2/eosinophil axis in adipose tissue is regulated by sympathetic nervous system and obesity in IL-33-dependent manner, and IL-33-driven ILC2/eosinophil axis is implicated in the development of obesity.© 2016 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21398499>Legionella nagasakiensis sp. nov., isolated from water samples and from a patient with pneumonia.</a></h2><p>A novel Legionella species was identified based on analysis of 16S rRNA and mip (macrophage infectivity potentiator) gene sequences, cellular fatty acids, isoprenoid quinones, biochemical reactions, antigens and quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization.

DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated that DNAs from the four strains were highly related (78-84 %) but they showed 29 % relatedness to Legionella oakridgensis ATCC 33761(T) and less than 10 % to strains of other Legionella species tested. These characterizations suggest that the isolates represent a novel species, for which the name Legionella nagasakiensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is CDC-1796-JAP-E(T) ( = ATCC BAA-1557(T) = JCM 15315(T)).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601849>A new insight into mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors: docking, pharmacophore-based virtual screening, and molecular modeling studies.</a></h2><p>Tyrosinase, a widely spread enzyme in micro-organisms, animals, and plants, participates in two rate-limiting steps in melanin formation pathway which is responsible for skin protection against UV lights' harm whose functional deficiency result in serious dermatological diseases. This enzyme seems to be responsible for neuromelanin formation in human brain as well. In plants, the enzyme leads the  pathway which is commonly observed in injured tissues that is economically very unfavorable. Among different types of tyrosinase, mushroom tyrosinase has the highest homology with the mammalian tyrosinase and the only commercial tyrosinase available. In this study, ligand-based pharmacophore drug discovery method was applied to rapidly identify mushroom tyrosinase enzyme inhibitors using virtual screening. The model pharmacophore of essential interactions was developed and refined studying already experimentally discovered potent inhibitors employing Docking analysis methodology. After pharmacophore virtual screening and binding modes prediction, 14 compounds from ZINC database were identified as potent inhibitors of mushroom tyrosinase which were classified into five groups according to their chemical structures. The inhibition behavior of the discovered compounds was further studied through Classical Molecular Dynamic Simulations and the conformational changes induced by the presence of the studied ligands were discussed and compared to those of the substrate, . According to the obtained results, five novel leads are introduced to be further optimized or directly used as potent inhibitors of mushroom tyrosinase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2894032>Cholinergic regulation of protein phosphorylation in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.</a></h2><p>Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal medullae and maintained in primary culture. After prelabeling with 32PO4, exposure of the chromaffin cells to acetylcholine increased the phosphorylation of a Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein and a Mr approximately equal to 60,000 protein ( hydroxylase), visualized after separation of total cellular proteins in naDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to three known phosphoproteins ("100-kDa," "87-kDa," and protein III) revealed an acetylcholine-dependent phosphorylation of these proteins. These three proteins were also shown to be present in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by immunolabeling techniques. "100-kDa" is a Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein selectively phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III, "87-kDa" is a Mr approximately equal to 87,000 protein selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and protein III is a phosphoprotein doublet of Mr approximately equal to 74,000 (IIIa) and Mr approximately equal to 55,000 (IIIb) phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. Furthermore, 100-kDa was shown to be identical to the Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein whose phosphorylation was increased by acetylcholine treatment. The acetylcholine-dependent increase in phosphorylation of  hydroxylase, 100-kDa, 87-kDa, and protein III required extracellular calcium and was mimicked by nicotine, veratridine, elevated K+, and calcium ionophore A23187, but not by muscarine. In addition, forskolin increased the phosphorylation of  hydroxylase, 100-kDa, and protein III, but not that of 87-kDa. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increased the phosphorylation of  hydroxylase, 87-kDa, and protein III, but not that of 100-kDa. The data demonstrate that cholinergic activation of chromaffin cells increases the phosphorylation of several proteins and that several protein kinase systems may be involved in these effects.</p></html>
