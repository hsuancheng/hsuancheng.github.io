It was demonstrated that the protons produced and accumulated inside the biofilm during the anodic phase greatly favored the oxygen reduction reaction when the electrode was switched to become the biocathode. Protons accumulation, which hindered the bioanode operation, thus became an advantage for the biocathode. The bioanodes, formed from garden compost leachate under constant polarization at -0.2 V vs. SCE, were able to support long exposure to forced aeration, with only a slight alteration of their anodic efficiency. They produced a current density of 16±1.7 A/ for acetate oxidation and up to -0.4 A/ for oxygen reduction. Analysis of the microbial communities by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing revealed strong selection of Chloroflexi (49±1%), which was not observed for conventional bioanodes not exposed to oxygen. Chloroflexi were found as the dominant phylum of electroactive biofilms for the first time.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to study how different bacteria affect macrophage polarization, we exposed murine RAW 264.7 macrophages to sixteen different strains representing probiotic strains, pathogens, commensals and strains of food origin. Increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or arginase-1 gene expression indicates M1 or  polarization, respectively, and was quantified by qRT-PCR. Strains of Escherichia and Salmonella elevated iNOS expression more so than strains of Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, indicating that Gram-negative strains are more potent M1 inducers. However, strain-specific responses were observed. For instance, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 was a poor inducer of iNOS gene expression compared to the other E. coli strains, while Enterococcus faecalis Symbioflor-1 was more potent in this respect compared to all the eleven Gram-positive strains tested. Macrophage polarization was further characterized by quantifying secreted pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Exposure to the pathogen E. coli 042 produced a cytokine profile indicating M1 differentiation, which is in accordance with the PCR data. However, exposure to most strains resulted in either high or low secretion levels of all cytokines tested, rather than a clear M1 or  profile. In general, the Gram-negative strains induced high levels of cytokine secretion compared to the Gram-positive strains. Interestingly, strains of human origin had a higher impact on macrophages compared to strains of food origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28794630>Probiotics protect mice from CoCrMo particles-induced osteolysis.</a></h2><p>Wear particle-induced inflammatory osteolysis is the primary cause of aseptic loosening, which is the most common reason for total hip arthroplasty (THA) failure in the med- and long term. Recent studies have suggested an important role of gut  (GM) in modulating the host metabolism and immune system, leading to alterations in bone mass. Probiotic bacteria administered in adequate amounts can alter the composition of GM and confer health benefits to the host. Given the inflammatory osteolysis that occurs in wear debris-induced prosthesis loosening, we examined whether the probiotic  could reduce osteolysis in a mouse calvarial resorption model. In this study,  markedly protected mice from CoCrMo particles (CoPs)-induced osteolysis. Osteoclast gene markers and the number of osteoclasts were significantly decreased in -treated mice. Probiotic treatment decreased the M1-like macrophage phenotype indicated by downregulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased the -like macrophage phenotype indicated by upregulation of IL-4, IL-10 and arginase. Collectively, these results indicated that the  treatment modulated the immune status and suppressed wear particle-induced osteolysis in vivo. Thus, probiotic treatment may represent a potential preventive and therapeutic approach to reduced wear debris-induced osteolysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31139852>Targeting gut  and barrier function with prebiotics to alleviate autoimmune manifestations in NOD mice.</a></h2><p>Adopting a diet containing indigestible fibre compounds such as prebiotics to fuel advantageous bacteria has proven beneficial for alleviating inflammation. The effect of the microbial changes on autoimmunity, however, remains unknown. We studied the effects of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on pancreatic islet and salivary gland inflammation in NOD mice and tested whether these were mediated by the gut .Mother and offspring mice were fed an XOS-supplemented diet until diabetes onset or weaning and were compared with a control-fed group. Diabetes incidence was monitored, insulitis and sialadenitis were scored in histological sections from adult mice, and several metabolic and immune variables were analysed in mice before the development of diabetes. Gut barrier function was assessed using an in vivo FITC-dextran permeability test. The importance of XOS-mediated gut microbial changes were evaluated in antibiotic-treated mice fed either XOS or control diet or given a faecal  transplant from test animals.Diabetes onset was delayed in the XOS-fed mice, which also had fewer cellular infiltrations in their pancreatic islets and salivary glands. Interestingly, insulitis was most reduced in the XOS-fed groups when the mice were also treated with an antibiotic cocktail. There was no difference in sialadenitis between the dietary groups treated with antibiotics; the mice were protected by  depletion regardless of diet. Faecal  transplantation was not able to transfer protection. No major differences in glucose-insulin regulation, glucagon-like peptide-1, or short-chain fatty acid production were related to the XOS diet. The XOS diet did, however, reduce gut permeability markers in the small and large intestine. This was accompanied by a more anti-inflammatory environment locally and systemically, dominated by a shift from M1 to  macrophages, a higher abundance of activated regulatory T cells, and lower levels of induction of natural killer T cells and cytotoxic T cells.Prebiotic XOS have -dependent effects on salivary gland inflammation and -independent effects on pancreatic islet pathology that are accompanied by an improved gut barrier that seems able to heighten control of intestinal diabetogenic antigens that have the potential to penetrate the mucosa to activate autoreactive immune responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24527635>Power generation and nitrogen removal of landfill leachate using microbial fuel cell technology.</a></h2><p>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology has been practised in the treatment of landfill leachate. However, it is a big challenge for the usage of MFCs to treat landfill leachate with high ammonium content. The purpose of this study was to design and test two MFC reactors, i.e. an ammonium oxidation/MFC reactor and an MFC/Anammox reactor for the treatment of landfill leachate with high ammonium content in terms of power generation and nitrogen removal. Using the ammonium oxidation/MFC reactor, the landfill leachate collected from Leon County Landfill of Northwest Florida generated a power density of 8 mW/ together with 92% of nitrogen removal. For the MFC/Anammox reactor, a power density of 12 mW/ was achieved with 94% of nitrogen removal. Compared with the ammonium oxidation/MFC reactor, 50% more energy was generated because in the MFC/Anammox Reactor, nitrite served as the electron acceptor; while in the Ammonium Oxidation/MFC reactor, nitrate served as the electron acceptor. In this research, power generation was also found to be directly linked to the microbial species that were involved in organic decomposition, i.e. the greater the microbial concentration, the more the power generated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183376>Gut microbiome catabolites as novel modulators of muscle cell glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome supplies essential metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids to skeletal muscle mitochondria, and the composition and activity of the  is in turn affected by muscle fitness. To further our understanding of the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and muscle, we examined the effect of -derived phenolic metabolites on the ability of human muscle cells to take up and metabolize glucose. As a model, we used the differentiated human skeletal muscle myoblast line, LHCN-, which expresses typical muscle phenotypic markers. We initially tested a selected panel of parent phenolic compounds and microbial metabolites, and their respective phenolic conjugates, as found in blood. Several of the tested compounds increased glucose uptake and metabolism, notably in high glucose- and insulin-treated myotubes. One of the most effective was isovanillic acid 3 -O-sulfate (IVAS), a metabolite from the microbiome found in the blood, primarily derived from consumed cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside, a major compound in berry fruits. IVAS stimulated a dose-dependent increase in glucose transport through glucose transporter GLUT4- and PI3K-dependent mechanisms. IVAS also up-regulated GLUT1, GLUT4, and PI3K p85α protein, and increased phosphorylation of Akt. The stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism by a unique microbiome metabolite provides a novel link among diet, gut , and skeletal muscle energy source utilization.-Houghton, M.

Here, we have set up a study to investigate the effectiveness of two probiotic formulations containing a blend of seven bacterial species in modulating intestinal inflammation in two rodent models of colitis, induced by treating mice with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Despite the taxonomy of the bacterial species in the two probiotic formulations being similar, only one preparation (Blend 2-Vivomixx) effectively attenuated the development of colitis in both models. In the TNBS model of colitis, Blend 2 reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, promoting the expansion  macrophages and the formation of IL-10-producing Treg cells in the colon's . In the DSS model of colitis, disease attenuation and Treg formation was observed only in mice administered with Blend 2, and this effect was associated with intestinal  remodeling and increased formation of lactate, butyrate, and propionate. None of these effects were observed in mice administered with Blend 1 (VSL#3). In summary, we have shown that two probiotic mixtures obtained by combining taxonomically similar species produced with different manufacturing methods exert divergent effects in mouse models of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101203>Porcine Small and Large Intestinal  Rapidly Hydrolyze the Masked Mycotoxin Deoxynivalenol-3-Glucoside and Release Deoxynivalenol in Spiked Batch Cultures .</a></h2><p>Mycotoxin contamination of cereal grains causes well-recognized toxicities in animals and humans, but the fate of plant-bound masked mycotoxins in the gut is less well understood. Masked mycotoxins have been found to be stable under conditions prevailing in the small intestine but are rapidly hydrolyzed by fecal . This study aims to assess the hydrolysis of the masked mycotoxin deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON3Glc) by the  of different regions of the porcine intestinal tract. Intestinal digesta samples were collected from the jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and feces of 5 pigs and immediately frozen under anaerobic conditions. Sample slurries were prepared in  culture medium, spiked with DON3Glc or free deoxynivalenol (DON; 2 nmol/ml), and incubated anaerobically for up to 72 h. Mycotoxin concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the  composition was determined using a quantitative PCR methodology. The jejunal  hydrolyzed DON3Glc very slowly, while samples from the ileum, cecum, colon, and feces rapidly and efficiently hydrolyzed DON3Glc. No further metabolism of DON was observed in any sample. The microbial load and  composition in the ileum were significantly different from those in the distal intestinal regions, whereas those in the cecum, colon and feces did not differ. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that the masked mycotoxin DON3Glc is hydrolyzed efficiently in the distal small intestine and large intestine of pigs. Once DON is released, toxicity and absorption in the distal intestinal tract likely occur  This study further supports the need to include masked metabolites in mycotoxin risk assessments and regulatory actions for feed and food.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25698557>Timosaponin AIII and its metabolite sarsasapogenin ameliorate colitis in mice by inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK activation and restoring Th17/Treg cell balance.</a></h2><p>The rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (AA, family Liliaceae), which contains furostanol and spirostanol saponins, is a typical herbal medicine that improves learning and memory in rats and inhibits inflammation. In a preliminary study, timosaponin AIII, one of AA main constituents, was metabolized to sarsasapogenin by gut  and inhibited NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Here we have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of AIII and sarsasapogenin in vitro and in vivo. Both AIII and sarsasapogenin potently inhibited NF-κB and MAPK activation, as well as IRAK1, TAK1, and IκBα phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Further, AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited the binding of LPS to macrophage Toll-like receptor 4, as well as polarization of  to M1 macrophages. Oral administration of AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited 2,3,4-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice, along with reducing NF-κB activation and interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 levels, while simultaneously increasing IL-10. Both compounds inhibited Th17 cell differentiation in colonic lamina propria, but induced Treg cell differentiation. Further, AIII and sarsasapogenin inhibited the differentiation of splenic CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells in vitro. The vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of sarsasapogenin were more potent than AIII. These results suggest that orally administered AIII may be metabolized to sarsasapogenin by gut , which may ameliorate inflammatory diseases such as colitis by inhibiting TLR4-NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway and restoring Th17/Treg cell balance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

UC is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. UC was first described by Samuel Wilks in 1859 and it is more common than Crohn's disease worldwide. The overall incidence and prevalence of UC is reported to be 1.2-20.3 and 7.6-245 cases per 100,000 persons/year respectively. UC has a bimodal age distribution with an incidence peak in the 2nd or 3rd decades and followed by second peak between 50 and 80 years of age. The key risk factors for UC include genetics, environmental factors, autoimmunity and gut . The classic presentation of UC include bloody diarrhea with or without mucus, rectal urgency, tenesmus, and variable degrees of abdominal pain that is often relieved by defecation. UC is diagnosed based on the combination of clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, histology, and the absence of alternative diagnoses. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of UC, it is also important to define the extent and severity of inflammation, which aids in the selection of appropriate treatment and for predicting the patient's prognosis. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis of UC. A pathognomonic finding of UC is the presence of continuous colonic inflammation characterized by erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, granularity, erosions, friability, bleeding, and ulcerations, with distinct demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed bowel. Histopathology is the definitive tool in diagnosing UC, assessing the disease severity and identifying intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) or cancer. The classical histological changes in UC include decreased crypt density, crypt architectural distortion, irregular mucosal surface and heavy diffuse transmucosal inflammation, in the absence of genuine granulomas. Abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the preferred initial radiographic imaging study in UC patients with acute abdominal symptoms. The hallmark CT finding of UC is mural thickening with a mean wall thickness of 8 mm, as opposed to a 2-3 mm mean wall thickness of the normal colon. The Mayo scoring system is a commonly used index to assess disease severity and monitor patients during therapy. The goals of treatment in UC are three fold-improve quality of life, achieve steroid free remission and minimize the risk of cancer. The choice of treatment depends on disease extent, severity and the course of the disease. For proctitis, topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are used as the first line agents. UC patients with more extensive or severe disease should be treated with a combination of oral and topical 5-ASA drugs +/- corticosteroids to induce remission. Patients with severe UC need to be hospitalized for treatment. The options in these patients include intravenous steroids and if refractory, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (infliximab) are utilized. Once remission is induced, patients are then continued on appropriate medications to maintain remission. Indications for emergency surgery include refractory toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, or severe colorectal bleeding.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Antibiotic treatments are likely to affect the gut flora and GI immune system, subsequently disturbing GI motility and body metabolism. In the present study, we investigated antibiotic‑induced alterations of body metabolism and GI motility in association with the macrophage profile in the colon. Specific pathogen‑free (SPF) mice (ICR; 6 weeks old; female) were orally administered vancomycin (0.2 mg/ml) in drinking water for 5 weeks, and subsequent changes in pathophysiology were observed. The expression of CD80 and CD163 was examined by immunohistochemistry and the expression of cytokines in colonic tissues was evaluated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red (6% w/v) solution. In the vancomycin‑treated SPF mice, significant increases in body weight, cecum weight and GITT were observed compared with the controls. The number of CD80‑positive M1 macrophages and the expression of interferon‑γ and interleukin‑12 were significantly increased, whereas, the numbers of CD163‑positive  macrophages in the mucosal and muscular layers were decreased in the colon of vancomycin‑treated mice. GITT was positively correlated with the number of CD80‑positive M1 macrophages in the colonic mucosa; however, was negatively correlated with the number of CD163‑positive  macrophages in the mucosal and muscular layers.

In the present study, the prebiotic activity of a maize-derived WG cereal (WGM) was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human feeding study (n 32). For a period of 21 d, healthy men and women, mean age 32 (sd 8) years and BMI 23·3 (sd 0·58) kg/, consumed either 48 g/d WG cereal (WGM) or 48 g placebo cereal (non-whole grain (NWG)) in a crossover fashion. Faecal samples were collected at five points during the study on days 0, 21, 42, 63 and 84 (representing at baseline, after both treatments and both wash-out periods). Faecal bacteriology was assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridisation with 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes specific for Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium histolyticum/perfringens subgroup, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus subgroup and total bacteria. After 21 d consumption of WGM, mean group levels of faecal bifidobacteria increased significantly compared with the control cereal (P = 0·001).

A total of 1,200 21-day-old ducks were randomly assigned to 5 stocking density groups of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ducks/, with 6 replicates for each group. At 40 days of age, duck serum and pectorals were collected for biochemical tests; liver and cecal contents of ducks were gathered for proteome and  analysis, respectively. Serum MDA increased while pectorals T-AOC reduced linearly with enhancing stocking density. Duck lipid metabolism was altered under different stocking density as well. Serum LDL-C increased linearly with increasing stocking density. Proteome analysis revealed fatty acid biosynthesis proteins such as acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 and fatty acid oxidation related proteins including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase were enriched in high stocking density group. Additionally, high stocking density increased oxidative response associated proteins such as DDRGK domain containing 1. Furthermore, increasing stocking density diminished proteins of anti-oxidant capacity including regucalcin and catalase. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that higher stocking density was accompanied with decreased microbial diversity, as well as depletion of anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa, including Bacteroidales, Butyricimonas and Alistipe. Besides, reduced bile acid metabolism-associated bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were found in the high-density group. Both proteome and 16S rDNA results showed inflammation and chronic liver disease trend in the high-density group, which suggests the involvement of the liver-gut axis in oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23349499>Promotion of autoimmune diabetes by cereal diet in the presence or absence of microbes associated with gut immune activation, regulatory imbalance, and altered cathelicidin antimicrobial Peptide.</a></h2><p>We are exposed to millions of microbial and dietary antigens via the gastrointestinal tract, which likely play a key role in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We differentiated the effects of these two major environmental factors on gut immunity and T1D. Diabetes-prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats were housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) or germ-free (GF) conditions and weaned onto diabetes-promoting cereal diets or a protective low-antigen hydrolyzed casein (HC) diet, and T1D incidence was monitored. Fecal  16S rRNA genes, immune cell distribution, and gene expression in the jejunum were analyzed. T1D was highest in cereal-SPF (65%) and cereal-GF rats (53%) but inhibited and delayed in HC-fed counterparts. Nearly all HC-GF rats remained diabetes-free, whereas HC-fed SPF rats were less protected (7 vs. 29%). Bacterial communities differed in SPF rats fed cereal compared with HC. Cereal-SPF rats displayed increased gut CD3(+) and CD8α(+) lymphocytes, ratio of Ifng to Il4 mRNA, and Lck expression, indicating T-cell activation. The ratio of CD3(+) T cells expressing the Treg marker Foxp3(+) was highest in HC-GF and lowest in cereal-SPF rats. Resident CD163(+)  macrophages were increased in HC-protected rats. The cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (Camp) gene was upregulated in the jejunum of HC diet-protected rats, and CAMP(+) cells colocalized with CD163.

The largest and most important interface between the organism and its environment is represented by surfaces covered with epithelial cells. Of these surfaces, mucosae comprise in humans approximately 300 , and the skin covers approximately 1.8  surface of the human body. Mucosal tissues contain two effector arms of the immune system, innate and adaptive, which operate in synergy. Interaction with commensal bacteria, which outnumber the nucleated cells of our body, occurs physiologically on epithelial surfaces; this interaction could pose the risk of inflammation. The mucosal immune system has developed a complex network of regulatory signalling cascades that is a prerequisite for proper activation but also for a timely inactivation of the pathway. As demonstrated in gnotobiotic animal models of human diseases, impaired regulation of mucosal responses to commensal bacteria plays an important role in the development of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499195>Mushroom polysaccharides and jiaogulan saponins exert cancer preventive effects by shaping the gut  and microenvironment in Apc mice.</a></h2><p>The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is alarming among younger peoples. While no effective chemopreventive drug available in the market, researchers have been searching for alternative strategies against CRC that are in demand. Therefore, we tested the cancer-preventive properties of Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi) polysaccharides (GLP), along with the saponins extracted from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS), an herbal tea with prebiotic-like effects. Here, we report that saponins from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS) and polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum (GLP together with GpS) profoundly improved the inflamed gut barrier of Apc mice by reducing polyps, shifting colonic M1 to  macrophages, positively reverting E-cadherin/N-cadherin ratio, and downregulating oncogenic signaling molecules. The treatments also markedly promoted short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and abridged sulfate-reducing bacteria in a time-dependent manner. G-protein coupled-receptors were significantly stimulated in the treated mice, accompanied by the modulated expressions of histone deacetylases, anti-cancer gut hormone PYY, and PPAPγ. These findings suggest that some of the herbal medicinal foods could modulate the relationship between the host and the gut  (GM) to exert their beneficial properties to the host. Our study also implicates that these dietary mushroom polysaccharides and the Gp saponins have the potential to be developed as new preventive medicines against CRC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a key component of the Hippo pathway and was recently suggested to promote epithelial cell regeneration for IBD recovery. However, it is unclear how YAP regulates macrophage polarization, inflammation, and gut microbial homeostasis. Although YAP has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and alleviate IBD, here we show that YAP in macrophages aggravates IBD, accompanied by the production of antimicrobial peptides and changes in gut . YAP impairs interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13-induced  macrophage polarization while promoting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon γ (IFN-γ)-triggered M1 macrophage activation for IL-6 production. In addition, YAP expression is differently regulated during the induction of  versus M1 macrophages. This study suggests that fully understanding the multiple functions of YAP in different cell types is crucial for IBD therapy.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, using 2-bromoacetophenone as the derivatization reagent (BP, 10 mg/mL, 40 °C for 20 min), a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method was established for the quantitative determination of seven short-chain fatty acids in plasma and feces. The analyses were performed on a C column in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. Specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, and stability were observed within the quantitative limits of biological sample analysis. The established method has largely improved the sensitivity by 200- to 2000-fold than that in gas chromatography (GC). Especially for butyrate, the lower quantitative limit of 1 ng/mL, 1600-fold higher in sensitivity than that of GC (1.6 μg/mL), ensured the accurate determination of its low level in blood or feces (88 ± 29 ng/mL in blood, 176 ± 18 μg/g in feces). Then, the validated method was applied for therapeutic studies of berberine in hyperlipidemia hamsters in vivo and screening of 13 compounds (including five metabolites of berberine and eight typical isoquinoline alkaloids) in vitro. After berberine treatment (oral, 200 mg/kg, 2 weeks) to hyperlipidemia hamsters, the levels of butyrate were significantly upregulated in blood (77 ± 10 ng/mL vs. 117 ± 13 ng/mL, *P < 0.05) and feces (132 ± 11 μg/g vs. 547 ± 57 μg/g, ***P < 0.001), which further verified butyrate as an active endogenous metabolite in coordination with berberine to lower the blood lipids. Additionally, the berberine metabolites (M1, , M3), as well as two isoquinoline alkaloids (tetrandrine and dauricine), could also obviously induce the production of SCFAs (butyrate, etc.) in gut . In total, we have successfully established a new derivative LC-MS/MS method for the targeted quantitative determination of seven SCFAs in biological samples.

Here we show that specific pathogen-free mice are more sensitive to influenza-mediated death than mice living in a natural environment. Priming with Toll-like receptor 2-ligand(+) Staphylococcus aureus, which commonly colonizes the upper respiratory mucosa, significantly attenuates influenza-mediated lung immune injury. Toll-like receptor 2 deficiency or alveolar macrophage depletion abolishes this protection. S. aureus priming recruits peripheral CCR2(+)CD11b(+) monocytes into the alveoli that polarize to  alveolar macrophages in an environment created by Toll-like receptor 2 signalling.  alveolar macrophages inhibit influenza-mediated lethal inflammation via anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibitory ligands.

Current biomarkers or their combinations cannot adequately predict IBD risk, diagnosis, progression or relapse, and response to therapy. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is emerging as a significant mediator of the inflammatory process. We aimed to assess levels of serum PKM2 in healthy and newly diagnosed IBD patients and its relationship with IBD indices and  changes.IBD serum samples from newly diagnosed patients were collected and analyzed using a PKM2-ELISA and correlated with disease activity scores, IBD disease type, and intestinal . Furthermore, we tested the genetic and protein expression of PKM2 in an in vitro intestinal cell model of inflammation.Serum PKM2 levels were 6-fold higher in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, with no sensitivity to disease phenotype (Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) or localization of inflammation. Serum PKM2 had considerably less interindividual variability than established IBD fecal biomarkers. A positive Pearson correlation (r=0.6121) existed between serum PKM2 and Bacteroidetes fecal levels in Crohn's disease (CD), while a negative (r=-0.6128) correlation was observed with Actinobacteria fecal levels. Furthermore, LPS (500ng/mL) significantly increased PKM2 expression in vitro, which was significantly suppressed by an anti-inflammatory flaxseed bioactive agent.Our data suggests PKM2 as a putative biomarker for IBD and the dysbiosis of microflora in CD.

Two sampling strategies were compared, sampling one site from the deepest pocket in the mouth (M1) versus a pooled sample of four sites from the deepest pockets in each quadrant (M4). The second study (2 versus 4 [2vs4]) included 20 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. The strategy M4 was compared to a pooled sample of two non-adjacent sites in the same quadrant ().

No language restrictions were applied.Randomized and quasi-randomized parallel trials that assessed the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics vs any other intervention but bariatric surgery or fecal transplantation in overweight or obese adults were selected.Three teams of 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Data were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.Nineteen randomized trials (28 publications, 1412 participants) were included. There were no differences in mean body weight change [mean difference (MD), -0.54 kg; 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) or mean BMI change (MD, -0.19 kg/; 95%CI, -0.43 to 0.04; I2 = 51%; low quality of evidence) between groups who received probiotics or synbiotics and control groups. Oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced mean waist circumference compared with control (MD, -0.82 cm; 95%CI, -1.43 to -0.21; I2 = 46%; low quality of evidence).The findings suggest that oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics has a small effect to reduce waist circumference but no effect on body weight or BMI, although the quality of evidence is low to moderate. Therefore, the current evidence is not definitive. Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice.PROSPERO registration number CRD42018075126.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, ADS-I metabolism in humans has not been investigated. In this study, we studied the biotransformation of ADS-I in human intestinal bacteria, and examined the in vitro antitumor activity of the major metabolites. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to detect ADS-I biotransformation products, and their chemical structures were identified by high performance liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance (HPLC-NMR). The antitumor activity of the major metabolites was determined by the MTT assay. Here, we show that main reaction seen in the metabolism of ADS-I in human intestinal bacteria was deglycosylation, which produced a total of four metabolites. The structures of the two major metabolites M1 and  were confirmed by using NMR. MTT assay showed that ADS-I metabolites M1 and  have the same levels of inhibitory activities as ADS-I in cultured SMMC-7721 cells and MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates deglycosylation as a primary pathway of ADS-I metabolism in human intestinal bacteria, and suggests that the pharmacological activity of ADS-I may be mediated, at least in part, by its metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28597080>Intratumoral Fusobacterium nucleatum abundance correlates with macrophage infiltration and CDKN2A methylation in microsatellite-unstable colorectal carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a specific species of gut , has been suggested to be enriched in the microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) molecular subtype of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). However, the clinicopathologic and molecular factors that interact with Fn in MSI-H CRCs are poorly understood. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene DNA sequence of Fn was quantitatively measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in tumor DNA samples from a total of 160 surgically resected MSI-H CRC tissues. Each case was classified into one of the three categories based on the Fn DNA amount: Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative. The clinicopathologic and molecular associations of Fn in MSI-H CRCs were statistically analyzed. Among the 160 MSI-H CRC samples, 15 (9%), 92 (58%), and 53 (33%) cases were Fn-high, Fn-low, and Fn-negative, respectively. Compared with Fn-low/negative tumors, Fn-high MSI-H CRCs were significantly associated with a high density of CD68+ tumor-infiltrating macrophages (P = 0.019) and promoter CpG island hypermethylation of the CDKN2A (p16) gene (P = 0.008). There were also tendencies toward associations of Fn-high with the BRAF V600E mutation (P = 0.047) and active Crohn-like lymphoid reactions (P = 0.052) in MSI-H CRCs. However, Fn-high was not significantly associated with CD3+ T cell density, CD163+  macrophage density or PD-L1 expression status. In conclusion, high amounts of intratumoral Fn are correlated with increased macrophage infiltration and CDKN2A promoter methylation in MSI-H CRCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26471282>Conditional deletion of caspase-8 in macrophages alters macrophage activation in a RIPK-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Although caspase-8 is a well-established initiator of apoptosis and suppressor of necroptosis, recent evidence suggests that this enzyme maintains functions beyond its role in cell death. As cells of the innate immune system, and in particular macrophages, are now at the forefront of autoimmune disease pathogenesis, we examined the potential involvement of caspase-8 within this population.Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice were bred via a cross between Casp8 (fl/fl) mice and Cre (LysM) mice, and RIPK3 (-/-) Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice were generated to assess the contribution of receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (RIPK)3. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were used to examine renal damage. Flow cytometric analysis was employed to characterize splenocyte distribution and activation. Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice were treated with either Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists or oral antibiotics to assess their response to TLR activation or TLR agonist removal. Luminex-based assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure cytokine/chemokine and immunoglobulin levels in serum and cytokine levels in cell culture studies. In vitro cell culture was used to assess macrophage response to cell death stimuli, TLR activation, and M1/ polarization. Data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.Loss of caspase-8 expression in macrophages promotes onset of a mild systemic inflammatory disease, which is preventable by the deletion of RIPK3. In vitro cell culture studies reveal that caspase-8-deficient macrophages are prone to a caspase-independent death in response to death receptor ligation; yet, caspase-8-deficient macrophages are not predisposed to unchecked survival, as analysis of mixed bone marrow chimeric mice demonstrates that caspase-8 deficiency does not confer preferential expansion of myeloid populations. Loss of caspase-8 in macrophages dictates the response to TLR activation, as injection of TLR ligands upregulates expression of costimulatory CD86 on the Ly6C(high)CD11b(+)F4/80(+) splenic cells, and oral antibiotic treatment to remove  prevents splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in Cre (LysM) Casp8 (fl/fl) mice. Further, caspase-8-deficient macrophages are hyperresponsive to TLR activation and exhibit aberrant M1 macrophage polarization due to RIPK activity.These data demonstrate that caspase-8 functions uniquely in macrophages by controlling the response to TLR activation and macrophage polarization in an RIPK-dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581176>Development and validation of a continuous in vitro system reproducing some biotic and abiotic factors of the veal calf intestine.</a></h2><p>Following the January 2006 European ban of antibiotics used as growth promoters in the veal calf industry, new feed additives are needed in order to maintain animal health and growth performance. As an alternative to in vivo experiments in the testing of such additives, an in vitro system modeling the intestinal ecosystem of the veal calf was developed. Stabilization of the main cultured microbial groups and their metabolic activity were tracked in an in vitro continuous fermentor operated under anaerobiosis, at pH 6.5, and at a temperature of 38.5 degrees C and supplied with one of three different nutritive media (M1, , or M3). These media mainly differed in their concentrations of simple and complex carbohydrates and in their lipid sources. In vitro microbial levels and fermentative metabolite concentrations were compared to in vivo data, and the biochemical composition of the nutritive media was compared to that of the veal calf intestinal content.

In this review we describe a coherent mechanism of action for the development of obesity, which involves the composition of gut , HFD, low-grade inflammation, expression of fat translocase and scavenger receptor CD36, and the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI). SR-BI binds to both lipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, which may promote incorporation of LPS in chylomicrons (CMs). These CMs are transported via lymph to the circulation, where LPS is transferred to other lipoproteins by translocases, preferentially to HDL. LPS increases the SR-BI binding, transcytosis of lipoproteins over the endothelial barrier,and endocytosis in adipocytes. Especially large size adipocytes with high metabolic activity absorb LPS-rich lipoproteins. In addition, macrophages in adipose tissue internalize LPS-lipoproteins. This may contribute to the polarization from  to M1 phenotype, which is a consequence of increased LPS delivery into the tissue during hypertrophy. In conclusion, evidence suggests that LPS is involved in the development of obesity as a direct targeting molecule for lipid delivery and storage in adipose tissue.© 2015 World Obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593782>"Western-Diet"-Induced Adipose Inflammation Requires a Complex Gut .</a></h2><p>Consumption of a low-fiber, high-fat, Western-style diet (WSD) induces adiposity and adipose inflammation characterized by increases in the M1: macrophage ratio and proinflammatory cytokine expression, both of which contribute to WSD-induced metabolic syndrome. WSD-induced adipose inflammation might result from endoplasmic reticulum stress in lipid-overloaded adipocytes and/or dissemination of gut bacterial products, resulting in activation of innate immune signaling. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut , and its detection by innate immune signaling pathways, in WSD-induced adipose inflammation.Mice were fed grain-based chow or a WSD for 8 weeks, assessed metabolically, and intestinal and adipose tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.  was ablated via antibiotics and use of gnotobiotic mice that completely lacked  (germ-free mice) or had a low-complexity  (altered Schaedler flora). Innate immune signaling was ablated by genetic deletion of Toll-like receptor signaling adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response 88.Ablation of  via antibiotic, germ-free, or altered Schaedler flora approaches did not significantly impact WSD-induced adiposity, yet dramatically reduced WSD-induced adipose inflammation as assessed by macrophage populations and cytokine expression.  ablation also prevented colonic neutrophil and CD103 dendritic cell infiltration. Such reduced indices of inflammation correlated with protection against WSD-induced dysglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and liver dysfunction. Genetic deletion of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 also prevented WSD-induced adipose inflammation.These results indicate that adipose inflammation, and some aspects of metabolic syndrome, are not purely a consequence of diet-induced adiposity per se but, rather, may require disturbance of intestine- interactions and subsequent activation of innate immunity.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Obesity is characterised by low-grade systemic and adipose tissue inflammation. This is suggested to be implicated in the metabolic syndrome and obesity. In the present review, we hypothesise that LPS directly and indirectly participates in the inflammatory reaction in adipose tissue during obesity. The experimental evidence shows that LPS is involved in the transition of macrophages from the  to the M1 phenotype. In addition, LPS inside adipocytes may activate caspase-4/5/11. This may induce a highly inflammatory type of programmed cell death (i.e. pyroptosis), which also occurs after infection with intracellular pathogens. Lipoproteins with or without LPS are taken up by adipocytes. Large adipocytes are more metabolically active and potentially more exposed to LPS than small adipocytes are. Thus, LPS might be involved in defining the adipocyte death size and the formation of crown-like structures. The adipocyte death size is reached when the intracellular concentration of LPS initiates pyroptosis. The mechanistic details remain to be elucidated, but the observations indicate that adipocytes are stimulated to cell death by processes that involve LPS from the gut . There is a complex interplay between the composition of the diet and . This influences the amount of LPS that is translocated from the gut. In particular, the lipid content of a meal may correlate with the amount of LPS built in to chylomicrons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11536604>Carbon metabolism of the cryptoendolithic  from the Antarctic desert.</a></h2><p>The carbon metabolism of the cryptoendolithic  of sandstones from the Ross Desert of Antarctica was studied in situ and in vitro. Organic and inorganic carbon compounds were metabolized by the , with bicarbonate incorporation into community lipids occurring primarily in the light. Light intensity affected the photometabolism of carbon with a photosynthesis-intensity response optimum at about 200 to 300 micromoles of photons per  per s. Photosynthesis was also affected by temperature, with a minimum activity at -5 degrees C, an optimum activity at 15 degrees C, and complete inhibition at 35 degrees C, indicating that the cryptoendolithic community was psychrophilic. The primary source of CO2 for photosynthesis in situ was the atmosphere. CO2 may also be photometabolized by using the carbon produced from respiration within the endolithic community. Photosynthesis occurred maximally when the  was wet with liquid water and to a lesser extent in a humid atmosphere.

According to the latest Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report (2014), the incidence of child obesity in Korea has exceeded the OECD average. To better understand and control this condition, the present study examined the composition of the gut microbial community in normal and obese adolescents. Fecal samples were collected from 67 obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/, or ≥ 99th BMI percentile) and 67 normal (BMI < 25 kg/ or < 85th BMI percentile) Korean adolescents aged 13-16 years and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Analysis of bacterial composition according to taxonomic rank (genus, family, and phylum) revealed marked differences in the Bacteroides and Prevotella populations in normal and obese samples (p < 0.005) at the genus and family levels; however, there was no difference in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio between normal and obese adolescents samples at the phylum level (F/B normal = 0.50 ± 0.53; F/B obese = 0.56 ± 0.86; p = 0.384). Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between the compositions of several bacterial taxa and child obesity. Among these, Bacteroides and Prevotella showed the most significant association with BMI (p < 0.0001 and 0.0001, respectively). We also found that the composition of Bacteroides was negatively associated with triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-crp) (p = 0.0049, 0.0023, and 0.0038, respectively) levels, whereas that of Prevotella was positively associated with TG and hs-crp levels (p = 0.0394 and 0.0150, respectively). We then applied the association rule mining algorithm to generate "rules" to identify the association between the populations of multiple bacterial taxa and obesity; these rules were able to discriminate obese from normal states.

In response to cold or exercise, brown fat cells also emerge in the white adipose tissue (WAT; also known as beige cells), a process known as browning. Here we show that the development of functional beige fat in the inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ingSAT) and perigonadal visceral adipose tissue (pgVAT) is promoted by the depletion of  either by means of antibiotic treatment or in germ-free mice. This leads to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and decreased white fat and adipocyte size in lean mice, obese leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Such metabolic improvements are mediated by eosinophil infiltration, enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling and  macrophage polarization in the subcutaneous white fat depots of -depleted animals. The metabolic phenotype and the browning of the subcutaneous fat are impaired by the suppression of type 2 cytokine signaling, and they are reversed by recolonization of the antibiotic-treated or germ-free mice with microbes.

Gut  has been widely reported to be associated with the onset of multiple diseases as well as treatment outcomes of different drugs. In this study, mucosal injury was observed in MTX-treated mice, leading to significant changes in macrophages (i.e., M1/ ratio, P < 0.05) but not in dendritic cells. Moreover, the population, diversity and principal components of the gut  in mice were dramatically altered after MTX treatment in a time-dependent manner, and Bacteroidales exhibited the most distinct variation among all the taxa (P < 0.05). Bacteroides fragilis was significantly decreased with MTX treatment (P < 0.01) and tended to decrease proportionately with increasing macrophage density. Gavage of mice with B. fragilis ameliorated MTX-induced inflammatory reactions and modulate macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our results delineate a strong impact of the gut  on MTX-induced intestinal mucositis and provide a potential method for the prevention of such ADRs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Expression levels of phenotypic gene markers of activated microglia (M1: iNOS, CD68, CD32; : Ym1, CD206, and SOCS3) in hippocampus were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Feces were collected for microbial community analysis.Rats exhibited an impairment in novel objective recognition 3 days after surgery compared with control rats (P < .01). In the hippocampus, expressions of Iba-1 and M1 markers of surgical rats were significantly upregulated. Similarly, expressions of SOCS3 and CD206 in the hippocampus were upregulated. Additionally, increasing levels of IL-6 and IL-4 were evident in the hippocampus. Administration of B-GOS significantly alleviated cognitive decline induced by surgery (P < .01). B-GOS-fed rats showed a significantly downregulated activation of microglia and expressions of M1-related genes and SOCS3 and IL-6. While there was no significant difference in expressions of CD206 and Ym1 and IL-4 between the surgical and B-GOS groups. Analysis of gut microbiome found that administration of B-GOS induced a significant change beta diversity of the gut microbiome and proliferation of Bifidobacterium and other potentially anti-inflammatory microbes.Administration of B-GOS has a beneficial effect on regulating neuroinflammatory and cognitive impairment in a rat model of abdominal surgery and was associated with the manipulation of gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804459>Metabolic Variability of a Multispecies Probiotic Preparation Impacts on the Anti-inflammatory Activity.</a></h2><p> In addition to strain taxonomy, the ability of probiotics to confer beneficial effects on the host rely on a number of additional factors including epigenetic modulation of bacterial genes leading to metabolic variability and might impact on probiotic functionality.  To investigate metabolism and functionality of two different batches of a probiotic blend commercialized under the same name in Europe in models of intestinal inflammation.  Boxes of VSL#3, a probiotic mixture used in the treatment of pouchitis, were obtained from pharmacies in UK subjected to metabolomic analysis and their functionality tested in mice rendered colitis by treatment with DSS or TNBS.  VSL#3-A (lot DM538), but not VSL#3-B (lot 507132), attenuated "clinical" signs of colitis in the DSS and TNBS models. In both models, VSL#3-A, but not VSL#3-B, reduced macroscopic scores, intestinal permeability, and expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNAs, while increased the expression of TGFβ and IL-10, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNAs and shifted colonic macrophages from a M1 to  phenotype ( < 0.05 vs. TNBS). In contrast, VSL#3-B failed to reduce inflammation, and worsened intestinal permeability in the DSS model ( < 0.001 vs. VSL#3-A). A metabolomic analysis of the two formulations allowed the identification of two specific patterns, with at least three-folds enrichment in the concentrations of four metabolites, including 1-3 dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an intermediate in the fructose metabolism, in VSL#3-B supernatants. Feeding mice with DHA, increased intestinal permeability.  Two batches of a commercially available probiotic show divergent metabolic activities. DHA, a product of probiotic metabolism, increases intestinal permeability, highlighting the complex interactions between food, , probiotics, and intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31249571> Aggravates the Progression of Colitis by Regulating M1 Macrophage Polarization via AKT2 Pathway.</a></h2><p>Disordered intestinal flora and discordant immune response are associated with the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Recent work has described the ability of macrophages to undergo repolarization toward a proinflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory  phenotype in response to particular bacterium-derived signals.

Mechanistically, our data showed that  aggravated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in the production of Th1-related cytokines IFN-γ through the AKT2 signaling pathway  and . To further confirm the disease-relevance of these shifts in macrophage repolarization in response to , stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were transferred into recipient mice with DSS colitis.

In contrast to its significant pharmacological effects in clinic, the plasma level of BBR is very low. Our previous work revealed that dihydroberberine (dhBBR) could be an absorbable form of BBR in the intestine, and butyrate is an active metabolite that is generated by gut bacteria in rats. In this study, for the first time we describe gut -regulated pharmacokinetics in beagle dogs after oral administration of BBR by single (50 mg/kg) or multiple doses (50 mg/kg/d) for 7 days. GC-MS, GC, LC-MS/MS, and LC/MS-IT-TOF were used to detect dhBBR, butyrate and BBR as well as its Phase I and II metabolites, respectively. The results showed that dhBBR was not detected in dog plasma but was excreted in small amounts in the feces of dogs examined on days 3 and 7. Butyrate was generated by gut bacteria and increased by 1.3- and 1.2-fold in plasma or feces, respectively, after 7 days of BBR treatment compared to the levels before treatment. Changes of intestinal bacterial composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA genes analysis. The results presented that dogs treated with BBR for 7 days increased both the abundance of the butyrate- and the nitroreductases- producing bacteria. We also identified chemical structures of the Phase I and II metabolites and analyzed their contents in beagle dogs. Eleven metabolites were detected in plasma and feces after BBR oral administration (50 mg/kg) to dogs, including 8 metabolites of Phase I and III metabolites of Phase II. The pharmacokinetic profile indicated that the concentration of BBR in plasma was low, with a  value of 36.88 ± 23.45 ng/mL. The relative content of glucuronic acid conjugates (M11) was higher than those of other metabolites (M1, , M12, and M14) in plasma. BBR was detected in feces, with high excreted amounts on day 3 (2625.04 ± 1726.94 μg/g) and day 7 (2793.43 ± 488.10 μg/g). In summary, this is the first study to describe gut -regulated pharmacokinetics in beagle dogs after oral administration of BBR, which is beneficial for discovery of drugs with poor absorption but good therapeutic efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30521585> control acute arterial inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia development after arterial injury.</a></h2><p>The microbiome has a functional role in a number of inflammatory processes and disease states. While neointimal hyperplasia development has been linked to inflammation, a direct role of the  in neointimal hyperplasia has not yet been established. Germ-free (GF) mice are an invaluable model for studying causative links between commensal organisms and the host. We hypothesized that GF mice would exhibit altered neointimal hyperplasia following carotid ligation compared to conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice.Twenty-week-old male C57BL/6 GF mice underwent left carotid ligation under sterile conditions. Maintenance of sterility was assessed by cultivation and 16S rRNA qPCR of stool. Neointimal hyperplasia was assessed by morphometric and histologic analysis of arterial sections after 28 days. Local arterial cell proliferation and inflammation was assessed by immunofluorescence for Ki67 and inflammatory cell markers at five days. Systemic inflammation was assessed by multiplex immunoassays of serum. CONV-R mice treated in the same manner served as the control cohort. GF and CONV-R mice were compared using standard statistical methods.All GF mice remained sterile during the entire study period. Twenty-eight days after carotid ligation, CONV-R mice had significantly more neointimal hyperplasia development compared to GF mice, as assessed by intima area, media area, intima+media area, and intima area/(intima+media) area. The collagen content of the neointimal lesions appeared qualitatively similar on Masson's trichrome staining. There was significantly reduced Ki67 immunoreactivity in the media and adventitia of GF carotid arteries 5 days after ligation. GF mice also had increased arterial infiltration of anti-inflammatory  macrophages compared to CONV-R mouse arteries and a reduced proportion of mature neutrophils. GF mice had significantly reduced serum IFN-γ-inducible protein (IP)-10 and MIP-2 5 days after carotid ligation, suggesting a reduced systemic inflammatory response.GF mice have attenuated neointimal hyperplasia development compared to CONV-R mice, which is likely related to altered kinetics of wound healing and acute inflammation. Recognizing the role of commensals in the regulation of arterial remodeling will provide a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of restenosis and support strategies to treat or reduce restenosis risk by manipulating .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378051>Short-Term Overfeeding with Dairy Cream Does Not Modify Gut Permeability, the Fecal , or Glucose Metabolism in Young Healthy Men.</a></h2><p>High-fat diets (HFDs) have been linked to low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance.The main purpose of the present study was to assess whether acute overfeeding with an HFD affects insulin sensitivity, gut barrier function, and fecal  in humans.In a prospective intervention study, 24 healthy men [mean ± SD: age 23.0 ± 2.8 y, body mass index (in kg/) 23.0 ± 2.1] received an HFD (48% of energy from fat) with an additional 1000 kcal/d (as whipping cream) above their calculated energy expenditure for 7 d. Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp), gut permeability (sugar and polyethylene glycol absorption tests, plasma zonulin), and gut  profiles (high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were assessed before and after overfeeding, and 14 d after intervention. Additionally, inflammation markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, calprotectin, regulated on activation normal, T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were measured in plasma by ELISA. Finally, lipid parameters were analyzed in serum by a laboratory service.Although participants gained 0.9 ± 0.6 kg (P < 0.001) body weight, overnutrition was not associated with a significant change in insulin sensitivity (M value and glucose disposal). Overfeeding for 7 d resulted in elevated serum total (10.2%), LDL (14.6%) and HDL (14.8%) cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.01). In contrast, fasting plasma triglyceride significantly declined (29.3%) during overfeeding (P < 0.001). In addition, there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers. Urine excretion of 4 sugars and polyethylene glycol, used as a proxy for gut permeability, and plasma concentration of zonulin, a marker of paracellular gut permeability, were unchanged. Moreover, overfeeding was not associated with consistent changes in gut  profiles, but marked alterations were observed in a subgroup of 6 individuals.Our findings suggest that short-term overfeeding with an HFD does not significantly impair insulin sensitivity and gut permeability in normal-weight healthy men, and that changes in dominant communities of fecal bacteria occur only in certain individuals.

YZG-331 was reduced by 14, 11, 6, 46, and 11% within 120 min incubation in human, monkey, dog, rat, and mouse liver microsomes (LMs), respectively. However, YZG-331 was stable in human, monkey, dog, rat, and mouse liver cytoplasm. In addition, YZG-331 was unstable in rat or mouse gut  with more than 50% of prototype drug degraded within 120 min incubation. Interestingly, the systemic exposure of  and M3 in rats and mice treated with antibiotics were significantly decreased in the pseudo germ-free group. YZG-331 could be metabolized in rat and human liver under the catalysis of CYP enzymes, and the metabolism showed species variation. In addition, 3 phase I metabolites were identified via hydroxyl (M1), hydrolysis (), or hydrolysis/ hydroxyl (M3) pathway. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1) and FMO3 participated in the conversion of YZG-331 in rat LMs. Nevertheless, YZG-331 expressed stability with recombinant human FMOs, which further confirmed the species variation in the metabolism. Overall, these studies suggested that YZG-331 is not stable in LMs and gut . CYP450 enzymes and FMOs mediated the metabolism of YZG-331, and the metabolic pathway showed species difference.

Nonetheless, a specific role of obesity and its interaction with genetics in the progression of Crohn's disease (CD) is unclear.We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with CD enrolled in Prospective Registry in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study at Massachusetts General Hospital (PRISM). Information on diagnosis of CD and its complications were collected and confirmed through review of medical records. A genetic risk score was calculated using previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms-associated genome-wide with CD susceptibility. We used logistic regression to estimate the effect of body mass index (BMI) and its interaction with genetic risk on risk of CD complications.Among 846 patients with CD, 350 required surgery, 242 with penetrating disease, 182 with stricturing disease, and 226 with perianal disease. There were no associations between obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/) and risk of perianal disease, stricturing disease, or surgery. Compared with normal-weight individuals with BMI < 25 kg/, obesity was associated with lower risk of penetrating disease (odds ratio [OR = 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.99). This association persists among a subgroup of participants with available BMI before development of penetrating disease (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.16-0.88). There were no interactions between BMI and genetic risk score on risk of CD complications (all P interaction > 0.28).Our data suggest that obesity does not negatively impact long-term progression of CD, even after accounting for genetic predisposition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532570>Characterization of a dehydratase and methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide in Lachnospiraceae.</a></h2><p>As a result of the exponential increase in genomic data, discovery of novel ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products (RiPPs) has progressed rapidly in the past decade.

However, recent analyses have deciphered a rather broad diversity of microbes in cleanrooms, whose origin as well as physiological status has not been fully understood. Here, we examined the input of intact microbial cells from a surrounding built environment into a spacecraft assembly cleanroom by applying a molecular viability assay based on propidium monoazide (PMA). The controlled cleanroom (CCR) was characterized by ~6.2*103 16S rRNA gene copies of intact bacterial cells per  floor surface, which only represented 1% of the total community that could be captured via molecular assays without viability marker. This was in contrast to the uncontrolled adjoining facility (UAF) that had 12 times more living bacteria. Regarding diversity measures retrieved from 16S rRNA Illumina-tag analyzes, we observed, however, only a minor drop in the cleanroom facility allowing the conclusion that the number but not the diversity of microbes is strongly affected by cleaning procedures. Network analyses allowed tracking a substantial input of living microbes to the cleanroom and a potential enrichment of survival specialists like bacterial spore formers and archaeal halophiles and mesophiles. Moreover, the cleanroom harbored a unique community including 11 exclusive genera, e.g., Haloferax and Sporosarcina, which are herein suggested as indicators of cleanroom environments. In sum, our findings provide evidence that archaea are alive in cleanrooms and that cleaning efforts and cleanroom maintenance substantially decrease the number but not the diversity of indoor microbiomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313735>Spatial uniformity of microbial diversity in a continuous bioelectrochemical system.</a></h2><p>Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are emerging as a technology with diverse future applications. Anode-associated microbial diversity and activity are known to change over time, but the consequences of these dynamics on BES functioning are poorly understood. A novel BES with exchangeable anodic electrodes that facilitates characterisation of microbial communities over time was constructed. The BES, received a mixture of volatile fatty acids and produced 0.13 mA cm(-2) of anodic electrode surface, leading to the removal of 14 g chemical oxygen demand per  electrode per day at a coulombic efficiency of 76%. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed no differences in the diversity of microbial communities associated with different electrodes within a single time point. This finding validates the design for temporal studies as changes in microbial diversity observed over time can be related to community development rather than spatial variation within the reactor.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Whether prebiotics can reduce intestinal generation of these microbial metabolites and improve insulin resistance in CKD patients not yet on dialysis remains unknown. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study in 40 patients with eGFR between 15 and 45 ml/min/1.73 . Patients were randomized to sequential treatment with prebiotic arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) (10 g twice daily) and maltodextrin for 4 weeks, or vice versa, with a 4-week wash-out period between both intervention periods. Serum levels and 24h urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate, p-cresyl glucuronide, indoxyl sulfate, trimethylamine N-oxide and phenylacetylglutamine were determined at each time point using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR). A total of 39 patients completed the study. We observed no significant effect of AXOS on serum p-cresyl sulfate (P 0.42), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.59), indoxyl sulfate (P 0.70) and phenylacetylglutamine (P 0.41) and a small, albeit significant decreasing effect on serum trimethylamine N-oxide (P 0.04). There were neither effect of AXOS on 24h urinary excretion of p-cresyl sulfate (P 0.31), p-cresyl glucuronide (P 0.23), indoxyl sulfate (P 0.87) and phenylacetylglutamine (P 0.43), nor on 24h urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (P 0.97). In addition, we observed no significant change in HOMA-IR (P 0.93). In conclusion, we could not demonstrate an influence of prebiotic AXOS on  derived uremic retention solutes and insulin resistance in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis.

We report that gut dysbiosis induced by antibiotic (Abx) treatment promotes allergic airway inflammation by shifting macrophage polarization in the lung toward the alternatively activated  phenotype. Adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages derived from Abx-treated mice was sufficient to increase allergic airway inflammation. Abx treatment resulted in the overgrowth of a commensal fungal Candida species in the gut and increased plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), which induced  macrophage polarization in the lung. Suppression of PGE₂ synthesis by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors aspirin and celecoxib suppressed  macrophage polarization and decreased allergic airway inflammatory cell infiltration in Abx-treated mice. Thus, Abx treatment can cause overgrowth of particular fungal species in the gut and promote  macrophage activation at distant sites to influence systemic responses including allergic inflammation.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Animal models point to sex hormone-related differentials in microbiome composition. In this study, we investigated the relationship of sex, body mass index (BMI) and dietary fiber intake with the gut microbiome in 82 humans. We sequenced fecal 16S rRNA genes by 454 FLX technology, then clustered and classified the reads to microbial genomes using the QIIME pipeline. Relationships of sex, BMI, and fiber intake with overall gut microbiome composition and specific taxon abundances were assessed by permutational MANOVA and multivariate logistic regression, respectively. We found that sex was associated with the gut microbiome composition overall (p=0.001). The gut microbiome in women was characterized by a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (p=0.03). BMI (>25 kg/ vs. <25 kg/) was associated with the gut microbiome composition overall (p=0.05), and this relationship was strong in women (p=0.03) but not in men (p=0.29). Fiber from beans and from fruits and vegetables were associated, respectively, with greater abundance of Actinobacteria (p=0.006 and false discovery rate adjusted q=0.05) and Clostridia (p=0.009 and false discovery rate adjusted q=0.09).

PICOS criteria defined the research question for the systematic review. A systematic keyword search in PubMed and EMBASE identified 25 studies: 9 assessed prebiotic, 11 assessed probiotic, and 7 assessed symbiotic therapies for a total of 1309 patients.Basic population characteristics, the primary variables of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (utilized for NAFLD diagnosis), and the secondary variables of body mass index (BMI), gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglyceridges (TAG) were extracted. Pooled effect sizes of these variables were calculated by meta-analysis.

The aim of this work is to verify the anti-inflammatory effects of a probiotic formulation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Bifidobacterium longum (Serobioma).To mimic the natural host compartmentalization between probiotics and immune cells through the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro, the transwell model was used. We focused on a particular subset of immune cells that play a key role in the mucosal immune system. The immunomodulatory effects of probiotic formulation were investigated in the human macrophage cell line THP1 and macrophages derived from ex vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Probiotic formulation induced a significant increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) production and was able to decrease the secretion of the major proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 by 70% and 80%, respectively. Finally, for the first time, the ability of probiotic formulation to favor the macrophage  phenotype has been identified.The transwell model is an intriguing toll approach to studying the human epithelial barrier.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As an important regulator of intestinal microenvironment, gut  plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, a metastasis-related secretory protein cathepsin K (CTSK) was identified as a vital mediator between the imbalance of intestinal  and CRC metastasis. We implanted MC38 cells into the cecal mesentry of antibiotic-treated mice with intragastrically administration of E. coli to mimic gut  imbalance. The bigger primary tumors and more liver metastatic foci were detected in the E. coli group accompanied with high LPS secretion and CTSK overexpression compared with that in the control group. CTSK contributes to the aggressive phenotype of CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing CTSK or administration of Odanacatib, a CTSK-specific inhibitor, totally abolished the CTSK-enhanced migration and motility of CRC cells. Interestingly, the tumor-secreted CTSK could bind to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to stimulate the  polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via an mTOR-dependent pathway. Recombinant CTSK could neither stimulate CRC growth and metastasis, nor induce  macrophage polarization in TRL4 mice. Meanwhile, CTSK could stimulate the secretion of cytokines by  TAMs including IL10 and IL17, which, in turn, promote the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells through NFκB pathway. Clinically, overexpression of CTSK in human CRC tissues is always accompanied with high  TAMs in the stroma, and correlated with CRC metastasis and poor prognosis. Our current research identified CTSK as a mediator between the imbalance of gut  and CRC metastasis. More importantly, we illustrated a CTSK-mediated-positive feedback loop between CRC cells and TAMs during metastasis, prompting CTSK as a novel predictive biomarker and feasible therapeutic target for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24463398>Ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry for determination of avicularin metabolites produced by a human intestinal bacterium.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria from human were screened to isolate the specific bacteria involved in the metabolism of avicularin. A Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, strain 46, capable of metabolizing avicularin (quercetin-3-O-arabinoside) was isolated for the first time. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 99% similarity with that of Bacillus. Then strain 46 was identified as a species of the genus Bacillus, and was named to be Bacillus sp. 46. Additionally, the metabolites were analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) technique combined with Metabolynx™ software. The structure of these metabolites were proposed and confirmed by comparing the UPLC retention time and MS/MS spectrum with that of authentic standards. Parent compound and six metabolites were detected in the isolated bacterial samples compared with blank samples. Avicularin (M1) was anaerobic metabolized to its aglycone quercetin () and methoxylated avicularin (M3, M4), then quercetin was converted to quercetin glycosides: quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (M5), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (M6) and quercetin-7-O-glucoside (M7) by Bacillus sp. 46. The metabolic pathway and metabolites of avicularin by the intestinal bacterium Bacillus sp. 46 were reported for the first time.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Positive energy balance, e.g. surplus energy intake over expenditure, is at the core for developing metabolic syndrome and T2D. Currently available glycemic control drugs come to the market based on their 1-2 years risk-benefit profiles, but most of them do not correct positive energy balance and lose efficacy in the long-term. This denouement is destined by a positive energy balance of T2D. There is continuous endeavor/investment in new drugs for T2D. In this review, we compared the effects of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents on energy balance and discussed several novel therapeutic targets/approaches for T2D that could potentially correct positive energy balance: changing the composition of intestinal host- to alleviate excess caloric consumption, controlling chylomicron uptake into intestinal lacteals to reduce excessive caloric intake, and activating pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) to ameliorate glucose metabolism and increase energy expenditure. We further reviewed how nicotine affects body weight and ameliorates positive energy balance, and ways to encourage people to adopt a more healthy lifestyle by exercising more and/or decreasing caloric intake. These potential targets/approaches may hopefully correct positive energy balance, delay disease progression, reverse some pathophysiological changes, and eventually prevent and/or cure the disease. Drug development strategies applying new insights into T2D process and therapeutic index to correct positive energy balance need to be seriously considered.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107222>Comprehensive characterization of the in vitro and in vivo metabolites of limonin in human samples using LC-Q-TOF/MS.</a></h2><p>Limonin is a bitter triterpenoid dilactone in the genus Citrus with potential medicinal value.

We explored the effect of the habitual diet and adherence to the dietary reference values on gut  composition and diversity. Further, the association of gut  with serum lipidomics and low-grade inflammation was evaluated. Overweight and obese women (BMI 30·7 (sd 4·4) kg/, n 100) were studied at early pregnancy (≤17 weeks). Intakes of nutrients were calculated from 3-d food diaries. Faecal  composition was analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fasting serum lipidomic profiles were determined by NMR. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, glycoprotein acetylation (GlycA) and lipopolysaccharide activity were used as markers for low-grade inflammation. The recommended dietary intake of fibre and fat was related to higher gut  richness and lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae. Correlations were observed between gut  richness and GlycA and between a few  genera and serum lipoprotein particles. As a conclusion, adherence to the dietary reference intake of fat and fibre was associated with beneficial gut  composition, which again contributed to lipidomic profile. Higher gut  richness and nutrient intakes were linked to a lower level of low-grade inflammation marker GlycA.

Its major constituent kakkalide is metabolized to irisolidone by gut . This research study was undertaken to understand the anti-colitis mechanism of kakkalide and irisolidone in vitro and in vivo. Kakkalide and its metabolite irisolidone inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression in macrophages. They also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of IRAK1 and TAK1 and activation of NF-κB by inhibiting the binding of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated LPS in vitro. Orally administered irisolidone or kakkalide alleviated colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Their treatments also protected epithelial cell disruption and infiltration of CD11b/CD11c cells in the colon. Furthermore, they suppressed TNBS-induced expression of M1 macrophage markers TNF-α, CD80, CD86, and Arg2 expression while the expression of  macrophage markers Arg1, CD163, CD206, and IL-10 was induced. They also suppressed the fecal Proteobacteria population. Overall, the anti-colitic effects of irisolidone were superior to those of kakkalide.

Given the emerging evidence on immune- interactions in CRC, we also sought to examine the interaction between macrophages and gut . To induce CRC, male C57BL/6 mice ( n = 32) received a single injection of azoxymethane (AOM), followed by three cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-supplemented water in weeks 1, 4, and 7. Prior to the final DSS cycle ( week 7) and twice weekly until euthanasia, mice ( n = 16/group) received either 200 μl ip of clodronate-filled liposomes (CLD) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) encapsulated liposomes to deplete macrophages. Colon tissue was analyzed for polyp burden, macrophage markers, transcription factors, and inflammatory mediators. Stool samples were collected, and DNA was isolated and subsequently sequenced for 16S rRNA. Clodronate liposomes decreased tumor number by ∼36% and specifically large (≥1 mm) tumors by ∼36% ( P < 0.05). This was consistent with a decrease in gene expression of EMR1 in the colon tissue and polyp tissue as well as expression of select markers associated with M1 (IL-6) and  macrophages (IL-13, IL-10, TGFβ, CCL17) in the colon tissue ( P < 0.05). Similarly, there was a decrease in STAT3 and p38 MAPK and ERK signaling in colon tissue. Clodronate liposomes increased the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum ( P < 0.05) and specifically Lactobacillaceae and Clostridiaceae families, which have been associated with reduced CRC risk. Overall, these data support the development of therapeutic strategies to target macrophages in CRC and provide support for further evaluation of immune- interactions in CRC. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that macrophage depletion during late-stage tumorigenesis is effective at reducing tumor growth. This was associated with a decrease in macrophage markers and chemokines in the colon tissue and a decrease in transcription factors that are linked to colorectal cancer. The macrophage-depleted group was found to have an increased abundance of Firmicutes, a phylum with documented anti-tumorigenic effects.

Next to progressive airway disease, CF is also associated with intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, has improved pulmonary and nutritional status but its effects on the intestinal  and inflammation are unclear. Hence, we assessed the changes on the intestinal microbial communities (16S rRNA variable 3 gene region) and inflammatory markers (calprotectin and -pyruvate kinase [-PK]) in 16 CF individuals (8 children and 8 adults) before and after (median 6.1 months) ivacaftor. Stool calprotectin significantly decreased following ivacaftor (median [IQR]: 154.4 [102.1-284.2] vs. 87.5 [19.5-190.2] mg/kg, P = 0.03). There was a significant increase in Akkermansia with ivacaftor. Increased abundance of Akkermansia was associated with normal stool -PK concentrations, and decreased abundances of Enterobacteriaceae correlated with decreased stool calprotectin concentrations. In summary, changes in the gut microbiome and decrease in intestinal inflammation was associated with Ivacaftor treatment among individuals with CF carrying at least one gating CFTR mutation. Thus, CFTR-modifying therapy may adequately improve the aberrant pathophysiology and milieu of the CF gut to favor a more healthy , which in turn reduces intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622429>Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Immunometabolism: New Frontiers for Treatment of Metabolic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Maintenance of healthy human metabolism depends on a symbiotic consortium among bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and host eukaryotic cells throughout the human gastrointestinal tract. Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the metabolic pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the metabolic processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen. M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites. It is now known that the gut -derived products induce low-grade inflammatory activation of tissue-resident macrophages and contribute to metabolic and degenerative diseases, including diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. Here, we update the potential interplay of host gut microbiome dysbiosis and metabolic diseases. We also summarize on advances on fecal therapy, probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and nutrients and small molecule inhibitors of metabolic pathway enzymes as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833897>Glabridin Prevents Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity Through Gut  Modulation and Colonic Macrophage Polarization in Mice.</a></h2><p>The chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) provokes a dose-related cardiotoxicity. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrated that glabridin (GLA), an isoflavone from licorice root, prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut  modulation and colonic macrophage polarization in mice. GLA reduced DOX-induced leakage of myocardial enzymes including aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase-MB. GLA downregulated pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cleaved-caspase 9 and cleaved-caspase 3) and upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins (HAX-1 and Bcl-2) in the cardiac tissues. In addition, GLA modulated DOX-induced dysbiosis of gut  and thereby decreased the ratio of M1/ colonic macrophage, accompanied by the downregulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and upregulated butyrate in the feces and peripheral blood. The leakage of myocardial enzymes induced by the DOX was decreased by antibiotics treatment, but not altered by co-treatment with the GLA and antibiotics. The ratio of M1/ colonic macrophage and leakage of myocardial enzymes reduced by the GLA were greatly increased by the  or LPS but decreased by the butyrate. Depletion of the macrophage attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity but failed to further affect the effects of GLA. Importantly, GLA decreased production of M1 cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) but increased production of  cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the colonic macrophage with the downregulation of NF-κB and the upregulation of STAT6. In summary, GLA prevents DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through gut  modulation and colonic macrophage polarization, and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29120476>Linking iron-deficiency with allergy: role of molecular allergens and the microbiome.</a></h2><p>Atopic individuals tend to develop a Th2 dominant immune response, resulting in hyperresponsiveness to harmless antigens, termed allergens. In the last decade, epidemiological studies have emerged that connected allergy with a deficient iron-status. Immune activation under iron-deficient conditions results in the expansion of Th2-, but not Th1 cells, can induce class-switching in B-cells and hampers the proper activation of , but not M1 macrophages. Moreover, many allergens, in particular with the lipocalin and lipocalin-like folds, seem to be capable of binding iron indirectly via siderophores harboring catechol moieties. The resulting locally restricted iron-deficiency may then lead during immune activation to the generation of Th2-cells and thus prepare for allergic sensitization. Moreover, iron-chelators seem to also influence clinical reactivity: mast cells accumulate iron before degranulation and seem to respond differently depending on the type of the encountered siderophore. Whereas deferoxamine triggers degranulation of connective tissue-type mast cells, catechol-based siderophores reduce activation and degranulation and improve clinical symptoms. Considering the complex interplay of iron, siderophores and immune molecules, it remains to be determined whether iron-deficiencies are the cause or the result of allergy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451811>Sodium butyrate-modified sulfonated polyetheretherketone modulates macrophage behavior and shows enhanced antibacterial and osteogenic functions during implant-associated infections.</a></h2><p>Prevention of implant-associated infections and insufficient bone tissue integration is critical to exploit the immunomodulatory properties and antibacterial effects of implant materials, which have attracted considerable attention. Modulation of the functions of immune cells in different environments is crucial for managing infection and inferior bone integration via immunomodulation. In this work, sodium butyrate, a fermentation product of gut , was loaded onto 3D porous sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SP) to modulate the immune responses of cells in different environments. Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial effects showed that sodium butyrate-loaded SP exhibited superior antibacterial activity, especially in the samples containing high concentrations of sodium butyrate. Under bacterial stimulation, the phagocytic activity of macrophages increased with an increase in the sodium butyrate concentration via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which favoured bactericidal activity in the implant-associated infection stage. For bacterial elimination, sodium butyrate-containing SP could polarize macrophages to the  phenotype and subsequently stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion, which is considered beneficial for bone regeneration in the tissue repair stage. In vitro osteogenesis was evaluated and the results demonstrated that treatment with sodium butyrate-containing SP increased the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins. An in vivo rat osteomyelitis model was used to evaluate the protective effect of the SP-loaded with sodium butyrate on bone destruction and osteolysis under infection conditions. To study osteogenesis in vivo, a rat femoral model without infection was used. The results indicated that the SP-B2 group exhibited superior anti-infection capacity and induced new bone formation around the implant in vivo. Treatment with sodium butyrate-containing porous SP modulated the macrophage response under different stimuli, thereby serving as a new approach for the design of smart implant materials with superior antibacterial and bone repair properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636639> Suppresses the Production of Proinflammatory Cytokines in -Infected Macrophages by Inhibiting the Expression of ADAM17.</a></h2><p>The ability of  to evade the host immune system allows the bacterium to colonize the host for a lifetime.

We found that  Kx110A1 (L. gas), a strain isolated from a human stomach, but not other tested  species, blocked the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in -infected macrophages. Interestingly, L. gas also inhibited the release of these cytokines in LPS or LTA stimulated macrophages, demonstrating a general anti-inflammatory property. The inhibition of these cytokines did not occur through the polarization of macrophages from the M1 (proinflammatory) to  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype or through the altered viability of  or host cells. Instead, we show that L. gas suppressed the release of TNF and IL-6 by reducing the expression of ADAM17 (also known as TNF-alpha-converting enzyme, TACE) on host cells. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which L. gas prevents the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 in host macrophages.Copyright © 2019 Gebremariam, Qazi, Somiah, Pathak, Sjölinder, Sverremark Ekström and Jonsson.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362639>Mixture of Two Lactobacillus plantarum Strains Modulates the Gut  Structure and Regulatory T Cell Response in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>The gut  has been linked to diet-induced obesity, and microorganisms that influence obesity have important health implications.

However, most pure microorganisms can degrade only limited species of NP with low degradation efficiencies. To establish a microbial consortium that can effectively degrade different forms of NP, in this study, we isolated a facultative microbial consortium NP- and characterized the biodegradation of NP by it. NP- could degrade 75.61% and 89.75% of 1000 mg/L NP within 48 h and 8 days, respectively; an efficiency higher than that of any other consortium or pure microorganism reported so far. The addition of yeast extract promoted the biodegradation more significantly than that of glucose. Moreover, surface-active compounds secreted into the extracellular environment were hypothesized to promote high-efficiency metabolism of NP. The detoxification of NP by this consortium was determined. The degradation pathway was hypothesized to be initiated by oxidization of the benzene ring, followed by step-wise side-chain biodegradation. The bacterial composition of NP- was determined using 16S rDNA library, and the consortium was found to mainly comprise members of the Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Alicycliphilus, and Acidovorax genera, with the former two accounting for 86.86% of the consortium. The high degradation efficiency of NP- indicated that it could be a promising candidate for NP bioremediation in situ.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

BAT contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis in a cold environment; WAT stores energy and produces adipokines that fine-tune metabolic and inflammatory responses. Obesity is often characterized by over-expansion and inflammation of WAT where inflammatory cells/mediators are abundant, especially pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation and leading to insulin resistance and metabolic complications. Macrophages constitute the major component of innate immunity and can be activated as a M1 or  (anti-inflammatory) phenotype in response to environmental stimuli. Polarized M1 macrophage causes AT inflammation, whereas polarized  macrophage promotes WAT remodeling into the BAT phenotype, also known as WAT browning/beiging, which enhances insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This review will discuss the regulation of AT homeostasis in relation to innate immunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564717>Intestinal autophagy links psychosocial stress with gut  to promote inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Psychosocial stress is a critical inducing factor of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), while autophagy is a novel central issue of IBD development. The present study investigated the potential role of autophagy in stress-related IBD in patients and animal model. The correlation between psychosocial stress and intestinal autophagy was determined in 23 patients with IBD. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a well-established inducer of psychosocial stress, was administrated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). In IBD patients, the autophagy markers beclin-1, LC3-II/I ratio, Atg16L1, and Atg4B were significantly enhanced. The psychosocial stress score was positively associated with the levels of beclin-1 and the LC3II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens. In IBD mouse model, CRH significantly aggravated intestinal inflammation, increased Paneth cell metaplasia, and enhanced intestinal autophagy (beclin-1, Atg16L1, PIK3R4, and Atg4B upregulation; GAA, CTSD, and PPKAA1 downregulation). Additionally, the CRH-induced gut microbial dysbiosis was evidenced by a marked increase in the number of detrimental bacteria. In LPS-stimulated BMDM, CRH substantially increased M1/ polarization and thus promoted inflammation. In both IBD mice and LPS-treated BMDM, blockade of autophagy by chloroquine abrogated the unbeneficial effects of CRH, whereas autophagy inducer rapamycin resulted in a pronounced protective effect against IBD lesion. Our data demonstrate that psychosocial stress may link the enhanced intestinal autophagy by modulating gut  and inflammation to aggravate IBD. These data indicate autophagy as a promising therapeutic target for psychosocial stress-related IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860408>Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 positive macrophages and HO-1 up-regulation in intestinal muscularis resident macrophages.</a></h2><p>Small intestinal muscularis externa macrophages have been associated with interstitial cells of Cajal. They have been proposed to play various roles in motility disorders and to take part in a -driven regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Our objective was to understand the reaction of resident macrophages of the musculature to a pro-inflammatory stimulator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice were injected with LPS or saline and sacrificed after 6 hr. Whole mounts were stained with antibodies toward CD169, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (iba1) (microglial/macrophage marker) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Cell densities were measured using unbiased stereology.iba1 cells showed an overall higher density than CD169 and HO-1 cells. Most HO-1 and iba1 cells were positive for CD 169 in serosa and at Auerbach's plexus (AP). At the deep muscular plexus, mainly iba1 cells were present, and were mostly CD169 ; a few HO-1 cells were present.A new subset of resident macrophages in the intestinal muscularis externa was discovered, identified as iba1 CD169 . HO-1 is constitutively present in most macrophages in serosa and at AP, suggesting a  phenotype. LPS-treatment results in an up-regulation of HO-1 /CD169 cells in serosa and at AP.

Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis. Deoxycholic acid (DCA), a secondary bile acid increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal  and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal  was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier, gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal  from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited  phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal  transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover,  depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23852993>Identification of the metabolites of anti-inflammatory compound clematichinenoside AR in rat intestinal microflora.</a></h2><p>Clematichinenoside AR (C-AR), a pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin with anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatoid activities, is the main active component of the traditional Chinese medicine Clematidis Radix et Rhizoma. However, its poor oral absorption indicated that not only the parent compound C-AR itself, but also its metabolites could be responsible for the pharmacological effects in rats. The present study aimed to investigate the metabolism of C-AR in rat intestinal microflora, where C-AR was extensively metabolized. C-AR was incubated with the content of the large intestine. The culture solution was collected at different time points and analyzed for the metabolites of C-AR. Eight metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. M1,  and M5 were the major metabolites. In addition, it was proposed that deglycosylation was the only pathway contributing to the biotransformation of C-AR in rat intestinal microflora.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636955>[Obesity and cancer].</a></h2><p>The incidence of obesity in the western world has increased dramatically during recent decades. Epidemiological data suggest that obesity is associated with an increased risk of several but not all types of cancers, with clear sex-specific differences. The underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. This review focuses on the potential factors linking obesity to cancer. Current experimental evidence suggests that insulin resistance and a chronic, subclinical inflammation in the visceral fat are the major metabolic events causing alterations in the levels of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and 2, adipose tissue-derived proinflammatory cytokines and other bioactive molecules, such as adipokines (e.g. leptin and adiponectin), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), sex hormones, gut  and secondary bile acids. All these factors may act directly or indirectly on the tumor microenvironment to drive tumor progression via stimulation of cell survival/antiapoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion/metastasis of the cancer cells. Therapeutic strategies that target dysfunctional or inflamed fat and have been shown to benefit patients include bariatric surgery, while other cell or hormone-directed interventions, such as conversion of visceral fat macrophages to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype or the pharmacological modulation of serum adipokine levels are still theoretical and need to be clinically evaluated for their ability to successfully treat or prevent obesity-related cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16761604>Fate of nitrogen in riparian forest soils and trees: an 15N tracer study simulating salmon decay.</a></h2><p>We introduced an 15N-NH4+ tracer to the riparian forest of a salmon-bearing stream (Kennedy Creek, Washington, USA) to quantify the cycling and fate of a late-season pulse of salmon N and, ultimately, mechanisms regulating potential links between salmon abundance and tree growth. The 15N tracer simulated deposition of 7.25 kg of salmon (fresh) to four 50- plots. We added NH4+ (the initial product of salmon carcass decay) and other important nutrients provided by carcasses (P, S, K, Mg, Ca) to soils in late October 2003, coincident with local salmon spawning. We followed the 15N tracer through soil and tree pools for one year. Biological uptake of the 15N tracer occurred quickly: 64% of the 15N tracer was bound in soil  within 14 days, and roots of the dominant riparian tree, western red cedar (Thuja plicata), began to take up 15N tracer within seven days. Root uptake continued through the winter. The 15N tracer content of soil organic matter reached a maximum of approximately 52%, five weeks after the application, and a relative equilibrium of approximately 40% within five months. Six months after the addition, in spring 2004, at least 37% of the 15N tracer was found in tree tissues: approximately 23% in foliage, approximately 11% in roots, and approximately 3% in stems. Within the stems, xylem and phloem sap contained approximately 96% of the tracer N, and approximately 4% was in structural xylem N. After one year, at least 28% of the 15N tracer was still found in trees, and loss from the plots was only approximately 20%. The large portion of tracer N taken up in the fall and reallocated to leaves and stems the following spring provides mechanistic evidence for a one-year-lagged tree-growth response to salmon nutrients. Salmon nutrients have been deposited in the Kennedy Creek system each fall for centuries, but the system shows no evidence of nutrient saturation. Rates of N uptake and retention are a function of site history and disturbance and also may be the result of a legacy effect, in which annual salmon nutrient addition may lead to increased efficiency of nutrient uptake and use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162597>Glucose- and Lipid-Related Biomarkers Are Affected in Healthy Obese or Hyperglycemic Adults Consuming a Whole-Grain Pasta Enriched in Prebiotics and Probiotics: A 12-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Synbiotic foods, which combine the action of prebiotics and probiotics along the gastrointestinal tract, can affect inflammatory and glucose-related markers.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects on inflammatory and glycemia-related markers of a whole-grain pasta containing barley β-glucans and Bacillus coagulans BC30, 6086 in healthy overweight or obese volunteers.A single-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary intervention study was carried out. Forty-one healthy sedentary overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25-29.9 kg/) and obese (BMI ≥30) volunteers, aged 30-65 y and low consumers of fruit and vegetables, ate 1 serving/d of whole-grain control (CTR) or innovative (INN) pasta for 12 wk and maintained their habitual diets. Biological samples were collected at baseline and every 4 wk for primary (plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP] and fasting plasma lipid profile) and secondary outcomes (glycemia-related markers, blood pressure, fecal  composition, and body weight). Between (CTR compared with INN) and within (among weeks) group differences were tested for the whole population and for subgroups stratified by baseline values of BMI (≥30) and glycemia (≥100 mg/dL).INN or CTR pasta consumption had no effect on primary and secondary outcomes over time, except for a significant increase in plasma γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) after 12 wk of CTR pasta consumption. Comparisons between intervention groups revealed differences only at 12 wk: plasma GGT was higher in the CTR group; plasma hs-CRP, plasma LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, and Bifidobacterium spp. were lower in the INN subgroup of obese volunteers; plasma resistin was lower and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance was higher in the INN subgroup of hyperglycemic volunteers.A daily serving of a synbiotic whole-grain pasta had limited effects on primary and secondary outcomes in the entire group of volunteers but affected glycemia- and lipid-related markers and resistin in a subgroup of healthy obese or hyperglycemic volunteers.

Interleukin-25 (IL-25) promotes type 2 immunity via alternative activation of macrophages, and is closely associated with inflammation-related diseases, even malignancies. However, it is not clear which role IL-25 plays in the development of HCC, and whether gut  are involved.IL-25 was detected by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines were measured by RT-qPCR and WB. After co-culture with IL-25-stimulated macrophages, the cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT marker of HCC cell lines (MHCC97L and HepG2) were evaluated by Brdu proliferation, Transwell assays and WB. An antibody neutralization assay of chemokine CXCL10 was performed to confirm its role in HCC development. Furthermore, the effects of IL-25 in HCC were investigated in vivo. Dysbiosis of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and  percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut  dysbiosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27354183>A preliminary insight of correlation between human fecal microbial diversity and blood lipid profile.</a></h2><p>The study aimed to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and yeast on cholesterol levels.

Using a culturing system which mimics farm soils, nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emission potentials of the soils or soil microorganisms were investigated. A total of thirty-three soil samples from the farmland showed high N(2)O production potential, of which the maximum level of N(2)O emission was 3.69 μg per ml of the cultured medium per day (ml(-1) d(-1)) in the assay system. However, only three eubacteria (Leptothrix sp., Paenibacillus sp., and Streptomyces sp.) were isolated as culturable N(2)O emitters among a total of 92 bacterial isolates and 2 fungi obtained from the assayed soil suspensions. N(2)O production from all the isolated N(2)O emitters was more active within a weakly acidic region (pH 4.5-5.0) than neutral regions. However, unlike N(2)O emitters isolated from tropical peat soils, they did not respond to supplemental 0.5% sucrose. In the acetylene inhibition assay for the evaluation of complete denitrification, Leptothrix sp. P3-15D and Streptomyces sp. -0C indicated that these culturable N(2)O emitters are not effective denitrifiers but weak N(2)O emitters in the Andisol. Conversely, Rhodococcus sp. that was isolated from the Andisol collected in another season using a KNO(3)-enriched plate, showed 3.2-fold higher N(2)O emission with 10% C(2) H(2). Instead of the culturable bacteria, it is probable that the N(2)O emitters in viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state or obligately anaerobic denitrifiers are the major contributors to N(2)O emission from the vitric Andisol.Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the mechanisms by which commensal bacteria in regulating the alveolar macrophages remain unclear. Here, by using an antibiotic-treated (Abt) mouse model, we found commensal bacteria depletion induced lower frequencies and numbers of alveolar macrophages. This effect was accompanied by the altered levels of genes involved in several biological pathways, including  macrophage polarization, as determined by gene expression analysis. Alveolar macrophages from the Abt mice had higher protein and gene levels of Arg1, CCL24, IL-13, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-1β, which could be recovered to normal levels by reconstructing commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory of Abt mice. Moreover, alveolar macrophages performed significant enhancement of  functions, especially CCL24 secretion, in the Abt mice challenged with B16/F10 melanoma. Adoptive transfer of normal alveolar macrophages or antibody neutralization of CCL24 significantly recovered the decrease of γδT17 cells and rescued the defect anti-tumor response of Abt mice, indicating the elevated amount of alveolar macrophage-derived CCL24 inhibited γδT cell mediated anti-tumor response. In conclusion, we demonstrated the ability of commensal bacteria to maintain alveolar macrophages with a low level of CCL24 production, which was necessary for the normal anti-tumor response in the lung.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277587>Dietary Nondigestible Polysaccharides Ameliorate Colitis by Improving Gut  and CD4 Differentiation, as Well as Facilitating  Macrophage Polarization.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of a specific multifiber mix diet (MF) designed to match the fiber content of a healthy diet in interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 ) mice with spontaneous chronic colitis displaying similar characteristics to those of human Crohn's disease (CD).Sixteen-week-old IL-10 mice were used for the experiments with MF diet for 4 weeks.

However, the mechanisms linking immunity to metabolic disease remain to be fully elucidated. It has previously been suggested that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) may be involved in the progression of numerous types of metabolic diseases as these cells act as suppressors and promoters for obesity and associated conditions, and are particularly involved in adipose tissue inflammation, which is a major feature of metabolic imbalance. Group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) have been revealed as anti‑obese immune regulators by secreting anti‑inflammatory cytokines and promoting the polarization of  macrophages, whereas group 1 ILCs (ILC1s), including natural killer cells, may promote adipose tissue inflammation via production of interferon‑γ, which in turn polarizes macrophages toward the M1 type. The majority of studies to date have demonstrated the pathological association between ILCs and obesity in the context of adipose tissue inflammation, whereas the roles of ILCs in other organs which participate in obesity development have not been fully characterized. Therefore, identifying the roles of all types of ILCs as central components mediating obesity‑associated inflammation, is of primary concern, and may lead to the discovery of novel preventative and therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531665>[Surgical treatment of obesity from the nutritional point - opportunities and dangers].</a></h2><p>Obesity is a civilization disease, which occurrence in the world population is gradually increasing. The basic causes of obesity include a sedentary lifestyle and energy-rich diet contributing to a positive energy balance. Methods of curing obesity contain the lifestyle modification, the pharmacological treatment and the surgical treatment. The bariatric surgery is a therapy that can be used among patients with BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 kg/ with comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, for whom previous treatment has been ineffective. The surgical treatment includes restrictive, limiting absorption and hybrid methods among them the most frequently performed sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Surgical treatment affects the clinical course of many chronic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus type 2. Unfortunately, this method of treatment is related to complications and is associated with increased risk of many complications, nutritional deficiencies, as well as deterioration of mental health. The potential causes of psychiatric disorders following bariatric surgery include dysbiosis and brain - gut axis dysfunction. After surgery, a dysbiosis is noticed (a reduction of Bifidobacterium spp.) that may increase the risk of depressive disorders occurrence. For this reason, to effective obesity treatment, patients undergoing bariatric surgery should be covered by the longterm care of an interdisciplinary team.© 2018 MEDPRESS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25639037>Autecology of microorganisms of typical Ecuador biotopes.</a></h2><p>34 strains of aerobic chemoorganotrophic microorganisms were isolated from 23 soil and plant samples selected from highland biotopes of Ecuador-Andes massif (Papallacta, 4020 m), ash at the foot of the volcano Tungurahua, mountainous jungle (La Favorita, 1600 m), as well as in humid tropic botanical garden (state Puyo, 950 m).

Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on obesity and gut  in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing -polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases obesity through modulating gut .The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced obesity and gut  composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To discern the mechanism, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), caused abnormal intestinal reparative responses to mucosal injury through differences in intestinal  and the presence of naïve immune cells. To identify such mechanisms, gut microbes and naïve immune cells were compared between rat pups born to dams fed either n-6 PUFA, n-3 PUFA or breeder chow. Maternal exposure to either of the PUFA rich diets altered the development of the intestinal  with an overall reduction in microbial density. Using qPCR, we found that each type of PUFA differentially altered the major gut phyla; fish oil increased Bacteroidetes and safflower oil increased Firmicutes. Both PUFA diets reduced microbes known to dominate the infant gut like Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteria spp. when compared to the chow group. Uniquely, maternal fish oil diets resulted in offspring showing blooms of opportunistic pathogens like Bilophila wadsworthia, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis in their gut . As well, fish oil groups showed a reduction in colonic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells and arginase+  macrophages. In conclusion, fish oil supplementation in pharmacological excess, at 18% by energy as shown in this study, provides an example where excess dosing in utero can prime offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts and alter immune cell homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653264>Helminth infection in mice improves insulin sensitivity via modulation of gut  and fatty acid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Intestinal helminths are prevalent in individuals who live in rural areas of developing countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome are rare. In the present study, we analyzed the modulation of the gut  in mice infected with the helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis, and fed either a standard rodent chow diet or high-fat diet (HFD). To investigate the effects of the  modulation on the metabolism, we analyzed the expression of tight-junction proteins present in the gut epithelium, inflammatory markers in the serum and tissue and quantified glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and resistance. Additionally, the levels of lipids related to inflammation were evaluated in the feces and serum. Our results show that infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis results in a modification of the gut , most notably by increasing Lactobacillus spp. These modifications in the  alter the host metabolism by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, switching macrophages from a M1 to  pattern in the adipose tissue, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins in the intestinal cells (thereby reducing the permeability) and decreasing LPS in the serum. Taken together, these changes correlate with improved insulin signaling and sensitivity, which could also be achieved with HFD mice treated with probiotics. Additionally, helminth infected mice produce higher levels of oleic acid, which participates in anti-inflammatory pathways. These results suggest that modulation of the  by helminth infection or probiotic treatment causes a reduction in subclinical inflammation, which has a positive effect on the glucose metabolism of the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate that active immunization against the outer membrane protein of bacteria present in the gut enhances local and systemic immune control via apoE-mediated immune-modulation. Reduction of western-diet-associated inflammation was obtained for more than eighteen weeks after immunization. Immunized mice had reduced serum cytokine levels, reduced insulin and fasting glucose concentrations; and gene expression in both liver and visceral adipose tissue confirmed a reduced inflammatory steady-state after immunization. Moreover, both gut and atherosclerotic plaques of immunized mice showed reduced inflammatory cells and an increased  macrophage fraction. These results suggest that adaptive responses directed against microbes present in our  have systemic beneficial consequences and demonstrate the key role of apoE in this mechanism that could be exploited to treat immune-metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696449>A maternal gluten-free diet reduces inflammation and diabetes incidence in the offspring of NOD mice.</a></h2><p>Early-life interventions in the intestinal environment have previously been shown to influence diabetes incidence. We therefore hypothesized that a gluten-free (GF) diet, known to decrease the incidence of type 1 diabetes, would protect against the development of diabetes when fed only during the pregnancy and lactation period. Pregnant nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice were fed a GF or standard diet until all pups were weaned to a standard diet. The early-life GF environment dramatically decreased the incidence of diabetes and insulitis. Gut  analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a pronounced difference between both mothers and their offspring on different diets, characterized by increased numbers of Akkermansia, Proteobacteria, and TM7 in the GF diet group. In addition, pancreatic forkhead box P3 regulatory T cells were increased in GF-fed offspring, as were  macrophage gene markers and tight junction-related genes in the gut, while intestinal gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced. An increased proportion of T cells in the pancreas expressing the mucosal integrin α4β7 suggests that the mechanism involves increased trafficking of gut-primed immune cells to the pancreas. In conclusion, a GF diet during fetal and early postnatal life reduces the incidence of diabetes. The mechanism may involve changes in gut  and shifts to a less proinflammatory immunological milieu in the gut and pancreas.© 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

Here, we investigated the impacts of triterpenoid saponins isolated from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GpS) on gut microbiome, mucosal environment, and the preventive effect on tumor growth. Six-week old ApcMin/+ mice and their wild-type littermates were fed either with vehicle or GpS daily for the duration of 8 weeks. The fecal microbiome was analyzed by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Study showed that GpS treatment significantly reduced the number of intestinal polyps in a preventive mode. More importantly, GpS feeding strikingly reduced the sulfate-reducing bacteria lineage, which are known to produce hydrogen sulfide and contribute to damage the intestinal epithelium or even promote cancer progression. Meanwhile, GpS also boosted the beneficial microbes. In the gut barrier of the ApcMin/+ mice, GpS treatment increased Paneth and goblet cells, up-regulated E-cadherin and down-regulated N-cadherin. In addition, GpS decreased the pro-oncogenic β-catenin, p-Src and the p-STAT3. Furthermore, GpS might also improve the inflamed gut epithelium of the ApcMin/+ mice by upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, while downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-18. Intriguingly, GpS markedly stimulated  and suppressed M1 macrophage markers, indicating that GpS altered mucosal cytokine profile in favor of the M1 to  macrophages switching, facilitating intestinal tissue repair. In conclusion, GpS might reverse the host's inflammatory phenotype by increasing beneficial bacteria, decreasing sulfate-reducing bacteria, and alleviating intestinal inflammatory gut environment, which might contribute to its cancer preventive effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30168718>Syntheses, Structures, and Antimicrobial Activities of Gold(I)- and Copper(I)- N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Complexes Derived from Basket-Shaped Dinuclear Ag(I)-NHC Complex.</a></h2><p>Novel dinuclear gold(I)- and copper(I)- N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC, L-1a) complexes [M(L-1a)](PF) (M = Au (Au-1·PF) and M = Cu (Cu-1·PF)) were synthesized by transmetalation of the dinuclear silver(I)-NHC complex [Ag(L-1a)](PF) (Ag-1·PF) with [AuCl(MeS)] or CuI in over 70% yield. These NHC complexes were characterized by CHN elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis, and solution (H and C) NMR spectroscopy. X-ray crystallography revealed that Au-1·PF and Cu-1·PF are dinuclear molecules consisting of two linear intramolecular C-M-C bonds (M = Au and Cu), one M···M interaction, and two metal atoms arranged in a T-shaped geometry; their molecular structures are very similar to the basket-shaped cage structure of the parent complex Ag-1·PF. Because of the smaller ionic radius of copper(I), Cu-1·PF has the smallest upper space of the basket among the three complexes. Au-1·PF and Cu-1·PF were very stable in the solid state and in solution. They did not undergo nucleophilic reaction with thiols 2-mercaptoethanol and 2-benzimidazolethiol (Hbmt) at least for several hours, whereas Ag-1·PF did react, forming precipitates of silver(I) thiolate and the free ligand L-1a·PF. The minimum inhibitory concentration values toward a panel of bacteria, yeasts, and molds were examined in a water-suspension system and a solution system containing dimethyl sulfoxide. The antimicrobial spectra of the three compounds were metal-dependent, and Au-1·PF showed the greatest activity toward Gram-positive bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28439298>Multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria in the gut of young children in Bangladesh.</a></h2><p>The gut of human harbors diverse commensal  performing an array of beneficial role for the hosts. In the present study, the major commensal gut bacteria isolated by culturing methods from 15 children of moderate income families, aged between 10 and 24 months, were studied for their response to different antibiotics, and the molecular basis of drug resistance.Of 122 bacterial colonies primarily selected from Luria-Bertani agar, bacterial genera confirmed by analytical profile index (API) 20E system included  as the predominant (52%) organism, followed by  (16%),  (12%),  (6%),  (6%),  (3%), and  (3%); while  and  were identified as the infrequently occurring genera. An estimated 11 and 22% of the  isolates carried virulence marker genes -2 and , respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility assay revealed 78% of the gut bacteria to be multidrug resistant (MDR) with highest resistance to erythromycin (96%), followed by ampicillin (63%), tetracycline (59%), azithromycin (53%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (43%), cefixime (39%), and ceftriaxone (33%). PCR assay results revealed 56% of the gut bacteria to possess gene cassette Class 1 integron; while 8, 17.5 and 6% of the strains carried tetracycline resistance-related genes A, B, and D, respectively. The macrolide (erythromycin and azithromycin) resistance marker genes A, B, and B were found in 28, 3 and 5% of bacterial isolates, respectively; while 26, 12, 17, 32, 7, 4 and 3% of the MDR bacterial isolates carried the extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-related genes e.g., , , , , ,  and  respectively. Majority of the MDR gut bacteria harbored large plasmids [e.g., 140 MDa (43%), 105 MDa (30%), 90 MDa (14%)] carrying invasion and related antibiotic resistance marker genes.Our results suggest gut of young Bangladeshi children to be an important reservoir for multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria carrying ESBL related genes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904023>α-Linolenic acid-derived metabolites from gut lactic acid bacteria induce differentiation of anti-inflammatory  macrophages through G protein-coupled receptor 40.</a></h2><p>Among dietary fatty acids with immunologic effects, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid (ALA), have been considered as factors that contribute to the differentiation of -type macrophages ( macrophages). In this study, we examined the effect of ALA and its gut lactic acid bacteria metabolites 13-hydroxy-9(),15()-octadecadienoic acid (13-OH) and 13-oxo-9(),15()-octadecadienoic acid (13-oxo) on the differentiation of  macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. BMDCs were stimulated with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and significant increases in  macrophage markers CD206 and Arginase-1 (Arg1) were observed. In addition,  macrophage phenotypes were less prevalent following cotreatment with GPCR40 antagonists or inhibitors of PLC-β and MEK under these conditions, suggesting that GPCR40 signaling is involved in the regulation of  macrophage differentiation. In further experiments, remarkable  macrophage accumulation was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice after intragastric treatments with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo at 1 g/kg of body weight per day for 3 d.

The quaternary mixture of PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and benzo[a] pyrene) and metals (Cr, Ni, and Pb) spiked the soil, constructing a microcosm; the microcosms were bioaugmented with newly developed plant bacterial consortia (Cpm and Cpm). The microcosms were amended with biochar (sieved particle size 0.5-2 mm) as redox regulators to reduce oxidative stress of plant-microbe systems. To formulate the two plant-bacterial consortia, plant species were collected and bacteria were isolated from oil spill soil. The bacterial strains used in two formulated consortia includes ─ Cpm (Enterobacter cloacae HS32, Brevibacillus reuszeri HS37, and Stenotrophomonas sp. HS16) and Cpm (Acinetobacter junii HS29, Enterobacter aerogenes HS39 and Enterobacter asburiae HS22). The PAHs degradation and metal removal efficacy of the consortia (Cpm and Cpm) were studied after 24 weeks of trial. The physicochemical properties of microcosm's soil (M and M) were assessed after experimentation, which resulted in the finding that the soil exhibits dropped in pH from basic to neutral after application of the plant microbe's consortium. The electrical conductivity was lower in M and M soils, with a range between 1.60 and 1.80 mS/cm after the treatment. The Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) results illustrate how metabolites with the different molecular weight (M.W) were found in M and M soils (184─446), as a result of the plant-microbes mediated rhizodegradation of four spiked PAHs. The metals in microcosm's soil are very low in concentration after 24 weeks of trial when compared to control(M). The Cr, Ni and Pb removal percentages were found in 45.79, 42.19 and 44.85 in M. However, the removal percentages were found to be 45.41, 41.47 and 44.25 respectively for these same HMs in M soil. Both the consortia that were newly developed showed similar trends of metals removal and PAHs degradation.

Increased gut fermentation and plant protein may mediate the effect. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether the appetite-suppressing effects of whole-grain rye porridge could be enhanced by replacing part of the rye with fermented dietary fibre and plant protein, and to explore the role of gut fermentation on appetite and metabolic responses over 8 h. We conducted a randomised, cross-over study using two rye porridges (40 and 55 g), three 40-g rye porridges with addition of inulin:gluten (9:3; 6:6; 3:9 g) and a refined wheat bread control (55 g), served as part of complete breakfasts. A standardised lunch and an ad libitum dinner were served 4 and 8 h later, respectively. Appetite, breath hydrogen and methane, glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) responses were measured over 8 h. Twenty-one healthy men and women, aged 23-60 years, with BMI of 21-33 kg/ participated in this study. Before lunch, the 55-g rye porridges lowered hunger by 20 % and desire to eat by 22 % and increased fullness by 29 % compared with wheat bread (P<0·05). Breath hydrogen increased proportionally to dietary fibre content (P<0·05). Plasma glucose after lunch was 6 % lower after the 55-g rye porridges compared with wheat bread (P<0·05) and correlated to breath hydrogen (P<0·001). No differences were observed in ad libitum food intake, insulin or GLP-1. We conclude that no further increase in satiety was observed when replacing part of the rye with inulin and gluten compared with plain rye porridges.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25644343>Oat avenanthramide-C (2c) is biotransformed by mice and the human  into bioactive metabolites.</a></h2><p>Avenanthramides (AVAs), which are found exclusively in oats, may play an important role in anti-inflammation and antiatherogenesis. Although the bioavailability of AVAs has been investigated previously, little is known about their metabolism.The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolism of avenanthramide-C (2c), one of the major AVAs, in mice and by the human , as well as to elucidate the bioactivity of its major metabolites with the goal of finding new exposure markers to precisely reflect oat consumption.For the mouse study, 10 CF-1 female mice were divided into control (vehicle-treated) and 2c intragastrically treated (200 mg/kg) groups (5 mice/group). Twenty-four-hour urine and fecal samples were collected with use of metabolic cages. For the batch culture incubations, 2c was cultured with fecal slurries obtained from 6 human donors. Incubated samples were collected at various time points (0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h). Metabolites were identified via HPLC with electrochemical detection and LC with electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry. To investigate whether 2c metabolites retain the biological effects of 2c, we compared their effects on the growth of and induction of apoptosis in HCT-116 human colon cancer cells.Eight metabolites were detected from the 2c-treated mouse urine samples. They were identified as 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (M1), dihydrocaffeic acid (), caffeic acid (M3), dihydroferulic acid (M4), ferulic acid (M5), dihydroavenanthramide-C (M6), dihydroavenanthramide-B (M7), and avenanthramide-B (M8) via analysis of their MS(n) (n = 1-3) spectra. We found that the reduction of 2c's C7'-C8' double bond and the cleavage of its amide bond were the major metabolic routes. In the human  study, 2c was converted into M1-M3 and M6. Moreover, interindividual differences in 2c metabolism were observed among the 6 human subjects. Subjects B, C, E, and F could rapidly metabolize 2c to M6, whereas subject D metabolized little 2c, even up to 120 h. In addition, only subjects A, B, and F could cleave the amide bond of 2c or M6 to form the cleaved metabolites. Furthermore, we showed that 2c and its major metabolite M6 are bioactive compounds against human colon cancer cells. M6 was more active than 2c with the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 158 μM and could induce apoptosis at 200 μM.To our knowledge, the current study demonstrates for the first time that avenanthramide-C can be extensively metabolized by mice and the human  to generate bioactive metabolites.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30312395>Diversity of fungi and bacteria in species-rich grasslands increases with plant diversity in shoots but not in roots and soil.</a></h2><p>Microbial communities in roots and shoots of plants and in soil are important for plant growth and health and take part in important ecosystem processes. Therefore, understanding the factors that affect their diversity is important. We have analyzed fungal and bacterial communities associated with plant shoots, roots and soil over a 1 km2 area in a semi-natural temperate grassland with 1-43 plant species per 0.1 , to describe the relationships between plant and microbial diversity and to identify the drivers of bacterial and fungal community composition. Microbial community composition differed between shoots, roots and soil. While both fungal and bacterial species richness in shoots increased with plant species richness, no correlation was found between plant and microbial diversity in roots and soil. Chemistry was a significant predictor of bacterial and fungal community composition in soil as was also the spatial location of the sampled site. In this species-rich grassland, the effects of plants on the microbiome composition seemed to be restricted to the shoot-associated taxa; in contrast, the microbiomes of roots or soil were not affected. The results support our hypothesis that the effect of plants on the microbiome composition decreases from shoots to roots and soil.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25719336>Obesity and cancer.</a></h2><p>The incidence of obesity in the Western world has increased dramatically during the recent decades. Epidemiological data suggest that obesity is associated with an increased risk of several but not all types of cancers, with clear sex-specific differences. The underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate. In this review, we discuss the potential factors linking obesity to cancer, with a focus on hormone-dependent cancer types. Current experimental evidence suggests that insulin resistance and a chronic, subclinical inflammation in the visceral fat are the major metabolic events, causing alterations in the levels of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, insulin-like growth factor-1 and -2, adipose tissue-derived proinflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, -6, -12, and -23), and other bioactive molecules such as adipokines (adiponectin and leptin), vascular endothelial growth factor, sex hormones, gut , and secondary bile acids. All these factors may act directly or indirectly on the tumor microenvironment to drive tumor progression via the stimulation of cell survival/antiapoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion/metastasis of cancer cells. Therapeutic strategies (including bariatric surgery) that target dysfunctional or inflamed fat have been shown to benefit patients, whereas other cell- or hormone-directed interventions (such as the conversion of visceral fat macrophages to an anti-inflammatory  phenotype or the pharmacological modulation of serum adipokine levels) are still theoretical and need to be clinically evaluated for their ability to successfully treat or prevent obesity-related cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27761147>The Rhizome Mixture of  and  Attenuates Mesalazine-Resistant Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of DWac on the gut  composition in mice with 2,3,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced colitis. Treatment with DWac restored TNBS-disturbed gut  composition and attenuated TNBS-induced colitis. Moreover, we examined the effect of DWac in mice with mesalazine-resistant colitis (MRC). Intrarectal injection of TNBS in MRC mice caused severe colitis, as well as colon shortening, edema, and increased myeloperoxidase activity. Treatment with mesalazine (30 mg/kg) did not attenuate TNBS-induced colitis in MRC mice, whereas treatment with DWac (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated TNBS-induced colitis. Moreover, treatment with the mixture of mesalazine (15 mg/kg) and DWac (15 mg/kg) additively attenuated colitis in MRC mice. Treatment with DWac and its mixture with mesalazine inhibited TNBS-induced activation of NF-B and expression of M1 macrophage markers but increased TNBS-suppressed expression of  macrophage markers. Furthermore, these inhibited TNBS-induced T-bet, RORt, TNF-, and IL-17 expression but increased TNBS-suppressed Foxp3 and IL-10 expression. However, Th2 cell differentiation and GATA3 and IL-5 expression were not affected. These findings suggest that DWac can ameliorate MRC by increasing the polarization of  macrophage and correcting the disturbance of gut  and Th1/Th17/Treg, as well as additively attenuating MRC along with mesalazine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29726951>Walnut Consumption Alters the Gastrointestinal , Microbially Derived Secondary Bile Acids, and Health Markers in Healthy Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Epidemiologic data suggest that diets rich in nuts have beneficial health effects, including reducing total and cause-specific mortality from cancer and heart disease. Although there is accumulating preclinical evidence that walnuts beneficially affect the gastrointestinal  and gut and metabolic health, these relations have not been investigated in humans.We aimed to assess the impact of walnut consumption on the human gastrointestinal  and metabolic markers of health.A controlled-feeding, randomized crossover study was undertaken in healthy men and women [n = 18; mean age = 53.1 y; body mass index (kg/): 28.8]. Study participants received isocaloric diets containing 0 or 42 g walnuts/d for two 3-wk periods, with a 1-wk washout between diet periods. Fecal and blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each period to assess secondary outcomes of the study, including effects of walnut consumption on fecal  and bile acids and metabolic markers of health.Compared with after the control period, walnut consumption resulted in a 49-160% higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Dialister, and Roseburia and 16-38% lower relative abundances of Ruminococcus, Dorea, Oscillospira, and Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). Fecal secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, were 25% and 45% lower, respectively, after the walnut treatment compared with the control treatment (P < 0.05). Serum LDL cholesterol and the noncholesterol sterol campesterol concentrations were 7% and 6% lower, respectively, after walnut consumption compared with after the control treatment (P < 0.01).Walnut consumption affected the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal , increasing the relative abundances of Firmicutes species in butyrate-producing Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, and reducing microbially derived, proinflammatory secondary bile acids and LDL cholesterol.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the gut  composition, the lipopolysaccharide levels and the metabolic profile in obese and normal-weight young subjects.We studied 32 obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/) and 32 normal-weight subjects (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/), aged 18-25 years. Quantification of intestinal bacteria was performed by real-time PCR. Endotoxin units were determined with the test QCL-1000, and biochemical profile was performed under a standard protocol of Spinreact.Obese individuals had a BMI of 34.5 (32.9-36.45) kg/, increased triglycerides (123 vs. 70 mg/dl), total cholesterol (168 vs. 142 mg/dl), and LDL-cholesterol (114 vs. 96.5 mg/dl). In obese subjects body temperature was higher than in normal-weight subjects. We found a greater number of Clostridum leptum and Lactobacillus (p < 0.001) and lower numbers of Prevotella and Escherichia coli (p < 0.001) in the obese group. A decrease of E. coli was associated with an increased risk of lipopolysaccharide levels ranging from 1 to 1.3 EU/ml. A positive correlation was found between serum lipopolysaccharides and BMI (r = 0.46, p = 0.008), triglyceride levels (r = 0.44, p = 0.011) as well as waist circumference (r = 0.34, p = 0.040), being more evident in young obese females.Subclinical metabolic endotoxemia determined by serum concentration of lipopolysaccharides was related to the smallest amount of E. coli, high triglyceride levels, and central adiposity in obese young persons.© 2016 S.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of gut  in these disorders. The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a key role in the innate immune response activation. We studied two polymorphisms (+3725G/C and 11350G/C) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the TLR4 gene that may alter its expression and their association with metabolic disorders related to systemic inflammation. We cloned the 3'UTR into a luciferase reporter system and compared wild-type 3'UTR (WT) and +3725C variant (MUT) constructs luciferase activities. MUT construct reduced the reporter gene activity by 30% compared to WT (P = 0.0001). To evaluate the association between these polymorphisms with biochemical and clinical overweight related variables, we conducted a population cross-sectional study in 966 men of Argentine general population. Considering smoking as a confounding variable that causes systemic inflammation, we studied these possible effects in both, smokers and nonsmokers. The 11350G/C polymorphism was not detected in our sample whereas the CC genotype of +3725 polymorphism was associated with lean subjects (p = 0.011) and higher Adiponectin levels (p = 0.021). Subjects without any NCEP/ATP III MS component were associated with this genotype as well (p = 0.001). These results were strengthened in nonsmokers, in which CC genotype was associated with lean subjects (p = 0.003) and compared with G carriers showed significantly lower BMI (25.53 vs. 28.60 kg/; p = 0.023) and waist circumference (89.27 vs. 97.51 cm; p = 0.025). None of these associations were found in smokers. These results showed that +3725C variant has a functional effect down-regulating gene expression and it could be considered as a predictive factor against overweight, particularly in nonsmokers. Considering the role of TLR4 in inflammation, these findings would suggest that the presence of +3725C variant could predict a lower prevalence of chronic metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29276981>Comparative metabolism of two major compounds in Fructus Corni extracts by gut microflora from normal and chronic nephropathy rats in vitro by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.</a></h2><p>Herbal medicines are widely used as therapeutic products in many countries. Fructus Corni, a traditional herb medicine, has been clinically used to cure chronic nephropathy for thousands of years. It could be converted by gut microflora in vivo to shape its pharmacological profiles. Thus, metabolic profiles of major active constituents in Fructus Corni extracts by gut microflora from rats in healthy and nephropathy state were firstly investigated in vitro by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) in this study. According to the features of protonated ions, five metabolites (M1, , M3, M5 and M6) were found and preliminarily authenticated. Intestinal bacteria were capable of converting N0 (loganin) to its aglycone M1 (loganetin). The latter was further hydrogenated to the corresponding  (hydrogenated loganetin) and subsequently to M3 (hydrogenated and demethylated loganetin) by demethylation; While M5 (demethylated morronisid aglycone) and M6 (dehydroxylated morronisid aglycone) were identified as the two metabolites of N4 (morronisid) through demethylation and dehydroxylation. Gut microflora from healthy and nephropathy rats could degrade loganin and morronisid to the above metabolites. However, healthy rat intestinal bacteria showed more powerful degradation and much more amounts of M1 and M6 were obtained in their samples. Additionally, this work demonstrated that UPLC-Q-TOF/MS approach connected with MetaboLynx™ analysis software was rapid and reliable for screening and authentication of natural product metabolites.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The human intestinal  might have an important impact on drug metabolism and ultimately on the drug oral bioavailability. However, the interaction of the buddleoside with human intestinal bacteria remains unknown. In this study, the conversion of buddleoside by different bacteria from human feces was firstly investigated. A reliable, sensitive and rapid analytical method, ultra performance liquid chromatography was established and successfully applied to investigate the metabolites and metabolic profile of buddleoside by human intestinal bacteria. Among the isolated bacteria, four strains including Escherichia sp. 4, Escherichia sp. 34, Enterococcus sp. 45 and Bacillus sp. 46 showed more powerful conversion capability. Based on the accurate mass data and the characteristic MS(n) product ions, the parent and six metabolites were detected and tentatively identified compared with blank samples. The metabolites were produced by four main metabolic pathways including deglycosylation, acetylation, methylation and hydroxylation. Buddleoside could be firstly converted to its aglycon acacetin () by the majority of the isolated intestinal bacteria. Subsequently,  was further metabolize to its methylated (M3), acetylated (M4), hydroxylated (M5) and hydrogenated product (M6). However, acacetin-7-glucosid (M1) was obtained only from the minor bacterial samples like Bacillus sp. 46. To further explain the metabolism of buddleoside, the β-d-glucosidase and α-l-rhamnosidase activities of four strains were analyzed. Bacillus sp. 46 could only produce α-l-rhamnosidase, while the other three strains showed two kinds of enzyme activities. Furthermore, the activities of α-l-rhamnosidase and β-d-glucosidase reached the highest level at 12-18h and 10-12h, respectively. The metabolic routes and metabolites of buddleoside produced by human intestinal microflora were firstly reported in this paper. The results will be very helpful for the further investigation of the pharmacokinetic research of buddleoside and to unravel how it works in vivo.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among the catechin metabolites, 1-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-3-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ol (EGC-), 4-hydroxy-5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid (EGC-M7), and 5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid (EGC-M9) were found to show inhibitory activity on HeLa cell proliferation as compared with control. The results suggested that three adjacent hydroxyl groups in the phenyl moiety may play an important role in the inhibitory activity. In addition, the inhibitory activity was also examined with four (-)-epicatechin (EC) metabolites possessing two adjacent hydroxyl groups in the phenyl moiety. Only 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid (EC-M9) showed inhibitory activity and therefore valeric acid moiety likely contributes to the inhibitory activity. EGC-M9 showed the strongest inhibitory activity with IC of 5.58 µM. Thus, in this study it was found for the first time that several catechin metabolites derived from EGC, EGCg, and EC inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714029>Involvement of gut  in the association between gastrointestinal motility and 5‑HT expression/ macrophage abundance in the gastrointestinal tract.</a></h2><p>Serotonin (5‑hydroxytryptamine; 5‑HT) may be a key player in gastrointestinal (GI) motility and the GI immune system. In the present study, the effect of gut  on the association between GI motility, and 5‑HT expression and macrophage abundance in the GI tract was examined. Germ‑free (GF) mice (6 weeks old) were orally administered a fecal bacterial suspension prepared from specific pathogen‑free mice and their GI tissues were evaluated 4 weeks later. The expression of 5‑HT and mannose receptor (MR) was examined by immunohistochemistry, and GI transit time (GITT) was measured by administration of carmine red solution. The numbers of 5‑HT‑positive endocrine cells and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages were significantly increased in the upper GI and colon of GF mice subjected to fecal transplantation (FT) compared with control GF mice without FT. GITT was significantly decreased in GF mice subjected to FT compared with GF mice without FT, and negatively correlated with the numbers of 5‑HT‑positive cells in the upper GI and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages throughout the GI tract. The numbers of 5‑HT‑positive endocrine cells and muscularis MR‑positive macrophages were significantly correlated throughout the GI tract. The present results suggest that the gut  is involved in the association between accelerated GI motility and induction of the 5‑HT/muscularis MR‑positive macrophage axis in the GI tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871257>Reactivation of Intestinal Inflammation Is Suppressed by Catestatin in a Murine Model of Colitis  M1 Macrophages and Not the Gut .</a></h2><p>While there is growing awareness of a relationship between chromogranin-A (CHGA) and susceptibility to inflammatory conditions, the role of human catestatin [(hCTS); CHGA] in the natural history of established inflammatory bowel disease is not known. Recently, using two different experimental models, we demonstrated that hCTS-treated mice develop less severe acute colitis. We have also shown the implication of the macrophages in this effect. The aims of this study were to determine (1) whether hCTS treatment could attenuate the reactivation of inflammation in adult mice with previously established chronic colitis; (2) whether this effect is mediated through macrophages or the gut . Quiescent colitis was induced in 7-8-week-old C57BL6 mice using four cycles (2-4%) of dextran sulfate sodium. hCTS (1.5 mg/kg/day) treatment or vehicle started 2 days before the last induction of colitis and continuing for 7 days. At sacrifice, macro- and microscopic scores were determined. Colonic pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and TNF- α], anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF- β), classically activated (M1) (), and alternatively activated () () macrophages markers were studied using ELISA and/or RT-qPCR. , peritoneal macrophages isolated from naïve mice and treated with hCTS (10 M, 12 h) were exposed to either lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml, 12 h) to polarize M1 macrophages or to IL-4/IL-13 (20 ng/ml) to polarize  macrophages. M1/ macrophage markers along with cytokine gene expression were determined using RT-qPCR. Feces and mucosa-associated  (MAM) samples were collected, and the V4 region of 16 s rRNA was sequenced. Micro- and macroscopic scores, colonic IL-6, IL-1β, TNF- α, and M1 macrophages markers were significantly decreased in the hCTS-treated group. Treatment did not have any effect on colonic IL-10, TGF-β, and  markers nor modified the bacterial richness, diversity, or the major phyla in colitic fecal and MAM samples. , pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, as well as their gene expression, were significantly reduced in hCTS-treated M1 macrophages. hCTS treatment did not affect  macrophage markers. These findings suggest that hCTS treatment attenuates the severity of inflammatory relapse through the modulation of the M1 macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23017151>Geographical and ecological stability of the symbiotic mid-gut  in European firebugs, Pyrrhocoris apterus (Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae).</a></h2><p>Symbiotic bacteria often play an essential nutritional role for insects, thereby allowing them to exploit novel food sources and expand into otherwise inaccessible ecological niches. Although many insects are inhabited by complex microbial communities, most studies on insect mutualists so far have focused on single endosymbionts and their interactions with the host. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the gut  of the red firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus, Hemiptera, Pyrrhocoridae), a model organism for physiological and endocrinological research. A combination of several culture-independent techniques (454 pyrosequencing, quantitative PCR and cloning/sequencing) revealed a diverse community of likely transient bacterial taxa in the mid-gut regions M1,  and M4. However, the completely anoxic M3 region harboured a distinct  consisting of facultative and obligate anaerobes including Actinobacteria (Coriobacterium glomerans and Gordonibacter sp.), Firmicutes (Clostri-dium sp. and Lactococcus lactis) and Proteobacteria (Klebsiella sp. and a previously undescribed Rickettsiales bacterium). Characterization of the M3  in different life stages of P. apterus indicated that the symbiotic bacterial community is vertically transmitted and becomes well defined between the second and third nymphal instar, which coincides with the initiation of feeding. Comparing the mid-gut M3 microbial communities of P. apterus individuals from five different populations and after feeding on three different diets revealed that the community composition is qualitatively and quantitatively very stable, with the six predominant taxa being consistently abundant. Our findings suggest that the firebug mid-gut  constitutes a functionally important and possibly coevolved symbiotic community.© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299489>Lipid production by a mixed culture of oleaginous yeast and microalga from distillery and domestic mixed wastewater.</a></h2><p>Lipid productivity by mixed culture of Rhodosporidium toruloides and Chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied using 1:1 mixed real wastewater from distillery and local municipal wastewater treatment plant with initial soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) around 25,000 mg/L, initial cell density of 2×10(7) cells/mL (yeast) and 5×10(6) cells/mL (microalga), at 30 °C and 2.93 W/ (2000 lux, 12:12 h light and dark cycles).

Catalpol, an iridoid glucoside, abundantly found in the root of the common used herb medicine Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, has been reported to show various biological effects and pharmacological activities. After oral administration, the active ingredient might have interactions with the intestinal bacteria, which could help unravel how the medicine was processed in vivo. In this work, different pure bacteria from healthy human feces were isolated and used to bioconvert catalpol. Ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) technique combined with Metabolynx(™) software was applied to analyze catalpol metabolites. Compared with blank samples, parent compound (M0) and four metabolites (M1-M4) were detected and tentatively identified based on the characteristics of their protonated ions. The metabolites were likely to be: catalpol aglycone (M1), acetylated catalpol (), dimethylated and hydroxylated catalpol aglycone (M3), nitrogen-containing catalpol aglycone (M4). M1 and M4 were generated in the majority of the samples like Bacteroides sp. 45. M3 was obtained in several bacterial samples like Enterococcus sp. 8-2 and  was detected only in the sample of Enterococcus sp. 43-1. To our knowledge, the metabolic routes and metabolites of catalpol produced by human intestinal bacteria were all firstly reported.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
