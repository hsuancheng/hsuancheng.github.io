Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and preclinical characterization of a highly potent, oral CGRP receptor antagonist BMS-927711 (8). Compound 8 has good oral bioavailability in rat and cynomolgus monkey, attractive overall preclinical properties, and shows dose-dependent activity in a primate model of CGRP-induced facial blood flow. Compound 8 is presently in phase II clinical trials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25466096>Pilot-scale production of cloudy juice from low-quality pear fruit under low-oxygen conditions.</a></h1><p>In this study, a process for the production of premium quality yellowish, cloudy pear juice from low-quality fruit under low-oxygen conditions was developed. The production process consisted of (1) shredding, (2) pressing with spiral-filter technology including a vacuumised extraction cell, (3) holding in an inert gas buffer tank, (4) pasteurisation, (5) and refrigerated storage. First, the system parameters of a spiral-filter press were optimised with the aim of producing a yellowish, cloudy pear juice with the highest possible juice yield. A maximum juice yield of 78% could be obtained. Enzymatic  during juice extraction could be suppressed as a result of the fast processing and the low air (oxygen) levels in the extraction chamber of the spiral-filter press. Furthermore, we observed that instantaneous pasteurisation at 107 °C for , subsequent aluminium laminate packaging and cold storage had only a minimum effect on the phenolic composition.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to reduce sugar and maintaining the product quality at the same time, functional ingredients and alternative sweetening agents have to be incorporated. In this study, the sourdough lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc citreum TR116, selected for its ability to produce high amounts of mannitol, was used to produce wheat sourdough and its biochemical characteristics (cell count, pH, TTA, sugar- and acid profile, as well as mannitol production) were monitored over 48 h. The so produced sourdough was then incorporated, as a functional ingredient, into a sugar reduced burger bun system and the quality characteristics of the dough and the final product were determined. Sourdough incorporation counteract the negative effects of sugar reduction on dough properties and resulted in the same viscoelastic properties (0.423 ± 0.008) and gluten-network-development (PMT: 160 ± 12.6 s; TM: 44.0 ± 2.6 BU) as the full-sugar control dough. Furthermore, the investigation of specific volume, crumb hardness and chewiness revealed no significant differences between sugar reduced sourdough burger buns and its control. It is noteworthy that sourdough contributed to  reaction resulting in darker crumb and crust colour (-8.2%; -9.6%) and it extended microbial shelf life of the burger buns significantly (+3.5 days). Sensory evaluation showed no significant differences in sweetness and sourness between sugar reduced buns containing sourdough and the full-sugar control. In conclusion, the incorporation of mannitol-rich sourdough fermented by Leuconostoc citreum TR116 represents a novel technological approach in the field of sugar reduction and showed high potential as a functional ingredient to ameliorate the losses of important quality parameters. Especially sourdough containing higher amounts of mannitol and lower amounts of lactate improved significantly the dough and burger bun quality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The administration of saline had no significant effect on contraction times, nor did 50 mg/kg of calcium dobesilate in saline as a vehicle. However, at dose levels of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg using saline as a vehicle the time between contractions significantly (P less than 0.001) increased to 11.4 +/- 14.8s and 12.9 +/- 23.3s, respectively. While neither the saline vehicle alone nor calcium dobesilate at any dose level influenced maximal collector diameters significantly, all dose levels of calcium dobesilate significantly (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01) reduced minimal lumenal diameters to 30% of their maximum. The time that the lymphangion spends at its minimal diameter is an indication of the intensity of contraction. Saline alone had no significant effect, but calcium dobesilate at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01) increased this time from 0.9 +/- 1.2s to 1.9 +/- 1.9s and 2.0 +/- 1., respectively. At 200 mg/kg of calcium dobesilate, there was a very significant increase (P less than 0.001) in minimal diameter times to 2.7 +/- 1.5s.</p></html>
