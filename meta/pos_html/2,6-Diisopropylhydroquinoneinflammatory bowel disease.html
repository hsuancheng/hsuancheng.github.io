Studies on risk factors and treatment of choice for pediatric CA-CDI are scarce with variable recommendations.This was a retrospective cohort study of the electronic health records of children 1-17 years with stool specimens sent for C. difficile at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 01, 2012 to December 31, 2016. Children with (1) CA , () confirmatory C. difficile laboratory testing with no other identified causes of diarrhea and (3) clinical symptoms consistent with CDI were defined as cases. Recurrent CA-CDI was defined using the above-described case criteria and onset of diarrhea within 8 weeks of primary CA-CDI.Of the 7350 children with stool samples sent for C. difficile testing, 408 had primary CA-CDI. Forty-five (11%) experienced a recurrence. Using multivariable logistic regression,  [odds ratio (OR) 7.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): .6-21.1] and cancer (OR 6.3; 95% CI: 1.6-24.1) diagnoses were risk factors for recurrent . Compared with children of Caucasian race, those with multi/other/unknown race had an OR of 3.03 (95% CI: 1.04-8.82) of recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in the type or duration of therapy as a predictor for recurrent CA CDI. Six percent of children who received metronidazole were switched to vancomycin due to subjective metronidazole allergy or intolerance or metronidazole treatment failure.Recurrent CA-CDI in children in our population is less common than previously reported. This study supports first-line treatment with the standard, short course metronidazole in most cases of primary CA-CDI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31556290>--β-d-Glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic Acid, an Ascorbic Acid Derivative Isolated from the Fruits of  L., Modulates Gut Microbiota and Palliates Colitis in Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p>In this study, the effects of --β-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid (AA-βG), a natural ascorbic acid derivative from the fruits of , on treating the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice were investigated. The results revealed that AA-βG had palliating effects on DSS-induced  (IBD) in terms of slowing down the trends of body weight and solid fecal mass loss, reducing colitis  activity index, improving serum physiological and biochemical indicators, increasing colon length, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and increasing tight junction proteins. Additionally, AA-βG treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty acids and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. The key bacteria related to IBD were found to be Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, ,  and . The results indicated that AA-βG might treat IBD through the regulation of gut microbiota, suggesting that AA-βG has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement in the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566409>Status of transition care in  in Spain. Different medical perspectives.</a></h1><p>transition is important for a successful follow-up of adolescents with  (IBD). The objectives of the study were to establish the situation of transition in Spain and to identify needs, requirements and barriers to transition from pediatric and adult gastroenterologist perspectives.a structured survey for self-completion using the REDCap platform was distributed via the Spanish Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SEGHNP) and the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's  and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU). The questionnaire contained closed and ranked questions concerning transition, perceived needs, organizational, clinician and patient related barriers to transition.one hundred and forty surveys were answered, 53% in pediatrics (PG) and 47% from adult gastroenterologists (AG) among 90 hospitals; 66% of them were reference centers. There was a higher response from pediatricians (18.%) versus adult gastroenterologists (8.3%) (p = 0.03). A structured transition program is adequate in 42.% centers. A well-structured transition was perceived as very important by 79.5% of PG and 63% of AG (p = 0.03). A higher proportion of both groups identified inadequacies in the preparation of adolescents for transfer (43% and 38%, p = ns). The main deficit areas were the lack of knowledge about  and treatment as well as the lack of self-advocacy and care coordination. Lack of resources, time and critical mass of patients were the highest ranked barriers by both groups. AG and PG (54% and 55%) highlighted suboptimal training in adolescent medicine.in Spain, nearly half of the centers have developed a structured transition program. Lack of training, time and insufficient resources are the main barriers for a successful transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661876>Target-Specific Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography for Non-Invasive and Dynamic Assessment of Early Neutrophil Infiltration in Murine Experimental Colitis.</a></h1><p>The role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of  (IBD) is still only incompletely understood. Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73. ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of  cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655907>UK Patients of Bangladeshi Descent with Crohn's  Respond Less Well to TNF Antagonists Than Caucasian Patients.</a></h1><p>Patients with  are currently managed with the assumption that trial data are applicable to all ethnic groups. Previous studies demonstrate differences in  severity and phenotype of Asian patients with Crohn's  (CD), including Bangladeshi Asians within the UK. No study has evaluated the impact of ethnicity on response to anti-TNFs.Our primary endpoint was a comparison of failure-free survival on first prescribed anti-TNF (anti-tumor necrosis factor) therapy in UK Bangladeshi and Caucasian patients with CD. Our secondary aims were to evaluate  phenotype, indication for anti-TNF prescription, and duration from diagnosis until first anti-TNF prescribed between groups.The records of consecutive outpatient appointments over a 12-month period were used to identify Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Information on patient demographics, ethnicity,  phenotype, immunomodulator use, outcome from first biologic, duration of therapy, and reason for cessation was recorded.In total, 224 Caucasian and Bangladeshi patients were prescribed an anti-TNF for CD. Bangladeshi patients started an anti-TNF 4.3 years earlier after diagnosis than Caucasian patients (3.9 years vs. 8. years: p < 0.01). Bangladeshi patients experienced shorter failure-free survival than Caucasian patients (1.8 vs. 4.8 years p < 0.01). By  years, significantly more Bangladeshi patients had stopped anti-TNF due to loss of response (OR 6.35, p < 0.01).This is the first study to suggest that Bangladeshi patients resident in the UK with CD respond less well to treatment with TNF antagonists than Caucasian patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586311>Fungal microbiome in colorectal cancer: a systematic review.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It has been estimated that more than one million new cases occur every year. Several studies have investigated the role of host bacteria as agents protecting against or increasing the risk of CRC, but few have assessed the fungal microbiome in patients with CRC. Fungal dysbiosis has been studied in colorectal  (e.g. ), but few researches compared the fungal microbiome of CRC patients with those of controls. The current study represents a systematic review aimed at assessing the expression and diversity of fungi in patients with CRC and non-CRC individuals. Here, we discuss the fungal species that could be implied in CRC development and alterations that can be induced by the presence of CRC, and the potential implications for future research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625616>Amelioration of colitis in mice by Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1 by M1 to M2 macrophage polarization.</a></h1><p>Dysregulation of immune responses by intestine to environmental antigens leads to the chronic  ,  (IBD). Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate IBD. We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase- (COX-) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

CEs are diagnosed in dogs with chronic gastrointestinal clinical signs (>3 weeks),  changes on intestinal biopsies and where no other underlying cause is determined based on a thorough, standardised diagnostic work-up. Based on response to therapy, CEs are subclassified into food-responsive, antibiotic-responsive or steroid-responsive enteropathies. A significant proportion of dogs with a CE are food-responsive; however, there are limited peer-reviewed publications describing the clinical efficacy of the commercially available diets used to treat CE.In this study, the authors evaluated the response of 15 dogs with a CE to a commercially available dietetic food (Hill's Prescription Diet i/d Sensitive Canine Dry). The dogs underwent a standard diagnostic evaluation and did not receive concurrent anthelmintic, antibiotic, glucocorticoid or gastroprotectant therapies. The clinical efficacy of the dietary treatment was assessed by comparing the Canine  Activity Index (CIBDAI) before and a median of 13 days after dietary therapy.The authors found that the CIBDAI significantly decreased following the introduction of the dietetic food (median CIBDAI score pretreatment 9, post-treatment ; P<0.0005).This study demonstrates that this dietetic food can be used to successfully manage CE in dogs.© British Veterinary Association 2019.

It has a unique function in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction including irritable  syndrome (IBS), is a common functional  . Its main symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation or alternations between diarrhea and constipation. There are obvious differences in metabolites between TCM syndromes. By comparing the body fluid metabolism maps of model animals, metabolomics can discover  biomarkers, analyze the differences in metabolic pathways and understand the pathological process and the metabolic pathways of substances in the body. Thus, the evaluation of animal models tends to be comprehensive and objective. This may provide further understanding between the interaction between Tong Xie Yao Fang and the IBS model.To evaluate the effect of Tong Xie Yao Fang on IBS rats by using metabolomics method.Wistar rats were used to establish IBS models, and then randomly divided into four groups: A model control group and three Tong Xie Yao Fang treatment groups (high, medium and low doses). A normal, non-IBS group was established. The rats were treated for  wk. On days 0 and 14 of the experimental model, urine was collected for 12 h and was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nine potential biomarkers were identified, and six major metabolic pathways were found to be related to IBS.In the study of metabonomics, nine potential biomarkers including L-serine, 4-methylgallic acid, L-threonine, succinylacetone, prolyl-hydroxyproline, valyl-serine, acetyl citrate, marmesin rutinoside and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan were identified in urine, which were assigned to amino acids, organic acids, succinyl and glycosides. Furthermore, the metabolic pathway of L-serine, L-threonine and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan was found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, which mainly involved the metabolism of cysteine and methionine, vitamin B6 metabolism, serotonin synapse, tryptophan metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, digestion, absorption of protein and amino acid metabolism. These pathways are related to intestinal dysfunction,  syndrome, nervous system dysfunction and other .Tong Xie Yao Fang has pharmacological effects on IBS, and its mechanism may be related to the metabolism of the nine potential biomarkers identified above in urine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617129>Obesity Is Associated with Decreased Risk of Clostridium difficile Infection in Hospitalized Patients with Pouchitis.</a></h1><p>Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of health-care-associated infections in the USA. There are limited data available regarding CDI in hospitalized patients with -related ileal pouch.This study aimed to evaluate the demographics, clinical features, risk factors, and admission outcomes among hospitalized patients with CDI-related pouchitis (CDP).Retrospective chart review was performed for patients who were admitted to our institute for pouchitis between 2013 and 2016 to identify patients with CDP. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors associated with CDP.A total of 160 subjects with pouchitis had a total of 218 admissions during the study period. Primary admission diagnosis was pouchitis or  flare-up for 202 (93%) admissions. Clostridium difficile was tested at least once for 72 patients, and the diagnosis of CDP was established for 16 (10%) patients. All patients with CDP were symptomatic, 13 (81%) had diarrhea, 8 (50%) had abdominal pain, 7 (44%) had nausea/vomiting, and  (13%) had gastrointestinal bleeding. On multivariable analysis, only body mass index > 25 (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06-0.94, p = 0.048) was significantly associated with decreased risk of CDP. No patients in CDP cohort were admitted to ICU, died at the hospital, or readmitted in 30 days after the discharge.In our cohort, obesity was associated with low risk of CDP among hospitalized patients with pouchitis. This finding warrants further validation in prospective studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677385>No Increased Risk of Colorectal Neoplasia in Patients With  and Postinflammatory Polyps.</a></h1><p>Patients with  (IBD) who have postinflammatory polyps (PIPs) may have an increased risk of developing colorectal neoplasia. Current guidelines recommend an intensified surveillance strategy in these patients, although the evidence for this recommendation is conflicting. The aim of our study was to assess whether IBD patients with PIPs are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.We established a retrospective cohort in a tertiary IBD center with IBD patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in the current era. We compared cumulative incidences of colorectal neoplasia since IBD diagnosis between patients with and without PIPs and corrected for confounders. Second, we compared the risk of receiving a colectomy.In our cohort with >22 years of median follow-up, 154 of 519 patients had PIPs. PIPs were associated with extensive  (odds ratio [OR], .76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-4.42; P < 0.001) and with more severe inflammation at colonoscopy (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, .28-5.50; P < 0.001). After correction for confounders, the presence of PIPs was not associated with development of colorectal neoplasia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.85-1.93; P = 0.24) or with development of advanced neoplasia (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.52-3.68; P = 0.52). There was a higher risk of colectomy in patients with PIPs (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.55-7.54; P = 0.002).In this cohort, PIPs were associated with  extent, inflammation, and higher rates of colectomy. However, the presence of PIPs was not associated with the development of neoplasia. These findings suggest that patients with PIPs may not need an intensified surveillance strategy.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

HUMIRA Complete, a Patient Support Program (PSP), aims to reduce nonadherence in patients prescribed adalimumab (ADA). The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between participation in the PSP and prescription abandonment rates among ADA-treated patients.This longitudinal study using patient-level data from AbbVie's PSP linked with medical and pharmacy claims data included patients ≥18 years with an ADA-approved indication, ≥1 pharmacy claim for ADA, and available data ≥3 months before and ≥6 months after the index date (defined as the initial ADA claim [01/2015 to 02/2017]). Abandonment was defined as reversal of initial ADA prescription with no paid claim during 3-month follow-up. Abandonment rates were compared between PSP and non-PSP cohorts using multivariable logistic regression controlling for potentially confounding baseline characteristics.In 17,371 patients (9,851 PSP; 7,520 non-PSP), the overall abandonment rate was 10.8-16.8% across indications. The odds of ADA abandonment were 70% less for PSP vs non-PSP patients (5.6% vs 20.4%, odds ratio [OR]=0.30, [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.27-0.33] <0.001), 38% less for patients using specialty vs retail pharmacy (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.56-0.69, <0.001), 20% less for those with income of $50-99K vs $0-49K (OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.69-0.92, <0.01), and 78% greater for those with copayment of $26-100 vs $0-25 (OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.55-.05, <0.001).Participation in the PSP, higher income, and using a specialty pharmacy were associated with lower odds of abandoning ADA therapy, whereas increased copayments were associated with greater abandonment. PSPs should be considered to improve initiation of ADA therapy.© 2019 Brixner et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605115>Matrix-Delivered Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Refractory Rectovaginal Crohn's Fistulas.</a></h1><p>Crohn's rectovaginal fistulizing  remains notoriously difficult to treat. A phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel protocol using a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-coated Gore Bio-A fistula plug for the treatment of medically and surgically refractory Crohn's rectovaginal fistulas was conducted.Five patients underwent an autologous subcutaneous adipose tissue harvest via a -cm abdominal wall incision at time of exam under anesthesia (EUA) with seton placement. MSCs were isolated, expanded, and impregnated on the plug. After 6 weeks, patients returned to the operating room for placement of the MSC-coated plug. The primary end points were safety and feasibility; the secondary end point was clinical and radiographic healing at 6 months.Five female patients (median age [range], 49 [38-53] years) with a median  duration (range) of 23 (7-34) years who were on biologic (n = 5) or combination therapy (n = 3) had successful harvest and expansion of MSCs and delivery of the Gore Bio-A plug. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events related to the MSCs or plug during the 6-month follow-up. At 6 months, 3 patients had complete cessation of drainage, and  had >50% reduction in drainage; all had a persistent fistula tract identified on magnetic resonance imaging and EUA at 6 months.Surgical placement of an autologous adipose-derived MSC-coated fistula plug in diverted patients with Crohn's rectovaginal fistulas was safe and feasible. All patients had a reduction in the size of their fistula tract, and 3 of 5 had cessation of drainage, but none achieved complete healing.This was a phase I clinical trial of autologous mesenchymal stem cells on a plug for rectovaginal Crohn's fistulas.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

STAT6 activation was detected in inflamed colonic epithelium of active IBD patients, suggesting a role of epithelial STAT6 in colitis development. Here, we demonstrated that non-hematopoietic STAT6, but not hematopoietic STAT6, triggered DSS-induced colitis and subsequent tumorigenesis. This could be due to the enhancing-effect of STAT6 on gut permeability and microbiota translocation via interruption of epithelial tight junction integrity. Mechanistically, long-myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK1) was identified as a target of STAT6, leading to epithelial tight junction dysfunction and microbiota-driven colitis. Furthermore, neutralization of IL-13, which was primarily derived from type  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) in a microbiota-dependent way, inhibited epithelial STAT6 activation and improved gut permeability and DSS-induced colitis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT6 reduces murine intestinal tumor formation, and tumoral p-STAT6 levels positively correlated to the clinical stage and poor prognosis of human colorectal cancer. Thus, our study reveals a direct role of STAT6 in the disruption of epithelial tight junction integrity and colitis development, and suggests STAT6 as a potential therapeutic and prophylactic target for IBD and colitis-associated cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670762>Early Discontinuation of Infliximab in Pregnant Women With .</a></h1><p>Early discontinuation of infliximab (IFX) in pregnant women with  (IBD) decreases the intrauterine fetal exposure to the drug but may increase the risk of  flaring leading to poor pregnancy outcomes. In this study, we assessed the impact of early IFX discontinuation on mother's  activity and on their at-risk babies.In a retrospective study of the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from 2011 to 2015, we compared IBD patients who discontinued IFX more than 90 days ("early IFX") with those who discontinue IFX 90 days or less ("late IFX) before delivery. We evaluated the risk of flaring, defined by new steroid prescriptions, visits to emergency room and/or hospital admissions, the pregnancy outcomes, and the at-risk babies.After IFX discontinuation, the early IFX group (68 deliveries) required significantly more steroid prescriptions than the late IFX group (318 deliveries) to control  activity (P < 001). There were more preterm babies in the early IFX group (P < 049), but no difference within the  groups was noticed in the rate of intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestation, and stillborn babies. Similarly, there was no increase in acute respiratory infections, development delays, and congenital malformations in babies of the mothers from the late IFX vs early IFX groups.Steroid-free remission IBD mothers are at risk for  flares and preterm babies when IFX is discontinued early in pregnancy. Continuation of IFX seems to be safe at least for the first year of life.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The hypothetical influence of IFX TDM was based on an optimal therapeutic range of 6-10 mg/L for mucosal healing.Secondary loss of response (reactive TDM) was the most common indication for TDM. These patients have consistently lower median IFX levels: 3.02 mg/L (IQR 1.14 - 6.67 mg/L) vs. 5.22 mg/L (IQR .70 - 8.12 mg/L), p = 0.0001 compared with patients in remission (proactive TDM). TDM helped to identify unnecessary use of IFX in 30.6% of the TDM tests performed in luminal Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis patients, with an associated drug cost saving of $531.38 per IFX TDM test episode. Unnecessary IFX use was identified in 38.9% (96/247) of reactive IFX TDM tests performed and in 19.3% (35/181) of proactive testing.Use of both reactive and proactive IFX TDM is cost-effective for IBD management as it informs the clinician where unnecessary use of IFX can be stopped.

For patients with moderate to severe UC and/or nonresponse to conventional treatment, advanced therapies (immunosuppressants and biologics) are available. We assessed real-world effectiveness of advanced UC therapies.This retrospective analysis of claims data included adult patients with UC initiating immunosuppressant or biologic therapy, with 12 months' continuous enrollment pre- and postinitiation. Patients had no prescription for biologic therapy (and/or immunosuppressant if initiating immunosuppressant) in the previous 12 months. Proportion of patients remaining steroid-free (excluding 14-week tapering period), hospitalizations, and costs in the 12 months postinitiation were assessed.In total, 3562 patients were included in the analysis. Most patients (83.0%) used steroids in the 12 months before initiating advanced therapy. Overall, 47.8% remained steroid-free after 12 months (excluding tapering). After adjusting for patient characteristics, remaining steroid-free was significantly more likely with infliximab (43.9%) than with adalimumab (39.4%; P < 0.05); golimumab (38.%) and vedolizumab (41.4%) were not significantly different vs adalimumab. Overall, 12.% of patients had a UC-related hospitalization within 12 months of initiation, with a mean (SD) total length of stay of 8. (8.9) days and no significant differences between biologic therapies. Mean, unadjusted, UC-related costs in the 12 months postinitiation were $42,579 and were similar between therapies.Patients with UC initiating advanced therapy frequently continued using steroids for at least a year.

Women in the adalimumab-exposed cohort had received at least one dose of the drug in the first trimester for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's  (N = 257). Women in the  comparison cohort had not used adalimumab in pregnancy (N = 120). Women in the healthy comparison cohort had no rheumatic or  (N = 225). Women and their infants were followed to one year postpartum with maternal interviews, medical records abstraction, and physical examinations. Study outcomes were major structural birth defects, minor defects, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, pre and post-natal growth deficiency, serious or opportunistic infections and malignancies. 42/602 (7.0%) of pregnancies were lost-to-follow-up. 22/221 (10.0%) in the adalimumab-exposed cohort had a live born infant with a major birth defect compared to 8/106 (7.5%) in the diseased unexposed cohort (adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to .73). Women in the adalimumab-exposed cohort were more likely to deliver preterm compared to the healthy cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] .59, 95% CI 1.22 to 5.50), but not compared to the diseased unexposed cohort (aHR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 7.20). No significant increased risks were noted with adalimumab exposure for any other study outcomes.Adalimumab exposure in pregnancy compared to diseased unexposed pregnancies was not associated with an increased risk for any of the adverse outcomes examined. Women with rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's  were at increased risk of preterm delivery, irrespective of adalimumab exposure.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566580>IFN-γ drives  pathogenesis through VE-cadherin-directed vascular barrier disruption.</a></h1><p> (IBD) is a chronic  disorder with rising incidence. Diseased tissues are heavily vascularized. Surprisingly, the pathogenic impact of the vasculature in IBD and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. IFN-γ is a major cytokine in IBD pathogenesis, but in the context of the , it is almost exclusively its immune-modulatory and epithelial cell-directed functions that have been considered. Recent studies by our group demonstrated that IFN-γ also exerts potent effects on blood vessels. Based on these considerations, we analyzed the vessel-directed pathogenic functions of IFN-γ and found that it drives IBD pathogenesis through vascular barrier disruption. Specifically, we show that inhibition of the IFN-γ response in vessels by endothelial-specific knockout of IFN-γ receptor  ameliorates experimentally induced colitis in mice. IFN-γ acts pathogenic by causing a breakdown of the vascular barrier through disruption of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. Notably, intestinal vascular barrier dysfunction was also confirmed in human IBD patients, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings. Treatment with imatinib restored VE-cadherin/adherens junctions, inhibited vascular permeability, and significantly reduced colonic inflammation in experimental colitis. Our findings inaugurate the pathogenic impact of IFN-γ-mediated intestinal vessel activation in IBD and open new avenues for vascular-directed treatment of this .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600487>HLA-DQA1*05 Carriage Associated With Development of Anti-Drug Antibodies to Infliximab and Adalimumab in Patients With Crohn's .</a></h1><p>Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies are the most widely used biologic drugs for treating immune-mediated , but repeated administration can induce the formation of anti-drug antibodies. The ability to identify patients at increased risk for development of anti-drug antibodies would facilitate selection of therapy and use of preventative strategies.We performed a genome-wide association study to identify variants associated with time to development of anti-drug antibodies in a discovery cohort of 1240 biologic-naïve patients with Crohn's  starting infliximab or adalimumab therapy. Immunogenicity was defined as an anti-drug antibody titer ≥10 AU/ml in a drug-tolerant ELISA assay. Significant association signals were confirmed in a replication cohort of 178 patients with .The HLA-DQA1*05 allele, carried by approximately 40% of Europeans, significantly increased the rate of immunogenicity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.60-.25; P=5.88×10). The highest rates of immunogenicity, 92% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with infliximab monotherapy who carried HLA-DQA1*05; conversely the lowest rates of immunogenicity, 10% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with adalimumab combination therapy who did not carry HLA-DQA1*05. We confirmed this finding in the replication cohort (HR, .00; 95% CI, 1.35-.98; P=6.60×10). This association was consistent for patients treated with adalimumab (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-.70) or infliximab (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.57-.33), and for patients treated with anti-TNF therapy alone (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-.22) or in combination with an immunomodulator (HR, .01; 95% CI, 1.57-.58).In an observational study, we found a genome-wide significant association between HLA-DQA1*05 and the development of antibodies against anti-TNF agents. A randomized controlled biomarker trial is required to determine whether pretreatment testing for HLA-DQA1*05 improves patient outcomes by helping physicians select anti-TNF and combination therapies.

It included 302 eligible patients aged 20 years or older who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery for CRC. Patients were randomly assigned to an intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) therapy group or to an IPC + anticoagulation therapy group. Anticoagulation therapy comprised fondaparinux or enoxaparin for postoperative VTE prophylaxis. Postoperative VTE was diagnosed based on enhanced multi-detector helical computed tomography. The primary endpoint was VTE incidence, including asymptomatic cases, the secondary endpoint was incidence of major bleeding, and we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in UMINCTR (UMIN000008435).Postoperative VTE incidence was 5.10% with IPC therapy (n = 157) and .76% with IPC + anticoagulant therapy (n = 145; =.293). We identified no symptomatic VTE cases. The major bleeding rates were 1.27% with IPC alone and 1.38% with the combination (=.936). The overall bleeding rates were 7.69% for enoxaparin and 13.6% for fondaparinux (=.500), and there were no bleeding-related deaths.Anticoagulant prophylaxis did not reduce the incidence of VTE and the incidence of major bleeding was comparable between the two groups. Usefulness of perioperative anticoagulation was not demonstrated in this study. Pharmacological prophylaxis must be restricted in Japanese patients with higher risk of VTE.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546668>TREM Receptors Connecting  Inflammation to Neurodegenerative Disorders.</a></h1><p>Alterations in Triggering Receptors Expressed on Myeloid cells (TREM-1/) are bound to a variety of infectious, sterile , and degenerative conditions, ranging from  (IBD) to neurodegenerative disorders. TREMs are emerging as key players in pivotal mechanisms often concurring in IBD and neurodegeneration, namely microbiota dysbiosis, leaky gut, and inflammation. In conditions of dysbiosis, compounds released by intestinal bacteria activate TREMs on macrophages, leading to an exuberant pro- reaction up to damage in the gut barrier. In turn, TREM-positive activated macrophages along with  mediators may reach the brain through the blood, glymphatic system, circumventricular organs, or the vagus nerve via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This leads to a systemic  response which, in turn, impairs the blood-brain barrier, while promoting further TREM-dependent neuroinflammation and, ultimately, neural injury. Nonetheless, controversial results still exist on the role of TREM- compared with TREM-1, depending on  specificity, stage, and degree of inflammation. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide an update on the role of TREMs in the pathophysiology of IBD and neurodegeneration. The evidence here discussed the highlights of the potential role of TREMs, especially TREM-1, in bridging  processes in intestinal and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593096>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a young patient with ulcerative colitis: A case report.</a></h1><p>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) represents one of the most alarming forms of hemostatic abnormalities that may occur in patients with  (IBDs).Here we report a case of a 25-year-old male with ulcerative colitis, who developed such thromboembolic complication during flare of the .

We investigated the role of DNAM-1 (co-activating)/TIGIT (co-inhibitory)/ligand axis in the regulation of T-cell functions and its involvement in IBD pathogenesis. We show that DNAM-1 and TIGIT display a peculiar expression pattern on gut mucosa T-cell populations, in a microenvironment where their shared ligands (PVR and Nectin-) are physiologically present. Moreover, DNAM-1 family receptor/ligand system is perturbed in IBD lesions, in a  activity-dependent manner. The expression profile of CCR6 and CD103 mucosa addressins suggests that microenvironment-associated factors, rather than skewed recruitment of circulating T-cell populations, play a more relevant role in supporting the establishment of DNAM-1 and TIGIT expression pattern in mucosal T-cell populations, and may explain its alteration in IBD. Although both co-receptors mark functionally competent T cells, DNAM-1 and TIGIT segregate on T cells endowed with different proliferative potential. Moreover, their opposing role in regulating T-cell proliferation exquisitely depends on ligand availability. All together, our data propose a role for DNAM-1 and TIGIT in regulating mucosal T-cell activation and immune homeostasis, and highlight the involvement of an imbalance of this system in IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580968>3D bioengineered tissue model of the large intestine to study .</a></h1><p>An in vitro model of intestinal epithelium with an immune component was bioengineered to mimic immunologic responses seen in . While intestinal immune phenomena can be modeled in transwells and 2D culture systems, 3D tissue models improve physiological relevance by providing a 3D substrate which enable migration of macrophages towards the epithelium. An intestinal epithelial layer comprised of non-transformed human colon organoid cells and a subepithelial layer laden with monocyte-derived macrophages was bioengineered to mimic native intestinal mucosa cell organization using spongy biomaterial scaffolds. Confluent monolayers with microvilli, a mucus layer, and infiltration of macrophages to the basal side of the epithelium were observed. Inflammation, induced by E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide and interferon γ resulted in morphological changes to the epithelium, resulting in ball-like structures, decreased epithelial coverage, and increased migration of macrophages to the epithelium. Analysis of cytokines present in the inflamed tissue model demonstrated significantly upregulated secretion of pro- cytokines that are often associated with active , including CXCL10, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-, and MIP-1β.

UC is estimated to afflict hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. In addition to traditional colonoscopy, ultrasonic techniques can detect colitis, but have limited spatial resolution, which frequently results in underdiagnoses. Nevertheless, clinical diagnosis of colitis is still generally performed via colonoscopy. Optical techniques such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been proposed to detect UC with higher resolution. However, UC can potentially alter tissue biomechanical properties, providing additional contrast for earlier and potentially more accurate detection. Although clinically available elastography techniques have been immensely useful, they do not have the resolution for imaging small tissues, such as in small mammalian  models. However, OCT-based elastography, optical coherence elastography (OCE), is well-suited for imaging the biomechanical properties of small mammal colon tissue.In this work, we induced elastic waves in  mouse colon tissue using a focused air-pulse. The elastic waves were detected using a phase-stabilized swept source OCE system, and the wave velocity was translated into stiffness. Measurements were taken at six positions for each sample to assess regional sample elasticity. Additional contrast between the control and diseased tissue was detected by analyzing the dispersion of the elastic wave and tissue optical properties obtained from the OCT structural image.The results show distinct differences (P<0.05) in the stiffness between control and colitis  samples, with a Young's modulus of 11.8±8.0 and 5.1±1.5 kPa, respectively. The OCT signal standard deviations for control and diseased samples were 5.8±0.3 and 5.5±0. dB, respectively. The slope of the OCT signal spatial frequency decay in the control samples was 92.7±10.0 and 87.3±4.7 dB∙µm in the colitis samples. The slope of the linearly fitted dispersion curve in the control samples was 1.5 mm, and 0.8 mm in the colitis samples.Our results show that OCE can be utilized to distinguish tissue based on stiffness and optical properties. Our estimates of tissue stiffness suggest that the healthy colon tissue was stiffer than diseased tissue. Furthermore, structural analysis of the tissue indicates a distinct difference in tissue optical properties between the healthy and UC-like diseased tissue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567711>Serum γ-globulin and albumin concentrations predict secondary loss of response to anti-TNFα in  patients.</a></h1><p>Loss of response to anti-TNFα treatment occurs frequently in IBD- patients. We evaluatedthe predictive value of serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations for treatment failure.Prospectively, all patients treated for the first time with either infliximab or adalimumab for IBD between 2007 and 2018 were included. All patients were tested for serum albumin and γ-globulin concentrations and were followed up until June 2018.128 patients (95 Crohn's , 67 females, age 40.1 ± 13.7 years) were included in the study. 81patients (63.3%) received infliximab and 47 (36.7%) adalimumab first line. Eight patients (6.3%) were primary non-responders, 50 patients (39.0%) showed a sustained clinical remission and 70 patients (54.7%) developed a secondary loss of response. Meantime to develop secondary loss of response was 24.5 ± 20.5 months. Albumin serum concentrations in the clinical response group were significantly higher than in the secondary loss of response group (39.8 ± 5.7 g/L vs. 35.0 ± 5.4 g/L). γ-globulin serum concentrations in the sustained response group were significantly lower than in the secondary loss of response group (11.8 ± .8 g/L vs. 14.7 ± 4.5 g/L). Hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia were associated with the loss of response. Immunosuppressant co-medication in patients with high γ-globulin serum concentrations reduced the risk of secondary loss of response.Low albumin and increased γ-globulin serum concentrations are strongly associated with a higher risk for loss of response to an anti-TNFα treatment. Increased serum γ-globulin concentrations may have a higher risk to produce anti-drug antibodies or a different phenotype of  less responsive to anti-TNFα treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614035>The influence of self-criticism on depression symptoms among ambulatory patients with .</a></h1><p>Considering that self-criticism is an important process in the development and maintenance of depression, and taking into account the stigma associated with  (IBD), the present study aimed to analyse whether self-criticism exacerbates the relationships of depression symptoms with IBD symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame. The sample included 53 ambulatory IBD patients (66% females) with ages from 18 to 65. Moderation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. Self-criticism exacerbated the associations of depression with IBD symptoms (b = 0.01; standard error [SE] = 0.00; Z = 3.73; P < .001) and illness shame (b = 0.02; SE = 0.01; Z = .40; P = .016). For the same level of IBD symptomatology or chronic illness-related shame, those individuals who present more feelings of inadequacy towards the self, experience more symptoms of depression. This exacerbation effect is stronger when IBD symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame are more intense. A high self-critical IBD patient may view the illness and/or symptomatology as a flaw or error that should be self-corrected. Physicians and other health professionals should be attentive to these pathological mechanisms and should attempt to alleviate them. It may be beneficial to refer high self-critical patients to psychological care.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560042>Utilization of Diagnostic Imaging and Ionization Radiation Exposure Among an  Inception Cohort.</a></h1><p>Abdominal imaging is important in managing  (IBD). We characterized utilization of imaging and exposure to ionizing radiation.We enumerated abdominal diagnostic imaging in a population-based cohort of IBD patients between 1994 and 2016. Trends in utilization of abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound were characterized. Cumulative doses of ionizing radiation were compared between IBD patients and non-IBD controls and between Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Regression models were constructed to assess predictors of high ionizing radiation exposure.There were 72,933 incident cases of IBD. During the first 5 years of diagnosis, IBD patients were exposed to nearly 6-fold higher exposure to cumulative ionizing radiation attributable to abdominal imaging compared with non-IBD controls (18.6 mSv vs .9 mSv). Cumulative ionizing radiation exposure was higher in CD than UC (26.0 mSv vs 12.0 mSv; P < 0.001). Crohn's  patients were more than twice as likely as UC patients to exceed 50 mSv (15.6% vs 6.%; P < 0.001) and 100 mSV (5.0% vs .1%; P < 0.001). There was geographic variation in ionizing radiation exposure, and individuals of lower income were more likely to have high exposure. Utilization of abdominal MRI has increased substantially, peaking between 2007 and 2012 and increasing annually at 34%, which coincided with an annual % decline in the use of abdominal CT.Crohn's  patients are at highest risk for high exposure to ionizing radiation, with a subgroup receiving potentially harmful levels. Increasing utilization and access to abdominal MRI may alleviate exposure.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The conjunction of Vit-D as well as zinc levels and anti-TNF-α-trough concentrations (TC) has not yet been explored.To determine the association of serum Vit-D, zinc and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with clinical and biochemical remission and a possible correlation with serum TC and antibody levels of anti-TNF-α.Serum Vit-D and zinc levels as well as Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) TC during the maintenance phase of treatment were measured in 112 IBD patients. Statistical analysis were performed for clinical and biochemical remission.Vit-D and zinc deficiency were detected in 58 and 4.5% of the patients respectively. In IFX-treated patients, IFX-TC, Vit-D and CRP levels were associated independently with clinical remission with an OR of 20 (95% CI 1.3-333, p = 0.03), 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.7, p = 0.02) and 0.4 (95% CI 0.-0.8, p = 0.01) respectively. Serum IFX-TC and Vit-D levels correlated positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.001), while serum IFX-TC and CRP levels showed an inverse correlation (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Only -IFX-TC associated independently with biochemical remission with a threshold of 3.1 µg/mL. In ADA-treated patients, ADA-TC associated independently with clinical and biochemical remission with an OR of .5 (95% CI 1.1-5.0, p = 0.04) and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4, p = 0.03) respectively. The serum zinc level was associated neither with clinical nor with biochemical remission in either cohort.Our results indicate that serum Vit-D level may be a predictive marker in addition to drug trough levels in IBD patients treated with IFX. Furthermore, due to the correlation between serum IFX and Vit-D levels, Vit-D substitution should be conducted in patients with low Vit-D levels.© 2019 S.

We used conditional logistic regression, including adjustments for smoking, season, enlistment status, and deployment, to estimate relative odds of CD according to vitamin D levels and interactions between genetic factors and levels of vitamin D.Levels of vitamin D before diagnosis were not associated with CD in pre- (P trend=.65) or pre-1 samples (P trend=.84). However, we found an inverse correlation between CD and highest tertile of vitamin D level in post-diagnosis samples (P trend=.01; odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.86). Interactions were not detected between vitamin D levels and VDR or GC polymorphisms. We observed an association between VDR Taq1 polymorphism and CD (independent of vitamin D) (P=.02).In serum samples from military personnel with CD and matched controls, we found no evidence for an association between CD and vitamin D levels up to 8 years before diagnosis. However, we observed an inverse-association between post-diagnosis vitamin D levels and CD. These findings suggest that low vitamin D does not contribute to development of CD-instead, CD leads to low vitamin D.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Information about  control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing IBD management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among IBD patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the  Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by  activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45./44., the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05). Median work productivity impairment was 20% and 5% for CD and UC patients, respectively, and activity impairment was 30%, the latter being higher among patients with moderate to severe  activity compared to patients with mild or no  activity (75.0%  10.0%,  < 0.001). For CD/UC patients, respectively, 25.4%/.8% had at least one surgery, 38.3%/19.6% were hospitalized, and 70.7%/77.6% changed IBD treatment at least once during the last 3 years. The most common treatments at baseline were biologics (75.3%) and immunosuppressants (70.9%) for CD patients and 5-ASA compounds (77.5%) for UC patients.Moderate to severe IBD activity, especially among CD patients, is associated with a substantial impact on QoL, work productivity impairment and an increased number of IBD surgeries and hospitalizations in Brazil.©The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study was to report the rates and risk factors of  pouch conditions.This was a retrospective review of UC or IBD unspecified (IBDU) patients who underwent TPC with IPAA for refractory  or dysplasia between 2008 and 2017. Pouchoscopy data were used to calculate rates of  pouch conditions. Factors associated with outcomes in univariable analysis were investigated in multivariable analysis.Of the 621 patients more than 18 years of age who underwent TPC with IPAA between January 2008 and December 2017, pouchoscopy data were available for 386 patients during a median follow-up period of 4 years. Acute pouchitis occurred in 205 patients (53%), 60 of whom (30%) progressed to chronic pouchitis. Cuffitis and Crohn's -like condition (CDLC) of the pouch occurred in 119 (30%) patients and 46 (12%) patients, respectively. In multivariable analysis, female sex was associated with a decreased risk of acute pouchitis, and pre-operative steroid use and medically refractory  were associated with an increased risk; IBDU was associated with chronic pouchitis; rectal cuff length ≥ cm and medically refractory  were associated with cuffitis; age 45-54 at colectomy was associated with CDLC. Rates of pouch failure were similar in chronic pouchitis and CDLC patients treated with biologics and those who were not. pouch conditions are common.

Leukocyte migration inhibitors are considered as promising and potentially effective therapeutic agents to treat  and auto-immune disorders. In this study, based on previous trioxotetrahydropyrimidin based integrin inhibitors that suboptimally blocked leukocyte adhesion, twelve molecules with a modified scaffold were designed, synthesized, and tested in vitro for their capacity to block the transendothelial migration of immune cells. One of the molecules, namely, methyl 4-((-(tert-butyl)-6-((,4,6-trioxotetrahydropyrimidin-5(2H)-ylidene) methyl) phenoxy) methyl) benzoate, (compound 12), completely blocked leukocyte transendothelial migration, without any toxic effects on immune or endothelial cells (IC = .4 µM). In vivo, compound 12 exhibited significant therapeutic effects in  (IBD)/Crohn's , multiple sclerosis, fatty liver , and rheumatoid arthritis models. A detailed acute and chronic toxicity profile of the lead compound in vivo did not reveal any toxic effects. Such a type of molecule might therefore provide a unique starting point for designing a novel class of leukocyte transmigration blocking agents with broad therapeutic applications in  and auto-immune pathologies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Neutropenia represents major feature of GSD-Ib along with metabolic disturbances. Previous research in GSD-Ib patients did not reveal significant genotype-phenotype correlation. Our objective was to explore the frequency and severity of neutropenia and it's complications in relation to genotype of GSD-Ib patients.We estimated cumulative incidence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia, relation of genotype to absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and dynamics of ANC during serious bacterial infections (SBI) in a cohort of Serbian GSD Ib patients.

In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple . Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31560040>Onset of Ulcerative Colitis in a Patient with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver  (NAFLD): Dramatic Effect of Plant-based Diet for NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver  (NAFLD) develops in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's . However, there is scarce reporting on the onset of UC in patients with NAFLD. A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with UC and referred to us in 2019. His height was 166.0 cm, and body weight was 86.3 kg. The waist circumference was 93.7 cm (normal range <85) and triglyceride was 751 mg/dL. These findings, in addition to hypertension, resulted in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. HbA1c was normal. Ultrasonography disclosed severe fatty liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver  was diagnosed. He underwent 12 days of educational hospitalization for UC. A lacto-ovo-semi-vegetarian diet (1400 kcal/day), a kind of plant-based diet (PBD), was provided. He lost 4 kg, which was 4.6% of his base body weight. Triglyceride and total cholesterol decreased to the normal ranges. Transaminases and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase also decreased. His body weight decreased further after discharge. Follow-up ultrasonography indicated an improvement in hepatic enlargement. The shear wave velocity decreased from 1.11 to 0.88 m/s. His soft stool became normal stool by  months after discharge. Records of his health checkups revealed the presence of metabolic syndrome and abnormal liver function tests already in 2015. Thus, it was concluded that UC developed in a patient with NAFLD in this case. Plant-based diet has already been shown to be effective in  (IBD). In the present case, NAFLD parameters were dramatically improved by PBD. Whether the improvement was due to weight loss per se or due to weight loss with PBD is to be clarified.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Most QoC projects or consensus statements are designed from the health care professional point of view. Having QoC indicators designed for and fully evaluable by patients may provide a key tool for external evaluation of QoC improvement measures. The aim of the IQCARO project was to identify indicators to measure QoC from the IBD patient's point of view.An extensive review of the literature to identify indicators of QoC was performed; first the identified indicators were reviewed by a steering committee including patients, nurses, IBD specialists, and methodologists. Then  focus groups of IBD patients analyzed the QoC indicators to determine whether they could be understood and evaluated by patients. The final QoC indicators were selected by a group of IBD patients using a Delphi consensus methodology.An initial list of 54 QoC indicators was selected by the steering committee. The QoC indicators were evaluated by 16 patients who participated in  focus groups. They identified 21 indicators that fulfilled the understandability and evaluability requirements. The 10 most relevant QoC indicators were selected by 26 patients with IBD using a Delphi consensus. The selected items covered important aspects of QoC, including professionalism, patients' autonomy, information, accessibility, and continuity of care.The present Delphi consensus identified QoC indicators that are useful for developing and measuring improvement strategies in the management of IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

We used transcriptome-wide mRNA profiling to study gene expression in colon biopsies and paired whole blood samples. Using blood mRNA measurements, we fit a regression model for  state prediction that was validated in an independent test set of adult subjects (GSE3365).Ninety-eight children were recruited [39 Crohn's , 18 ulcerative colitis,  IBDU, 39 non-IBD]. There were 1,118 significantly differentially (IBD vs non-IBD) expressed genes in colon tissue, and 880 in blood.

Critically, we show that type  priming of lung tissue through increased mucin production inhibits the progression of a subsequent lung migratory helminth infection and limits its transit through the airways. These data show that infection by gastrointestinal-dwelling helminths induces a systemic innate mucin response that primes peripheral barrier sites for protection against subsequent secondary helminth infections. These data suggest that innate-driven priming of mucus barriers may have evolved to protect from subsequent infections with multiple helminth species, which occur naturally in endemic areas.© 2019 Campbell et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607366>Neuronal regulation of group  innate lymphoid cells and type  inflammation.</a></h1><p>Diverse infectious, , and environmental stimuli induce type  inflammation in the body.

In 53.5% of the cases, complications included , cytopenia, bronchiectasis, granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung  (ILD) and asthma. In their immunological evaluations, IgG, IgM, and IgA mean values were 474.8 ±214.1 mg/dl; 56.7 ±41.9 mg/dl; 35.3 ±58. mg/dl, respectively, and the vaccine response was positive in 64.% of the cases. In all age groups, absolute lymphocyte counts, naive (CD19+IgD+27-), nonswitch (CD19+IgD-27+) memory B cells were numerically higher when compared to the data of healthy children; however, although switch memory (CD19+IgD+27+) B cells were proportionally low in the 4-8 and 12-18 age groups, they were low both numerically and proportionally in the 8-12 age group. No statistically significant difference was found between the cases with complications and without complications. But the cases with pulmonary complications were compared within the group, the CD8 ratio was high but the IgA level was low in patients with bronchiectasis and CD3 was numerically and proportionally low in the cases with ILD compared to others. According to the Paris classification, 11/27 (40.7%) of the cases, 3/27 (11.1%) of them and 13/27 (48.%) of them were evaluated as MB0, MB1, and MB2, respectively.In genetic studies, TACI (trans-membrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand interactor - TNFRSF13B) mutation was found positive in 25% of the cases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616860>Transforming Access to Specialist Care for : The PACE Telemedicine Program.</a></h1><p>There are significant geographic disparities in the delivery of IBD healthcare in Ontario which may ultimately impact health outcomes. Telemedicine-based health services may potentially bridge gaps in access to gastroenterologists in remote and underserved areas.We conducted a needs assessment for IBD specialist care in Ontario using health administrative data. As part of a separate initiative to address geographic disparities in access to care, we described the development and implementation of our Promoting Access and Care through Centres of Excellence (PACE) Telemedicine Program. Over the first 18 months, we measured wait times and potential cost savings.We found substantial deficiencies in specialist care early in the course of IBD and continuous IBD care in regions where the number of gastroenterologists per capita were low. The PACE Telemedicine Program enabled new IBD consultations within a median time of 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-32 days) and visits for active IBD symptoms with a median time of 8.5 days (IQR, 4-14 days). Forty-five percent of new consultations and 83% of patients with active IBD symptoms were seen within the target wait time of two weeks. Telemedicine services resulted in an estimated cost savings of $47,565 among individuals who qualified for Ontario's Northern Travel Grant.The implementation of telemedicine services for IBD is highly feasible and can reduce wait times to see gastroenterologists that meet nationally recommended targets and can lead to cost savings.© The Author(s) 2018.

PubMed was searched for original articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I  occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for IBD, 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD. By screening the references, one paper for IBD was added. Finally, this led to 5, 9, and 8 pertinent papers respectively for IBD, CD, and CKD. Considering the papers on IBD and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for IBD, 4 for CD, and 5 for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both IBD and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for IBD and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each  only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's  among IBDs, in one algorithm.the results of this review indicate that case identification for IBD and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies. The same is not true for CKD, which requires further efforts, mainly to improve the detection of early stage patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648920>Impact of a medical interview on the decision to switch from originator infliximab to its biosimilar in patients with .</a></h1><p>To lighten the burden on health-care spending, switching from the infliximab originator to a biosimilar in patients with  (IBD) is advocated. However, the uptake of biosimilars lacks initiatives aimed at educating patients.To explore the impact of a gastroenterologist's interview on IBD patients' acceptance for switching from infliximab bio-originator Remicade® to its biosimilar CT-P13 Inflectra®.After the interview of 138 included patients, 120 properly responded to a self-administered questionnaire to collect consent about the switch and relevant data. French national IBD patients' association (Association François Aupetit) provided an information sheet on biosimilars.93 (67.0%) out of 138 and 82 (68.3%) out of 120 patients switched treatment. 114 (79.8%) had never heard about biosimilars. Paradoxically, having heard about biosimilars was associated with a poorer chance to switch (Odds Ratio OR [95% CI] = 0.13 [0.02-0.72]). On the contrary, the more satisfied about generics, the more patients accepted the switch (OR [95% CI] = 1.31 [1.01-1.69]). There were 1.47 (Relative Risk RR [95% CI] = 1.47 [1.07-.01]) times more chance to agree to the switch if the interview modified the patient's opinion on biosimilars.This study confirms that an organized information provided to the patient is a contributive way to enhance patient's acceptance of biosimilars in IBD.Copyright © 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Key cost-drivers of IBD health care expenditures include pharmaceuticals and unplanned care, but evolving treatment approaches have shifted these factors. We aimed to assess changes in cost of care, determine shifts in IBD cost-drivers, and examine differences by socioeconomic and insurance status over time.The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative database that collects data on health care utilization and expenditures from a nationally representative sample since 1998, was utilized. Adult subjects with IBD were identified by ICD-9 codes. To determine changes in per-patient costs or cost-drivers unique to IBD, a control population of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects was generated and matched in 1:1 case to control. Total annual health care expenditures were obtained and categorized as outpatient, inpatient, emergency, or pharmacy related. Temporal cohorts from 1998 to 2015 were created to assess change over time. Per-patient expenditures were compared by  state and temporal cohort using weighted generalized linear models.A total of 641 IBD subjects were identified and matched to 641 RA individuals. From 1998 to 2015, median total annual health care expenditures nearly doubled (adjusted estimate .20; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0) and were 36% higher in IBD compared with RA. In IBD, pharmacy expenses increased 7% to become the largest cost-driver (44% total expenditures). Concurrently, inpatient spending in IBD decreased by 40%. There were no significant differences in the rate of change of cost-drivers in IBD compared with RA.Per-patient health care costs for chronic  conditions have nearly doubled over the last 20 years. Increases in pharmaceutical spending in IBD may be accompanied by reduction in inpatient care. Additional studies are needed to explore patient-, -, system-, and industry-level cost mitigation strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

Our aims were to determine the incidence, duration of anemia, and rate of receipt of iron therapy among IBD patients and compare these with non-IBD patients.We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study among the US veteran population from January 2011 to September 2018.  patients who were not anemic at the time of first IBD medication were included and matched with non-IBD patients. We estimated the incidence of anemia, duration of time patients spent in an anemic state per year, and rate of anemia treatment among IBD and matched non-IBD patients.A total of 3114 IBD patients were included and matched to 5568 non-IBD patients. The incidence rate of anemia was 92.75 per 1000 person-years in the IBD group vs 51.18 per 1000 person-years in the non-IBD group. The mean (SD) number of anemia days per year in the IBD and non-IBD groups was 52.5 (82.1) and 27.3 (62.4), respectively (P ≤ 0.001). Although anemic IBD patients were more likely to receive iron therapy compared with non-IBD anemic patients, only 37% and .8% of anemic IBD patients received oral or intravenous iron therapy during follow-up, respectively. patients spent almost  months of each year of follow-up in an anemic state.

This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the risk of new onset IBD in patients with COPD and new onset COPD in IBD patients.We performed a systematic review of observational studies exploring the risk of both associations. Two independent reviewers explored the EMBASE, MEDLINE, LILACS and DOAJ databases, and the risk of bias was evaluated using the ROBBINS-I tool. Data from included studies was pooled in a random effect meta-analysis following a DerSimonian-Laird method. The quality of the evidence was ranked using GRADE criteria.Four studies including a pooled population of 1355 new cases were included. We found association between new onset IBD in COPD population. The risk of bias was low in most of them. Only one study reported tobacco exposure as a potential confounding factor. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for a new diagnosis of IBD in COPD patients was .02 (CI, 1.56 to .63), I = 72% (GRADE: low). The subgroup analyses for Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis yielded RRs of .29 (CI, 1.51 to 3.48; I = 62%), and 1.79 (CI, 1.39 to .29; I = 19%.), respectively.According to our findings, the risk of new onset IBD was higher in populations with COPD compared to the general population without this condition. Based on our analysis, we suggest a potential association between IBD and COPD; however, further research exploring the potential effect of confounding variables, especially cigarette smoking, is still needed.

Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor is a highly regulated, dynamic event in IBD pathogenesis. Using a lentivirus approach, NF-κB-regulated luciferase was expressed in patient macrophages, isolated from frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. Following activation, samples could be segregated into three clusters based on the NF-κB-regulated luciferase response. The ulcerative colitis (UC) samples appeared only in the hypo-responsive Cluster 1, and in Cluster . Conversely, Crohn's  (CD) patients appeared in all Clusters with their percentage being higher in the hyper-responsive Cluster 3. A positive correlation was seen between NF-κB-induced luciferase activity and the concentrations of cytokines released into medium from stimulated macrophages, but not with serum or biopsy cytokine levels. Confocal imaging of lentivirally-expressed p65 activation revealed that a higher proportion of macrophages from CD patients responded to endotoxin lipid A compared to controls. In contrast, cells from UC patients exhibited a shorter duration of NF-κB p65 subunit nuclear localization compared to healthy controls, and CD donors. Analysis of macrophage cytokine responses and patient metadata revealed a strong correlation between CD patients who smoked and hyper-activation of p65. These  dynamic assays of NF-κB activation in blood-derived macrophages have the potential to segregate IBD patients into groups with different phenotypes and may therefore help determine response to therapy.Copyright © 2019 Papoutsopoulou, Burkitt, Bergey, England, Hough, Schmidt, Spiller, White, Paszek, Jackson, Martins Dos Santos, Sellge, Pritchard, Campbell, Müller and Probert.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622737>Risk Factors Associated With Early-onset Colorectal Cancer.</a></h1><p>The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in individuals younger than 50 years, who do not usually undergo screening if they are of average risk. We sought to identify risk factors for CRC in this population.We compared sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 18-49 years (early-onset) with patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 50 years or older (late-onset) and with age-matched, cancer-free individuals (controls) at a tertiary academic hospital. We collected data from all adult patients with a diagnosis of CRC from January 1, 2011 through April 3, 2017 from electronic health records. Associations with risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We identified 269 patients with early-onset CRC, 2802 with late-onset CRC, and 1122 controls. Compared with controls, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39-.51), have  (IBD) (3% vs 0.4% for controls; univariable P<.01), and have a family history of CRC (OR, 8.61; CI, 4.83-15.75). Prevalence values of well-established modifiable CRC risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and diabetes, were similar. Compared to patients with late-onset CRC, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), black (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08-.65) or Asian (OR, .60; 95% CI, 1.57-4.15), and have IBD (OR, .97; 95% CI, 1.16-6.63) or a family history of CRC (OR, .87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.25). Sensitivity analyses excluding IBD and family history of CRC showed comparable results. Early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset  to be detected in the left colon or rectum (75% vs 59%, P=.02) and at a late stage of tumor development (77% vs 62%, P=.01).In a retrospective study of patients with early-onset CRC vs late-onset CRC or no cancer, we identified non-modifiable risk factors, including sex, race, IBD, and family history of CRC, to be associated with early-onset CRC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The aim of this study is to better characterize this possible association by conducting a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of relevant literature until April 30, 2019, was performed. Data on HZ infection and medications in patients with IBD and controls were extracted. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the source of heterogeneity. Seven cohort studies were included that involved more than 1,000,000 participants. The RR of HZ infection in patients with Crohn's  (CD) compared with non-CD patients was 1.74 (95% CI 1.57-1.92, p < 0.001). The pooled RR of HZ infection in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) compared with non-UC was 1.40 (95% CI 1.31-1.50, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that age, race, and publication year contribute to heterogeneity. We also found that steroid users were at increased risk of HZ in CD (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-.88). Steroid users and anti-TNFα users were at increased risk of HZ in UC, with RRs of 1.99 (95% CI 1.64-.42) and .29 (95% CI 1.52-3.45), respectively. Begg's test and Egger's test suggested no publication bias. There was a 74% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with CD and 40% increased risk of HZ infection in patients with UC compared with that in non-IBD.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of , irritable  syndrome, and non-alcohol fatty liver .An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × .0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata. Large and well-designed studies are required to confirm the role of FMT in alopecia areata.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Codon 139 variants are frequently observed in Asians, while multiple variants are seen in codon 18 which also cause AEs including the European ancestry. The purpose of this study is to establish a technique capable of the simple genotyping of NUDT15 codon 18 and to evaluate its efficacy.A high-resolution melt (HRM) technique is performed to simply determine genotypes. The accuracy of HRM analysis was evaluated with DNAs from 1245 Japanese patients with . Subsequently, another group of 572 patients was analyzed to verify the method. The diplotypes and the frequency of their AEs were estimated on the basis of codon 18 and 139 genotypes.The HRM analysis enabled the correct identification of the three main genotypes, ref/ref, ref/ins, and ref/V18I, in 1236 of 1241 cases. All rare genotypes including ref/del were identified as the impossible-to-determine group, the proper diagnosis rate was 99.6%.

By estimating diplotypes using both codon 18 and 139 genotypes, .74% and .13% of Japanese patients with Arg/Arg and Arg/Cys of codon 139 have a lower enzymatic activity of NUDT15 and a higher risk for adverse responses than those estimated by codon 139 genotypes alone.Our study showed that HRM method enables simple genotyping of complicated codon 18 variants essential to haplotype estimation of the NUDT15.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605016>Differential regulation of claudin- and claudin-15 expression in children and adults with malabsorptive .</a></h1><p>Intestinal Na-nutrient cotransport depends on claudin- and claudin-15 mediated Na recycling. Expression of these proteins is coordinately regulated during postnatal development. While expression of claudin- and claudin-15 has been studied in  (IBD) and celiac  (CD), it has not been assessed in other malabsorptive , and no reports have compared expression in children and adults. We used quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy to assess claudin- and claudin-15 expression in duodenal biopsies from children and adults with malabsorptive  and healthy controls. Consistent with previous work in rodents, claudin- expression in healthy children was markedly greater, and claudin-15 expression was less, than that in adults. Claudin- expression was increased in adults with CD and downregulated in children with graft-versus-host  (GVHD). In contrast, claudin-15 expression was reduced in adults with GVHD and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). These data show that one of the two Na/water pore-forming claudins is upregulated in CD and downregulated in GVHD and CVID. The specific claudin whose expression changes, however, reflects the age of the patient (child or adult). We conclude that contributions of claudin- and claudin-15 to pathophysiology of and responses to diarrhea in children and adults with GVHD and CVID differ from those in CD and IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617572>Substrate-based kinase activity inference identifies MK2 as driver of colitis.</a></h1><p> (IBD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder that has few treatment options due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of its molecular pathogenesis.

This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase  (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active colitis with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced  signaling in the colon and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in IBD and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the .© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

GCs are also widely used in anti-/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of , but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/ changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after  wk. The mechanism may involve augmented  signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term. Future studies are required to assess the impact of  deletion in other conditions such as experimental colitis.-Aranda, C. J., Arredondo-Amador, M., Ocón, B., Lavín, J. L., Aransay, A.

Recruitment to bacteria-containing endosomes and other intracellular membranes is required for NOD1/ signaling, and NOD1/ mutations that disrupt membrane localization are associated with  and other  conditions. However, little is known about this recruitment process. We found that NOD1/ S-palmitoylation is required for membrane recruitment and immune signaling. ZDHHC5 was identified as the palmitoyltransferase responsible for this critical posttranslational modification, and several -associated mutations in NOD2 were found to be associated with defective S-palmitoylation. Thus, ZDHHC5-mediated S-palmitoylation of NOD1/ is critical for their ability to respond to peptidoglycans and to mount an effective immune response.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

We conducted this study to assess whether sarcopenia predicts the need for surgery and postoperative complications in patients with IBD. We performed a systematic search of four electronic databases, last updated in March, 2019. Data from studies comparing rates of surgery and postoperative complications in sarcopenic IBD patients versus non-sarcopenic IBD patients were pooled with the random-effects models. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Ten studies with a collective total of 885 IBD patients were included in our meta-analysis. Although the analysis of raw data did not reveal significant differences between the two groups with respect to the rate of surgery and postoperative complications (OR = 1.826; 95% CI 0.913-3.654; p = 0.089 and OR = 3.265; 95% CI 0.575-18.557; p = 0.182, respectively), the analysis of adjusted data identified sarcopenia as an independent predictor for both of the undesirable outcomes (OR = .655; 95% CI 1.121-6.336; p = 0.027 and OR = 6.097; 95% CI 1.756-21.175; p = 0.004, respectively).

Head-to-head trials of these therapies in patients with  are lacking.In a phase 3b, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial conducted at 245 centers in 34 countries, we compared vedolizumab with adalimumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis to determine whether vedolizumab was superior. Previous exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor other than adalimumab was allowed in up to 25% of patients. The patients were assigned to receive infusions of 300 mg of vedolizumab on day 1 and at weeks , 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46 (plus injections of placebo) or subcutaneous injections of 40 mg of adalimumab, with a total dose of 160 mg at week 1, 80 mg at week , and 40 mg every  weeks thereafter until week 50 (plus infusions of placebo). Dose escalation was not permitted in either group. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 52 (defined as a total score of ≤ on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe ] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components). To control for type I error, efficacy outcomes were analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure, with the variables in the following order: clinical remission, endoscopic improvement (subscore of 0 to 1 on the Mayo endoscopic component), and corticosteroid-free remission at week 52.A total of 769 patients underwent randomization and received at least one dose of vedolizumab (383 patients) or adalimumab (386 patients). At week 52, clinical remission was observed in a higher percentage of patients in the vedolizumab group than in the adalimumab group (31.3% vs. 22.5%; difference, 8.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], .5 to 15.0; P = 0.006), as was endoscopic improvement (39.7% vs. 27.7%; difference, 11.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3 to 18.5; P<0.001). Corticosteroid-free clinical remission occurred in 12.6% of the patients in the vedolizumab group and in 21.8% in the adalimumab group (difference, -9.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -18.9 to 0.4). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection were 23.4 and 34.6 events per 100 patient-years with vedolizumab and adalimumab, respectively, and the corresponding rates for serious infection were 1.6 and . events per 100 patient-years.In this trial involving patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, vedolizumab was superior to adalimumab with respect to achievement of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement, but not corticosteroid-free clinical remission.

A retrospective cohort study was performed. The data of patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer and ostomy using the auxiliary incision in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2010 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria: (1) patient underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before operation; () patient was classified as tumor stage II or III; (3) patient was followed up and underwent stoma closure at our center; (4) ostomy was performed through specimen extraction incision. Patients with multiple gastrointestinal carcinomas or  were excluded. Two hundred and eight patients were included in the study and divided into the LI group (=86) and LTC group (=122). The operation parameters and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.  There were 135 males and 73 females (1.85∶1.00). Mean age of the 208 patients was (59.6±11.6) years (range 29-85 years). There were no significant differences between LI and LTC groups in baseline data (all >0.05). All of the patients completed surgery successfully. The severe complication rate after ostomy was .9% (6/208). In the fecal diversion period, LI group showed significantly faster defecation [(1.6±1.0) days vs. (.±1.9) days, =-.918, =0.004] and lower incidence of parastomal hernia [8.1% (7/86) vs. 19.7% (24/122), χ()=5.290, =0.021], but higher incidence of peristomal dermatitis [18.6% (16/86) vs. 4.9% (6/122), χ()=9.990, =0.002] as compared to LTC group. The incidence of renal insufficiency was lower in LTC group, though the difference was not significant [4.9% (6/122) vs. 10.5% (9/86), χ()=.320, =0.128]. The severe complication rate after stoma closure was 1.9% (4/208). In the stoma closure period, a significantly higher incidence of wound infection was noted in LTC group [18.0% (22/122) vs. 4.7% (4/86), χ()=8.258, =0.004]. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of anastomotic leakage, stenosis, and incisional hernia (all >0.05). All complications were improved after treatment.  Both LI and LTC through auxiliary incision following laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer are safe and feasible.

Recently, it has been found that oral microbiota are involved in arthritis pathogenesis. Microbiome composition and its functional implications have been associated with the prevention of bone loss and/or reducing fracture risk. The link between gut-oral microbiota and joint inflammation in animal models of arthritis has been established, and it is now receiving increasing attention in human studies. Recent papers have demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut and oral microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). These alterations resemble those established in systemic  conditions (, spondyloarthritides, and psoriasis), which include decreased microbial diversity and a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties. An association between abundance of oral  and intestinal  in RA patients compared to healthy controls has been clearly demonstrated. These new findings open important future horizons both for understanding  pathophysiology and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. The changes and decreased diversity of oral and gut microbiota seem to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of RA and OA. However, specific microbial clusters and biomarkers belonging to oral and gut microbiota need to be further investigated to highlight the mechanisms related to alterations in bones and joints  pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531732>Outcomes of  surgery in obese versus non-obese patients: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Obesity is considered a risk factor for many chronic  and obese patients are often considered higher risk surgical candidates.

A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager software to create forest plots and calculate odds ratios and mean differences.Four thousand three hundred and eleven patients from five observational studies were included. Obese patients were older at the time of surgery and more likely to have diabetes. Obese patients had longer operative times (MD 23.28, 95% CI 14.63-31.93, p < 0.001), higher intra-operative blood loss (MD 45.32, 95% CI 5.89-84.76, p = 0.02), longer length of stay (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.60-1.20, p < 0.001), higher wound infection rates (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-.23, p < 0.001), and higher total postoperative complication rates (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04-1.70, p = 0.02).Obesity is associated with significantly worse outcomes following IBD-specific surgery, including longer operative times, greater blood loss, longer length of stay, higher wound infection rates, and higher total postoperative complication rates.

To systematically characterize this response, we analyzed 58,067 immune cells from the mouse small intestine by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) at steady state and after induction of a type   reaction to ovalbumin (OVA). Computational analysis revealed broad shifts in both cell-type composition and cell programs in response to the inflammation, especially in group  innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Inflammation induced the expression of exon 5 of Calca, which encodes the alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (α-CGRP), in intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. α-CGRP antagonized KLRG1 ILC2s proliferation but promoted IL-5 expression. Genetic perturbation of α-CGRP increased the proportion of intestinal KLRG1 ILC2s. Our work highlights a model where α-CGRP-mediated neuronal signaling is critical for suppressing ILC2 expansion and maintaining homeostasis of the type  immune machinery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Binding of hsa-miR-375 to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Changes in the viability and apoptosis in Caco- cells influenced by hsa-miR-375 were examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulatory effect of hsa-miR-375 on the intestinal epithelial barrier was examined by detecting transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and lucifer yellow flux. Relative levels of TLR4, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and  factors in Caco- cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Hsa-miR-375 was downregulated in intestinal mucosa tissues of patients with Crohn's  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 decreased viability and TEER, but elevated apoptotic rate and lucifer yellow flux. Overexpression of hsa-miR-375 achieved the opposite trends. TLR4 was the direct downstream of hsa-miR-375, and its level was negatively mediated by hsa-miR-375. In addition, TLR4 level in Caco- cells was upregulated after LPS induction, while hsa-miR-375 level was unchangeable. Knockdown of hsa-miR-375 upregulated NF-κB and pro- factors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and downregulated ZO-1, occludin and anti- factor IL-10.Hsa-miR-375 is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD by upregulating TLR4 and inducing NF-κB activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648922>Recent developments and advances in atopic dermatitis and food allergy.</a></h1><p>This review highlights recent advances in atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA), particularly on molecular mechanisms and  endotypes, recent developments in global strategies for the management of patients, pipeline for future treatments, primary and secondary prevention and psychosocial aspects.

Growing evidences support the existence of exposure-response relationship with Vedolizumab, but the utility and the appropriate use of TDM in clinical practice is still under debate. In this review, we summarize all evidences supporting a TDM-guided approach for patients treated with Vedolizumab, suggesting three potential scenarios: 1) early prediction of long-term outcomes; ) verifying the best strategy in case of loss of response, 3) maximizing therapeutic efficacy during maintenance treatment. Vedolizumab through concentrations < 20 μg/ml at week 6 and > 12 μg/ml seem to be associated with more favourable outcomes. No comparative studies have been conducted so far to demonstrate the advantage of adopting a TDM-guided versus an empirical approach for managing primary or secondary non responses.The frequency of antibodies to Vedolizumab detection is quite low (up to 4% in pivotal trials), suggesting, unlike of anti TNF-α agents, a low probability of experiencing an immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure in clinical practice.

We chose clinically relevant endpoints covering the intra- and postoperative course. Complications were graded by severity using the comprehensive complication index. Benchmark values were defined as the 75th percentile of the participating centers' median values for respective quality indicators.Patients were mainly females (78%), aged 38±11 years, with a baseline BMI 40.8 ± 5.8 kg/m. Over 90 days, 7.% of RYGB and 6.% of SG patients presented at least 1 complication and no patients died (mortality in nonbenchmark cases: 0.06%).

The most popular questionnaires used in empirical research around the world are the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for women and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) for men. Sexual satisfaction was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, sexual problems, and illness perceptions. When analysing the problem of IBD, disorders of sexual function should not be ignored. Patients should be screened for psychological  and sexual dysfunction, and necessary treatments should be given as soon as possible.

Our recent study demonstrated that lower body weight, lower peripouch fat, family history of  (IBD), female gender, and dyschezia are risk factors for FPC patients with IBD. The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between pouch wall thickness and FPC, and to investigate the association between inflamed and non-inflamed pouch wall thickness.This case-control study included all eligible patients with FPC from our prospectively maintained, IRB-approved Pouchitis Registry from 2011 to 2017. We measured pouch wall thickness of fully distended pouches on cross-sectional abdominal and pelvic imaging. Patients with stoma and non-distended pouches were completely excluded. Risk factors for FPC were analyzed.A total of 140 out of 451 patients from our were found to have fully distended pouches on imaging. Of the 140 patients, 36 (25.7%) were diagnosed as having FPC. We analyzed pouch wall thickness for each subcategory of FPC as well as non-FPC conditions. The thickness of pouch wall was follows: pouch prolapse (N = 19): 1.5 mm (1.5-.0), afferent limb syndrome (N = 12): 1.5 mm (1.1-.0), folded pouch (N = 4): 1.5 mm (1.1-1.9), and redundant pouch (N = ): 1.3 mm (1.0-1.3). The control group (N = 104) consisting of normal pouch, pouchitis, cuffitis, Crohn's  of the pouch, and pouch sinus with median pouch wall thickness of 1.5 mm, .3 mm, .0 mm, .0 mm, and 1.5 mm, respectively. There were significant differences in pouch wall thickness between normal or non-inflamed pouch versus pouchitis versus cuffitis versus Crohn's  of the pouch with p values of 0.01, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.049, respectively.Patients with FPC were shown to have thin pouch wall, which those with  conditions of the pouch tended to have thick pouch wall. These findings will have implications in both diagnosis and investigation of etiopathogenesis of these disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569788>Anti- Mechanisms of Koreanaside A, a Lignan Isolated from the Flower of , against LPS-Induced Macrophage Activation and DSS-Induced Colitis Mice: The Crucial Role of AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT Signaling.</a></h1><p>The current treatment options for  (IBD) are unsatisfactory. Therefore, novel and safer therapies are needed. We previously reported that koreanaside A (KA) showed high radical scavenging activity and suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in its anti- effect have not been reported. KA inhibited pro- mediators such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- (COX-), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E (PGE). KA inhibited the production and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induced by LPS. KA downregulated the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent  gene expressions in the MyD88-overexpressed cells. KA suppressed the LPS-induced transcriptional and DNA-binding activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). KA was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1/ (JAK1/) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). In DSS-induced colitis mice, KA relieved the symptoms of colitis by suppressing  cell infiltration, restoring tight junction (TJ)- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression, and inactivating AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT1/3. Therefore, KA reduced  responses by downregulating AP-1, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT signaling in LPS-induced macrophages and DSS-induced colitis mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595533>Assessment of steroid use as a key performance indicator in -analysis of data from 2385 UK patients.</a></h1><p>Patients with IBD are at risk of excess corticosteroids.To assess steroid excess in a large IBD cohort and test associations with quality improvement and prescribing.Steroid exposure was recorded for outpatients attending 19 centres and associated factors analysed. Measures taken to avoid excess were assessed.Of 2385 patients, 28% received steroids in the preceding 12 months. 14.8% had steroid excess or dependency. Steroid use was significantly lower at 'intervention centres' which participated in a quality improvement programme (exposure: 23.8% vs 31.0%, P < .001; excess 11.5% vs 17.1%, P < .001). At intervention centres, steroid use fell from 2015 to 2017 (steroid exposure 30.0%-23.8%, P = .003; steroid excess 13.8%-11.5%, P = .17). Steroid excess was judged avoidable in 50.7%. Factors independently associated with reduced steroid excess in Crohn's  included maintenance with anti-TNF agents (OR 0.61 [95% CI 0.24-0.95]), treatment in a centre with a multi-disciplinary team (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.20-0.86]) and treatment at an intervention centre (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.46-0.97]). Treatment with 5-ASA in CD was associated with higher rates of steroid excess (OR 1.72 [95% CI 1.24-.09]). In ulcerative colitis (UC), thiopurine monotherapy was associated with steroid excess (OR 1.97 [95% CI 1.19-3.01]) and treatment at an intervention centre with less steroid excess (OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.45-0.95]).This study validates steroid assessment as a meaningful quality measure and provides a benchmark for this performance indicator in a large cohort.

It is not feasible to identify patients at risk of antibody formation before initiating infliximab. The genetic variation HLADQA1*05 (rs2097432) has been linked to infliximab antibody formation in Crohn's  (CD).To evaluate the association between HLADQA1*05 and infliximab antibody formation, infliximab loss of response, treatment discontinuation and adverse drug events in patients with  (IBD) METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, infliximab-exposed patients with IBD (n = 262) were screened for the genetic variation, HLADQA1*05A>G (rs2097432). Risk of infliximab ADA formation, infliximab loss of response, adverse events and discontinuation were assessed in wild-type (GG) and variant-carrying (AG or AA) individuals.Forty per cent of all participants were HLADQA1*05A>G variant carriers, with 79% of participants with infliximab antibodies carrying at least one variant allele. The risk of infliximab antibody formation was higher in HLADQA1*05A>G variant carriers (adjusted HR = 7.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = .97-17.191, P = 1.46 × 10 ) independent of age, sex, weight, dose and co-immunosuppression with an immunomodulator. Variant carrier status was associated with an increased risk of infliximab loss of response (adjusted HR = .34, 95% CI = 1.41-3.88, P = .001) and discontinuation (adjusted HR = .27, 95% CI = 1.46-3.43, P = .53 × 10 ) although not with infliximab-associated adverse drug events.HLADQA1*05 is independently associated with a high risk of infliximab antibody formation in addition to infliximab loss of response and treatment discontinuation.

Opioid use continues to be more prevalent in IBD than any other chronic gastrointestinal condition, and the majority of IBD patients consume narcotics during hospitalization despite the risks of infection and death.We performed a retrospective review of 57 subjects aimed at quantifying pain and opiate consumption for IBD-related admissions over a 3-month period. For each patient, the average and maximum of each day's pain scores were used to measure changes in pain from admission to discharge using mixed model regression, with opiate use as a time-dependent covariate.The daily average pain score over the entire hospitalization was 4.23 ± .09, and the maximum pain score was 8.28 ± 1.75. Among opioid users (n = 51), the daily average pain score was 4.65 ± .16 and the maximum pain score was 7.53 ± .56. Across all cases from admission to discharge, there was less than a 1-point change in daily average pain (- 0.96 ± .03, p = 0.0009), and no change in maximum pain (- 0.89 ± 3.59, p = 0.0671). Opioid users, a subset of the overall cohort, had a similar less than one-point drop in daily average pain (- 0.94 ± - 0.29, p = 0.0024) and no change in daily maximum pain scores (- 0.81 ± - 0.47, p = 0.0914). Patients on average used 20 ± 25 mg morphine equivalents per day. Opioid-naïve patients used similar doses to those who used opioids prior to admission (PTA). Almost half of all cases (47%) were discharged with an opioid prescription, the majority (71%) of whom were not on opioids PTA.Pain in IBD is not well controlled through hospitalization, with less than a 1-point change from admission to discharge, despite significant opioid consumption. Alternative analgesic methods should be explored, given the significant impact of narcotics on long-term outcomes including mortality and quality of life.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638797>Rationally Designed, Conformationally Constrained Inverse Agonists of RORγt-Identification of a Potent, Selective Series with Biologic-Like in Vivo Efficacy.</a></h1><p>RORγt is an important nuclear receptor that regulates the production of several pro- cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22.

One class of such receptor-ligand pairs involves formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) that have been shown to influence  response and repair. Here we explored the role of murine Fpr2/3, an ortholog of human FPR2/receptor for lipoxin A4 (ALX), in orchestrating intestinal mucosal repair. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice,  mice exhibited delayed recovery from acute experimental colitis and perturbed repair after biopsy-induced colonic mucosal injury. Decreased numbers of infiltrating monocytes were observed in healing wounds from  mice compared with WT animals. Bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that  monocytes showed a competitive disadvantage when infiltrating colonic wounds. Moreover,  monocytes were defective in chemotactic responses to the chemokine CC chemokine ligand (CCL)20, which is up-regulated during early phases of inflammation. Analysis of  monocytes revealed altered expression of the CCL20 receptor CC chemokine receptor (CCR)6, suggesting that Fpr2/3 regulates CCL20-CCR6-mediated monocyte chemotaxis to sites of mucosal injury in the gut. These findings demonstrate an important contribution of Fpr2/3 in facilitating monocyte recruitment to sites of mucosal injury to influence wound repair.-Birkl, D., O'Leary, M.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful,  preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± .88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619405>Increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia following gastric conditions indicating Helicobacter pylori infection: a case-control study.</a></h1><p>Based on a previous report of increased chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) risk following peptic ulcer, we hypothesised that chronic Helicobacter pylori infection could serve as a risk factor for CML.In a population-based, retrospective case-control study we used Swedish registry data on 980 CML patients and 4 960 age- and sex-matched controls to investigate associations between markers of previous infection with Helicobacter pylori and CML incidence.Previous diagnoses of dyspepsia, gastritis or peptic ulcers, as well as previous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication, were all associated with a significantly increased risk of CML (relative risks 1.5-.0 p=0.0005-0.05). Meanwhile, neither  nor intake of non-steroid anti- drugs were associated with CML, indicating that it is not gastrointestinal ulcer or inflammation per se which influences risk.The consistent associations suggest a shared background between gastric conditions and CML, and strengthens the case that Helicobacter pylori could constitute this common risk factor.As the aetiology of CML is practically unknown, and Helicobacter pylori could potentially be a therapeutic target, even this indirect evidence encourages further studies on the potential involvement of Helicobacter pylori in CML aetiology.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31567639>Medical cannabis for : real-life experience of mode of consumption and assessment of side-effects.</a></h1><p>Use of medical cannabis for improving symptoms of  is increasing.

This prospective, observational study assessed the effects of licensed cannabis use among patients with .Dose and mode of consumption, adverse events, use of other medications, and long-term effects were evaluated among 127 patients with  using legalized medical cannabis. Blood count, albumin, and C-reactive protein were assessed before, 1 month, and at least 1 year after medical cannabis therapy was initiated. Questionnaires on  activity, patient function, and signs of addiction were completed by patients and by a significant family member to assess its effects.The average dose used was 31 ± 15 g/month. The average Harvey-Bradshaw index improved from 14 ± 6.7 to 7 ± 4.7 (P < 0.001) during a median follow-up of 44 months (interquartile range, 24-56 months). There was a slight, but statistically significant, average weight gain of  kg within 1 year of cannabis use. The need for other medications was significantly reduced.

It may confer a worse prognosis in colorectal cancer, but its importance in pT2N0 colorectal cancer is unknown. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of tumour budding in pT2N0 colorectal cancer.This was a retrospective cohort study with prospective assessment of tumour budding by  pathologists. We included all patients who underwent elective curative resection for pT2N0 colorectal cancer except those with hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes,  or positive resection margins, those who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and those who died within 90 days of operation. Patients were classified as having high-grade tumour budding (≥ 10 budding foci per high-power field) or low-grade tumour budding (< 9 budding foci per high-power field). The main outcome measure was locoregional or distant recurrence.Of 85 patients, 36 had high-grade tumour budding and 49 had low-grade tumour budding. The overall recurrence rate was 11% (9/85) and median follow-up was 41.0 months (interquartile range 22.0–68.0). Interrater reliability for tumour budding assessment was excellent (κ = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–0.96). There were more recurrences in patients with high-grade tumour budding (7/36, 19.4% v. /49, 4.1%; p = 0.020). On multivariate analysis, after we adjusted for confounders, the presence of high-grade tumour budding was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 5.11, 95% CI 1.01–25.9).Tumour budding was independently associated with increased recurrence after pT2N0 colorectal cancer resection.

Chemically induced colitis models are relatively easy and rapid to develop. The ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model is one of the main models in the experimental studies of  (IBD) since inflammation induced by TNBS mimics several features of Crohn's . This review aims to summarize the existing literature and discuss different protocols for the induction of chronic model of TNBS-induced colitis. We searched MEDLINE via Pubmed platform for studies published through December 2018, using MeSH terms (Crohn .kw) OR (.kw) OR (Colitis, Ulcerative.kw) AND (trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid.kw) AND ( models, animal.kw) AND (mice.all). The inclusion criteria were original articles, preclinical studies in vivo using mice, chronic model of colitis, and TNBS as the inducer of colitis and articles published in English. Chronic TNBS-induced colitis is made with multiple TNBS intrarectal administrations in an average dose of 1. mg using a volume lower than 150 μL in 50% ethanol. The strains mostly used are Balb/c and C57BL/6 with 5-6 weeks. To characterize the preclinical model the parameters more used include body weight, stool consistency and morbidity,  biomarkers like interferon (IFN)-γ, myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10, presence of ulcers, thickness or hyperemia in the colon, and histological evaluation of the inflammation.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco- cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco- cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and  conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating IBD-associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The primary end point in the induction trial (week 8) and the maintenance trial (week 44) was clinical remission (defined as a total score of ≤ on the Mayo scale [range, 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe ] and no subscore >1 [range, 0 to 3] on any of the four Mayo scale components).The percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 8 among patients who received intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of 130 mg (15.6%) or 6 mg per kilogram (15.5%) was significantly higher than that among patients who received placebo (5.3%) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients who had a response to induction therapy with ustekinumab and underwent a second randomization, the percentage of patients who had clinical remission at week 44 was significantly higher among patients assigned to 90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks (38.4%) or every 8 weeks (43.8%) than among those assigned to placebo (24.0%) (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events with ustekinumab was similar to that with placebo. Through 52 weeks of exposure, there were two deaths (one each from acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemorrhage from esophageal varices) and seven cases of cancer (one each of prostate, colon, renal papillary, and rectal cancer and three nonmelanoma skin cancers) among 825 patients who received ustekinumab and no deaths and one case of cancer (testicular cancer) among 319 patients who received placebo.Ustekinumab was more effective than placebo for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.

Developing novel efficient therapeutics is still a common interest for clinicians. Increasing evidence have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) contributes to the pathological pain state in some pain models. Resveratrol (RSV) has showed promising potential for the treatment of neuropathic pain and  pain. However, whether RSV has analgesic effect on visceral pain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we established the colitis model through intrarectal administration of ,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and found that TNBS induced colonic inflammation and visceral hypersensitivity. Meanwhile, astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), TRAF6, phosphorylation of NF-κB (pNF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were increased in L6-S1 spinal cord after TNBS enema. Then, intrathecal injection of TRAF6 siRNA attenuated visceral pain, blocked the upregulation of pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the spinal cord in TNBS mice. Furthermore, spinal administration of NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 reversed the pain behavior and suppressed spinal TNF-α and IL-1β expression in TNBS mice. Finally, repeated intrathecal injection of RSV reversed TNBS-induced visceral pain hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, TNBS-induced enhancement of spinal GFAP, TRAF6, pNF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were reduced by the same treatment of RSV. In conclusion, our results suggest that RSV exerts the effects of antinociception on colitis-induced visceral hyperalgesia through inhibition of spinal TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway and the production of  mediators in the spinal cord, suggesting a new application of RSV for the treatment of visceral pain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients (age 18-64) with UC in the United States to examine time trends for colectomy and biologic use from 2007 to 2016.We estimated quarterly rates for colectomy and biologic use using the IQVIA Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database. We used interrupted time series methods with segmented regression to assess time trends with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for biologic use and colectomy before and after the emergence of newly available biologic therapies in 2014.Among 93,930 patients with UC, 2275 (.4%) underwent colectomy from 2007 to 2016. Biologic use rates increased significantly from 2007 to 2016, from 131 per 1000 person-years in 2007 (95% CI, 121 to 140) to 589 per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 575 to 604; P < 0.001). Colectomy rates decreased significantly between 2007 and 2016, from 7.8 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.) to 4. per 1000 person-years in 2016 (95% CI, 3. to 5.1; P < 0.001). An interruption in 2014 was associated with a positive trend deflection for biologic use (+72 treatments per 1000 person-years per year (95% CI, 61 to 83) and a negative trend deflection for colectomy (-0.76 per 1000 person-years per year; 95% CI, -1.47 to -0.05).Among commercially insured patients in the United States from 2007 to 2016, biologic use rates increased, colectomy rates decreased, and both trends were impacted by the interruption in 2014.

These changes are directly related to the content of OMSW in the growing substrate. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-in-flammatory   (IBD) mice model, we measured the colonic  response to the different glucan preparations. We found that the histology damaging score (HDS) resulting from DSS treatment reach a value of 11.8 ± .3 were efficiently downregulated by treatment with the fungal extracted glucans. Glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 20% OMSW downregulated to a HDS value of 6.4 ± 0.5 whereas those cultivated at 80% OMSW showed the strongest effects (5.5 ± 0.6). Similar downregulatory effects were obtained for expression of various intestinal cytokines. All tested glucans were equally effective in regulating the number of CD14/CD16 monocytes from 18. ± .7% for DSS to 6.4 ± .0 for DSS + glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 50% OMSW. We tested the effect of glucans on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-α, which demonstrated that stalk-derived glucans were more effective than caps-derived glucans. Isolated glucans competed with anti-Dectin-1 and anti-CR3 antibodies, indicating that they contain β-glucans recognized by these receptors. In conclusion, the most effective glucans in ameliorating IBD-associated symptoms induced by DSS treatment in mice were glucan extracts prepared from the stalk of P. eryngii grown at higher concentrations of OMSW. We conclude that these stress-induced growing conditions may be helpful in selecting more effective glucans derived from edible mushrooms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641874>Efficacy of enteral nutrition in patients with Crohn's  on maintenance anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Enteral nutrition (EN) is effective in Crohn's  (CD) patients and has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on loss of response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibody therapy; however, the current level of evidence is not sufficient. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether EN in combination anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy is useful in maintaining remission. PubMed was used to identify all relevant studies. A total of nine articles were identified including one randomized control trial, two prospective cohort studies, and six retrospective cohort studies. We performed a meta-analysis on all these articles to assess the remission maintenance effect of EN (n = 857). The remission or response maintenance effect in the EN group was 203/288 (70.5%), which was higher than 306/569 (53.8%) in the non-EN group. The odds ratio for long-term remission or response using fixed effects model and random effects model were .23 (95% CI 1.60-3.10) and .19 (95% CI 1.49-3.22), respectively. The usefulness of EN was unclear in two prospective studies that were conducted immediately after remission induction with anti-TNF-alpha antibody therapy was detected. Differences in the definition of relapse and the observation period among articles were considered to be limitations. This analysis suggests that EN is effective for maintaining remission in patients already in remission or response as a result of anti-TNF-alpha antibody maintenance therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613459>Toxic Megacolon.</a></h1><p>Toxic megacolon is a rare, but potentially deadly complication of colonic inflammation.

We aimed to describe the U.S. experience with vedolizumab in a commercially insured population.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Quintiles-IMS Legacy PharMetrics Adjudicated Claims Database from May 2014 to June 2016. We included new vedolizumab users with Crohn  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) between 18 and 64 years with ≥12 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiating vedolizumab. Outcomes included treatment persistence >14 weeks, late steroid use, IBD-related surgery and infections associated with hospitalization. We built multivariable regression models to identify predictors of treatment persistence and late steroid use.We identified 269 CD and 187 UC vedolizumab initiators. Only 60% of CD patients and 56% of UC patients remained on vedolizumab after 14 weeks without IBD-related hospitalization, surgery, and corticosteroid use. There were no significant predictors of treatment persistence. Steroid use in the first  months of vedolizumab initiation was a significant predictor of late steroid use in CD (odds ratio: 23.34; 95% confidence interval: 5.10-153.89). In the 6 months after vedolizumab initiation, 1.9% of CD and 5.9% of UC patients had an IBD-related surgery. Serious infections were <4%.These data reflect the early U.S. experience with vedolizumab. The population-level response to vedolizumab therapy is just >50%. Steroids at the time of vedolizumab initiation is the strongest predictor of late steroid use in CD.

Parent-proxy report measures are standard for pediatric psychosocial assessment, and the IMPACT-III-P will provide a more comprehensive representation of HRQOL. Reliability and validity analyses were conducted.Parents (N = 50) of youth 8-17 years with IBD reported on their child's HRQOL (IMPACT-III-P and PedsQL-4.0) and depression (BASC-); youth reported on their HRQOL (child IMPACT-III), pain interference (PROMIS Pain Interference), and  symptoms; and physicians completed measures of  activity.Criterion validity was established as the IMPACT-III-P was strongly, positively associated with the PedsQL (r = .59, p < .001). Convergent validity was supported as higher IMPACT-III-P scores were associated with less pain interference (r = -.41, p < .01) and lower depression (r = -.41, p < .01). Discriminant validity was partially supported, as higher IMPACT-III-P scores were associated with lower child-reported symptoms (r = -.41, p < .01), but scores did not differ based on inactive, mild, or moderate/severe  activity groups as rated by physicians. Internal consistency, parent-child agreement, and item-level analyses revealed strong reliability.The IMPACT-III-P demonstrated strong validity and reliability.

Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death resulting from innate immune activation, termed pyroptosis, was recently found to be a cause of this barrier defect. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of pretreatment ileal biopsy pyroptosis as a biomarker for clinical response to vedolizumab in CD.Crohn's  patients ranging 18 to 80 years old from 5 IBD centers with pre-vedolizumab ileal biopsies during colonoscopy were enrolled. Biopsies were stained for activated caspases, and levels of ileal IEC pyroptosis levels were quantified. The primary outcome was clinical response 6 months after therapy, defined as a reduction of Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) of ≥5 points from baseline. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, defined as HBI <5, and endoscopic improvement, as measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's  (SES-CD).One hundred CD patients (45 male, 55 female), median age 47 (19, 78) years, were included; clinical response rate was 60%, and clinical remission was 36%. The response rate in patients with ileal pyroptosis <14 positive cells per 1000 IECs was significantly higher than those above the threshold: 89% (25 of 28) vs 49% (35 of 72), odds ratio (OR) 8.8 (95% CI, .3-48.6; P < 0.001). Corresponding remission rates were 54% (15 of 28) vs 29% (21 of 72; OR .8 [1.03-7.59; P = 0.036]). For endoscopic improvement, ileal pyroptosis of 22 positive cells per 1000 IECs was the optimal threshold that determines the magnitude SES-CD change.Ileal biopsy IEC pyroptosis was predictive of clinical response and endoscopic improvement to vedolizmab in CD patients.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

The clinical data of 161 children with IBD was collected from the electronic medical records in the Department of Pediatrics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine from January 2012 to December 2017. These patients were divided into Crohn's  (CD) group and ulcerative colitis (UC) group, accounting for 82.0% (132 cases) and 18.0%(29 cases), respectively. The incidence of EIMs in each group was analyzed. The potential risk factors of EIMs including the IBD phenotype, gender, age, location of the CD lesion,  activity of CD, and the presence of perianal lesion were analyzed with logistic regression model.  Eighty-eight patients (54.7%) had EIMs. The main EIMs were immune-mediated EIMs and growth retardation, accounting for 41.0% (66/161) and 24.% (39/161), respectively. Aphthous ulcer (39/161, 23.0%) was the most common symptom among immune-mediated EIMs, followed by arthropathy (20/161, 12.4%) and skin lesions (19/161, 11.8%). Forty-three patients (26.7%) had EIMs before being diagnosed as IBD. Fifty-eight (65.9%) patients had only one EIM during the whole course of IBD. By logistic regression analysis, CD (5.536, 95:1.825-16.788) and perianal  (1.969, 95:1.035-3.746) were the risk factors of immune-mediated EIMs. Meanwhile, CD (11.319, 95: 1.487-86.179), younger than six-year-old at diagnosis (8.556, 95: 3.109-23.545), moderate to severe activity of CD (3.447, 95: 1.196-9.934) and perianal  (3.361, 95: 1.720-7.793) increased the risk of growth retardation.

The nonradiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis ' activity has a comparable impact on the patients' quality of life and from the practical point of view the approach to treatment of each of them is the same. The aim: The attempt to identify the reasons of diagnostic delays of AS among patients hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue  Department in Lublin and to suggest the ways of improving the accuracy of diagnostic track among other healthcare providers than rheumatologists.Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of 82 patients' with the established diagnosis of AS, hospitalized in the Rheumatology and Connective Tissue  Department in Lublin in 2000-2019, and of 45 years of age and older.Results: From among 82 patients (28 women and 54 men) the diagnosis of AS after 45 years of age was established in 25 patients (10 women and 15 men) - group t, and in the other 57 patients (group n) the diagnosis was established before 45 years of age. On average the age at the time of diagnosis in the whole group (t+n) was 40,7±10, (18-76) years, the age at the beginning of  back pain (age of axial symptoms) was 30,9±8,5 (13-51) years and the diagnostic delay (period between first axial symptoms and diagnosis establishment) was 9,75±9,5 (0-46) years. We did not find any statistically significant associations between sex and age at the moment of diagnosis, age of the beginning of axial symptoms and the time of diagnostic delay. There was no significant difference of incidence of enthesitis, uveitis, arthritis, prevalence of family history of spondyloarthritis and CRP level between group t and n. Antigen HLA B27 was more frequently present in group t.Conclusions: Instead of the recognition progress and worldwide popularization of knowledge about axSpA, the diagnostic delays in this field are still estimated to last many years, the patients are looking for other specialists' help, and they can be not knowledgeable of the  back pain criteria. Currently, HLA B27 antigen and C-reactive protein are the two most commonly used biomarkers for diagnostic and  activity monitoring purposes of axSpA and magnetic resonance is the only "imaging biomarker".

Although higher drug trough levels (TLs) are associated with sustained clinical outcomes, there are concerns that they may be associated with a higher risk of adverse events (AEs). The aim was to evaluate the presence of a possible association between drug TLs and the occurrence of AEs in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF drugs.  We retrospectively studied a cohort of 113 IBD patients treated with adalimumab or infliximab, of whom 27 were in combination therapy with immunosuppressants. TLs were measured using a homogeneous mobility shift assay.  During a median follow-up of 16 months (range 1-144), we observed 103 AEs occurring in 58 patients. We found no statistically significant difference ( = .21) in median TLs between patients who did 6.7 mcg/mL; range 0.0-36.) or did not (7.7 mcg/mL; range 0.0-20.7) experience an AE. No difference was observed in the rate of AEs between patients in mono- or combination therapy ( = .38), as well as between elderly (i.e., >65 years) and younger patients ( = .32). Considering a TL cutoff of 7 mcg/mL for infliximab and 12 mcg/mL for adalimumab, or even double these TL values, we observed no statistically significant difference in the rate of AEs occurrence.  Our study suggests that, when clinically required, anti-TNF drug dosage may be increased without particular concerns regarding the risk of AEs occurrence in IBD patients, even in patients on combination therapy and elderly ones.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669514>Comparison of the Quantum Blue® Reader Point-of-Care system versus ELISA technique for therapeutic drug monitoring of Infliximab levels.</a></h1><p>Infliximab (IFX) is a monoclonal antibody used to treat patients with  (IBD). For IFX therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), the most commonly used analysis is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) which do not allow results to be provided in real-time. The aim of this study was to compare the in-house ELISA (Promonitor IFX) with the much faster assay Quantum Blue® IFX (QB) for quantification of serum IFX concentration among IBD patients in maintenance IFX therapy.We studied 30 serum samples from outpatients in IFX maintenance therapy at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark. Samples were used to compare IFX measurements from Promonitor IFX with QB. Therapeutic intervals of <3 μg/mL, 3-7 μg/mL and >7 μg/mL were equally covered. Differences were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and Student t-test. Correlation was evaluated using x,y-plot and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The intermediate imprecision (CV%) of QB was measured at two levels (3 μg/mL and 7 μg/mL). For qualitative comparison, weighted kappa statistics (κ) were determined after stratification of results by therapeutic interval.Promonitor IFX and QB were strongly correlated (r = 0.92, p<0.001). The mean difference between Promonitor IFX and QB was -0.57 μg/mL (p = 0.). The CV% of QB was 16.3% at 3 μg/mL and 16.7% at 7 μg/mL. Classification of results according to therapeutic interval showed almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.81).QB is a suitable alternative to Promonitor IFX for TDM in patients treated with IFX for IBD. The results revealed a strong correlation between methods, in particular at lower IFX concentrations, representing the most interesting clinical range. When the samples were stratified according to the therapeutic interval, an almost perfect agreement between the methods was observed.Copyright © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

This Mediterranean aromatic plant, used as a gastronomic spice and as food preservative by the food industry has been studied mainly due to its essential oil antibacterial properties, composed primarily by monoterpenes. With this work, we aimed to evaluate the effects of a phenolic extract of pennyroyal in the impairment of  processes in  (IBD) and in the potential inhibition of progression to colorectal cancer (CRC).To that purpose, we evaluated the effect of pennyroyal extract administration in a model of TNBS-induced colitis in mice and further determined its effect on human colon carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion.The phenolic extract of pennyroyal exhibited antioxidant properties in in vitro assays and administration of the extract in a rat model of carrageenan-induced paw oedema led to significant anti- effects. Further results evidenced a beneficial effect of the phenolic extract in the attenuation of experimental colitis and a potential antiproliferative effect on cultured colon cancer cells, effects not previously described, to our knowledge. A reduction in several markers of colon inflammation was observed following administration of the extract to colitis-induced mice, including functional and histological indicators. A successful inhibition of cancer cell invasion and proliferation was also observed in in vitro studies with HT-29 cells. Furthermore, the extract also led to a reduced expression of iNOS/COX- in the colon of colitis-induced mice, both being crucial mediators of intestinal inflammation.Taking into consideration the central role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of CRC and the recognised connection between  events and cancer, these results enlighten the relevance of the phenolic constituents of pennyroyal as important pharmacological sources in the investigation of new treatment options for patients with .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

TNFα antagonists were the triggering agents in about 95 % of the cases. Changes in biological therapy were required in nearly half of the cases (46. %). Almost 90 % of the patients had either a complete (42.1 %) or a partial response (47 %).Management of CEAs under biological therapy can be challenging in clinical practice. Case discussions between gastroenterologists, rheumatologists and dermatologists should be undertaken to best manage patients with CAEs and avoid unnecessary changes of therapy.© 2019 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG).

A total of 137 IBD patients, including 40 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 97 patients with Crohn's  (CD), and 50 healthy controls (HCs), were recruited. Serum food-specific IgG antibodies were detected by semi-quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum food-specific IgE antibodies were measured by Western blot. The value of food-specific IgG antibodies was compared among different groups, and potent factors related to these antibodies were explored by binary logistic regression.Food-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 57.5% of UC patients, in 90.72% of CD patients and in 42% of HCs. A significantly high prevalence and titer of food-specific IgG antibodies were observed in CD patients compared to UC patients and HCs. The number of IgG-positive foods was greater in CD and UC patients than in HCs (CD  HCs,  = 0.000; UC  HCs,  = 0.029). The top five food antigens that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in CD patients were tomato (80.68%), corn (69.32%), egg (63.64%), rice (61.36%), and soybean (46.59%). The foods that caused positive specific IgG antibodies in UC patients were egg (60.87%), corn (47.83%), tomato (47.83%), rice (26.09%), and soybean (21.74%). Significantly higher levels of total food-specific IgG were detected in IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα therapy compared to patients receiving steroids and immunosuppressants (anti-TNFα  steroids,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  immunosuppressants,  = 0.000; anti-TNFα  steroids + immunosuppressants,  = 0.003). A decrease in food-specific IgG levels was detected in IBD patients after receiving anti-TNFα therapy ( = 0.007). Patients who smoked and CD patients were prone to developing serum food-specific IgG antibodies [Smoke: OR (95%CI): 17.6 (1.91-162.26),  = 0.011; CD patients: OR (95%CI): 12.48 (3.45-45.09),  = 0.000]. There was no difference in the prevalence of food-specific IgE antibodies among CD patients (57.1%), UC patients (65.%) and HCs (60%) ( = 0.831).CD patients have a higher prevalence of food-specific IgG antibodies than UC patients and HCs. IBD patients are prone to rice, corn, tomato and soybean intolerance. Smoking may be a risk factor in the occurrence of food-specific IgG antibodies. Food-specific IgG antibodies may be a potential method in the diagnosis and management of food intolerance in IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607622>Gastrointestinal Perforations in Adult Whole-Liver Transplant Patients: Clinical, Radiologic, and Histopathologic Analysis.</a></h1><p>Gastrointestinal perforation (GIP) is a rare complication after adult liver transplant (LT) associated with high morbidity and mortality. Limited data are available about clinical risk factors and underlying pathogenic mechanisms.The retrospective study included all GIP cases from a consecutive cohort of 361 LT recipients during the period 2005-2017. Clinical variables were investigated as potential risk factors for GIP, and radiologic and histopathologic evaluations were undertaken to identify any causative mechanism.A total of 22 patients developed at least 1 episode of GIP (prevalence 6.1%) at a median time of 18.5 [interquartile range, 12.5-28.5] days after LT. The perforations occurred in the small  (63.6%), transverse colon (27.3%), right colon (22.7%), left colon (9.1%), and stomach (9.1%). A total of 27.3% of patients developed multiple sites of GIP, and in 31% GIP recurred after curative surgery. The 30-day mortality rate after relaparotomy was 40%. A history of previous abdominal surgery (odds ratio, .5) and early post-LT relaparotomy due to other complications (odds ratio, .6) were significant risk factors for GIP. No thromboembolic or steno-occlusive complications of any splanchnic vessel were detected at computed tomography scan, while histopathology examination on perforated gastrointestinal segments excluded cytomegalovirus infection, graft-vs-host , and . In all the cases, ischemic necrosis with aspecific microangiopathy and microembolization were the pathologic features detected.GIP is a severe complication after LT with frequent multiple gastrointestinal involvement and recurrence after curative surgery. The pathologic underlying mechanism is usually microvascular ischemia. Clinical risk factors are history of previous abdominal surgery and early post-LT relaparotomy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to assess longitudinal changes in BMD in this population.A retrospective longitudinal study of children with IBD, treated at two tertiary centres in Israel, who underwent two BMD measurements by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Changes in lumbar spine BMD (∆L1-4 z-scores) were examined for correlations with clinical characteristics.The cohort included 41 patients (age at diagnosis 12.1 ± 3.5 years, 23 females).The mean interval between the scans was 3.4 ± .0 years. There was a trend towards improvement in L1-4 z-scores (-1.64 ± 1.02 vs -1.45 ± 0.83, P = .12). ∆L1-4 z-scores correlated positively with ∆weight-standard deviation scores (SDS), ∆height-SDS and ∆BMI-SDS, and with age at the second scan (R = .55, P < .01; R = .42, P < .01; R = .42, P = .01; R = .35, P = .02, respectively); and negatively with L1-4 z-scores at the first scan (R = -.63, P < .01). Stepwise linear regression analysis identified the first scan L1-4 z-scores and ∆weight-SDS as independent predictors of ∆L1-4 z-scores. An L1-4 z-score ≤- at the first DXA scan was associated with significant improvement at the second scan.Improvement in BMD was more pronounced in children who gained weight or whose BMD was low at the first scan.© 2019 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

The infiltration of immune cells into the mucosa and uncontrolled production of pro- cytokines and other mediators trigger the chronic  reaction in the intestine [1]. The  setting consists of subsequent events that comprise an induction phase, the peak of inflammation which is subsequently followed by the resolution phase. The induction phase, which represents the first phase of inflammation, is important for the rapid and efficient activation of the immune system for sufficient host defense. The permanent sensing of exogenous or endogenous danger signals enables the fast initiation of the  reaction. The immune cell infiltrate initiates an  cascade where released lipid and protein mediators play an indispensable role [, 3]. The last decades of research strongly suggest that resolution of inflammation is similarly a tightly coordinated and active process. The basic concept that resolution of inflammation has to be regarded as an active process has been thoroughly described by others [4-6]. The following review focuses on mechanisms, pathways, and specific mediators that are actively involved in the resolution of inflammation in CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665264>Inflammation, but Not the Underlying  or Its Location, Predicts Oral Iron Absorption Capacity in Patients With .</a></h1><p>Anaemia is common in patients with  [IBD], its two main aetiologies being iron deficiency anaemia [IDA] and anaemia of chronic inflammation [ACI]. Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to  cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying ,  locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult IBD patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with IBD [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying  type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at  h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying  type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

The primary aim of the study is to assess feasibility of both the intervention and trial procedures for a future large-scale trial.We are enrolling physicians with experience prescribing biologic therapy in the past year and families of children with IBD. Families in the intervention arm receive a 3-step intervention including a letter sent before trial consent or clinic appointment, an in-clinic decision tool and a follow-up phone call. Our primary trial outcome is a measure of feasibility, with measures of clinical and decision outcomes secondary. We seek to enroll 27 families in each of  arms (usual-care and intervention) and plan data collection at the time of the initial visit or hospital stay, and at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after the initial visit.This study protocol is designed to demonstrate that integrating novel consent procedures, including timing and multiple versions of written consent, may increase trial feasibility while maintaining scientific rigor and full protection of study participants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650803>A Systematic Review of Case-Identification Algorithms for 18 Conditions Based on Italian Healthcare Administrative Databases: A Study Protocol.</a></h1><p>there has been a long-standing, consistent use worldwide of Healthcare Administrative Databases (HADs) for epidemiological purposes, especially to identify acute and chronic health conditions. These databases are able to reflect health-related conditions at a population level through -specific case-identification algorithms that combine information coded in multiple HADs.

The search string consists of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part on HADs and a -specific part. All identified papers will be screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. All articles that used/defined an algorithm for the identification of each  of interest using Italian HADs will be included. Algorithms with exclusive use of death certificates, pathology register, general practitioner or pediatrician data will be excluded. Pertinent papers will be classified according to the objective for which the algorithm was used, and only articles that used algorithms with "primary objectives" (I  occurrence; II population/cohort selection; III outcome identification) will be considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, follow-back periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms will be collected. Further information on specific accuracy measures from external validations, sensitivity analyses, and the contribution of each source will be recorded.

The conceptual framework used was the Functional Mastery of Health Ownership (FMHO) model.A predictive correlational study design using self-administered questionnaires was used. A convenience sample of 151 adults with a diagnosis of IBD for at least 1 year was recruited from the patient population of a gastroenterology medical practice.Data were analyzed using multiple regression with standard entry factor loading. Portions of the model were found to be significant and account for 44% of the variance ( < .001;   = .44, Adjusted   = .41). Significant relationships were found among mastery and IBD self-efficacy, perception of mastery, and current health status.

Here we provide a real-world comparison of these two agents.We conducted an ambidirectional cohort study. Each patient included had moderate to severe active CD. Clinical response and remission were assessed between 4 and 16 weeks after induction.Of a total of 163 patients, 97 were induced with ADA and 66 were induced with UST. Logistic regression model analysis adjusted based on effect size showed that ADA when compared to UST induced clinical response (73.% vs. 50% (odds ratio (OR): .40; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14 - 5.07; P = 0.02)) and remission (44.3% vs. 27.7% (OR: .35; 95% CI: 1.07 - 5.16; P = 0.034) in a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients. Among tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-naive patients, when comparing ADA vs. UST, ADA was superior in inducing clinical response (69/89 (77.5%) vs. 4/10 (40%) (OR: 4.26; 95% CI: 1.08 - 16.84; P = 0.04)), but not remission (41/89 (46%) vs. 3/9 (33%) (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.39 - 6.97; P = 0.503)). Among TNF-experienced patients, ADA was numerically inferior in inducing clinical response (/8 (25%) vs. 29/56 (52%) (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.07 - 1.94; P = 0.24)) and remission (/8 (25%) vs. 15/56 (27%) (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.22 - 6.81; P = 0.82)), but neither of these differences were statistically significant.In a real-world setting, the rate of clinical response and remission was higher among patients with CD who received ADA compared to UST. Of note, however, despite the small sample sizes of TNF-experienced patients who received ADA and TNF-naive patients who received UST, the higher effectiveness of ADA in inducing clinical response and indeed remission among patients with CD with active  appears to primarily be driven by those who are TNF-naive. Among TNF-experienced patients, UST may be superior in inducing clinical response and equally effective in inducing clinical remission when compared to ADA. Based on this study, one may infer that among TNF-experienced patients with CD with active , one could consider switching to an agent such as UST instead of a second approved TNF blocker. However, larger studies comparing the two agents are required.Copyright 2019, Ahmed et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640184>Gut DNA Virome Diversity and Its Association with Host Bacteria Regulate  Phenotype and Neuronal Immunotoxicity in Experimental Gulf War Illness.</a></h1><p>Gulf War illness (GWI) is characterized by the persistence of , chronic fatigue, neuroinflammation, headache, cognitive impairment, and other medically unexplained conditions. Results using a murine model show that enteric viral populations especially bacteriophages were altered in GWI. The increased viral richness and alpha diversity correlated positively with gut bacterial dysbiosis and proinflammatory cytokines. Altered virome signature in GWI mice also had a concomitant weakening of intestinal epithelial tight junctions with a significant increase in Claudin- protein expression and decrease in ZO1 and Occludin mRNA expression. The altered virome signature in GWI, decreased tight junction protein level was followed by the presence an activation of innate immune responses such as increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. The altered virome diversity had a positive correlation with serum IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, intestinal inflammation (IFN-γ), and decreased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurogenesis marker. The co-exposure of Gulf War chemical and antibiotic (for gut sterility) or Gulf War chemical and Ribavirin, an antiviral compound to suppress virus alteration in the gut showed significant improvement in epithelial tight junction protein, decreased intestinal-, systemic-, and neuroinflammation. These results showed that the observed enteric viral dysbiosis could activate enteric viral particle-induced innate immune response in GWI and could be a novel therapeutic target in GWI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578306>Transmission and clearance of potential procarcinogenic bacteria during fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile.</a></h1><p>BACKGROUNDFecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) in adults and children, but donor stool samples are currently screened for only a limited number of potential pathogens. We sought to determine whether putative procarcinogenic bacteria (enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli harboring the colibactin toxin) could be durably transmitted from donors to patients during FMT.METHODSStool samples were collected from 11 pediatric rCDI patients and their respective FMT donors prior to FMT as well as from the patients at -10 weeks, 10-20 weeks, and 6 months after FMT. Bacterial virulence factors in stool DNA extracts and stool cultures were measured by quantitative PCR: Bacteroides fragilis toxin (bft), Fusobacterium adhesin A (fadA), and Escherichia coli colibactin (clbB).RESULTSFour of 11 patients demonstrated sustained acquisition of a procarcinogenic bacteria. Whole genome sequencing was performed on colony isolates from one of these donor/recipient pairs and demonstrated that clbB+ E. coli strains present in the recipient after FMT were identical to a strain present in the donor, confirming strain transmission. Conversely,  patients exhibited clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria following FMT from a negative donor.CONCLUSIONBoth durable transmission and clearance of procarcinogenic bacteria occurred following FMT, suggesting that additional studies on appropriate screening measures for FMT donors and the long-term consequences and/or benefits of FMT are warranted.FUNDINGCrohn's & Colitis Foundation, the Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the National Cancer Institute, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542070>Lymphomatoid Papulosis Type B in a Patient with Crohn's  Treated with TNF-Alpha Inhibitors Infliximab and Adalimumab.</a></h1><p>Dear Editor, Lymphomatoid papulosis (LP) is a chronic, recurrent, usually self-limited papulonecrotic or papulonodular skin , which belongs to the group of primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (1). Three main histological subtypes of LP have been recognized: type A (histiocytic), type B (mycosis fungoides-like), and type C (anaplastic large cell lymphoma-like). Recently, new histologic LP variants classified as type D (CD8-positive, cytotoxic form) and type E (angioinvasive form) have also been described. The etiology of LP has not been determined to date (-4). Herein we report a case of LP type B evolving in a patient with Crohn's  after treatment with infliximab and adalimumab. A 38-year-old man suffering from terminal ileitis form of luminar Crohn's  for 10 years presented at our department. During the last 10 years, the patient had been treated with a number of conventional -modifying anti- drugs including non-steroid anti- drugs, mesalazine, and immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids and azathioprine. As the  was not sufficiently controlled, TNF-α inhibitor therapy was initiated. Infliximab was administered in standard dosage (5 mg/kg body weight every 8 weeks after the induction period) for one year. Concomitant therapy with azathioprine was established to reduce the risk of adverse immunological reactions. Since the patient showed only partial clinical response, infliximab was switched to adalimumab (40 mg biweekly), resulting in notable improvement. 18 months after the initiation of adalimumab treatment, asymptomatic, small, red to brown papules developed on the extremities. Multiple lesions were observed, initially on the legs, but the symptoms rapidly progressed to the arms and trunk (Figure 1). An acquired ichthyosis further complicated the  course by extended, extremely xerotic, scaling skin lesions. Neither systemic symptoms nor significant lymphadenopathy was observed. The clinical picture suggested either ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides or a coincidence of LP and acquired ichthyosis. The histology of a typical papule showed perivascular and periadnexal lymphoid infiltration with massive hemorrhage in the dermis. The infiltration was dense, composed of small-to-medium-sized lymphoid cells showing focal significant epidermotropism (Figure ). Most observed epidermal lymphocytes were CD3+, CD4+, and CD30+, while the dermal infiltration had higher CD4 and lower CD30 expression (10-15%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of skin and peripheral blood samples did not show clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor gamma (TcRgamma) genes. Normal phenotypes of lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry of peripheral blood. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides was excluded since histology of ichthyosiform skin lesions showed only hyperkeratosis with a reduced granular layer. While the cutaneous CD4+ epidermotropic infiltrate was suspicious of either mycosis fungoides or LP type B, the complexity of clinicopathological data confirmed the diagnosis of LP type B. The peripheral blood counts, serum biochemical tests, and urinalysis were within normal range, while the elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) of IgG and IgA subclasses indicated the activity of Crohn's . Adalimumab and azathioprine were discontinued, and oral budesonide therapy was started in combination with topical corticosteroids and PUVA phototherapy. The skin lesions resolved with hyperpigmentation, and there was no relapse during the twelve-month follow-up. Recent data suggest that LP occurs more commonly in immunocompromised patients, especially in those with solid organ or bone marrow transplants (3). Though TNF-α inhibitors have dramatically advanced the treatment of various , the risk of lymphoma associated with their use remains controversial (5). Several cases of cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders associated with TNF-α inhibitor treatment have been reported, including two patients with LP (6). One of the two patients with LP received infliximab for Crohn's  (7), while the other one had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and received adalimumab (8). Our case is the third report on LP developing under TNF-α inhibitor therapy and the first LP type B in a patient with Crohn's  treated with infliximab and later with adalimumab. A further interesting aspect of our case is that it also represents an example of the known association of acquired ichthyosis with  (9). Multidisciplinary management was needed to provide optimal care and  outcome for our patient. Since it is usually difficult to prove causality in most of such cases, it is important to collect similar clinical observations.

We sought to compare the clinical course of patients with IBD to those without.We conducted a retrospective case-control study of adult patients admitted to a level-1 trauma center from January 1, 2008, through October 1, 2015. Seventy-five patients with IBD were identified. Cases were matched to controls by age, sex, injury severity, and mechanism using 4:1 propensity score-matching analysis. Injury characteristics, clinical course, and infectious and noninfectious complications were compared using bivariate and multivariate analysis.Participants had a mean age of 56 years and mean injury severity score of 15. Of the 75 cases, 44% had ulcerative colitis, 44% had Crohn's , and 12% had undetermined type. More cases were on an immunosuppressant (19% vs %, P < 0.01) or steroids (8% vs %, P = 0.02) on admission compared with controls. More cases had prior abdominal surgery (P = 0.01). Cases had fewer brain injuries (P = 0.02) and higher admission Glasgow Coma Scale (P < 0.01) but required more neurosurgical intervention (P = 0.03). Cases required more orthopedic surgeries (P < 0.01) and more pain management consultations (P = 0.04). In multivariable analysis, IBD was associated with increased odds of operative intervention, pain management consultation, venous thromboembolism, and longer hospital stay (P < 0.05). Patients on immunosuppressants had increased odds of requiring surgery (P = 0.04), particularly orthopedic surgery (P < 0.01).Baseline factors associated with  may place patients at higher risk for surgery and complications after trauma.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

We sought to develop a chronic mouse IBD model for assessing long-term anti- effects with ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) by using dual P- and E-selectin targeted microbubbles (MB). : Interleukin 10 deficient (IL-10 on a C57BL/6 genetic background; n=55) and FVB (n=16) mice were used. In IL-10mice, various experimental regimens including piroxicam, ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), respectively were used for promoting colitis; colitis was induced with DSS in FVB mice. Using clinical and small animal ultrasound scanners, evolution of inflammation in proximal, middle and distal colon, was monitored with USMI by using MB at multiple time points. Imaged colon segments were analyzed  for  changes on H&E staining and for P-selectin expression on immunofluorescence staining. : Sustained colitis was not detected with USMI in IL-10 or FVB mice with various experimental regimens. USMI signals either gradually decreased after the colitis enhancing/inducing drug/agents were discontinued, or the mortality rate of mice was high. Inflammation was observed on H&E staining in IL-10 mice with piroxicam promotion, while stable overexpression of P-selectin was not found on immunofluorescence staining in the same mice. : Sustained colitis in IL-10 mice induced with piroxicam, TNBS or DSS, and in FVB mice induced with DSS, was not detected with USMI using MB, and this was verified by immunofluorescence staining for inflammation marker P-selectin. Thus, these models may not be appropriate for long-term monitoring of chronic colitis and subsequent treatment response with dual-selectin targeted USMI.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597098>Disrupting Myelin-Specific Th17 Cell Gut Homing Confers Protection in an Adoptive Transfer Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.</a></h1><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune  of the CNS.

Mechanistically, myelin-specific Th17 cells proliferate in the colon and affect gut microbiota composition. The beneficial effect of blocking the α4β7-integrin and its ligand MAdCAM-1 pathway on EAE is interdependent with gut microbiota. Those results show that disrupting myelin-specific Th17 cell trafficking to the large intestine harnesses neuroinflammation and suggests that the gut environment and microbiota catalyze the encephalitogenic properties of Th17 cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Case-control studies reporting the proportion of IBD cases in HS cohorts were included and meta-analysis performed.From six included studies, a significant association between HS and IBD after pooling of adjusted effect sizes was identified (OR .12; 95% CI 1.62-.77; P = 0.03). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant association between HS and Crohn's  (OR .25; 95% CI 1.52-3.32; P < 0.0001, I = 92%) and with ulcerative colitis (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.26-1.94; P < 0.0001; I = 36%).Studies reviewed were observational by design which are susceptible to bias and lack of randomization.Our results indicate a statistically significant association between HS and IBD.

VPR-254 is a selective in vitro inhibitor of RORγT.The main goals of our study were twofold: (1) To determine if ex vivo treatment with VPR-254 reduced relevant cytokine (IL-17 and IL-21) secretion from colonic strips of mice with colitis; () To determine if treatment of mice with VPR-254 attenuated parameters of colitis, using three murine IBD models.VPR-254 was evaluated ex vivo in a colonic strip assay, using tissue from mice with Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. In vivo, VPR-254 was evaluated for efficacy in DSS, Trintirobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and Anti-CD40 antibody-induced murine models of colitis.VPR-254 reduced the production of key pro- cytokines (e.g., IL-17) in ex vivo and in vivo models of colitis. This small molecule inhibitor of RORγT also improved various morphometric and histological parameters associated with three diverse murine models of IBD.Our results support the concept that an inhibitor of ROR-gamma T may have potential utility for the treatment of IBD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634402>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Increases Drug Retention of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Agents in Pediatric Patients With Crohn's .</a></h1><p>In recent years, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) agents has been commonly utilized. We aimed to investigate its effect on long-term drug retention and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with Crohn's  (CD).The medical records of pediatric CD patients receiving anti-TNFα agents from 2007 to 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified to those who initiated anti-TNFα treatment between 2007 and 2012, an era when TDM was not available (TDM-), and patients who initiated anti-TNFα treatment between 2013 and 2018, with at least 1 TDM during firstline anti-TNFα treatment (TDM+). The main outcome measures included time to first anti-TNFα discontinuation (drug retention), flares, and hospitalizations per year of first anti-TNFα treatment, treatment intensification rate, and surgical resection rate.One hundred ninety-seven patients were included (n = 98, TDM-; n = 99, TDM+; median [interquartile range] age, 12.6 [10.1-14.] years; females 68 [35%]). Compared with the TDM- group, the TDM+ group had a longer drug retention time (mean ± SE, 45.0 ± .7 vs 33.5 ± .4 months; P = 0.001), lower hospitalization rate per patient per year (mean ± SE, 0.51 ± 0.7 vs 0.92 ± 0.81; P < 0.001), and higher treatment intensification rate (70% vs 18%; P < 0.001). Surgical resection rate was not significantly different. Analysis of the entire cohort showed a longer retention time for adalimumab vs infliximab (45.3 ± .8 vs 34.8 ± .5 months; P = 0.007).TDM-based treatment enables longer drug retention time, reflecting better utilization of anti-TNFα agents, with several additional favorable outcomes.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

IBD patients with IBS-like symptoms show higher interleukin-13 (IL-13) serum levels and poor psychological well-being. Supplementary glutamine reduced the daily  movement frequency, improved the stool form, and normalized intestinal hyperpermeability. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of IL-13 and supplementary glutamine on human intestinal epithelial function in vitro.Caco- cells were grown on TranswellTM inserts. -IL-13 was added to the basolateral compartment, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled-dextran permeability measured. Effects of glutamine or the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were assessed. Involvement of tight junction proteins was assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.IL-13 significantly decreased TEER and increased FITC labeled-dextran epithelial permeability. IL-13 stimulation decreased the claudin-1 expression and increased the claudin- expression. Glutamine alleviated IL-13-induced decrease of TEER and increase of FITC labeled-dextran permeability. Further, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor showed this alleviating effect while the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 inhibitor did not.IL-13 induced barrier integrity impairment by decreasing claudin-1 and increasing claudin-.

A select group of patients with IBD is responsible for a large proportion of this utilization, demonstrating the burden of frequent hospitalizations. We aim to better understand the burden of 30-day readmissions among patients with IBD using a national hospital database.Retrospective cohort study of state-specific inpatient databases.The State Inpatient Databases for New York and Florida were used to identify patients with IBD hospitalized between 2009 and 2013. The prevalence of 30-day IBD-specific readmission was determined. The association between 30-day readmission and visit outcomes, specifically length of stay and a composite of comorbid conditions (venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, sepsis, Clostridium difficile infection, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and blood transfusion), was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Patients with IBD accounted for 35,514 and 39,506 inpatient stays in New York and Florida, respectively. Of these stays, 13.7% to 16.% resulted in a 30-day readmission. On multivariable analysis, 30-day readmissions were associated with a longer length of stay than index hospitalizations by 1.00 day (adjusted regression coefficient, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.73-1.26) and a higher likelihood of having a comorbid condition (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.68-1.99) in New York. Similar associations were confirmed in Florida.Nearly 1 in 7 hospitalizations of patients with IBD lead to a 30-day readmission. These IBD-specific readmissions are associated with increased utilization and comorbidity.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with IBD treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, .8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with , 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy.

Whereas several studies report an increase in mast cell density during IBD, others found a decrease. Recently, we observed a reduced response to mast cell degranulation induced by antigen contact in a colitis model. As the effects of mast cell mediators on epithelial ion transport are mediated indirectly via stimulation of secretomotor neurons, we investigated in vitro whether proinflammatory cytokines change the response to mast cell degranulation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and a mix of proinflammatory cytokines caused an increase of short-circuit current (I) and tissue conductance in rat colon. Anion secretion induced by histamine was downregulated in the presence of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the cytokine mix, whereas the response to the mast cell stimulator compound 48/80 was not changed significantly. In a coculture of rat submucosal ganglionic cells with a mast cell line (RBL-2H3), TNFα preincubation for 1 d increased the percentage of neurons responding to mast cell degranulation with an increase of the cytosolic Ca concentration and enhanced the amplitude of this response. Consequently, the downregulation of epithelial secretion is compensated by an increased sensitivity of secretomotor neurons leading to a constant response of the epithelium to compound 48/80. Furthermore, enteric neurons can modify mast cell functions as nicotine inhibited the increase in cytosolic Ca concentration of RBL-2H3 cells and the I evoked by compound 48/80. Consequently, these in vitro models deliver new insights into cellular interactions in the gut wall under  conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In many cases, the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's  is straightforward, especially when patients have a typical presentation and characteristic histopathological features. Knowledge of the full clinical history is very important, particularly past and recent medical history, drug history, foreign travel, or known contact with individuals with specific infection. Discussion of all cases of suspected IBD within a multidisciplinary team meeting is required to ensure that clinical, radiological, and pathological features can be correlated. Mimics of IBD can be divided into 4 categories: 1) those due to specific infection, ) those due to a specific localized  process, 3) those due to iatrogenic causes, and 4) other rarer causes. Accurate diagnosis of IBD and exclusion of these mimics are crucial for patient management. Once a diagnosis of IBD has been proffered by a pathologist, it is very difficult to "undiagnose" the condition when an alternative diagnosis or "mimic" has been subsequently identified. The histological diagnosis of each of these IBD mimics is discussed in detail, with guidance on how to avoid the pitfall of missing these sometimes very subtle and "difficult to diagnose" conditions.© 2019 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the percentage of sarcopenia in IBD patients, characterizing methods for assessment and clinical symptoms associated to it. () Methods: Consecutive IBD patients accessing the Fondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) were enrolled. Healthy patients, elderly or elderly sarcopenic patients, were enrolled as controls. Skeletal muscle mass was evaluated by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Bio-Impedensometric Analysis (BIA). Asthenia degree was assessed by subjective visual analogue scales (VAS). Quality of life was measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire. (3) Results: Patients with IBD showed a significant reduction in skeletal muscle mass than healthy controls with lower DEXA and BIA parameters. Moreover, IBD patients presented a lower perception of muscle strength with a higher incidence of asthenia and reduction in quality of life when compared with healthy controls. A significant association between loss in skeletal muscle mass and high asthenia degree was found, configuring a condition of sarcopenia in about one third of patients with IBD.

Nine fatty acid-binding proteins have been identified, with each having individual tissue-specific functions in addition to regulation of fatty acids. This review focuses on the three fatty acid-binding proteins found in the gastrointestinal tract and discusses their role as diagnostic or  monitoring markers in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, celiac , and . Of these three fatty acid-binding proteins, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein is of the most interest due to its exclusive expression in the gastrointestinal tract. The elevation of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein in blood and urine reflects enterocyte damage, regardless of the underlying cause. The short half-life of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein also means it is a relatively sensitive marker. In contrast, there is currently less evidence to support liver fatty acid-binding protein and ileal bile acid-binding protein as sensitive biomarkers in these conditions.

The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's  (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and () patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed -specific displacement advantages under two- status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Of note, due to the ethnic diversity in the epidemiology of T2DM, alogliptin has been shown to be more efficacious in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients with T2DM, but with a similar tolerability profile. These data indicate that DPP-4is, including alogliptin, are important treatment options, especially for Asian patients with T2DM, for whom they have potential as a first-line therapy. This benefit-risk assessment aims to place alogliptin within the current armamentarium of T2DM and aid physicians when choosing optimal diabetes treatment for their patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545811>Global smoking trends in : A systematic review of inception cohorts.</a></h1><p>The effect of smoking on the risk of developing  (IBD) may be heterogeneous across ethnicity and geography. Although trends in smoking for the general population are well described, it is unknown whether these can be extrapolated to the IBD cohort. Smoking prevalence trends specific to the global IBD cohort over time have not been previously reported. This is a systematic review of smoking prevalence specific to the IBD cohort across geography.A systematic literature search was conducted on Medline and Embase from January 1st 1946 to April 5th 2018 to identify population-based studies assessing the prevalence of smoking at diagnosis in inception cohorts of Crohn's (CD) or ulcerative colitis(UC). Studies that did not report smoking data from time of diagnosis or the year of IBD diagnosis were excluded. Prevalence of smoking in IBD was stratified by geography and across time.We identified 56 studies that were eligible for inclusion. Smoking prevalence data at diagnosis of CD and UC was collected from twenty and twenty-five countries respectively. Never-smokers in the newly diagnosed CD population in the West has increased over the last two decades, especially in the United Kingdom and Sweden; +26.6% and +11.% respectively. Never-smokers at CD diagnosis in newly industrialised nations have decreased over the 1990s and 2000s; China (-19.36%). Never-smokers at UC diagnosis also decreased in China; -15.4%. The former-smoker population at UC diagnosis in China is expanding; 11%(1990-2006) to 34%(2011-2013).There has been a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in the IBD cohort in the West. This is not consistent globally. Although, smoking prevalence has decreased in the general population of newly industrialised nations, this remains an important risk factor with longer term outcomes awaiting translation in both UC and CD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680263></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625422>Anorectal function and quality of life in IBD patients with a perianal complaint.</a></h1><p> Anorectal function of  (IBD) patients is still poorly understood, with contradictory results. This prospective observational study aimed to analyze the effect of perianal  on anorectal function and quality of life in IBD patients.  Patient assessment included full clinical examination, validated scores, anorectal manometry, three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography, and endoscopy. The  Questionnaire was adopted to evaluate patients' quality of life.  From January to November 2016, 37 consecutive IBD patients (30 Crohn's , 7 ulcerative colitis) and 20 controls were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients had a history of perianal fistula, 9 reported fecal incontinence, and  had anal fissure. Fecal incontinent patients were older, had a longer  duration, and higher  movement number than continent patients. Endoanal ultrasound findings were normal in all volunteers, while pathological features were found in 31/37 patients. Rectal sensory testing and anal pressure did not differ between the IBD patients and controls. However, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was normally elicited in all controls vs. 32/37 (86%) IBD patients; 25/37 (68%) IBD patients showed manometric features of dyssynergic defecation. Rectal inflammation and incontinence were associated with low maximum anal resting pressure. The quality of life score was lower in ulcerative colitis patients than in Crohn's patients and significantly lower in fecal incontinent patients.  Anorectal function is impaired in IBD patients with perianal . Fecal incontinence correlates with poorer quality of life. Anorectal manometry and ultrasonography are useful tools for evaluating IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658350>Concomitant lung and intestinal tuberculosis - case report.</a></h1><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for one in five deaths for young women (between 15-44 years old). Almost 9 million persons are diagnosed with TB each year and around  million deaths are due to TB or TB complications. Abdominal TB has no specific clinical symptoms, no imagistic and no specific laboratory tests, all these making the diagnosis more difficult. Most often, clinical, radiographic, and histopathological (HP) aspects in TB enteritis are nonspecific and may suggest cancer or . We present the case of a 42-year-old male patient, with intestinal and lung TB presenting as intestinal obstruction to emphasize the importance of clinical suspicion and histopathology for final diagnosis. Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) evidenced a few left-sided pulmonary nodules and wall thickening of some parts of the small and large . Also, CT evidenced nearby mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He was admitted in the Department of Surgery and later confirmed with intestinal TB. Because of modified chest radiography, further investigations identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. Final diagnosis was concomitant lung and intestinal TB confirmed by sputum and histopathology. The patient received proper anti-tuberculous treatment and his condition improved after the first month. The physician treating the organ is the one that should establish the diagnosis of extra-respiratory TB; however, treatment and later follow-up are multidisciplinary. TB should always be suspected in any patient with nonspecific symptoms.

In contrast to drug therapies, which exert several side effects, herbal remedies have constantly attracted the attention of researchers. Therefore, in the present study, a mother tincture (MT) from fresh, young, non-woody  L. branches with leaves was obtained using distillation-based techniques. Further, this was used to assess its in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activities and anti- properties, and to validate it as a potential phytotherapeutic treatment for IBD. The characterization of the tincture included common phytochemical screening assays for antioxidant capacity measurement, cell viability assays on Caco- colon cells, and in vivo assessment of antioxidant and anti- effects by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis of the intestinal mucosa, measurement of reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and gene expression of the inflammation markers (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) in intestine after oral administration to an experimental mouse model of colon inflammation (colitis) developed by intrarectal administration of ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). Our study proved that administration of 25 or 50 mg  MT/kg of body weight/day by gavage for 7 days succeeded in inhibiting the  process induced by TNBS in the intestine, most probably because of its rich contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. These data could contribute to the formulation of therapeutic products based on  that could come to the aid of IBD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641205>DSS-induced colitis produces inflammation-induced bone loss while irisin treatment mitigates the  state in both gut and bone.</a></h1><p>Chronic pediatric  (IBD) leads to lack of bone accrual, bone loss, and increased fractures. Presently there is no cure, and many IBD treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved  changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild IBD rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe IBD induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given % DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro- factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti- treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614204>Polysaccharides derived from Morinda citrifolia Linn reduce  markers during experimental colitis.</a></h1><p>There are many reports of pharmacological activities of extracts and fractions of different vegetable-derived products in the scientific literature and in folk medicine. Ethnopharmacological use of these products by various communities continues to be extensively explored, and they account for more than half of all medications used worldwide. Polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from plants such as Morinda Citrifolia Linn present therapeutic potential in treatment of  (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC).To evaluate the anti- action of Noni PLS against the intestinal damage in UC induced by acetic acid in mice.In acetic acid-induced colitis, the mice were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with PLS (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (sc) with dexamethasone (.0 mg/kg) 30 min before euthanasia to determine the best dose of PLS with an anti- effect in the course of UC. The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro- cytokines, and COX- expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti- action against intestinal damage by reducing  cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro- action of cytokines, and COX- expression in the inflamed colon.

We found that mean serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CD were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (MD: - 3.17 ng/mL; 95% CI - 4.42 to - 1.93). Results from the meta-analysis examining 1,25(OH)D levels in Crohn's patients revealed higher levels in the CD group than in healthy (MD: 3.47 pg/mL; 95% CI - 7.72 to 14.66) and UC group (MD: 5.05 pg/mL; 95% CI - .42 to 12.52). Serum 25(OH)D levels were lower in the UC group than in the healthy control group (MD: - .52 ng/mL; 95% CI - 4.02 to - 1.02). In studies investigating the level of 1,25(OH)D in UC and healthy control groups, the level of 1,25(OH)D in the UC groups were found to be higher than that in the control groups (MD: 3.76 pg/mL; 95% CI - 8.36 to 15.57).

This study aimed to investigate whether A20 exogenous administration restored impaired intestinal permeability and inhibited T helper (Th) response in mice with colitis.The effect of A20 overexpression in colonic mucosa on epithelial barrier function and T cell differentiation was evaluated in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis.A20 rectal treatment alleviated DSS-induced chronic colitis and restored impaired intestinal permeability. Oral challenge with % DSS elicited a Th2-type response in mice with colitis, and A20 rectal treatment inhibited CD4 interleukin (IL)-4 T cell differentiation and proliferation.

Interestingly, XLP- patients display high levels of IL-18 in the serum even while in stable condition, presumably through spontaneous inflammasome activation. Recent data suggests that LPS stimulation can trigger inflammasome activation through a TNFR2/TNF/TNFR1 mediated loop in xiap macrophages. Yet, the direct role TNFR2-specific activation plays in the absence of XIAP is unknown. We found TNFR2-specific activation leads to cell death in xiap myeloid cells, particularly in the absence of the RING domain. RIPK1 kinase activity downstream of TNFR2 resulted in a TNF/TNFR1 cell death, independent of necroptosis. TNFR2-specific activation leads to a similar  NF-kB driven transcriptional profile as TNFR1 activation with the exception of upregulation of NLRP3 and caspase-11. Activation and upregulation of the canonical inflammasome upon loss of XIAP was mediated by RIPK1 kinase activity and ROS production. While both the inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity and ROS production reduced cell death, as well as release of IL-1β, the release of IL-18 was not reduced to basal levels. This study supports targeting TNFR2 specifically to reduce IL-18 release in XLP- patients and to reduce priming of the inflammasome components.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657664>Cyanidin-3--Glucoside and Cyanidin Protect Against Intestinal Barrier Damage and ,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid-Induced Colitis.</a></h1><p>Anthocyanin-rich extracts have shown anti-inflammation activity in mouse colitis models. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti- activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco- cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of  cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco- cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and  cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco- cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti- activity in both colitis mice and Caco- cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti- effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing  cytokine secretion.

Cumulative probability of perianal CD relapse was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.After a median follow-up of 89 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 65-173 months), 44 of the 78 perianal CD patients (56.4%) relapsed after stopping anti-TNF, defined as increased fistula drainage or recurrence of previously healed fistula, after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Cumulative probabilities of perianal CD relapse were 50.8%, 72.6% and 78.0% at 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. Younger age at diagnosis of CD [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.09; P = .04] was associated with a higher chance of perianal CD relapse. Among those with perianal CD relapse (n = 44), retreatment with anti-TNF induced remission in 24 of 29 patients (82.8%). Twelve (27.3%) patients required defunctioning surgery and one (.3%) required proctectomy. Maintenance with thiopurine was not associated with a reduced likelihood of relapse [HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.58-.12; P = .77]. Among the 17 patients who achieved radiological remission of perianal CD, five (35.3%) developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy after a median of 6 months.More than half of the perianal CD patients developed relapse after stopping anti-TNF therapy. Most regained response after resuming anti-TNF. However, more than one-fourth of the perianal CD patients with relapse required defunctioning surgery.

Using smartphones to communicate symptoms and biomarkers is a potential alternative. We aimed to compare outpatient management using  smartphone apps (IBDsmart for symptoms and IBDoc for fecal calprotectin monitoring) vs standard face-to-face care. We hypothesized noninferiority of quality of life and symptoms at 12 months plus a reduction in face-to-face appointments in the smartphone app group. outpatients (previously seen more often than annually) were randomized to smartphone app or standard face-to-face care over 12 months. Quality of life and symptoms were measured quarterly for 12 months. Acceptability was measured for gastroenterologists and patients at 12 months.One hundred people (73 Crohn's , 49 male, average age 35 years) consented and completed baseline questionnaires (50 in each group). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses revealed noninferiority of quality of life and symptom scores at 12 months. Outpatient appointment numbers were reduced in smartphone app care (P < 0.001). There was no difference in number of surgical outpatient appointments or number of -related hospitalizations between groups. Adherence to IBDsmart (50% perfect adherence) was slightly better than adherence to IBDoc (30% perfect adherence). Good acceptability was reported among most gastroenterologists and patients.Remote symptom and fecal calprotectin monitoring is effective and acceptable. It also reduces the need for face-to-face outpatient appointments. Patients with mild-to-moderate  who are not new diagnoses are ideal for this system.ACTRN12615000342516.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The final search was performed in August 2019.Of 6769 studies identified in the search with  further studies found from other sources, 50 studies met inclusion criteria. Increased  wall thickness and detection of increased blood flow by colour Doppler were most often applied criteria for defining  activity and distribution. When compared with other reference investigations, gastrointestinal ultrasound accurately determined  extent, severity and response to medical therapy. While further information can be obtained from haemodynamic measurements of the abdominal vessels and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, their clinical value was uncertain. Likewise, hydrocolonic sonography has few advantages over standard GIUS examination. Of several scoring systems proposed, there is disparity between the measures and a general lack of validation. There has been limited application of gastrointestinal ultrasound in acute severe ulcerative colitis with toxic megacolon, and, while performing well in children, normal limits differ to those in adults.Current evidence indicates that gastrointestinal ultrasound has utility in the non-invasive assessment of patients with ulcerative colitis. Continued advances in technology with better image resolution, validation of scoring systems and application at the point of care by gastroenterologists are likely to contribute to increased use of gastrointestinal ultrasound in routine clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

ORM sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator (ORMDL3) residing in this region is the most promising gene candidate for explaining association with . However, the relationship between 17q12-q21 alleles and  is complex suggesting contributions from other factors, such as trans-acting genetic and environmental modifiers or circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms regulate expression levels of thousands of genes and their dysregulation is implicated in the etiology of several common chronic  . However, their role in the regulation of the 17q12-q21 genes has not been investigated. Moreover, the core clock gene nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) resides about 200 kb distal to the GWAS region. We hypothesized that circadian rhythms influenced gene expression levels in 17q12-q21 region and conversely, regulatory elements in this region influenced transcription of the core clock gene NR1D1 in cis. To test these hypotheses, we examined the diurnal expression profiles of zona pellucida binding protein  (ZPBP2/Zpbp2), gasdermin B (GSDMB), and ORMDL3/Ormdl3 in human and mouse tissues and analyzed the impact of genetic variation in the ZPBP2/Zpbp2 region on NR1D1/Nr1d1 expression. We found that Ormdl3 and Zpbp2 were controlled by the circadian clock in a tissue-specific fashion. We also report that deletion of the Zpbp2 region altered the expression profile of Nr1d1 in lungs and ileum in a time-dependent manner. In liver, the deletion was associated with enhanced expression of Ormdl3. We provide the first evidence that -associated genes Zpbp2 and Ormdl3 are regulated by circadian rhythms and the Zpbp2 region influences expression of the core clock gene Nr1d1.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559368>Is fixed short-course antimicrobial therapy justified for patients who are critically ill with intra-abdominal infections?</a></h1><p>A long-course antibiotic therapy increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. A 7- to 14-day duration of therapy has been traditionally adopted in patients with intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). Prophylactic antibiotic use is warranted in uncomplicated IAIs, in which the infection involves a single organ, and the source of the infection is completely eradicated by a surgical procedure. A large, randomized clinical trial of the treatment of complicated IAIs recently demonstrated that a fixed 4-day course of antibiotic therapy was as effective as a long-course therapy in patients who underwent adequate source control. Considering the poor prognosis and lack of clear evidence available for shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients who are critically ill or those with ongoing signs of sepsis, the duration of therapy for complicated IAIs should be individually determined according to the clinical course. Limiting therapy to no more than 7 days seems to be warranted in patients who are critically ill with a good clinical response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622979>The ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program- Collaborative: Design, Implementation, and Validation of a -specific Module.</a></h1><p>Surgery for  (IBD) involves a complex interplay between , surgery, and medications, exposing patients to increased risk of postoperative complications. Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect -specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in IBD.A collaborative of 13 high-volume IBD surgery centers was convened to collect 5 IBD-specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The  most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All 5 novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first -specific collaborative within NSQIP. The selected variables were demonstrated to be reliably collected, and this collaborative will facilitate high-quality, large case-volume research specific to the IBD patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

A retrospectively descriptive cohort study was carried out. Clinical data of 2010 patients who underwent FMT and received follow-up for more than 3 months from May 2014 to November 2018 were collected, including 1,206 cases from Tongji University Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and 804 cases from Nanjing Eastern Military General Hospital. Of the ,010 patients, 797 were male and 1,213 were female, with a mean age of (49.4±16.5) years old. Inclusion criteria were those with indications for FMT and voluntary treatment of FMT. Pregnant or lactating women, patients with end-stage , cases who were participating or participated in other clinical trials within 3 months, and patients with previous  history of pathogen infection, oral antibiotics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for the recent2 weeks, and those at immunosuppressive state were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from the enrolled patients and their families. There were 1,356 cases of constipation, 175 cases of , 148 cases of chronic diarrhea, 127 cases of radiation enteritis, 119 cases of irritable  syndrome, and 85 cases of autism (complicating with intestinal disorders). FMT donor requirements: (1) 18 to 30 years old non-relatives, non-pregnant healthy adults with healthy lifestyle and good eating habits as volunteers to participate in fecal donation; () no administration of antibiotics within 3 months; (3) no chronic  such as constipation, irritable  syndrome, , etc., no autoimmune , not in immunosuppressive state, no history of malignant ; (4) negative pathogen examination of infectious  (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, syphilis, HIV, etc.); (5) negative fecal examination (C.difficile, dysentery bacillus, Shigella, Campylobacter, parasites, etc.). The donor requirements after enrollment: (1) physical examination was reviewed once every two months, and the result still met the above requirements; () 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for every fecal donation in order to ensure that the composition and diversity of the fecal flora was stable and reliable. The preparation of the stool suspension referred to the Amsterdam criteria and the preparation process was less than 1 hour. The preparation of the FMT capsule was processed by pre-freezing the stool suspension after the preparation of the above suspension, and the frozen sample was transferred into a freeze dryer for freezing. The dried and lyophilized powder was encapsulated in capsules, and the capsule shell was made of acid-resistant hypromellose capsule (No.0) and pediatric-specific capsule (No.3), sealed and packaged in a-20℃ refrigerator. Three ways of accepting FMT treatment pathways included 6-day transplantation after the placement of the nasointestinal tube, 6-day oral FMT capsule transplantation and one-time transplantation through colonoscopy. Intestinal preparation (nasointestinal tube feeding of polyethylene glycol until watery stool) was carried out before transplantation. Other treatments were stopped during treatment and follow-up, and any medication was not recommended when necessary.  Of the 2010 patients, 1,497 cases received nasointestinal tube transplantation (nasointestinal tube group), 452 cases oral capsule transplantation (oral capsule group) and 61 cases colonoscopy (colonoscopy group). At 3 time points of 3, 12, and 36 months after FMT, the clinical cure rates and the clinical improvement rates were 41.3% (560/1 356), 35.% (320/909), 31.4% (69/220), and 29.0% (393/1 356), 27.8% (253/909), 29.1% (64/220), respectively in constipation patients; 33.1% (58/175), 29.9% (35/117), 24.5% (12/49), and 31.4% (55/175), 27.4% (32/117), 57.1% (28/49), respectively in  patients; 87.8% (130/148), 81.8% (81/99), 78.3% (36/46), and 8.1% (12/148), 7.1% (7/99), 4.3% (/46), respectively in chronic diarrhea patients; 61.4% (78/127), 56.5% (48/85), 47.6% (20/42), and 21.% (27/127), 15.3% (13/85), 14.3% (6/42), respectively in radiation enteritis patients; 53.8% (64/119), 45.0% (36/80), 6/15, and 21.0% (25/119), 26.% (21/80), 4/15, respectively in irritable  syndrome patients; 23.5% (20/85), 22.8% (13/57), 20.0%(5/25), and 55.3% (47/85), 49.1% (28/57), 40.0% (10/25), respectively in autism patients. Meanwhile the clinical cure rates and the clinical improvement rates at 3, 12, and 36 months were 47.7% (714/1 497), 42.8% (425/994), 39.1% (128/327), and 29.1% (436/1 497), 27.0% (268/994), 28.1% (92/327), respectively in the nasointestinal tube group; 38.7% (175/452), 30.% (91/301), 33.3% (16/48), and 24.3% (110/452), 26.% (79/301), 25.0% (12/48), respectively in the oral capsule group; 34.4% (21/61), 32.7% (17/52), 18.% (4/22), and 21.3% (13/61), 13.5% (7/52), 45.5% (10/22), respectively in colonoscopy group. No serious adverse events occurred during treatment and follow-up period. The adverse event of nasointestinal tube group presented higher ratio of discomfort in respiratorytract accounting for 13.1% (196/1497); the oral capsule group had a higher proportion of nausea and vomiting when swallowing capsules accounting for 7.1% (32/452); the colonoscopy group was mainly diarrhea, accounting for 37.7% (23/61). The above symptoms disappeared after the nasointestinal tube was removed, or after treatment ended, or within 1 to 3 days after hospitalization.

Health outcomes of children born to mothers with IBD seem favorable. However, little is known about the quality of life related to their health compared to children born to healthy mothers. Therefore, our first objective was to investigate the effect of having IBD during pregnancy on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children born to mothers with IBD in the first 5 years of age compared to children born to healthy mothers. Secondly, we studied the effect of the different IBD related factors on the HRQoL.We prospectively followed 264 women with IBD, who visited the preconception outpatient clinic at our tertiary health center in the Netherlands from April 2013 through November 2016. Women of children aged 1-5 years were approached to fill in a 43-item validated TNO-AZL Preschool Children Quality of Life questionnaire (TAPQOL) to assess HRQoL (Fekkes et al., 2000; Bunge et al., 2005 [1,]). Outcomes were compared to children of mothers without IBD.One-hundred-eighty-two women completed the TAPQOL questionnaire. In total 182 children of mothers with IBD were included [median age 3.0 years (IQR -4)]. From 70 healthy mothers, 70 children were included as controls. There was no significant difference in the HRQoL between children who were and were not born to mothers with IBD (P = .18). Also, no effect of the different IBD related factors was found.In this study, we found no effect of having IBD during pregnancy on the health-related quality of life of children in the first 5 years of life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to characterise inflammation, predict prognosis, and understand the impact of drug therapy using Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).Patients with a stricture diagnosed on MRE over a 5-year period were reviewed for MRE  extent and inflammation, clinical course, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), response to anti-TNF therapy, endoscopic dilatation, hospitalization and surgery.136 patients had 235 (77 one and 59 ≥ two) strictures.46% of patients underwent surgery after a median 6 months; median follow-up for those not requiring surgery was 41 months. Predictors of surgery: Hospitalization due to obstruction predicted subsequent surgery (OR .50; 95% CI 1.06-5.90) while anti-TNF therapy commenced at stricture diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.05-0.99). MRE characteristics associated with surgery were proximal  dilatation ≥30mm diameter (OR, .98; 95% CI 1.36-6.55), stricture  wall thickness ≥10mm (OR .42; 95% CI 1.11-5.27), and stricture length >5cm (OR .56; 95% CI 1.21-5.43). 81% of patients with these 3 adverse MRE features required surgery versus 17% if none were present (P<0.001). Accuracy for these 3 MRE variables predicting surgery was high (AUC 0.76).MRE findings in Crohn's  strictures are highly predictive of the  course and the need for future surgery. MRE may also identify who would benefit from treatment intensification. Anti-TNF therapy is associated with reduced risk of surgery and appears to alter the natural history of this complication.This article is protected by copyright.

Data were collected for 3 years following diagnosis.A total of 631 patients (late-onset 153, adult-onset 161, young adult-onset 317) were included. Colonic  was more frequent in late-onset (P < 0005), stenosing behaviour was more frequent than in adult-onset (P < 0003), but fistulising  was uncommon. Surgery rates were not different between the three age groups. Systemic steroids were prescribed more frequently in young adult-onset in the first year, but low bioavailability steroids were used more frequently in late-onset in the first  years after diagnosis (P < 0.036, P < 0.041, respectively). The use of immunomodulators and anti-TNF's even in patients with more complicated , that is, B2 or B3 behaviour (Montreal classification), remained significantly inferior (P < 0.0001) in late-onset compared to young adult-onset. Age at diagnosis, Charlson comorbidity index, and steroid used in the first year were negatively associated with the use of immunomodulators and biologics. Comorbidities, related medications and hospitalizations were more frequent in late-onset. Polypharmacy was present in 56% of elderly Crohn's  patients.Thirty-two percent of late-onset Crohn's  presented with complicated  behaviour.

We assessed correlation between Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's  (SES-CD) and individual CDAI items stratified by  location to better understand this relationship.We pooled patient-level data from 3 placebo-controlled Crohn's  (CD) trials that tested adalimumab, upadacitinib, and risankizumab.  location was defined as ileum only, colon only, or ileocolonic based upon colonoscopy at study entry. Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression assessed correlations between items of the CDAI and SES-CD.A total of 353 patients were included (20.7% ileal, 30.6% colonic, 48.7% ileocolonic ). Crohn's  Activity Index and SES-CD scores were moderately correlated (R = 0.33; P < 0.001). Among CDAI items, the strongest correlations with SES-CD were seen with very soft or liquid stool frequency (SF) and patient-reported outcome  (PRO2; which includes SF and abdominal pain score; both R = 0.36; P < 0.001); these correlations were numerically stronger in colonic  (SF: R = 0.46; P < 0.001; PRO2: R = 0.44; P < 0.001) than in ileal  (SF: R = 0.14; P = 0.23; PRO2: R = 0.21; P = 0.07), although a test for interaction was not significant. In adjusted linear regression models, the proportion of mucosa that was inflamed and the proportion of mucosa with ulceration were positively correlated, whereas the presence of strictures was inversely correlated with SF.The SF item of the CDAI is moderately correlated with SES-CD and independently correlated with mucosal ulceration, inflammation, and strictures. Understanding why  inflammation as measured endoscopically does not correlate more strongly with patients' symptoms could help develop scales that link CD pathology to patient experience.Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Inactive rhomboid protein  (iRhom2) is essential for activating TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) in immune cells, which regulates TNF-α release. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation in IBD.The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. The expression of iRhom2 and TACE in the colonic tissue of IBD patients and ,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution (TNBS)-treated mice was determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. To assess the role of iRhom2 in intestinal inflammation, colitis was induced in wild-type and iRhom2-/- mice by the administration of TNBS enema.In LPS-stimulated COLO 205 and RAW 264.7 cells, the mRNA and protein levels of TACE and iRhom2 were upregulated. The expression of TACE and iRhom2 in the colon of the IBD patients and TNBS-treated mice was significantly enhanced. The  cells that expressed high levels of iRhom2 in the colon were identified as macrophages. Finally, iRhom2 deficiency ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis by inhibiting TNF-α release.iRhom2 has an important role in intestinal inflammation through TNF-α secretion in immune cells, which suggests that iRhom2 could be a novel therapeutic target for IBD.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

However, significant challenges still exist in Latin America to facilitate the access of biological agents for physicians and patients.The aim of this review was to summarize current evidence on penetration of biological agents for CD and UC in Latin America.Data are derived from a previous complete systematic review that explored different characteristics of  (IBD) in Latin America. The studies fully included in this previous systematic review which contained detailed descriptions of the percentage of use of biological agents in different cohorts throughout Latin American and Caribbean countries were included, and descriptive findings were compiled, describing CD and UC penetration of these drugs in different patient cohorts from different countries.From the 61 studies included in the original systematic review, only 19 included data of the percentage of patients treated with biological agents. Anti-TNF use in CD varied from 1.51% in Mexico up to 46.9% in Colombia, with most of the studies describing anti-TNF use in approximately 20%-40% of CD patients. On the other side, the frequency of the use of biologics was clearly lower in UC, varying from 0% in 2009 to up 16.% in 2018, according to two different Mexican studies. Only two studies described the penetration of anti-TNF agents in IBD overall: 13.4% in a Colombian and 37.93% in a Brazilian study. No studies described percentage of use of new biologic agents (vedolizumab and ustekinumab).Penetration of anti-TNF agents in Latin America is comparable to the rest of the world in CD, but lower in UC.

However, there may be high levels due to factors other than the activity of ulcerative colitis. Our aim was to analyse possible false positive results of calprotectin for the activity of ulcerative colitis owing to the presence of  polyps.Retrospective, observational, descriptive study. Data was collected from patients monitored for  years in whom a colonoscopy had been requested within 3 months after detecting high calprotectin values (>150μg/g) and before modifying the treatment.We reviewed 39 patients and in 5 of them, with previous diagnosis of extensive ulcerative colitis,  polyps were detected. Three patients were on treatment with mesalazine, one with azathioprine and other with infliximab. All of them were asymptomatic and the endoscopy did not show macroscopic activity (endoscopic Mayo score=0) or histological activity. The median values of calprotectin were 422μg/g (IQR: 298-,408) and they remained elevated in a second measurement. In 4 of the patients the  polyps were multiple and small in size. The other patient had a polyp measuring 4cm.In clinical practice we can find high faecal calprotectin levels not due to the presence of ulcerative colitis activity, but due to other lesions such as  polyps. This fact must be taken into account before carrying out relevant changes such as step-up therapy to immunosuppressive drugs or biological drugs in patients with confirmed high calprotectin levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

DNA was obtained from the peripheral blood and analyzed by the Agena platform. The selected genes were catalase (CAT), α-defensin 5 (DEFA5), FasR, FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, PPA2, ABCB1, NOD2, PPARγ, and PKCζ. We used the elastic net algorithm and R software.We studied 240 CpGs. Sixteen CpGs showed differential methylation profiles among aCD, iCD, and CTR. We selected for validation those with the greatest differences: DEFA5 CpG_11; CpG_13; CAT CpG_31.32; TNF CpG_4, CpG_12; and ABCB1 CpG_21. Our results validated the genes DEFA5 (methylation gain) and TNF (methylation loss) with P values < 0.001. In both cases, the methylation level was maintained and did not change with CD activity (aCD vs iCD). The subanalysis comparison between aCD and iCD showed significant differential methylation profiles in other CpGs: TNF, FAS, ABCB1, CAT, and TNFRS1BF genes.The methylation status of DEFA5 and TNF genes provides a signature biomarker that characterizes patients with CD and supports the possible implication of the environment and the immune system in CD pathogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615647>[Epidemiology, treatment and prognosis of colorectal cancer in young adults in sub-Saharan Africa].</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer is the most common digestive cancer. The objectives of this study was to analyse the frequency, aetiologies, and the therapeutic and progressive aspects of colorectal cancer in young adults in Burkina Faso. This study was a 10-years descriptive study conducted in  regional hospitals in Burkina Faso. It included all patients aged 20 to 45 years admitted to these two hospitals for colon cancer or rectal cancer during the study period. A total of 116 patients were included, which was 39.% of all patients admitted for colorectal cancer during the same period. The average age of the included patients was 35.4 years old. There were 70 male patients (60.3%). Seven patients had a history of chronic , and six had a family history of colon cancer. The average consultation time was 6. months. In 25 cases (19.9%), the cancer was discovered in the context of an abdominal emergency. Ninety-two patients (79.3%) were diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4 according to the TNM Staging System. The most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (103 cases, 88.9%). Therapeutically, surgery was performed on 87 patients (75%) and chemotherapy was used in 37 cases (31.9%). Sixteen patients received radiotherapy. The intra operative mortality rate was 4.6%. The 5-year survival rate was 17%.

Patients with UC usually suffer from a lifetime of debilitating physical symptoms. Therefore, developing effective therapeutic strategy that can manage this  better and improve patients' life quality is in urgent need. Sesamin (SSM) is a lignan derived from sesame seeds. In this study, the protective effect of SSM against UC and the underlying mechanism were investigated  and . Our data showed that SSM protected Caco- cells from HO-induced oxidative stress injury via GSH-mediated scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor  (Nrf2) was significantly increased by SSM, and the ability of SSM to activate Nrf2-targeted genes was further confirmed in Caco- cells using western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In contrast, Nrf2 knockdown abolished the protective effect of SSM. Additionally, we found that SSM also activated advanced protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in Caco- cells, while either AKT or ERK inhibition can prevent SSM-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Furthermore, SSM displayed a better protective effect against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced UC compared with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in C57BL/6 mice. The enhanced Nrf2 signaling and activated AKT/ERK were also observed in the colon of mice after SSM administration. These results first demonstrate the protective effect of SSM against UC and indicate that the effect is associated with AKT/ERK activation and subsequent Nrf2 signaling enhancement. This study provides a new insight into the medicinal value of SSM and proposes it as a new natural nutrition for better managing the symptoms of UC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627144>Does symptom activity explain psychological differences in patients with irritable  syndrome and ? Results from a multi-center cross-sectional study.</a></h1><p>Irritable  syndrome (IBS) and  (IBD) have similar symptoms and are affected by psychological factors via gut-brain-interactions. However, previous studies on IBS and IBD showed inconsistent results regarding psychological factors, potentially because they failed to consider the impact of symptom activity. The aim of this study was 1) to compare psychological distress and psychological risk factors among patients with IBS, IBD and healthy controls (HC), and ) to assess the impact of symptom activity.A controlled cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients with IBS and IBD were recruited in several primary, secondary, and tertiary medical care units between 02 and 12/2017 in Germany. Overall, 381 matched participants (127/group, 63% female) were included. For the second analyses, patients with IBD were distinguished in patients with active (n = 93) and non-active (n = 34) symptoms. Psychological distress (somatization, depression, anxiety, and illness anxiety) and risk factors (adverse childhood experiences, attachment style, and mentalizing capacity) were measured.Patients with IBS showed higher psychological distress and more psychological risk factors than patients with IBD and HC. However, patients with IBD and active symptoms showed similar psychological distress than patients with IBS, except for lower illness anxiety (p < .001, η = 0.069).With the exception of higher illness anxiety in IBS patients, differences in psychological factors between patients with IBS and IBD were more strongly associated with symptom activity than with the underlying diagnosis. Therefore, this study challenges previous concepts of distinguishing functional and organic gastrointestinal , but highlights the role of symptom activity and illness anxiety.DRKS00011685.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There is controversy whether anastomotic ulcers represent  recurrence and should be included in the grading system. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of anastomotic ulcers on Crohn's  recurrence in patients with prior ileocolic resections. Secondary aims included defining the prevalence of anastomotic ulcers, risk factors for development, and their natural history.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing an ileocolic resection between 2008 and 2017 at a large academic center, with a postoperative colonoscopy assessing the neoterminal ileum and ileocolic anastomosis. The primary outcome was  recurrence defined as endoscopic recurrence (>5 ulcers in the neoterminal ileum) or need for another ileocolic resection among patients with or without an anastomotic ulcer in endoscopic remission.One hundred eighty-two subjects with Crohn's  and an ileocolic resection were included. Anastomotic ulcers were present in 95 (52.%) subjects. No factors were associated with anastomotic ulcer development. One hundred eleven patients were in endoscopic remission on the first postoperative colonoscopy. On multivariable analysis, anastomotic ulcers were associated with  recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.64; 95% CI, 1.21-10.95; P = 0.02). Sixty-six subjects with anastomotic ulcers underwent a second colonoscopy, with 31 patients (79.5%) having persistent ulcers independent of medication escalation.Anastomotic ulcers occur in over half of Crohn's  patients after ileocolic resection. No factors are associated with their development. They are associated with Crohn's  recurrence and are persistent.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press.

Understanding these geographical differences is crucial for formulating effective strategies for preventing and treating IBD. We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of IBD in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of , Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to IBD using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR .1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated. All of the estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI).In 2017, there were 6·8 million (95% UI 6·4-7·3) cases of IBD globally. The age-standardised prevalence rate increased from 79·5 (75·9-83·5) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 84·3 (79·-89·9) per 100 000 population in 2017. The age-standardised death rate decreased from 0·61 (0·55-0·69) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0·51 (0·42-0·54) per 100 000 population in 2017. At the GBD regional level, the highest age-standardised prevalence rate in 2017 occurred in high-income North America (422·0 [398·7-446·1] per 100 000) and the lowest age-standardised prevalence rates were observed in the Caribbean (6·7 [6·3-7·] per 100 000 population). High Socio-demographic Index (SDI) locations had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate, while low SDI regions had the lowest age-standardised prevalence rate. At the national level, the USA had the highest age-standardised prevalence rate (464·5 [438·6-490·9] per 100 000 population), followed by the UK (449·6 [420·6-481·6] per 100 000). Vanuatu had the highest age-standardised death rate in 2017 (1·8 [0·8-3·] per 100 000 population) and Singapore had the lowest (0·08 [0·06-0·14] per 100 000 population). The total YLDs attributed to IBD almost doubled over the study period, from 0·56 million (0·39-0·77) in 1990 to 1·02 million (0·71-1·38) in 2017. The age-standardised rate of DALYs decreased from 26·5 (21·0-33·0) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 23· (19·1-27·8) per 100 000 population in 2017.The prevalence of IBD increased substantially in many regions from 1990 to 2017, which might pose a substantial social and economic burden on governments and health systems in the coming years. Our findings can be useful for policy makers developing strategies to tackle IBD, including the education of specialised personnel to address the burden of this complex .Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Thus, our objective is to conduct a meta-analysis on the association of rosacea with IBD.We conduct a meta-analysis and searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase databases for case-controlled and cohort studies that assessed the association of rosacea with IBD from inception to July 2nd, 2018. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Disagreement was resolved by discussion. We performed random-effects model meta-analysis to obtain the pooled risk estimates for Crohn  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients with rosacea.We included three case-control and three cohort studies. The risk of bias of included studies was generally low. The meta-analysis on case-control studies showed marginally increased odds of CD (pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.69) and a significantly increased odds of UC (pooled OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.43-1.89) in patients with rosacea. The meta-analysis on cohort studies demonstrated significant increased risk of CD (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% CI 1.14-.20) and UC (pooled HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.37) in patients with rosacea.The evidence indicates an association of rosacea with IBD.

Twenty-two (51%) had perforated appendicitis that was medically managed prior to interval appendectomy. Sixteen of 21 noninterval appendectomies were performed for clinically suspected acute appendicitis. Among them, 1 had Crohn's  identified during surgery. None of the other patients had a subsequent diagnosis of  (median follow-up of 4 weeks). There were significantly more cases with mucosal-only granulomas as well as fewer serosal granulomas in the noninterval appendectomy specimens than the interval specimens ( = .014). When performed, special stains for microorganisms did not contribute to clinical care. In the same time period, GA was seen in 6 (6%) of 94  resections for Crohn's .GA is rare in pediatric patients, with interval appendectomy being the most common etiology and only rarely associated with Crohn's . Granulomas in interval appendectomies tend to be serosal-based. Special stains for infectious organisms in GA are of low diagnostic yield and have little impact on clinical management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p> (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota. Multiple clinical and animal data have shown that  is associated with a healthy mucosa. However, its precise role in colitis is currently unknown. Our study aimed to determine its protective effects and underlying mechanisms in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were administered  Muc or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once daily by oral gavage for 14 days. Colitis was induced by drinking % DSS from days 0 to 6, followed by  days of drinking normal water. Mice were weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that  improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology scores and enhanced barrier function. Serum and tissue levels of  cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL1α, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF, and KC) decreased as a result of  administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences showed that  induced significant gut microbiota alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that pro- cytokines and other injury factors were negatively associated with , , and , which were prominently abundant in -treated mice. We confirmed that  treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut barrier function and reduce the levels of  cytokines, or by improving the microbial community.

Natural products derived from plants that are rich in bioactive compounds are used by many patients with IBD. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus of the Caatinga family that has been used by the local population for food and medicinal purposes. The intestinal anti- effect of xique-xique cladode juice was evaluated in the present study. A dose of 5 mL kg-1 had a protective effect on intestinal inflammation, with an improvement in macroscopic damage, and a decrease in pro- markers and oxidative stress, in addition to preserving the colonic tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the downregulation of IL-17, NF-κB, and iNOS, and upregulation of SOCs-1, ZO-1, and MUC-. These protective effects could be attributed to the phenolic compounds as well as the fibers present in xique-xique juice.

Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248 IBD biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39./38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.5%). VDZ was associated with later non-persistence in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.675; p = 0.003) compared to anti-TNFα.Only 60-70% of IBD -patients are still persistent with their biologic therapy after 12 months. VDZ therapy is associated with a higher persistence than anti-TNFα therapy in this analysis.© 2019 S.

Mice with IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents IBD-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented IBD-like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal  cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC and inadequate response to existing treatment.This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial was conducted at 17 centers in Japan between April 2012 and September 2014. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC received a treatment protocol comprising 5 mg/kg IFX at Weeks 0, , and 6, and Clinical Activity Index (CAI)-based responders at Week 8 also received treatment at 8-week intervals at Weeks 14 and 22, with a final evaluation at Week 30.A total of 21 patients were treated in this study. IFX therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms, and this effect was maintained for up to 30 weeks. Overall CAI-based remission rate was 42.9% and overall Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)-based remission rate was 19.0%. Median partial Mayo score was 6.0 at baseline and 4.0 at Week 30 (overall). Among the eight patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy, Mayo response was achieved at Week 30 (overall) in three patients (37.5%). Trough serum IFX concentrations in Week 8 CAI-based responders were maintained throughout the study period. Adverse events and serious adverse events were observed in 95. and 14.3% of patients, respectively.These results support the use of IFX in the treatment of pediatric patients with UC with inadequate response to existing treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number:  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626701>Unique Phenotypic Characteristics and Clinical Course in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Multicenter US Experience.</a></h1><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare phenotype. We aimed to assess patients with UC-PSC or UC alone and describe differences in clinical and phenotypic characteristics, antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and long-term clinical outcomes.This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of UC from 1962 through 2015. We evaluated clinical factors associated with UC-PSC vs UC alone and assessed associations by using multivariable logistic regression models.Among 522 patients with UC, 56 (10.7%) had PSC. Compared with UC alone, patients with UC-PSC were younger (younger than 20 years) at diagnosis (odds ratios [OR], .35; adjusted P = 0.02) and had milder UC severity (adjusted P = 0.05), despite having pancolonic involvement (OR, 7.01; adjusted P < 0.001). In the biologics era (calendar year 2005 to 2015), patients with UC-PSC less commonly received anti-TNF therapy compared with patients with UC (OR, 0.38; adjusted P = 0.009), but their response rates were similar. Fewer patients with UC-PSC received corticosteroids (OR, 0.24; adjusted P = 0.005) or rectal 5-aminosalicyte acid (OR, 0.26; adjusted P < 0.001). Other differences were identified that were not statistically significant in a multivariable model: patients with UC-PSC more commonly were male, had lower rates of smoking, and had higher rates of colorectal cancer and colectomy.This study identified a unique phenotype of UC with concurrent PSC, which had different clinical behavior compared with UC only. These phenotypic characteristics can help identify high-risk patients with UC before PSC is diagnosed and guide different management and monitoring strategies.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

We performed a randomized, controlled trial to investigate the effects of a low-FODMAP diet on persistent gut symptoms, the intestinal microbiome, and circulating markers of inflammation in patients with quiescent IBD.We performed a single-blind trial of 52 patients with quiescent Crohn's  or ulcerative colitis and persistent gut symptoms at  large gastroenterology clinics in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that followed a diet low in FODMAPs (n=27) or a control diet (n=25), with dietary advice, for 4 weeks. Gut symptoms and health-related quality of life were measured using validated questionnaires. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and end of trial. We assessed fecal microbiome composition and function using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and phenotypes of T cells in blood using flow cytometry.A higher proportion of patients reported adequate relief of gut symptoms following the low-FODMAP diet (14/27, 52%) than the control diet (4/25, 16%, P=.007). Patients had a greater reduction in irritable  syndrome severity scores following the low-FODMAP diet (mean reduction of 67; standard error, 78) than the control diet (mean reduction of 34; standard error, 50), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=.075). Following the low-FODMAP diet, patients had higher health-related quality of life scores (81.9±1.) than patients on the control diet (78.3±1., P=.042). A targeted analysis revealed that in stool samples collected at the end of the study period, patients on the low-FODMAP diet had significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B longum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii than patients on control diet. However, microbiome diversity and markers of inflammation did not differ significantly between groups.In a trial of the low-FODMAP diet vs a control diet in patients with quiescent IBD, we found no significant difference after 4 weeks in change in irritable  syndrome severity scores, but significant improvements in specific symptom scores and numbers reporting adequate symptom relief. The low-FODMAP diet reduced fecal abundance of microbes believed to regulate the immune response, compared with the control diet, but had no significant effect on markers of inflammation. We conclude that a 4-week diet low in FODMAPs is safe and effective for managing persistent gut symptoms in patients with quiescent IBD. www.isrctn.com no: ISRCTN17061468.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

At our center, preemptive appendicectomy is performed at the time of pancreas transplant to prevent any future risk in a complex transplant patient. The aim of this study was to review all histology reports from the removed appendices.The histology reports from all incidental appendicectomies performed at pancreas transplant were reviewed.Between January 2001 and June 2016, 107 pancreas transplants were performed (86 simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplants, 11 pancreas after kidney transplants, and 10 pancreas transplants alone), and 65 appendix histology reports were available from this patient group. All were preemptive appendicectomies as none of the patients had symptoms to suggest acute appendicitis. Of the 65 appendix histologies, 43 (66.%) were reported as normal. Twenty specimens (30.8%) showed fibrosis consistent with previous inflammation of the appendix, and 12 specimens (18.5%) showed fecal material in the lumen (1 due to an obstructing fecalith and another  showing luminal distension with feces). Three specimens (4.6%) showed lymphoid hyperplasia. There were 5 (7.7 %) unexpected findings upon histology. In review of histology reports, 1 patient had a 1.1-mm carcinoid tumor in an otherwise normal appendix, 1 had an Enterobius species worm infestation, 1 had focal endometriosis, 1 had crypt abscesses suggestive of , 1 had a metaplastic polyp, and 1 had melanosis coli of unknown clinical significance. There were no cases of overt acute appendicitis.

Children who received conventional therapy (including 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, thiopurines and methotrexate) since diagnosis were included. Primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission without need for rescue therapy (biologics or surgery) at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and at last follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modelling was performed to determine variables at diagnosis associated with outcomes.In total, 176 IBD patients (121 CD, 55 UC) were identified with a median follow-up of 4.6 [.0-8.1] years. Remission rates were 79.6% at month 6, but decreased to 60.% at month 12, and 31.8% at last follow-up.
