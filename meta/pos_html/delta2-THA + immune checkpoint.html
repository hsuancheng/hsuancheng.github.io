The very low survival rates are mainly related to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. GC is the final clinical outcome of a stepwise process that starts with a chronic and sustained inflammatory reaction mounted in response to  infection. The bacterium modulates innate and adaptive immunity presumably as part of the strategies to survive, which favors the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that ultimately facilitates GC progression. T- exhaustion, which is characterized by elevated expression of   (IC) proteins, is one of the most salient manifestations of immunosuppressive microenvironments. It has been consistently demonstrated that the tumor- microenvironment(TIME)-exhausted phenotype can be reverted by blocking ICs with monoclonal antibodies. Although these therapies are associated with long-lasting response rates, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit, which varies according to tumor site. The search for biomarkers to predict the response to IC inhibition is a matter of intense investigation as this may contribute to maximize disease control, reduce side effects, and minimize cost. The approval of pembrolizumab for its use in GC has rocketed immuno-oncology research in this cancer type. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge centered around the  contexture and recent findings in connection with IC inhibition in GC.Copyright © 2019 Lucía Figueroa-Protti et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632619>Degradation of tumour stromal hyaluronan by small extracellular vesicle-PH20 stimulates CD103 dendritic cells and in combination with PD-L1 blockade boosts anti-tumour immunity.</a></h2><p>Highly accumulated hyaluronan (HA) not only provides a physiological barrier but also supports an -suppressive tumour microenvironment. High-molecular-weight (HMW)-HA inhibits the activation of  cells and their access into tumour tissues, whereas, low-molecular-weight oligo-HA is known to potentially activate dendritic cells (DCs). In this paper, we investigated whether small extracellular vesicle (EVs)-PH20 hyaluronidase induces tumour HA degradation, which, in turn, activates DCs to promote anti-cancer  responses. Informed by our previous work, we used a small EV carrying GPI-anchored PH20 hyaluronidase (Exo-PH20) that could deeply penetrate into tumour foci via HA degradation. We found that Exo-PH20-treatment successfully activates the maturation and migration of DCs , particularly CD103 DCs leading to the activation of tumour-specific CD8 T cells, which work together to inhibit tumour growth. Moreover, combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody provided potent tumour-specific CD8 T   responses as well as elicited prominent tumour growth inhibition both in syngenic and spontaneous breast cancer models, and this anti-tumour immunity was durable. Together, these results present new insights for HA degradation by Exo-PH20, providing a better understanding of oligo HA-triggered  responses to cancer.© 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, new therapeutic interventions are needed to increase the immunogenicity of tumors and overcome the resistance to these immunotherapies. Oncolytic properties of common viruses can be exploited for the priming of antitumor immunity, and such oncolytic viruses are currently in active clinical development in combination with  -targeted therapies. However, the routine implementation of these therapies is limited by their manufacturing constraints, the risk of exposure of clinical staff, and the ongoing regulations on genetically modified organisms. We sought to determine whether anti-infectious disease vaccines could be used as a commercially available source of immunostimulatory agents for cancer immunotherapy. We found that rotavirus vaccines have both immunostimulatory and oncolytic properties. In vitro, they can directly kill cancer cells with features of immunogenic  death. In vivo, intratumoral rotavirus therapy has antitumor effects that are dependent on the  system. In several immunocompetent murine tumor models, intratumoral rotavirus overcomes resistance to and synergizes with  -targeted therapy. Heat- and UV-inactivated rotavirus lost their oncolytic activity but kept their synergy with  -targeted antibodies through the up-regulation of the double-stranded RNA receptor retinoic acid-induced gene 1 (RIG-I). Rotavirus vaccines are clinical-grade products used in pediatric and adult populations. Therefore, in situ immunization strategies with intratumoral-attenuated rotavirus could be implemented quickly in the clinic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

According to the current World Health Organization classification for GEP-NENs and lung NENs, treatment strategies differ for well-differentiated and poorly differentiated subtypes. For well-differentiated GEP-NENs, somatostatin analogues (SSA), peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and molecular-targeted agents are approved as the standards of care based on phase III clinical trial data. Promising data regarding the use of everolimus and the novel SSA pasireotide for lung NENs are emerging, though additional studies are required to confirm these effects. For poorly differentiated tumors from the GEP tract and lung, a platinum-based cytotoxic regimen is widely used. Genomic analysis has recently revealed a diverse pattern of primary organ-dependent mutations, and the use of traditional treatment strategies versus organ-specific strategies is currently under discussion. In addition, clinical trials for several molecular-targeted agents and   inhibitors for the treatment of NENs are currently underway. Accumulating genomic information is expected to contribute to the development of novel therapies for other organ-derived NENs or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). Here, we provide an updated overview of the current knowledge regarding genomic profiles and representative agents for NENs and highlight the prospects for future investigations.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636245>Virotherapy as a Potential Therapeutic Approach for the Treatment of Aggressive Thyroid Cancer.</a></h2><p>Virotherapy is a novel cancer treatment based on oncolytic viruses (OVs), which selectively infect and lyse cancer cells, without harming normal cells or tissues. Several viruses, either naturally occurring or developed through genetic engineering, are currently under investigation in clinical studies. Emerging reports suggesting the -stimulatory property of OVs against tumor cells further support the clinical use of OVs for the treatment of lesions lacking effective therapies. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Therefore, several groups investigated the therapeutic potential of OVs in PDTC/ATC models producing experimental data sustaining the potential clinical efficacy of OVs in these cancer models. Moreover, the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment further supports the potential use of OVs in ATC. In this review, we present the results of the studies evaluating the efficacy of OVs alone or in combination with other treatment options. In particular, their potential therapeutic combination with multiple kinases inhibitors (MKIs) or   inhibitors are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666472>Paraneoplastic Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema Syndrome Should be Treated with Low-dose Prednisolone During Pembrolizumab Therapy: The Author's Reply.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h2><p> Renal  carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal  carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However,   inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal  carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal  carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several -related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal  carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of -related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal  carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after   inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to immunotherapy in metastatic renal  carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654628>Cervical cancer patients that respond to chemoradiation therapy display an intense tumor infiltrating  profile before treatment.</a></h2><p>Cervical cancer (CC) is a major cause of death and suffering to women globally with 570,000 new cases in 2017. It disproportionately affects those living in resource-constrained countries such as Brazil, with 90% of the deaths from CC happening in low and middle-income countries. Early detection is still the best strategy for improving response to therapy and survival and cases detected in advanced stages show variable response rates to the standard chemoradiation therapy protocols. Both the genetic landscape and the  status of patients can dramatically affect cancer progression and response to therapy, as well as disease recurrence. Here we performed a comprehensive sequencing analysis using the cancer gene panel - Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer hotspot Panel V2 CHPv2, as well as determined the  infiltrate composition of a group of locally advanced CC patients with the goal of identifying genetic and  characteristics associated with a clinical response to therapy. The expression levels of CD68 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as well as the   molecules PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in stroma and in tumor regions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The HPV infection status with high-risk strains was also determined. Twenty-one samples from patients with squamous  carcinoma segregated into responder (11) and non-responder (10) groups according to standard chemoradiation therapy response were studied. Our findings indicate that responder patients showed an increase of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment as indicated by higher numbers of CD8 and PD-L2 TILs, as well as higher expression of PD-L1 immunoreactive area, as compared to the non-responder group. Additionally, our results demonstrate a correlation between the number of gene mutations and PD-L2 TILs in the responder group. The genes PIK3CA and KDR/VEGFR were the most mutated genes, corroborating past findings. Together, these findings indicate an inflammatory tumor microenvironment present in patients that will respond to future chemoradiation treatment as compared to those that will not. This points to possible future predictors of response to therapy in CC patients.Copyright © 2019.

We demonstrated the concept for a sensitive method to determine Ag-reactive T  clones based on clonal expansion using model neoantigens (NeoAgs) rather than cytokine production. Sequential increase in T  clonal frequencies following Ag stimulation was detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) of T  receptor β (TCR β) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with a higher sensitivity than that of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) by 100-fold.

After primary infection of the cornea, the virus enters latency within the trigeminal ganglion (TG), from which it can reactivate throughout the life of the host. Viral latency is maintained, in part, by virus-specific CD8 T cells that nonlethally interact with infected neurons. When CD8 T  responses are inhibited, HSV-1 can reactivate and these recurrent reactivation events can lead to blinding scarring of the cornea. In the C57BL/6 mouse, CD8 T cells specific to the immunodominant epitope from glycoprotein B maintain functionality throughout latency while CD8 T cells specific to subdominant epitopes undergo functional impairment that is associated with the expression of the inhibitory  molecule programmed death 1 (PD-1). Here, we investigate the  molecule, T- immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), which has traditionally been associated with CD8 T  exhaustion. Unexpectedly, we found that Tim-3 was preferentially expressed on highly functional ganglionic CD8 T cells during acute and latent HSV-1 infection. This, paired with data that show that Tim-3 expression on CD8 T cells in the latently infected TG is influenced by viral gene expression, suggests that Tim-3 is an indicator of recent T  stimulation, rather than functional compromise, in this model. We conclude that Tim-3 expression is not sufficient to define functional compromise during latency; however, it may be useful in identifying activated cells within the TG during HSV-1 infection. Without an effective means of eliminating HSV-1 from latently infected neurons, efforts to control the virus have centered on preventing viral reactivation from latency. Virus-specific CD8 T cells within the infected TG have been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral reactivation and with a portion of these cells exhibiting functional impairment,  molecule immunotherapies have presented a potential solution to enhancing the anti-viral response of these cells. In pursuing this potential treatment strategy, we found that Tim-3 (often associated with CD8 T  functional exhaustion) is not upregulated on impaired cells but is instead upregulated on highly functional cells that have recently received antigenic stimulation. These findings support a role for Tim-3 as a marker of activation rather than exhaustion in this model, and we provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that there is persistent viral gene expression in the HSV-1 latently infected TG.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634731>Gut microbiota and cancer: How gut microbiota modulates activity, efficacy and toxicity of antitumoral therapy.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota is involved in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Also, it modulates the activity, efficacy and toxicity of several chemotherapy agents, such as gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, irinotecan, cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil, and target therapy, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. More recently, accumulating data suggest that the composition of gut microbiota may also affect efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy.

With the next-generation sequencing methodologies, more knowledge is gathered about gut microbiome and its irreplaceable role in keeping the balance between human health and diseases is figured out.   inhibitors (ICIs) are one of the most innovational cancer immunotherapies across cancer types and significantly expand the therapeutic options of cancer patients. However, a proportion of patients show no effective responses or develop -related adverse events when responses do occur. More important, it is demonstrated that the therapeutic response or treatment-limiting toxicity of cancer immunotherapy can be ameliorated or diminished by gut microbiome modulation. In this review, we first introduce the relationship between gut microbiome and cancer immunotherapy. And then, we expound the impact of gut microbiome on efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy. Further, we review approaches to manipulating gut microbiome to regulate response to ICIs.

Typically, monoclonal antibodies are used to target the radionuclides to cancer  surface antigens. However, antibodies face limitations due to their poor tumor penetration and suboptimal pharmacokinetics, while the expression of their target on the cancer  surface may be gradually lost. In addition, most antigens are expressed in a limited number of tumor types. To circumvent these problems, we developed a Nanobody (Nb)-based RIT against a prominent stromal  (stromal-targeting radioimmunotherapy or STRIT) present in nearly all tumors, the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM). Macrophage Mannose Receptor (MMR) functions as a stable molecular target on TAM residing in hypoxic areas, further allowing the delivery of a high radiation dose to the more radioresistant hypoxic tumor regions. Since MMR expression is not restricted to TAM, we first optimized a strategy to block extra-tumoral MMR to prevent therapy-induced toxicity. A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled bivalent Nb largely blocks extra-tumoral binding of Lu-labeled anti-MMR Nb and prevents toxicity, while still allowing the intra-tumoral binding of the monovalent Nb. Interestingly, three doses of Lu-labeled anti-MMR Nb resulted in a significantly retarded tumor growth, thereby outcompeting the effects of anti-PD1, anti-VEGFR2, doxorubicin and paclitaxel in the TS/A mammary carcinoma model. Together, these data propose anti-MMR STRIT as a valid new approach for cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Until 2006, non-specific immunotherapy with high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (  inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual  inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era.

Inspired by the capability of fever-like heat in inducing an -favorable tumor microenvironment, mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is proposed to sensitize tumors to   inhibition and turn "cold" tumors "hot." Here we present a combined all-in-one and all-in-control strategy to realize a local symbiotic mild photothermal-assisted immunotherapy (SMPAI). We load both a near-infrared (NIR) photothermal agent IR820 and a programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) into a lipid gel depot with a favorable property of thermally reversible gel-to-sol phase transition. Manually controlled NIR irradiation regulates the release of aPD-L1 and, more importantly, increases the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and boosts T- activity against tumors. In vivo antitumor studies on 4T1 and B16F10 models demonstrate that SMPAI is an effective and promising strategy for treating "cold" tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666667>Patient-derived organoids as a potential model to predict response to PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Selection of cancer patients for treatment with   inhibitors remains a challenge due to tumour heterogeneity and variable biomarker detection. PD-L1 expression in 24 surgical chordoma specimen was determined immunohistochemically with antibodies 28-8 and E1L3N. The ability of patient-derived organoids to detect treatment effects of nivolumab was explored by quantitative and qualitative immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. The more sensitive antibody, E1L3N (ROC = 0.896, p = 0.001), was associated with greater tumour diameters (p = 0.014) and detected both tumour cells and infiltrating lymphocytes in 54% of patients, but only 1-15% of their cells. Organoids generated from PD-L1-positive patients contained both tumour cells and PD-1/CD8-positive lymphocytes and responded to nivolumab treatment with marked dose-dependent diameter reductions of up to 50% and increased  death in both PD-L1-positive and negative organoids.

These immunotherapies are generally better tolerated than chemotherapy, and their adverse events are -related mimicking autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Although these -related adverse events mainly affect the skin, endocrine glands, digestive tract, joints, liver or lungs, all the organs can be theoretically affected, and the haematopoietic system is not spared. This review of the literature will focus on the haematological -related adverse events (Haem-irAEs). By reviewing the largest clinical trials of ICIs, we estimate the frequency of Haem-irAEs at 3.6% for all grades and 0.7% for grades III-IV. Frequency of Haem-irAEs of all grades was found to be higher with anti-programmed  death 1 (4.1%) or anti-programmed  death ligand 1 (4.7%) than with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (0.5%) (p < 0.0001). From the 63 cases with Haem-irAEs reported in the literature, the mean time to the onset was found to be 10 weeks after ICI initiation, and the large range for occurrence (1-84 weeks) and the regular incidence suggest that Haem-irAEs could occur at any time after ICI therapy. Among the 63 reported cases with Haem-irAEs, the distribution was  thrombocytopenia (n = 18, 29%), pancytopenia or  aplastic anaemia (n = 12, 19%), neutropenia (n = 11, 17%), haemolytic anaemia (n = 10, 16%), cytokine release syndrome with haemophagocytic syndrome (n = 7, 11%) and other Haem-irAEs including bicytopenia or pure red  aplasia (n = 5, 8%). Haem-irAEs are generally highly severe adverse reactions with a mortality rate of Haem-irAEs reported to be 14% (9 deaths among the 63 cases reported). The more severe and life-threatening Haem-irAEs were both cytokine release syndrome with haemophagocytic syndrome and pancytopenia or aplastic anaemia. Haem-irAEs induced by ICIs are potentially life-threatening.

Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted to calculate progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival; the impact of influencing variables was evaluated using uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analyses.Among 153 patients (59% men, mean age 66 years), median PFS was 4 months [mo; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 3-5], OS was 13 mo (10-17), and objective response rate (ORR) was 22%. Therapy line ≥ 3 was associated with significantly inferior PFS (p = 0.003) and OS (p = 0.001). In first-line therapy PFS, OS, and ORR were 7 mo (3-11), 17 mo [9-not evaluable (n.e.)], and 36%; in second-line 4 mo (3-7), 18 mo (13-n.e.) and 19%, and in ≥ third-line 2 mo (1-3), 9 mo (4-12), and 13%. PFS was significantly influenced by PD-L1 expression in first-line therapy (p = 0.006). In ≥ third-line patients, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status significantly affected PFS and OS (both p < 0.001).Third- or later-line single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is less efficacious as compared to first- and second-line treatment. In that setting, ECOG performance status predominates known predictors like PD-L1 expression or presence of an alteration in EGFR or ALK.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646161>Nonbullous pemphigoid secondary to PD-1 inhibition.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635548>Safe use of nivolumab in a patient with renal  carcinoma and hepatitis B.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy with  inhibitors gains a major role in bladder cancer.

A recent phase II study in advanced cervical cancer has demonstrated a disease control rate of 68.4% with the   inhibitor nivolumab. By blocking  , immunotherapy puts the  system into a state of hyper-activation that can cause -related adverse events. We present the clinical, pathological and molecular data of a patient with metastatic cervical cancer and progressive disease after second-line therapy. We report on the therapeutic response under third-line immunotherapy with nivolumab, the -related adverse events (IRAE), and their successful management.We report the case of a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with advanced squamous  carcinoma of the cervix with paraaortic lymph node metastases. After an initial combined radio-chemotherapy with cisplatin, she developed local and nodal (supraclavicular) recurrence. Second-line chemotherapy with 6 cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab resulted in a partial response for 6 months.  inhibition with nivolumab was started due to progression, leading to persistent complete remission. Immunotherapy was well tolerated for 8 months until the patient presented with an -related isolated vulvitis, which was successfully managed with topical corticosteroids.The persistent complete response after third-line treatment for relapsed chemotherapy-resistant cervical cancer presented in this case highlights the potential of immunotherapy for patients with advanced cervical cancer impressively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an isolated -related vulvitis under nivolumab. This adverse event might be underdiagnosed and mistreated, however, it is of importance due to its impact on quality of life, sexual wellbeing and compliance of patients. Successful IRAE management may enable prolonged   inhibitor therapy. In the future, routine molecular tumour profiling is likely to aid in the stratification of cervical cancer patients for immunotherapy.

However, previous studies have suggested conflicting results on the conditions of occurrence of ICI-induced vitiligo.The aim of this study was to describe the occurrences and outcomes of several cases of ICI-induced vitiligo.A retrospective study was carried out using the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPD) between the beginning of the commercialization of ICI in France and 1 January 2019, selecting for analysis the vitiligo reactions of patients due to treatment with ICI.Among the 95 case patients identified in the FPD, the median times to onset of vitiligo after the start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab therapies were 5.4, 5.0, and 3.8 months, respectively. Furthermore, 37 patients (45%) discontinued ICI treatment due to disease progression. The median follow-up time of all patients was 33 months (interquartile range 2-56).This study provided an overall picture of ICI-induced vitiligo in daily medical practice on a large number of pharmacovigilance observations of case patients. Among the observations of ICI-induced vitiligo, the diagnosed cancer was melanoma for almost all patients. Most patients in the study experienced other associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as colitis, pruritus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, pancreatitis, and gastritis. Furthermore, our data suggest that the resolution of pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-induced vitiligo could be a marker of disease progression.

Therefore, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the only available adjuvant therapeutic choices for TNBC. New emerging reports show that TNBC is associated with higher numbers of intratumoral tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This is indicative of host anti-TNBC  surveillance and suggesting that immunotherapy can be considered as a therapeutic approach for TNBC management. Recent progress in molecular mechanisms of tumor- system interaction and cancer vaccine development studies, fast discoveries and FDA approvals of   inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, and oncolytic virotherapy have significantly attracted attention and research directions toward the immunotherapeutic approach to TNBC.

Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although -related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report 2 patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response. CRP as well as IL-6 was found to be a potential biomarker for irAEs.

Most recently the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small  lung cancer (ES-SCLC) resulted in improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Recent randomized studies examining both consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ES-SCLC have impacted the utilization of these interventions. The approval of   inhibitors (ICIs) to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the front-line setting may also further impact the role of radiotherapy in this disease. In this article, we review the current evidence supporting thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC and discuss the promising therapeutic implications of thoracic radiation in light of the inclusion of ICIs. We also address how the increasing routine use of surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ICIs may diminish the use of PCI in ES-SCLC.2019 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

Most known agents are ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) nivolumab and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibodies). New molecules are now approved or in development as anti-PD-L1 antibodies, anti-LAG-3 or anti-TIM-3 antibodies, increasing the probability and new description of -related adverse events.

Immunotherapy-related hepatitis and cholangitis present a diagnostic and management challenge, being rare and incompletely characterised. We aim to report the incidence, features and treatments used for this in a real-world setting and to identify useful biomarkers, which can be used to predict effective use of steroids.Retrospective review of 453 patients started on immunotherapy over 7 years.Tertiary hepatology and oncology centre.21 patients identified with immunotherapy-related hepatotoxicity.Hepatitis was most common in those receiving dual therapy (incidence 20%), with 75% of Grade 4 hepatitis cases occurring with ipilimumab-containing regimens. Corticosteroid monotherapy is first line treatment, but doses above 60 mg OD prednisolone do not demonstrate any additional benefit in time to hepatitis resolution. The alanine transaminase (ALT) reduction in steroid-responsive hepatitis is typically rapid (with a halving of ALT within 11 days). The commencement of additional immunosuppression (typically mycophenolate) appears safe and prompts a more rapid fall in ALT than corticosteroid use alone. Infliximab was safely used twice as hepatitis treatment. We also describe one patient with rare immunotherapy-induced biliary disease.Vigilance is required for detection of immunotherapy-associated liver disease as, other than dual immunotherapy, we can identify no predictive factors for its development. Our data suggest that corticosteroid response is not dependent on the higher dosing regimens. Early escalation of immunosuppression may be of benefit in the absence of a rapid response to corticosteroids.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

However,   blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more  modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1   blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T  to respond to the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T- reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T- inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624532>Suppressing immunotherapy by organ-specific tumor microenvironments: what is in the brain?</a></h2><p>Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have led to curative efficacy and significantly prolonged survival in a subset of patients of multiple cancer types; and immunotherapy has become the newest pillar of cancer treatment in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and precision targeted therapies. In the metastatic disease setting, responses to immunotherapy are heterogeneous depending on the metastatic organ sites. The tissue-specific immuno-biology in the tumor microenvironments (TMEs) contributes to the differential therapeutic responses. Herein, we review the impact of tissue-specific tumor microenvironment on the efficacy of immunotherapy, with a focus on historically under-represented central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, which was excluded from most clinical trials. Retrospective examination of patient specimens and prospective clinical studies with   blockade (ICB) have established that brain can harbor an "active"  microenvironment for effective immunotherapy. Regulation by the innate  microglial cells and remodeling of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to immunotherapeutic responses mediated by T lymphocytes. How to convert an "inactive" (cold) brain microenvironment into an "active" (hot) brain TME should be the focus of future efforts. Thus, procurement and complete examination of clinical specimens from brain metastases as well as development of appropriate preclinical brain metastasis models susceptible to external manipulation of the TME are critical steps towards that goal. A deeper understanding of the immuno-biology in distinct organ microenvironments will help to expand the benefits of immunotherapy to more needed patients.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666701>The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour immunity.</a></h2><p>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and encodes a key signalling protein in tumours.

Here we optimized a series of inhibitors, using novel binding interactions to markedly enhance their potency and selectivity. Our efforts have led to the discovery of AMG 510, which is, to our knowledge, the first KRAS(G12C) inhibitor in clinical development. In preclinical analyses, treatment with AMG 510 led to the regression of KRAS tumours and improved the anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents. In -competent mice, treatment with AMG 510 resulted in a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and produced durable cures alone as well as in combination with - inhibitors. Cured mice rejected the growth of isogenic KRAS tumours, which suggests adaptive immunity against shared antigens.

In urological tumors, the use of the - inhibitors (ICIs) is increasingly spreading. Although not all patients and not all diseases respond equally well to immunotherapy, there is an increasing need to find predictive markers of response to ICIs. Patient- and tumor-related factors may be involved in primary and secondary resistance to immunotherapy: tumor-derived protein and cytokines, tumor mutational burden, and patient performance status and comorbidities can condition tumor response to ICIs. Recently, some of these factors have been evaluated as potential biomarkers of response, with conflicting results. To date, the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the presence of deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) in tumor tissue are the only biomarkers capable of guiding the clinician's decision in urothelial cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. In this review, we performed a comprehensive search of the main publications on biomarkers that are predictive of response to ICIs in urological cancers.

However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-  inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.84-2.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650066>First-in-human phase I clinical trial of a combined  modulatory approach using TetMYB vaccine and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced solid cancer including colorectal or adenoid cystic carcinoma: The MYPHISMO study protocol (NCT03287427).</a></h2><p>MYB is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and also a driver mutation in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC).

However, limited progress with Tim-3 immunotherapy has been achieved over the last decade due to the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells.

To further improve response rates, we explored combining anti-CTLA4 blockade with antisense suppression of CD47, an inhibitory receptor on T cells that limit T- receptor signaling and killing of irradiated target cells. Human melanoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed positive correlations between CD47 mRNA expression and expression of T- regulators including CTLA4 and its counter receptors CD80 and CD86. Antisense suppression of CD47 on human T cells in vitro using a translational blocking morpholino (CD47 m) alone or combined with anti-CTLA4 enhanced antigen-dependent killing of irradiated melanoma cells. Correspondingly, the treatment of locally irradiated B16F10 melanomas in C57BL/6 mice using combined blockade of CD47 and CTLA4 significantly increased the survival of mice relative to either treatment alone. CD47 m alone or in combination with anti-CTLA4 increased CD3 T- infiltration in irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 also increased CD3 and CD8 T- infiltration as well as markers of NK cells in non-irradiated tumors. Anti-CTLA4 combined with CD47 m resulted in the greatest increase in intratumoral granzyme B, interferon-γ, and NK- marker mRNA expression.

Despite its great efficacy, the therapy is associated with a wide spectrum of -related adverse events (irAE) including neurological symptoms which can affect all parts of the central and peripheral nervous system. Even though these events are rare, they are of high relevance as the rate of residual symptoms or even fatal outcomes is remarkable. To provide a detailed overview of neurological adverse events associated with  -inhibitor therapy we conducted a literature search. While focusing on ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab therapy, all available case reports as well as larger case series and clinical trials have been considered. Eighty-two case reports about -inhibitor therapy induced symptoms of the peripheral nervous system have been published, while only 43 case reports addressed central nervous system abnormalities. The frequency of  -inhibitor therapy inducing neurological adverse events is about 1% in larger studies. Especially neuromuscular adverse events exhibit distinct clinical and diagnostic characteristics.

Radiation has been shown to significantly alter the tumor microenvironment, cause immunogenic  death, and potentiate anti-tumor  responses. Several radiation parameters may modulate these effects. Clinical data to date have suggested that combination therapy is largely well tolerated, but additional study is warranted to better estimate both short-term and long-term risks of combination treatment and extend these data to new immunotherapy agents.

The principle of action can be explained as "brake theory". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal -related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop. In this article, we summarized the recommended treatments of grade 3-4 severe irAEs in the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines and consensus. We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the "De-escalation Therapy" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible. Many irAEs in the era of immunotherapy are unprecedented compared with traditional chemotherapy and small-molecule targeted therapy, which is a big challenge to oncologists. Therefore, the establishment of multidisciplinary system is very important for the management of cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628024>DNA methylation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in head and neck squamous  carcinomas correlates with IDO1 expression, HPV status, patients' survival,   infiltrates, mutational load, and interferon γ signature.</a></h2><p>The  , indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, is under investigation as target of novel immunotherapies for cancers, including head and neck squamous  carcinomas (HNSCC). The aim of our study was to analyze DNA methylation of the encoding gene (IDO1) in HNSCC.Methylation of three CpG sites within the promoter, promoter flank, and gene body was investigated and correlated with mRNA expression,   infiltration, mutational burden, human papillomavirus (HPV)-status, and overall survival in a cohort of N = 528 HNSCC patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, IDO1 immunohistochemistry and DNA methylation analysis was performed in an independent cohort of N = 138 HNSCC samples.Significant inverse correlations of IDO1 methylation and IDO1 mRNA expression were found in the promoter and promoter flank region (Spearman's ρ = -0.163 and ρ = -0.377, respectively) while a positive correlation was present in the gene body (ρ = 0.502; all P < 0.001). IDO1 DNA methylation significantly correlated with IDO1 protein expressing  cells as well as tumor cells. IDO1 promoter flank hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P < 0.001). In addition, we discovered significant correlations between IDO1 methylation and expression with RNA signatures of   infiltrates and with HPV-status, mutational load (methylation only), and interferon γ signature.Our results suggest IDO1 expression levels are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This study provides rationale to test IDO1 methylation as potential biomarker for prediction of response to IDO1   inhibitors in HNSCC.Crown Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with immunotherapy to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion. To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect  was observed.  experiments demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT . Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the  gene PD-L1 that mediates the  resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the  system.

Despite global biomedical and public health efforts, standard interventions to control the pandemic have not advanced in most resource-poor settings, in contrast to other global diseases such as malaria and HIV infection. The authors propose that reconsidering concepts of the optimal host  response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required to develop a paradigm that will inform novel interventions. The development of active tuberculosis associated with cancer treatment by   inhibition highlights that merely driving a stronger  response may not improve control of the pathogen. Here, we present different models of the host-pathogen interaction that are consistent with the complexity of human infection. We consider both the protective and harmful components of the  response in tuberculosis and develop a multiparameter framework that predicts disease risk.

One aspect of  death is the potential to release antigens that initiate adaptive  responses. Here, a diffusion enhanced formulation, INT230-6, containing potent anti-cancer cytotoxic agents, was administered intratumorally into large (approx. 300mm) subcutaneous murine Colon26 tumors. Treatment resulted in regression from baseline in 100% of the tumors and complete response in up to 90%. CD8 or CD8/CD4 T  double-depletion at treatment onset prevented complete responses, indicating a critical role of T cells in promoting complete tumor regression. Mice with complete response were protected from subcutaneous and intravenous re-challenge of Colon26 cells in a CD4/CD8 dependent manner. Thus, immunological T  memory was induced by INT230-6. Colon26 tumors express the endogenous retroviral protein gp70 containing the CD8 T- AH-1 epitope. AH-1-specific CD8 T cells were detected in peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice and their frequency increased 14 days after treatment onset. AH-1-specific CD8 T cells were also significantly enriched in tumors of untreated mice. These cells had an activated phenotype and highly expressed Programmed -death protein-1 (PD-1) but did not lead to tumor regression. CD8 T  tumor infiltrate also increased 11 days after treatment. INT230-6 synergized with  blockade, inducing a complete remission of the primary tumors and shrinking of untreated contralateral tumors, which demonstrates not only a local but also systemic immunological effect of the combined therapy.

In advanced gastric cancer (AGC) patients, there have been few reports about the correlation between irAEs and efficacy of   inhibitors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the correlation between irAEs and efficacy in AGC patients treated with nivolumab.The subjects of this study were AGC patients received nivolumab monotherapy between January 2015 and August 2018. IrAEs were defined as those AEs having a potential immunological basis that required close follow-up, or immunosuppressive therapy and/or endocrine therapy. We divided the patients who received nivolumab into two groups based on occurrence of irAEs; those with irAEs (irAE group) or those without (non-irAE group). We assessed the efficacy in both groups.Of the 65 AGC patients that received nivolumab monotherapy, 14 developed irAEs. The median time to onset of irAEs was 30.5 days (range 3-407 days). Median follow-up period for survivors was 32 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 34.5). The median progression-free survival was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.5) in the irAE group and 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.11, p < 0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached) in the irAE group and 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in the non-irAE group (HR = 0.17, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of metastatic sites ≥2 (HR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 4.54), high ALP level (HR = 2.50; 95% CI, 1.27 to 4.54), and absence of irAEs (HR = 9.54, 95% CI, 3.34 to 27.30 for yes vs. no) were associated with a poor prognosis.

This represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment from directly targeting tumor cells to harnessing the power of a patient's own  system to destroy them. The cGAS-STING pathway is the major cytosolic dsDNA sensing pathway that plays a pivotal role in the innate antitumor response. With a fundamentally different mode of action (MOA) than   modulators, STING activation can potentially enhance tumor immunogenicity and improve patient responses by synergizing with existing anti-cancer drugs. Therefore, there has been intense interest from the pharmaceutical industry and academic institutions in search of potent STING agonists for immuno-oncology application. In this article, we review briefly the cGAS-STING pathway and STING agonists that are in the clinical and preclinical studies, summarize recently disclosed patent applications and published journal articles in the field and cover both cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) analogs and non-nucleic acid derived STING agonists.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645587>Structural and In Vitro Functional Analyses of Novel Plant-Produced Anti-Human PD1 Antibody.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising and effective treatment for cancer. The frequently used immunotherapy agents are   inhibitors, such as antibodies specific to PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4. However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable. Plant-produced nivolumab binds to human PD1 protein with high affinity and specificity, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and enhances T  function, comparable to commercial nivolumab. These results confirmed that plant-produced anti-PD1 antibody has the potential to be effective agent for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646105>Apoptotic caspases inhibit abscopal responses to radiation and identify a new prognostic biomarker for breast cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Caspase 3 (CASP3) has a key role in the execution of apoptosis, and many cancer cells are believed to disable CASP3 as a mechanism of resistance to cytotoxic therapeutics. Alongside, CASP3 regulates stress-responsive immunomodulatory pathways, including secretion of type I interferon (IFN). Here, we report that mouse mammary carcinoma TSA cells lacking  or subjected to chemical caspase inhibition were as sensitive to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy (RT)  as their control counterparts, yet secreted increased levels of type I IFN. This effect originated from the accrued accumulation of irradiated cells with cytosolic DNA, likely reflecting the delayed breakdown of cells experiencing mitochondrial permeabilization in the absence of CASP3.  TSA cells growing in immunocompetent syngeneic mice were more sensitive to RT than their CASP3-proficient counterparts, and superior at generating  abscopal responses in the presence of an   blocker. Finally, multiple genetic signatures of apoptotic proficiency were unexpectedly found to have robust negative (rather than positive) prognostic significance in a public cohort of breast cancer patients. However, these latter findings were not consistent with genetic signatures of defective type I IFN signaling, which were rather associated with improved prognosis. Differential gene expression analysis on patient subgroups with divergent prognosis (as stratified by independent signatures of apoptotic proficiency) identified  as a new biomarker with independent prognostic value in breast cancer patients. With the caveats associated with the retrospective investigation of heterogeneous, public databases, our data suggest that apoptotic caspases may influence the survival of breast cancer patients (or at least some subsets thereof) via mechanisms not necessarily related to type I IFN signaling as they identify a novel independent prognostic biomarker that awaits prospective validation.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665051>Immunotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer: state of the art and future perspectives.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease with primary or acquired incurability characteristics in a significant part of patients. Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The  system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial  system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant -mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the   inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of immunotherapy in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning immunotherapy in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block,   inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

In glioblastoma, lymphocytic ganglionitis has not been reported and  inhibitors are not routinely used. Here we report a case of glioblastoma not treated with  inhibitors in which the primary tumor and peripheral ganglia of the celiac and sympathetic chains, as well as myenteric plexus, are infiltrated by CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. In addition to the marked lymphocytic infiltrates, this case is also notable for an unusually long survival (8 years) after diagnosis with glioblastoma, but an ultimately fatal outcome due to ileus. The findings suggest T-  attack of glioblastoma may prolong survival, but also suggest T- autoimmune diseases such as lymphocytic ganglionitis could become a risk with the future use of -targeted therapies for glioblastoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Multimodal therapies employing agents that can affect different arms of the  system and/or tumor microenvironment might increase clinical responses.We demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of the IL-15 superagonist, N-803 plus vaccine in 4T1 triple-negative breast and MC38-CEA colon murine carcinoma models. A comprehensive  and gene expression analysis was performed in the periphery and/or tumor microenvironment (TME) of MC38-CEA tumor-bearing mice.Although N-803 plus vaccine induced peripheral CD8 T  activation and cytokine production, there was no reduction in tumor burden and poor tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells with minimal levels of granzyme B. For the first time, we demonstrate that the addition of entinostat to N-803 plus vaccine promoted significant tumor control, correlating with increased expression of genes associated with tumor inflammation, enhanced infiltration of activated CD8 T cells with maximal granzyme B, T- responses to multiple tumor-associated antigens, increased serum IFNg, reduction of regulatory T cells in the TME, and decreased expression of the  V-domain Ig Suppressor of T  Activation (VISTA) on multiple  subsets.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the synergistic combination of entinostat, N-803, and vaccine elicits potent anti-tumor activity by generating a more inflamed TME.

Here, we show that the blockade of the CD11b-dependent extravasation of myeloid cells blocks such a combination effect as well. Based on the characterization of the myeloid and lymphoid  infiltrates, including the expression pattern of   proteins (and noting a chemotherapy-induced overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1, PD-L1, on both cancer cells and leukocytes, as well as a reduced frequency of exhausted CD8 T cells positive for programmed  death 1 protein, PD-1), we then evaluated the possibility to combine ICD inducers, CRMs and targeting of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. While fasting or CRMs failed to improve tumor growth control by PD-1 blockade, ICD inducers alone achieved a partial sensitization to treatment with a PD-1-specific antibody. However, definitive cure of most of the tumor-bearing mice was only achieved by a tritherapy combining (i) ICD inducers exemplified by mitoxantrone and oxaliplatin, (ii) CRMs exemplified by hydroxycitrate and spermidine and substitutable for by fasting, and (iii)   inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.

Pembrolizumab is used for non-small  lung carcinoma with high programmed  death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. It has been found that better overall survival can be obtained using pembrolizumab compared to the existing chemotherapy. We report a case of perforation of small intestinal metastasis after pembrolizumab treatment.A 62-year-old man was treated by pembrolizumab for PD-L1 highly expressed lung adenocarcinoma, with multiple metastasis (small intestinal, lymph nodes, and bone). The treatment was stopped owing to drug-induced pneumonitis. One month after drug withdrawal, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital with the complaint of severe stomachache. He had a rigid abdomen and generalized tenderness, and computed tomography scans showed free air within the abdomen. We diagnosed bowel perforation and performed emergency surgery. Surgical findings revealed multiple small intestine metastasis and mesenteric lymph node metastasis. Perforation was found in the metastatic site in the jejunum located around 40 cm anal to Treitz's ligament. This perforated part was resected, and functional end-to-end anastomosis was performed using linear staplers. The post-operative course was uneventful. Pathological examination revealed lung adenocarcinoma metastasis at the perforation site, and the effectiveness of pembrolizumab was grade 1b (Japanese Classification of the Colorectal Carcinoma, seventh edition).This is the first report of perforation of small intestinal metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma after pembrolizumab treatment. Because pembrolizumab causes some side effects, particularly autoimmune side effects, careful attention during treatment is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650943>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for the Pneumonitis Associated with   Inhibitor].</a></h2><p>The increasing use of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in tumors has brought new hope of survival to patients with advanced tumors.

Ligands provided by constituents of the tumour microenvironment engage receptors expressed by malignant T cells, promoting tumour growth and chemotherapy resistance. In addition to stimulatory receptors that promote the growth and survival of malignant T cells, recent studies suggest that homologous inhibitory receptors may have an opposing effect and function as tumour suppressors. For example, recent data suggest that programmed  death 1 blockade may lead to increased lymphoma growth. Therefore, the identification of alternative  receptors in T  lymphoproliferative neoplasms is an important and clinically relevant question.The  receptors T  immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3), V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T  activation (VISTA) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) play fundamental roles in peripheral tolerance, and their ligands are exploited by many solid tumours to evade host immunity. However, their expression in T  lymphoproliferative neoplasms has not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the expression of TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 in a cohort of peripheral T  lymphomas cases by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis.Our results demonstrate that TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 expression is rarely identified within a large cohort of T  lymphomas and its tumour microenvironment.Our data suggest that -regulatory roles for TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 may be predominant in lymphomas subsets different than the ones analysed in the current study. However, a potential role for these  receptors as tumour suppressors in T  lymphomas remains to be elucidated.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

The substantial risks and cost associated with this procedure render it unfeasible on a large scale. This strategy also indicates that a common pathway toward a cure for both HIV and cancer may exist. Successful approaches to curing both diseases should ideally possess three components, i.e., (1) direct targeting of pathological cells (neoplastic cells in cancer and the HIV-infected reservoir cells), (2) subsequent impediment to reconstitution of the pool of pathological cells and (3) sustained, immunologic control of the disease (both diseases are characterized by detrimental  hyper-activation that hinders successful establishment of immunity). In this review, we explore medications that are either investigational or FDA-approved anticancer treatments that may be employed to achieve the goal of curing HIV-1. These include: thioredoxin reductase inhibitors (phases 1-3),   inhibitors (phases 1, 3), Jak inhibitors (FDA approved for arthritis and multiple cancer indications, summarized in Table 1). Of note, some of these medications such as arsenic trioxide and Jak inhibitors may also reversibly down regulate CCR5 expression on CD4 T-cells, thus escaping the ethical issues of inducing or transferring mutations in CCR5 that are presently the subject of interest as it relates to HIV-1 cure strategies.Copyright © 2019 Gavegnano, Savarino, Owanikoko and Marconi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663631>Oncolytic viruses: what to expect from its use in cancer treatment.</a></h2><p>Oncolytic viruses are biologic agents able to selectively infect and destroy cancer cells while sparing the normal ones.

Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway inflammation prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of -related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (5.35%); 50% were grade 2 and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small- lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.5% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can provide additional information to standard diagnostic techniques and can identify therapeutic targets. A 32-yr-old male with xeroderma pigmentosum developed metastatic angiosarcoma that was unresponsive to three lines of conventional sarcoma therapies. WGS was performed on his primary cancer revealing a hypermutated tumor, including clonal ultraviolet radiation-induced mutational patterns (Signature 7) and subclonal signatures of mutated DNA polymerase epsilon () (Signature 10). These signatures are associated with response to   blockade. Immunohistochemistry confirmed high PD-L1 expression in metastatic deposits. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab was commenced off-label given the  mutation and high mutational load. After four cycles, there was a significant reduction in his disease with almost complete resolution of the metastatic deposits. This case highlights the importance of WGS in the analysis, interpretation, and treatment of cancers.

While it is effective as an anti-emetic and in preventing hypersensitivity reactions, dexamethasone depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes and impacts  responses. The effect of dexamethasone on the number and quality of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes has not been reported. To address this, we calibrated the dose in two different strains of mice to achieve the same extent of peripheral blood lymphocyte depletion observed in patients with cancer. Doses that caused analogous depletion of T and B lymphocytes and NK cells from the peripheral blood, elicited no change in these populations within the tumour. The expression of   molecules PD-1, OX40, GITR and TIM3 on tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was not altered. We found that dexamethasone had a small but significant deleterious impact on weakly efficacious chemoimmunotherapy but had no effect when the protocol was highly efficacious. Based on these results, we predict that dexamethasone will have a modest negative influence on the overall effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy treatment.© 2019 The Author(s).

Combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade therapy has enhanced efficacy, but it remains unclear through what mechanisms such effects are mediated. A critical question is whether combination therapy targets and modulates the same T  populations as monotherapies. Using a mass cytometry-based systems approach, we comprehensively profiled the response of T  populations to monotherapy and combination anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic murine tumors and clinical samples. Most effects of monotherapies were additive in the context of combination therapy; however, multiple combination therapy-specific effects were observed. Highly phenotypically exhausted cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells expand in frequency following anti-PD-1 monotherapy but not combination therapy, while activated terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells expand only following combination therapy. Combination therapy also led to further increased frequency of T helper type 1 (Th1)-like CD4 effector T cells even though anti-PD-1 monotherapy is not sufficient to do so. Mass cytometry analyses of peripheral blood from melanoma patients treated with   blockade therapies similarly revealed mostly additive effects on the frequencies of T  subsets along with unique modulation of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells by combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy. Together, these findings indicate that dual blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 therapy is sufficient to induce unique cellular responses compared with either monotherapy.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Poor DC development can limit the efficacy of   blockade and  vaccination approaches. Interference in intracellular signaling cascades downstream from the receptors of major tumor-associated suppressive cytokines like IL-10 and IL-6, might improve DC development and activation, and thus enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We performed exploratory functional screens on arrays consisting of >1000 human kinase peptide substrates to identify pathways involved in DC development and its inhibition by IL-10 or IL-6. The resulting alterations in phosphorylation of the kinome substrate profile pointed to glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) as a pivotal kinase in both DC development and suppression. GSK3β inhibition blocked human DC differentiation , which was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-12p70 secretion, and a reduced capacity for T  priming. More importantly, adenoviral transduction of monocytes with a constitutively active form of GSK3β induced resistance to the suppressive effects of IL-10 and melanoma-derived supernatants alike, resulting in improved DC development, accompanied by up-regulation of co-stimulatory markers, an increase in CD83 expression levels in mature DC, and diminished release of IL-10. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated intratumoral manipulation of this pathway in an  melanoma model resulted in DC activation and recruitment, and in improved  surveillance and tumor control. We propose the induction of constitutive GSK3β activity as a novel therapeutic means to bolster DC functionality in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Author(s).

In the HIV field a double benefit of such ICPi should result from their dual ability to restore in-vitro HIV-specific CD8 T- functions and to enhance HIV production from reservoir cells, thus fulfilling the goals of the 'shock and kill' concept proposed as an HIV cure therapeutic strategy.We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting the tolerance profile of ICPi and their effects on HIV plasma loads (pVL), CD4 count, HIV reservoirs (-associated HIV-DNA) and/or HIV-specific CD8 T in PLWH.Thirty-four articles were included for a total 176 participants. 12.1% participants experienced severe adverse events and 49.4% nonsevere adverse events. pVL remained stable in 91.9% participant, showed increases in 5.8% participant, and decreases in 2.3%. CD4 count remained stable in 60.7% participants, showed increases in 24.6%, and decreases in 14.7%. Regarding ICPi effects on HIV-DNA and HIV-specific immunity, we identified three distinct profiles: profile I, transient pVL increases followed by a boost in HIV-specific CD8 T cells concomitant to a decrease in HIV-DNA, reported in one participant. Profile II: increase in HIV-specific CD8 T cells without changes in pVL or HIV-DNA, reported in three participants.

Effectiveness of   blockade in bladder adenocarcinoma is unknown due to lack of clinical trials. Due to the disease rarity, the rate of PD-L1 expression and DNA mismatch repair deficiency is largely unknown. In this study, we examined PD-L1 expression in 56 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma and mismatch repair protein expression in 42 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. Mismatch repair protein expression was uniformly intact in all cases of bladder adenocarcinoma, in comparison with 19% of advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma being mismatch repair deficient. This finding indicates that mismatch repair proteins may be combined with β-catenin and GATA-3 to create an immunostaining panel which, in addition to clinical studies, can aid in distinguishing bladder adenocarcinoma from secondary involvement by colorectal carcinoma. 4% of cases were found to overexpress PD-L1 in tumor cells while approximately a third of cases were found to display PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating  cells. These results indicate hypermutators are likely rare in bladder adenocarcinoma, yet 20-30% of the patients may be eligible for   blockade therapy.Copyright © 2019.

Although CD70 expression is a prerequisite to enrol patients in solid tumour clinical trials using anti-CD70 immunotherapy, there is currently no standardised test to evaluate CD70 expression.

In this retrospective study, over 600 tumour samples from different solid and haematological malignancies were analysed while using one validated IHC method. CD70 and CD27 expression was demonstrated in a broad range of tumour types. In solid tumours, 43% demonstrated CD70 positivity with the highest degree in renal  carcinoma (79.5%). Kaposi sarcoma showed no CD70 expression on the tumour cells. In lymphoma samples, 58% demonstrated CD70 positivity. Moreover, the co-expression of CD70 and CD27 was observed in 39% of lymphoma samples.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T -proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis B background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme B, IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells.

Recent studies have shown that the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, a novel nutritional index, can be useful for predicting the prognosis in some malignancies. However, its usefulness in predicting the clinical outcome of - inhibitor (ICI) treatment in patients with NSCLC has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the CONUT score in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy. A cut-off CONUT score of 2 was used to categorize patients into low and high CONUT groups. We evaluated the relation between the clinicopathological factors including CONUT score and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis.Twenty-two patients were classified into the low CONUT score group, while 10 were classified into the high CONUT score group. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, the number of prior treatments and the CONUT score were found to independently predict progression-free survival (PFS) (P<0.05), while the CONUT score as well as NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.05). In addition, in patients who received pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment, a high CONUT score was associated with a significantly worse PFS and overall survival in comparison to a low CONUT score.The CONUT score has potential application as a predictor of the therapeutic effect and the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Our findings suggest that in addition to the programmed  death ligand 1 expression level, the CONUT may also be a useful indicator for selecting NSCLC patients who may benefit from ICI treatment.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

In contrast, tumor cells highly express PD-L1, which binds to receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, leading to  escape. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1   therapy blocks the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to reinvigorate the exhausted T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Exosomes are biologically active lipid-bilayer nanovesicles secreted by various  types that mediate intercellular signal communication. Numerous studies have shown that tumor cells are able to promote tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and  escape by releasing exosomes. Recent studies imply that tumor-derived exosomes could carry PD-L1 in the same membrane topology as the  surface, thereby resisting   therapy. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of exosomes in the regulation of tumor progression and the potential resistance mechanism to immunotherapy via exosomal PD-L1. In addition, we propose that exosomal PD-L1 may have the potential to be a target to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671550>Immunotherapies and Future Combination Strategies for Head and Neck Squamous  Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a dismal prognosis. Nearly 10 years after the approval of cetuximab, anti-PD1/PD-L1  inhibitors are the first drugs that have shown any survival benefit for the treatment on platinum-refractory recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC. Furthermore,  inhibitors are better tolerated than chemotherapy. The state of the art in the treatment of R/M HNSCC is changing, thanks to improved results for  inhibitors. Results for these treatments are also awaited in curative settings and for locally advanced HNSCC. Unfortunately, the response rate of immunotherapy is low. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to anti-PD1/PD-L1 is a key point for better selecting patients that would benefit the most from immunotherapy. Furthermore, the combination of  inhibitors with various agents is being currently evaluated to improve the response rate, prolong response duration, and even increase the chances for a cure.

Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic  death (ICD) for T -mediated antitumor  response, their immunotherapy efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for mitochondria, a rationally engineered immunity amplifier via mitochondria-targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional  agent. The newly synthesized task-specific mitochondria-targeted IR780 derivative (T780) was integrated with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to form multifunctional nanoparticles via assembling strategy along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as biomimetic corona (BSA@T780/DOX NPs). The in situ enhancement in both phototherapy and MDR reversal by targeting mitochondria with BSA@T780/DOX NPs boosted high-efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor  response. The newly developed strategy not only eradicated the primary tumor, but also eliminated the bilateral tumors efficiently, as well as preventing metastasis and postsurgical recurrence, demonstrating great interest for fighting against low-immunogenic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660663>Mucous membrane pemphigoid and lichenoid reactions after   inhibitors: common pathomechanisms.</a></h2><p>  inhibitor (ICI) therapy has demonstrated impressive antitumor activity.

The remarkable efficacy of   blockade has been confirmed in various solid tumors. However, the correlation between PD-L1 expression and host immunological landscape remains of considerable controversy in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, PD-L1 expression and CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) infiltration levels were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor sections of 138 NSCLC patients. The expression level of PD-L1 was positively correlated with the abundance of CD8  TILs ( < 0.0001). Furthermore, no constitutive expression of PD-L1 was observed in the majority of six NSCLC  lines detected by Western blot; but exposure to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a primary cytokine secreted by activated CD8 T cells, prominently increased PD-L1 expression. Notably, a significantly positive association was determined within PD-L1, CD8 and IFN-γ gene expression by qRT-PCR, which was corroborated by RNA-sequencing from TCGA lung cancer dataset. These findings demonstrate that PD-L1 expression indicates an adaptive  resistance mechanism adopted by tumor cells in the aversion of immunogenic destruction by CD8 TILs. Both higher expression of PD-L1 and infiltration of CD8 TILs were correlated with superior prognosis ( = 0.044 for PD-L1;  = 0.002 for CD8). Moreover, Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that the combination of PD-L1 and CD8 were independent prognostic factors, which was more accurate in prediction of prognosis in NSCLC than individually. Finally, we found that IFN-γ induced the upregulation of PD-L1 in NSCLC cells, mainly through the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression is mainly induced by activated CD8 TILs via IFN-γ in the  milieu and indicates pre-existing adaptive  response in NSCLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650944>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for Cardiac Adverse Reactions Related to   Inhibitor].</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy of malignant tumors has become a hot spot in the field of cancer research and treatment, bringing new hope to patients with advanced cancer.

The improvement of prognostic tools and systemic therapy are urgently needed. Targeting the  system using  inhibitors such as PD1/PDL1 inhibitors is an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for poor-prognosis tumors. Multiple clinical trials are ongoing, including in advanced ACC. However, PDL1 expression has been studied in ACC in only one heterogeneous series of 28 clinical samples. Here, we have retrospectively analyzed  mRNA expression in 146 clinical ACC samples and searched for correlations between expression and biological and clinicopathological data, including post-operative disease-free survival (DFS).  mRNA expression was heterogeneous across samples. "PDL1-high" tumors were not associated with the classical prognostic variables but were associated with longer DFS in both uni- and multivariate analyses. High PDL1 mRNA expression was associated with biological signs of the cytotoxic local  response. Supervised analysis between "PDL1-high" and "PDL1-low" tumors identified a robust 370-gene signature whose ontology analysis suggested the existence in "PDL1-high" tumors of a cytotoxic T- response, however, associated with some degree of T- exhaustion. In conclusion,  mRNA expression refines the prognostication in ACC and high expression is associated with longer DFS. Clinical validation at the protein level and functional validation are required to fully understand the role of PDL1 in ACC.

However, even when pathologic disease-free margins can be achieved, locoregional and/or distant disease relapse remains high. Perioperative immunotherapy may improve outcomes, but mechanistic data supporting the use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment clinically is sparse.Two syngeneic models of oral cavity carcinoma with defined T  antigens were treated with PD-1 mAb before or after surgical resection of primary tumors, and antigen-specific T  responses were explored with functional and challenge assays.We demonstrated that functional immunodominance developed among T cells targeting multiple independent tumor antigens. T cells specific for subdominant antigens expressed greater levels of PD-1. Neoadjuvant, but not adjuvant, PD-1   blockade broke immunodominance and induced T  responses to dominant and subdominant antigens. Using tumors lacking the immunodominant antigen as a model of antigen escape, neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade induced effector T  immunity against tumor cells lacking immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen. When combined with complete surgical excision, neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade led to formation of immunologic memory capable of preventing engraftment of tumors lacking the immunodominant but retaining subdominant antigen.Together, these results implicate PD-1 expression by T cells in the mechanism of functional immunodominance among independent T  clones within a progressing tumor, and support the use of neoadjuvant PD-1   blockade in patients with surgically resectable carcinomas.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643657>Ipilimumab.</a></h2><p>Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 which acts as an   inhibitor increases  reactivity and is used to treat metastatic malignant melanoma.

While better peri-operative strategies, increased number of cytotoxic agents and availability of targeted therapies have improved survival, there remains an unmet need for novel treatment approaches.   inhibitors (ICIs) have marked a new era in cancer management with unprecedented results in several malignancies. Although OGC lagged behind other solid tumours, evidence has increasingly accumulated supporting the contention that modulation of the anti-cancer host  response may be beneficial for at least some patients. Many trials have been completed in Eastern and Western countries, some of these leading to the approval of ICIs in the refractory setting, and favorable opinion from regulatory agencies is expected also in treatment-naïve, advanced OGC. Furthermore, studies are evaluating ICIs in the early stage setting and exploring the potential of combination treatments.

The pathologist plays a key role in interpreting liver biopsies by classifying the pattern of injury, grading the severity of injury, and evaluating for other possible causes. Reports of iatrogenic liver injury are reviewed here with a focus on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) [i.e., intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD)] and   inhibitors (ICIs). The hallmark features of IFALD are cholestasis and steatosis. Cholestasis is more common in infants whereas steatosis and steatohepatitis are more commonly seen in older children and adults. Infants tend to have a faster progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Perivenular fibrosis and ductopenia may also be seen in IFALD. Although fish oil-based lipid emulsions can reverse cholestasis, recent studies have shown persistent or progressive fibrosis. ICI-induced liver injury usually presents as an acute hepatitis with features similar to those seen in idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. However, it lacks a prominent plasma  infiltrate and serological markers of autoimmune hepatitis.

RNA-Seq was performed to assess changes on a genome-wide level. A cytotoxic T  killing assay was performed in MC38-OVA cells treated with JQ1 to demonstrate increased immunogenicity. In vivo experiments in the Myc-Cap model were conducted to show the effects of JQ1 administration in concert with anti-CTLA-4  blockade.Here, we show that targeting BET bromodomains using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 decreased PD-L1 expression and mitigated tumor progression in prostate cancer models.

Transcriptional profiling showed that BET bromodomain inhibition regulates distinct networks of antigen processing and   molecules. In murine models, treatment with JQ1 was additive with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy, resulting in an increased CD8/Treg ratio.BET Bromodomain inhibition can mediate changes in expression at a genome wide level in prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased susceptibility to CD8 T  targeting.

In this study, we develop a multiplexed   biosensor (MICB) for parallel detection of soluble   PD-1, PD-L1, and LAG-3. MICB integrates a microfluidic sandwich immunoassay using engineered single chain variable fragments and alternating current electrohydrodynamic in situ nanofluidic mixing for promoting biosensor-target interaction and reducing non-specific non-target binding. MICB provides advantages of simultaneous analysis of up to 28 samples in <2 h, requires as little as a single sample drop (i.e., 20 μL) per target  , and applies high-affinity yeast -derived single chain variable fragments as a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies. We investigate the assay performance of MICB and demonstrate its capability for accurate   detection in simulated patient serum samples at clinically-relevant levels. MICB provides a dynamic range of 5 to 200 pg mL-1 for PD-1 and PD-L1, and 50 to 1000 pg mL-1 for LAG-3 with a coefficient of variation <13.8%. Sensitive   detection was achieved with limits of detection values of 5 pg mL-1 for PD-1, 5 pg mL-1 for PD-L1, and 50 pg mL-1 for LAG-3. The multiplexing capability, sensitivity, and relative assay simplicity of MICB make it capable of serving as a bioanalytical tool for   therapy monitoring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670092>Traf6 inhibitor boosts antitumor immunity by impeding regulatory T  migration in Hepa1-6 tumor model.</a></h2><p>Tumors escape  attacks via various mechanisms, among which activation of regulatory pathways in effector  cells and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells are usually employed. Traf6 is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and involved in many signaling pathways. While it plays important roles in both tumor biology and  system, the potential therapeutic role of Traf6 in tumor immunotherapy hasn't ever been assessed. Here, we confirmed the anti-tumor effect of Traf6 inhibitor in Hepa1-6 tumor model. Flow cytometry-based analysis revealed that T -mediated antitumor immunity was provoked and the infiltration of Treg cells was restrained when treated with Traf6 inhibitor. Via an in vivo migration assay, we found that Traf6 inhibitor decreased the population of intratumor Tregs by impeding the migration of Tregs towards tumor. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of Traf6 inhibitor and PD-1 blockade could receive a better antitumor efficiency. These results implicated that Traf6 inhibitor could serve as a supplement for   therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Links to defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system are well established in early onset colorectal, urothelial and gynaecological malignancies. MMR deficient patients treated with   inhibitors have demonstrated improved response rates. Studies exploring MMR status in head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) demonstrate conflicting results. This study explores the incidence of MMR protein loss and its association with clinicopathological features and outcome in oSCC. Immunohistochemical staining using tissue microarrays to assess the expression of MMR proteins (hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and hPMS2) was performed on 285 consecutive oSCC cases between 2000 and 2016. Data on smoking, alcohol and metachronous malignancies were retrospectively collected. Proportional hazards regression models were used to compare survival in MMR intact and deficient patients. MMR deficiency was seen in 21 patients (7.4%). MMR deficient tumours were associated with bone invasion (52% vs 32%, p=0.05), higher pT stage (pT4 in 57% vs 35%, p<0.001) and a higher number of metachronous malignancies (p=0.05). MMR deficiency was not associated with younger age at presentation or absence of smoking or alcohol. There was no significant association between MMR status and survival (overall survival hazard ratio 1.36; p=0.32). The incidence of MMR loss in oSCC is low and is not associated with young age at presentation. MMR deficiency in oSCC is associated with an increase in the number of metachronous malignancies and more advanced primary tumours.Copyright © 2019.

DC-based anticancer vaccination relies on patient-derived DCs pulsed with a source of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) in the context of standardized maturation-cocktails, followed by their reinfusion. Extensive evidence has confirmed that DC-based vaccines can generate TAA-specific, cytotoxic T cells. Nonetheless, clinical efficacy of DC-based vaccines remains suboptimal, reflecting the widespread immunosuppression within tumors.

Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM creates neoantigens that activate T- responses against B- lymphoma.To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy, we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens' immunogenicity potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of T -exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, microbiome, and pathogen databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry.SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHM) were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center B--like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHM groups harbored more potentially -stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1 expression in CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHM than in SHM patients with activated B--like DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4 T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV SHM than in SHM patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV SHM and ongoing SHM.These results show for the first time that IGV SHM and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627733>Immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma: the complex interface between inflammation, fibrosis, and the  response.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and confers a poor prognosis. Beyond standard systemic therapy with multikinase inhibitors, recent studies demonstrate the potential for robust and durable responses from   inhibition in subsets of HCC patients across disease etiologies. The majority of HCC arises in the context of chronic inflammation and from within a fibrotic liver, with many cases associated with hepatitis virus infections, toxins, and fatty liver disease. Many patients also have concomitant cirrhosis which is associated with both local and systemic  deficiency. Furthermore, the liver is an immunologic organ in itself, which may enhance or suppress the  response to cancer arising within it.

In advanced kidney cancer,  inhibitors have shown improved outcomes in first- and second-line settings compared with standard of care, but the role of patient gender on treatment outcome is unclear. We aimed to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy according to patient gender in advanced kidney cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library to identify eligible studies published through February 16, 2019. Studies were included if they reported on the differential outcomes of male and female patients with metastatic kidney cancer receiving immunotherapy. Our outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). Four randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 3664 patients (2715 males and 949 females) met our inclusion criteria. Both men and women with metastatic kidney cancer had an OS and PFS advantage with immunotherapy compared with standard-of-care, but no statistically significant difference between the genders was observed (OS hazard ratio [HR] for men, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.8; P = .40; HR for women, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81; P = .13; PFS HR for men, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82; P = .24; HR for women, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.90; P = .105).

The overall incidence of renal  carcinoma appears to be increasing but death rates have been declining. Patients with poor risk, advanced disease have a two-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Prior to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, and  inhibitors, IFN-α and high-dose IL-2, were standard of care treatment options but, conversely, their use is now limited to select patients. Immunotherapies have played a significant role in the treatment of various cancers and have continued to expand. It is of utmost importance that practitioners include  inhibitors as treatment options for renal  carcinoma as they mark a new era in the treatment of advanced or relapsed setting. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, ipilimumab, and atezolizumab all play a role in management of disease as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Ongoing clinical trials are ongoing to further assess the benefits of inducing cellular immunity in the treatment of renal  carcinoma. In this article, the available data on   inhibitors for the treatment of advanced or relapsed renal  carcinoma and their place in therapy are reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669264>Extracellular pH Modulating Injectable Gel for Enhancing   Inhibitor Therapy.</a></h2><p>Clinical data from diverse cancer types shows that the increased T  infiltration in tumors correlates with improved patient prognosis. Acidic extracellular pH is a major attribute of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes  evasion and tumor progression. Therefore, antagonizing tumor acidity can be a powerful approach in cancer immunotherapy. Here, Pluronic F-127 is used as a NaHCO releasing carrier to focally alleviate extracellular tumor acidity. In a mouse tumor model, intratumoral treatment with pH modulating injectable gel (pH-MIG) generates -favorable TME, as evidenced by the decrease of -suppressive cells and increase of tumor infiltrating CD8 + T cells. The combination of pH-MIG with   inhibitors, anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies, increases intratumoral T  function, which leads to tumor clearance. Mechanistically, extracellular acidity was shown to upregulate co-inhibitory   receptors and inhibit mTOR signaling pathways in memory CD8 + T cells, which impaired effector functions. Furthermore, an acidic pH environment increased the expression and engagement of TIGIT and its ligand CD155, which suggested that the extracellular pH can regulate the suppressive function of TIGIT pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that pH-MIG holds potential as a new TME modulator for effective   inhibitor therapies.Copyright © 2019.

This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the   PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With the aim of simultaneously improving both PDT-mediated intracellular ROS production and ICD levels, we designed a serum albumin (SA)-coated boehmite ("B"; aluminum hydroxide oxide) organic-inorganic scaffold that could be loaded with chlorin e6 (Ce6), a photosensitizer, and a honey bee venom melittin (MLT) peptide, denoted Ce6/MLT@SAB. Ce6/MLT@SAB was anchored by a boehmite nanorod structure and exhibited particle size of approximately 180 nm. Ce6/MLT@SAB could significantly reduce hemolysis relative to that of free MLT, while providing MLT-enhanced PDT antitumor effects . Compared with Ce6@SAB, Ce6/MLT@SAB improved Ce6 penetration of cancer cells both  and , thereby providing enhanced intracellular ROS generation with 660 nm light treatment. Following phototreatment, Ce6/MLT@SAB-treated cells displayed significantly improved levels of ICD and abilities to activate dendritic cells. In the absence of laser irradiation, multidose injection of Ce6/MLT@SAB could delay the growth of subcutaneous murine tumors by more than 60%, compared to controls. When combined with laser irradiation, a single injection and phototreatment with Ce6/MLT@SAB eradicated one-third of subcutaneous tumors in treated mice. The addition of an   blockade to Ce6/MLT@SAB phototreatment further augmented antitumor effects, generating increased numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in tumors with concomitant reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639056>Comprehensive  profiling and -monitoring using body fluid of patients with metastatic gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study is to profile the cytokines and  cells of body fluid from metastatic gastric cancer (mGC), and evaluate the potential role as a prognostic factor and the feasibility as a predictive biomarker or monitoring source for   inhibitor.Body fluid including ascites and pleural fluid were obtained from 55 mGC patients and 24 matched blood. VEGF-A, IL-10, and TGF-β1 were measured and  cells were profiled by fluorescence assisted  sorting (FACS).VEGF-A and IL-10 were significantly higher in body fluid than in plasma of mGC. Proportion of T lymphocytes with CD69 or PD-1, memory T  marked with CD45RO, and number of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) were significantly higher in body fluid than those in blood of mGC. Proportion of CD8 T lymphocyte with memory marker (CD45RO) and activation marker (HLA-DR), CD3 T lymphocyte with PD-1, and number of FoxP3+ Tregs were identified as independent prognostic factors. When patients were classified by molecular subgroups of primary tumor, VEGF-A was significantly higher in genomically stable (GS)-like group than that in chromosomal instability (CIN)-like group while PD-L1 positive tumor cells (%) showed opposite results. Monitoring  dynamics using body fluid was also feasible. Early activated T  marked with CD25 was significantly increased in chemotherapy treated group.By analyzing cytokines and proportion of  cells in body fluid, prognosis of patients with mGC can be predicted.  monitoring using body fluid may provide more effective treatment for patients with mGC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634214>Rapid evolution of acute kidney injury after initial infusion of pembrolizumab in a melanoma patient concurrently treated with RAF/MEK inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The use of either   blockade or RAF/MEK inhibitors represents standard of care treatment options for metastatic melanoma.

There are still no effective targeted therapies in SCLC despite improved understanding of the molecular steps leading to SCLC development and progression these last years. After four decades, the only modest improvement in OS of patients suffering from ES-SCLC has recently been shown in a trial combining atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1   inhibitor, with carboplatin and etoposide, chemotherapy agents. This highlights the need to pursue research efforts in this field. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed and activated in several cancers, including SCLC, and contributing to cancer progression and metastasis through its important role in  proliferation, survival, adhesion, spreading, migration, and invasion. FAK also plays a role in tumor  evasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA damage repair, radioresistance, and regulation of cancer stem cells. FAK is of particular interest in SCLC, being known for its aggressiveness. The inhibition of FAK in SCLC  lines demonstrated significative decrease in  proliferation, invasion, and migration, and induced   arrest and apoptosis.

In this study, we sought to understand the gene-expression signature of patients with primary prostate tumors by investigating the co-expression profiles of patient samples and their corresponding clinical outcomes, in particular "disease-free months" and "disease reoccurrence". We tested the hypothesis that the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis is co-expressed with factors supporting TIME and PCa progression. Gene expression counts, with clinical attributes from PCa patients, were acquired from TCGA. Profiles of PCa patients were used to identify key drivers that influence or regulate CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to identify co-expression patterns among CXCL13-CXCR5, associated genes, and key genetic drivers within the CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling pathway. The processing of downloaded data files began with quality checks using NOISeq, followed by WGCNA. Our results confirmed the quality of the TCGA transcriptome data, identified 12 co-expression networks, and demonstrated that CXCL13, CXCR5 and associated genes are members of signaling networks (modules) associated with G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) responsiveness, invasion/migration,  , and innate immunity.

Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for  escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for   inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or  cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to   blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of   inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small  lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with   inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, 5, and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating  cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627442>Verification of 5-Aminolevurinic Radiodynamic Therapy Using a Murine Melanoma Brain Metastasis Model.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer with a propensity for brain metastases. These can be treated by radiotherapy, but the radiation-resistant nature of melanoma makes the prognosis for melanoma patients with brain metastases poor. Previously, we demonstrated that treatment of mice with subcutaneous melanoma with 5-aminolevurinic acid (5-ALA) and X-rays in combination, ("radiodynamic therapy (RDT)"), instead of with 5-ALA and laser beams ("photodynamic therapy"), improved tumor suppression in vivo. Here, using the B16-Luc melanoma brain metastasis model, we demonstrate that 5-ALA RDT effectively treats brain metastasis. We also studied how 5-ALA RDT damages cells in vitro using a B16 melanoma culture.  culture preincubated with 5-ALA alone increased intracellular photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. On X-ray irradiation, the cells enhanced their ∙OH radical generation, which subsequently induced γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks in their nuclei, but decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. After two days, the   was arrested. When 5-ALA RDT was applied to the brain melanoma metastasis model in vivo, suppression of tumor growth was indicated. Therapeutic efficacy in melanoma treatment has recently been improved by molecular targeted drugs and   inhibitors.

So far, little is known about the clinical significance of B7-H3 expression in meningiomas. Thus, we conducted the present study to address this issue in a cohort of 242 patients from a single institution.Expression profiles of   proteins (PD-L1, B7-H3, LAG3, PD-1 and VISTA) were explored by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a meningioma test-cohort (n = 8). The roles of B7-H3 expression was further assessed in an expanded patient cohort (n = 234) using immunohistochemical tissue microarray analysis.B7-H3 expression was significantly greater than all   proteins studied in tested cohort. B7-H3 was detected with different degrees in all meningioma specimens, predominantly on tumor  membranes and in cytoplasm. The tumors were classified as B7-H3 high or low group pending on IHC histoscore (median histoscore = 111.06; range, 7.313-212.008). B7-H3 expression was statistically correlated with patient gender (p = .0297), tumor histopathological subtypes (p = .0262) and radiotherapy after surgery (p = .0028). However, no significant differences were observed in patient age, tumor location, grade and extent of resection between these two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients of B7-H3 high or low group.Our study indicates variable expression and clinical role of B7-H3 in meningiomas, suggesting its potential as an immunotherapeutic target in the future.Copyright © 2019.

Immunotherapies such as those that target   molecules can be used to augment -mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8 T cells in tumour rejection is well established, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4 T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634167>Global PD-L1 Signals and Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes: Markers of Immunogenicity in Different Subsets of Merkel  Carcinoma and Potential Therapeutic Implications.</a></h2><p>We previously studied the genetic and immunohistochemical profiles of subsets of Merkel  carcinoma (MCC) stratified by morphology and Merkel  polyomavirus (MCPyV) status.

The observed clinical responses to  inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have not correlated with PD-L1 expression by MCC cells, and recent evidence suggests that functions of this pathway within the  tumor microenvironment may be relevant. We conducted a semiquantitative (high, moderate, and minimal) immunohistochemical evaluation of the global PD-L1 signal in 52 cases of MCC, segregated in 3 subsets [pure MCPyV-positive (n = 28), pure MCPyV-negative (n = 9), and combined MCPyV-negative (n = 15)]. TILS were categorized as brisk, nonbrisk, or absent. Intersubset comparisons revealed that high global PD-L1 signals were exclusively associated with pure MCPyV-positive MCCs contrasted with virus-negative cases (P = 0.0003). Moderate signals were seen across all 3 groups. Brisk TILS were significantly associated with MCPyV-positive MCCs compared with MCPyV-negative cases (P = 0.029). Neither parameter (PD-L1 or TILS) was significantly different between the MCPyV-negative groups. Of potential clinical relevance, MCPyV seems to convey greater immunogenicity to MCCs than the high mutational burden/greater neoantigen load of MCPyV-negative cases. Interesting too is the fact that subset-related profiles of these markers mirrored those noted at genetic and immunohistochemical levels, separating pure MCPyV-positive MCCs from the virus-negative subsets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p>Inflammation substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including  suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among   modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous  carcinoma (OSCC)  evasion from  surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and  suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646095>Blockade of ErbB2 and PD-L1 using a bispecific antibody to improve targeted anti-ErbB2 therapy.</a></h2><p>A significant proportion of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/ErbB2)-positive metastatic breast cancer patients are refractory to Her2-targeted trastuzumab-like therapy. Some of this resistance has been attributed to the upregulation of   such as programmed  death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1 in Her2-positive breast cancer patients. Therefore, therapies targeting both the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and oncogenic Her2 signaling are of significant clinical interest. Here, we constructed a mouse bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1 and rat Her2 (referred to as BsPD-L1xrErbB2) aiming to redirect the anti-PD-L1 response toward Her2-expressing tumor cells. BsPD-L1xrErbB2 demonstrated additive binding to interferon (IFN)-γ treated Her2 TUBO tumor cells, but it did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells . BsPD-L1xrErbB2 also blocked the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This bispecific antibody was constructed with a mouse IgG2a Fc backbone and interacted with Fcγ receptors and resulted in complement deposition (C3). ADCC and complement action could be potential mechanisms of action of this molecule. BsPD-L1xrErbB2 successfully reduced TUBO tumor growth and increased tumor rejection rate compared to the monovalent anti-PD-L1, monovalent anti-ErbB2 or the combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-ErbB2 monotherapies. The enhanced anti-tumor effect of BsPD-L1xrErbB2 was dependent on CD8 T lymphocytes and IFN-γ, as depletion of CD8 T lymphocytes and neutralization of IFN-γ completely abolished the antitumor activity of the bispecific antibody. Consistently, BsPD-L1xrErbB2 treatment also increased the frequency of intratumor CD8 T lymphocytes. Taken together, our data support a bispecific antibody approach to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1  blockade in Her2-positive metastatic breast cancers.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627906>[Myocarditis: Uncommon but severe toxicity of   inhibitors].</a></h2><p>Traditional cancer therapies, such as treatment with anthracyclines and chest radiation, are known to induce cardiovascular complications. Currently, the increase of cancer therapies will involve new mechanisms such as cancer immunotherapies, also called   inhibitors (PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors). These treatments have shown long-term remissions in subgroup of cancers, including melanomas, non-small- lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, renal  carcinoma, squamous  carcinoma of the head and neck and colorectal cancer. Although these treatments will change the natural course of these cancers, they may sometimes induce cardiovascular complications, which has been reported as about 1 % in the literature. Currently, the physicians must keep in mind one uncommon but severe cardiac complication: auto- myocarditis. The clinical presentation may include various symptoms like chest pain, heart failure or rhythm disorders. In this situation, a baseline cardiologic check-up before starting cancer immunotherapy may be very helpful. Cardiac biomarkers (troponin and brain natriuretic peptide) and 12-lead resting electrocardiogram must be promptly performed when myocarditis is suspected. A cardiologist's opinion must be requested in emergency to discuss both a transthoracic echocardiography and the appropriate treatment (stopping immunotherapy, adding immunosuppressive treatment such as corticoids) and the monitoring in an intensive care unit. Cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsies may help to approach the final diagnosis. In this situation, other cancer therapies may be discussed.Copyright © 2019 Société Française du Cancer.

Upregulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells contributes to malignancy through suppression of the T -mediated antitumor response. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a glycolytic gate-keeping enzyme, is also known to promote tumor development. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism of regulation of PD-L1 by PDK1 through activation of c-Jun-NH-kinase (JNK)-c-Jun in ovarian cancer cells. Elevated PDK1 expression was correlated with that of PD-L1 in the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and ovarian cancer tissue array. Overexpression of PDK1 in ovarian cancer cells impaired CD8 T  function by suppressing IFN-γ secretion through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Conversely, knockdown of PDK1 in ovarian cancer cells relieved suppression of CD8 T  function. CD8 T  apoptosis induced by binding of PD-1 with PD-L1 was increased after co-culture with ovarian cancer cells overexpressing PDK1, while depletion of PDK1 exerted the opposite effect.  experiments revealed synergistic improved overall survival and enhanced inhibition of tumor growth upon co-treatment with dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK inhibitor, and PD-L1 antibody, accompanied by increased IFN-γ secretion by monocytes infiltrating tumor islets. Moreover, PDK1 expression and CD8 T  infiltration were inversely correlated in the ovarian cancer tissue array. Our collective findings provide a novel explanation of how PDK1 contributes to upregulation of PD-L1 in ovarian cancer and highlight its potential as a target therapeutic molecule that cooperates with the   blockade.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640814>Discovery of low-molecular weight anti-PD-L1 peptides for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy using  inhibitors, especially PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, has now evolved into the most promising therapy for cancer patients. However, most of these inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies, and their large size may limit their tumor penetration, leading to suboptimal efficacy. As a result, there has been a growing interest in developing low-molecular-weight  inhibitors.We developed a novel biopanning strategy to discover small peptide-based anti-PD-L1 inhibitors. The affinity and specificity of the peptides to PD-L1 were examined using various assays. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroid penetration study was performed to determine the tumor penetration capability of the peptides. Anti-tumor activity of the peptides was evaluated in mice bearing CT26 tumor cells.We discover several anti-PD-L1 peptide inhibitors to block PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. The peptides exhibit high affinity and specificity to human PD-L1 protein as well as PD-L1-overexpressing human cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and DU-145. Molecular docking studies indicate that the peptide CLP002 specifically binds to PD-L1 at the residues where PD-L1 interacts with PD-1. The peptide also blocks the CD80/PD-L1 interaction, which may further enhance the  response of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Compared to antibody, the peptide CLP002 exhibits better tumor penetration in a 3D tumor spheroid model. The peptide CLP002 restores proliferation and prevents apoptosis of T cells that are co-cultured with cancer cells. The peptide CLP002 also inhibits tumor growth and increases survival of CT26 tumor-bearing mice.This study demonstrated the feasibility of using phage display to discover small peptide-based  inhibitors. Our results also suggested that the anti-PD-L1 peptide represents a promising low-molecular-weight  inhibitor for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646069>Caloric restriction promotes the stemness and antitumor activity of T lymphocytes.</a></h2><p>Recent findings have shed new light on the mechanisms through which tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) maintain their cytotoxic potential in the context of  blockade or adoptive transfer therapies. As a consequence of the ionic unbalance occurring in the tumor microenvironment, TILs enter an adaptive caloric-restricted state, characterized by a decline in nucleocytosolic acetyl CoA levels and induction of autophagy. These events dictate an epigenetic program that drives the acquisition of a stem--like phenotype and ultimately improves antitumor function.

Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T  immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of  inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino acid stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T  responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T  responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and  blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors.© 2019 The Author(s).

Inducible T- co-stimulator ligand (ICOSLG) is a member of the B7 family of  regulatory ligands, expression of which in cancer is implicated in disease progression due to regulation of anti-tumor adaptive immunity. Although aberrant ICOSLG expression has been reported in glioma cells, the underlying mechanisms that promote glioblastoma (GBM) progression remain elusive.Here, we investigated a causal role for ICOSLG in GBM progression by analyzing ICOSLG expression in both human glioma tissues and patient-derived GBM sphere cells (GSCs). We further examined its  modulatory effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms.Bioinformatics analysis and GBM tissue microarray showed that upregulation of ICOSLG expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with GBM. ICOSLG expression was upregulated preferentially in mesenchymal GSCs but not in proneural GSCs in a tumor necrosis factor-α-/NF-ĸB-dependent manner. Furthermore, ICOSLG expression by mesenchymal GSCs promoted expansion of T cells that produced interleukin-10. Knockdown of the gene encoding ICOSLG markedly reduced GBM tumor growth in  competent mice, with a concomitant downregulation of interleukin-10 levels in the tumor microenvironment.Inhibition of the ICOSLG-ICOS axis in GBM may provide a promising immunotherapeutic approach for suppressing a subset of GBM with an elevated mesenchymal signature.© The Author(s) 2019.

IFNa2b affects many  intrinsic features of tumor cells and modulates the host innate and cognate  responses. To better understand the biological traits associated with ulceration that could explain the efficacy of prophylactic type 1 IFN, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of various molecules (major histocompatibility complex class I and class II, MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1 (MX1), inducible Nitric-Oxide Synthase (iNOS) or CD47) in two retrospective cohorts of melanoma patients, one diagnosed with a primary cutaneous melanoma (1995-2013, N = 172, among whom 49% were ulcerated melanoma (UM)) and a second one diagnosed with metastatic melanoma amenable to lymph node resection (EORTC 18952 and 18991 trials, N = 98, among whom 44% were UM). We found that primary and metastatic UM exhibit higher basal expression of MHC class I molecules, independently of Breslow thickness, histology and lymphocytic infiltration compared with NUM and that primary UM harbored higher constitutive levels of the antiviral protein Mx1 at the border of tumor beds than NUM. These findings suggest that UM expand in a tumor microenvironment where chronic exposure to type 1 IFN could favor a response to exogenous IFNs.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642347>Role of   inhibitors in the treatment of colorectal cancer: focus on nivolumab.</a></h2><p>: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a challenging disease, whose systemic therapy has traditionally been based on a generalized population of patients, with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes.

A greater understanding of these processes may see the development of therapeutic interventions that enhance T  recruitment and, consequently, improved patient outcomes. We therefore investigated the chemokines essential for   recruitment and subsequent therapeutic efficacy of these immunotherapies.The chemokines upregulated by dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade were assessed using nanosting-based analysis with results confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry and cytometric bead array. Blocking/neutralizing antibodies confirmed the requirement for key chemokines/cytokines and  effector cells. Results were confirmed in patients treated with   inhibitors using single- RNAseq and paired survival analyses.The CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were significantly upregulated following dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade and both CD8 T  infiltration and therapeutic efficacy were CXCR3 dependent. In both murine models and patients undergoing immunotherapy, macrophages were the predominant source of CXCL9 and their depletion abrogated CD8 T  infiltration and the therapeutic efficacy of dual   blockade. Single  RNA-seq analysis of patient TILs revealed that CXCL9/10/11 was predominantly expressed by macrophages following ICB and we identified a distinct macrophage signature that was associated with positive responses to   blockade.These data underline the fundamental importance of macrophage-derived CXCR3 ligands for the therapeutic efficacy of ICB and highlight the potential of manipulating this axis to enhance patient responses.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665365>  Profiles in Luminal B Breast Cancer (Alliance).</a></h2><p>Unlike estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer, ER-positive breast cancer outcome is less influenced by lymphocyte content indicating the presence of  tolerance mechanisms that may be specific to this disease subset.A supervised analysis of microarray data from the Alliance/ACOSOG Z1031 neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) trial identified upregulated genes in Luminal B breast cancers that correlated with AI-resistant tumor proliferation (Pearson's correlation r ≥ 0.4 with Ki67) (33 cases Ki67 >10% on AI) versus Luminal-B breast cancers that were more AI-sensitive (33 cases Ki67 <10% on AI).

The mechanism of T  dysfunction in TB is still not clear. In this study we set up a mouse model of T  dysfunction by persistent  antigen stimulation and investigated the therapeutic role of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in it. C57BL/6 mice were primed with  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and boosted repeatedly with a combination of  fusion proteins Mtb10.4-HspX (MH) plus ESAT6-Ag85B-MPT64 -Mtb8.4-Rv2626c (LT70) or MH plus ESAT6 and CFP10 with adjuvant of N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C). Following persistent antigen stimulation, the mice were treated with IL-2 and the therapeutic effects were analyzed. The results showed that compared with the mice that received transient antigen stimulation (boost twice), persistent antigen stimulation (boost more than 10 times) resulted in decrease of antigen specific IFN-γ and IL-2 production, reduction of memory CD8 T cells, over-expression of   programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), and impaired the protective immunity against bacterial challenge. Treating the T  functionally exhausted mice with IL-2 restored antigen-specific T  responses and protective efficacy. In conclusion, persistent stimulation with  antigens induced T  dysfunction, which could be restored by complement of IL-2.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Li, Niu, Ma, Chen, Zhang, Peng, Gan, Ma and Zhu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656801>- inhibitors in brain metastases from renal  carcinoma: a battle was lost but not the war.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669415>The MHC II-CD4 Immunologic Synapse in Alcoholic Hepatitis and Autoimmune Liver Pathology: The Role of Aberrant MHC II in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) - CD4 immunologic synapse is classically described between the T  receptor of CD4 positive lymphocytes and MHC II on antigen presenting cells. This interaction and others between surrounding costimulatory and  molecules promotes differentiation of naïve CD4 T lymphocytes into helper T cells subtypes including Th1, Th2, and Th17 that have more tailored immunologic responses. Although MHC II is mainly produced by professional antigen presenting cells, it can be aberrantly produced by other  types, including hepatocytes in various liver pathologies such as autoimmune hepatitis and alcoholic hepatitis. This can lead to direct targeting of hepatocytes by CD4 positive lymphocytes, which form an immunologic synapse with the hepatocyte. The lymphocytes internalize the MHC II - CD4 complexes in a phagocytosis-like mechanism and in the process eat the hepatocyte piece by piece. We review the evidence for this mechanism and the role of these autoimmune responses in various liver diseases, including alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. The role of aberrant MHC II in malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is also reviewed. Further understanding of this mechanism can lead to better understanding of the  mechanisms involved in these liver pathologies, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications.Copyright © 2019.

Eligibility criteria included histologically or citologically confirmed NSCLC, stage IIIB and IV, evaluable disease, sufficient organ function and at least one prior line of chemotherapy. The endpoints included Overall Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). Safety analysis was performed with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, and -related Adverse Events (irAEs) were treated according to protocol treatment guidelines. Tumour response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Data was analysed using SPSS, version 21.0 (IBM Statistics).From June 2015 to December 2016, a total of 229 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled at 30 Portuguese centres. Clinical data were collected up to the end of July 2018. The baseline median age was 64 years (range 37-83) and the majority of patients were males (70.3%) and former/current smokers (69.4%). Patients with non-squamous histology predominated (88.1%), and 67.6% of the patients had received 2 or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Out of 229 patients, data was available for 219 patients (3 patients did not start treatment, while data was unavailable in 7 patients); of the 219 patients, 15.5% were not evaluated for radiological tumour assessment, 1.4% had complete response (CR), 21% partial response (PR), 31% stable disease (SD) and 31.1% progressive disease (PD). Thus, the ORR was 22.4% and DCR was 53.4% in this population. At the time of survival analysis the median PFS was 4.91 months (95% CI, 3.89-6.11) and median OS was 13.21 months (95% CI, 9.89-16.53). The safety profile was in line with clinical trial data.Efficacy and safety results observed in this retrospective analysis were consistent with observations reported in clinical trials and from other centres.Copyright © 2019 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

The authors report the case of a 62-year-old white male individual with metastatic choroidal melanoma who had commenced adjuvant systemic treatment with combination  inhibitor therapy of intravenous ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) and nivolumab (anti-programmed  death-1) at 3-week  intervals. On day 4 after the second , he developed an acute widespread rash. On examination there was confluent erythema with bullae and epidermal loss over 60% of the body surface area, with severe oral mucosal ulceration. A clinical diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was made and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated systemically and died from multiorgan failure. This is the first reported case of TEN associated with nivolumab and ipilimumab dual therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma. Monotherapy improves survival in metastatic melanoma, but dual therapy has shown a greater mortality benefit at 3 years. Although the literature demonstrates case reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and TEN in association with nivolumab, ipilimumab has generally been regarded as a "safe" treatment with regard to severe cutaneous adverse reactions. With the increased use of immunotherapies, it is important to plan the management and early recognition of drug-related skin toxicity. This is of greatest concern during treatment initiation and with the higher risk associated with combination therapy. Reporting of adverse events and infrequently encountered complications with systemic biologic treatments will augment pharmacovigilance and improve the stratification of patients to treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of   Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small  Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h2><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of   inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with immunotherapy were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

In this study, we aim to pinpoint the metabolic pathway altered and assess its therapeutic potential.In silico reproduction of TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and functional annotation using GSEA was performed. Candidate metabolic pathway was validated using in vitro and in vivo assays.From TCGA database, we found that polyamine metabolism was significantly enriched in Cyclin E1-driven OvCa. Expressions of SMS, SRM, and ODC1 were positively correlated with that of CCNE1, respectively. ODC1 and SMS expressions were significantly correlated with decreased  infiltrates. PGC-1α silencing significantly decreased invasion and migration in both OvCa  lines. Both spermidine and spermine levels were significantly increased when PGC-1α was silenced. Targeting SRM significantly decreased spermine level in OVCAR3 cells, which was rescued when PGC-1α was silenced. Silencing of PGC-1α resulted in increased SRM in both OvCa cells. Dinaciclib significantly decreased invasion and migration of OVCAR3 cells. Expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were predominantly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Dinaciclib showed no notable effect of PD-1 yet substantially induced the increased levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2.Cyclin E1-driven OvCa is characterized with activated polyamine synthesis, which is associated with decreased cancer immunity.

Tissue microarrays were immunostained for PD-L1 using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Expression of PD-L1 in ⩾5% tumor cells was considered positive. PD-1 expression in  cells was also assessed. All cases were reviewed twice based on antibody expression and compared with a positive control. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).A total of 738 cases with complete follow up met criteria. Median age was 57 [interquartile range (IQR): 49-64] years, and median follow up was 34 (IQR: 15-62.9) months. Median tumor size was 5 cm (IQR: 3.0-7.5 cm). Approximately 8.2% and 7.6% of tumors were PD-L1 and programmed -death 1 (PD-1) positive, respectively. PD-L1 and PD-1 positivity were significantly associated with higher tumor stage (both  < 0.001), and presence of tumor necrosis and lymphovascular multivariable analyses; PD-L1 positivity was found as a predictor of worse RFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.08,  = 0.05] and OS (HR = 2.61,  = 0.02).PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with worse outcomes for patients with localized RCC at intermediate follow up. This marker may help stratify patients for stricter surveillance after surgical treatment and provide a basis for -inhibitor therapy in the adjuvant setting.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639551>  protein and cytokine expression by T lymphocytes in pleural effusion of cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy.</a></h2><p>Pleural effusion (PE) occasionally develops in cancer patients during treatment with antibodies to programmed  death-1 (PD-1) or to its ligand PD-L1 (hereafter, αPD-1 therapy). Such effusion often contains infiltrated mononuclear cells, although the types of   present as well as the outcome of such patients have remained unclear.We performed a multi-institutional, observational study to examine the clinical outcome of patients who develop PE after the onset of αPD-1 therapy. We compared the   profiles and the  status of lymphocytes in PE as determined by flow cytometry between nine patients who developed effusion during αPD-1 therapy (αPD-1 group) and 15 patients who developed PE during treatment with other anticancer agents (control group).Most mononuclear cells in PE were lymphocytes in both the αPD-1 and control groups. The frequency of both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes expressing the   proteins TIM-3 or TIGIT as well as that of CD8 T lymphocytes expressing PD-L1 were increased in the αPD-1 group compared with the control group. αPD-1 therapy continued for a substantial period after the emergence of PE in six of the nine patients in the αPD-1 group, and the frequency of CD4 T lymphocytes in PE expressing the   protein LAG-3 or the cytokine interkeukin-17 was lower for these patients than for those who did not receive a sustained treatment benefit.Our results suggest a clinical benefit of continuing αPD-1 therapy in some patients who develop PE. We found that infiltrating T lymphocytes in PE manifest a more exhausted phenotype during αPD-1 therapy than during treatment with other cancer drugs, with subpopulations of these cells characterized by specific   protein and cytokine expression profiles possibly contributing to the antitumor  response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Distinct from both responses, we experienced a case of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) with a pseudo-relapse, in which development of granulation mimicked cancer relapse during nivolumab therapy. A male with advanced NSCLC started nivolumab as a second-line therapy. After 15 cycles of nivolumab with a complete response, tumor markers started increasing and positron-emission computed tomography indicated a hot spot in the sigmoid colon. Laparoscopic segmental sigmoid colon resection revealed granulation tissue without any relapse of malignant cells.

Various types of cancers express high levels of PD-L1 and exploit PD-L1/PD-1 signaling to evade T  immunity. Blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has consistently shown remarkable anti-tumor effects in patients with advanced cancers and is recognized as the gold standard for developing new   blockade (ICB) and combination therapies. However, the response rates of anti-PD-L1 have been limited in several solid tumors. Therefore, furthering our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 can bring substantial benefits to patients with cancer by improving the efficacy of current PD-L1/PD-1 blockade or other ICBs. In this review, we provide current knowledge of PD-L1 regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, post-translational, and extracellular levels, and discuss the implications of these findings in cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate and rapid identification of neoantigens play a pivotal role in cancer immunotherapy. Although several in silico tools for neoantigen prediction have been presented, limitations of these tools exist.We developed pTuneos, a computational pipeline for prioritizing tumor neoantigens from next-generation sequencing data. We tested the performance of pTuneos on the melanoma cancer vaccine cohort data and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-recognized neopeptide data. pTuneos is able to predict the MHC presentation and T  recognition ability of the candidate neoantigens, and the actual immunogenicity of single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based neopeptides considering their natural processing and presentation, surpassing the existing tools with a comprehensive and quantitative benchmark of their neoantigen prioritization performance and running time. pTuneos was further tested on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort data as well as the melanoma and non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort data undergoing  blockade immunotherapy. The overall neoantigen immunogenicity score proposed by pTuneos is demonstrated to be a powerful and pan-cancer marker for survival prediction compared to traditional well-established biomarkers.In summary, pTuneos provides the state-of-the-art one-stop and user-friendly solution for prioritizing SNV-based candidate neoepitopes, which could help to advance research on next-generation cancer immunotherapies and personalized cancer vaccines. pTuneos is available at https://github.com/bm2-lab/pTuneos , with a Docker version for quick deployment at https://cloud.docker.com/u/bm2lab/repository/docker/bm2lab/ptuneos .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666468>Neuropsychiatric -related Adverse Events Induced by Pembrolizumab in a Patient with Lung Adenocarcinoma and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.</a></h2><p>The patient was a 73-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who was treated with pembrolizumab.

To screen for an affibody targeting the   PD-L1, a combinatorial affibody library was generated in yeast using degenerate overlap PCR primers and In-fusion technology. Z-j1 and Z-j2 affibodies targeting the Ig-like V domain of PD-L1 were screened and identified from this combinatorial library using the yeast two hybrid system. The Z-j1 and Z-j2 recombinant affibody proteins were over produced in E.coli and purified.

Baseline serum creatinine, averaged 6 months before  inhibitor start date, was compared with all subsequent creatinine values within 12 months of starting therapy. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria for fold changes in creatinine from baseline. Sustained AKI events lasted at least 3 days and was our primary outcome. The cause of sustained AKI was determined by chart review. Cumulative incidence and subdistribution hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline demographics, comorbidities, and medications, and sustained AKI and potential  inhibitor-related AKI.We included 1016 patients in the analysis. Average age was 63 (SD 13) years, 61% were men, and 91% were white. Mean baseline creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl (SD 0.4 mg/dl), and 169 (17%) had CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m) at baseline. A total of 169 patients (17%) experienced AKI, defined by an increase in creatinine at least 1.5 times the baseline within 12 months; 82 patients (8%) experienced sustained AKI and 30 patients (3%) had potential  inhibitor-related AKI. The first episode of sustained AKI occurred, on average, 106 days (SD 85) after  inhibitor initiation. Sixteen (2%) patients experienced stage 3 sustained AKI and four patients required dialysis. Proton pump inhibitor use at baseline was associated with sustained AKI.AKI is common in patients receiving  inhibitor therapy.

Blocking the interaction of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/ L2 is able to active T--mediated antitumor response. Monoclonal antibody-based drugs targeting PD-1 pathway have exhibited great promise in cancer therapy. Here we show that MW11-h317, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, displays high affinity for PD-1 and blocks PD-1 interactions with PD-L1/L2. MW11-h317 can effectively induce T--mediated  response and inhibit tumor growth in mouse model. Crystal structure of PD-1/MW11-h317 Fab complex reveals that both the loops and glycosylation of PD-1 are involved in recognition and binding, in which Asn58 glycosylation plays a critical role. The unique glycan epitope in PD-1 to MW11-h317 is different from the first two approved clinical PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

Among them, pericardial effusion and tamponade deserve attention as they may present with unusual symptomatology.We report three cases of pericardial effusion under nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. Two cases of early and late-onset pericardial effusion were symptomatic with tamponade and one case occurred without any symptoms. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial biopsy was performed in symptomatic pericardial effusion followed by the administration of a corticotherapy. Pericardial biopsies showed infiltration of T-lymphocytes, mostly CD4. Nivolumab was stopped in two cases and resumed for one patient.

Neo-antigens are defined as a subset of tumor-specific antigens generated by non-synonymous mutations, Indel gene mutation or gene fusions, presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules that were recognized by effector CD8+ T cells. Cancer cells with inherent genetic instability form abnormal proteins that have not been previously recognized by the  system and these proteins become highly immunogenic antigens(neo-antigens)that can spontaneously trigger CD8+ T  responses. Cancer cells that present extremely immunogenic neo-antigens are eliminated from the host through the process of carcinogenesis. Therefore, recognition of neo-antigens could be an important subject of the clinical utility of both neo-antigen cancer vaccine and adoptive TCR-T  therapy as cancer immunotherapies. Furthermore, monitoring the quantity and quality of the neo-antigen derived in each patient could deduce the clinical response to   inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 therapy in various cancers.

Although some extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients have shown responses to   blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patient response to immunotherapy have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor  microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 -related genes and characterized the  cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an  subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor  microenvironment subgroups were named  tolerance,  evasion-A,  evasion-B, and  silenced. The  tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T- lymphoma. The  evasion group showed high cytotoxic T- counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the -silenced group, almost all  responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor  microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor  microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the  tolerance group, 60% (3/5) in the  evasion group, and 0% (0/5) in the -silenced group.

In conclusion, we propose that the tumor  microenvironment of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652644>MPT0G612, a Novel HDAC6 Inhibitor, Induces Apoptosis and Suppresses IFN-γ-Induced Programmed Death-Ligand 1 in Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been implicated in regulating complex cellular mechanisms to influence tumor biology and immunogenicity in various types of cancer. The potential of selective inhibition of HDAC6 has been widely discussed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We previously identified that MPT0G612 is a novel HDAC6 inhibitor exhibiting a promising antitumor activity against several solid tumors. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and pharmacological mechanisms of MPT0G612 as a potential therapy for CRC patients. Results revealed that MPT0G612 significantly suppresses the proliferation and viability, as well as induces apoptosis in CRC cells. Autophagy activation with LC3B-II formation and p62 degradation was observed, and the inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitor or Atg5 knockdown enhances MPT0G612-induced  death. In addition, HDAC6 knockdown reduces MPT0G612-mediated autophagy and further potentiates apoptotic  death. Furthermore, MPT0G612 downregulates the expression of PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ in CRC cells. These results suggest that MPT0G612 is a potent  death inducer through inhibiting HDAC6-associated pathway, and a potential agent for combination strategy with   inhibitors for the treatment of CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635973>  inhibitors: For how long do we need to release the brakes to achieve the optimum acceleration of -mediated anti-tumor response?</a></h2><p>In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has emerged as the fourth pillar of cancer therapy alongside surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We here report an unusual scenario of a patient with advanced metastatic non-small  lung cancer who was lost to follow up after two cycles of chemo-immunotherapy who later returned to clinic with complete response; suggesting that in some, all that was needed may have been just a few doses of therapy to "release the breaks."Copyright © 2019.

Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.2-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16.2 months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting. Our data support its use in clinical practice for pretreated non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with older age or CNS metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent  surveillance, and possibly synergize   treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T  functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells ( based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628506>[Erratum to: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like uveitis under   inhibitor treatment for metastasized malignant melanoma].</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656782>Biomarkers in metastatic renal  carcinoma in the era of   inhibitors.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652645>Epigenetic Reprogramming for Targeting -Mutant Malignant Gliomas.</a></h2><p>Targeting the epigenome has been considered a compelling treatment modality for several cancers, including gliomas. Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor  responses, appropriate drug combinations with   inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of immunotherapy, ultimately leading to tumor  eradication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648184>  inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction: a disproportionality analysis using the WHO adverse drug reaction database VigiBase.</a></h2><p>Our study aimed to identify and characterize thyroid dysfunctions associated with immume  inhibitors (ICIs).Data were obtained from VigiBase, between January 1, 2011 to March 6, 2019.All thyroid drug-adverse events are classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were considered as measures of disproportionality for the assessment of association between ICIs and thyroid dysfunctions. We used IC to identify meaningful drug-adverse events while using ROR to compare differences in the reporting of drug-adverse events caused by different ICI subgroups. Positive IC values are deemed significant.Compared with the full database, the following ICI-associated thyroid dysfunctions were over-reported: hypothyroidism (1125 reports for ICIs vs 12495 for all drugs; Information Component 4.28 [95% CI 4.18-4.35]), hyperthyroidism (926 vs 7538; 4.66 [95% CI 4.55-4.74]), thyroiditis (294 vs 1237; 5.40 [95% CI 5.21-5.54]), thyrotoxic crisis (11 vs 288; 3.55 [95% CI 2.61-4.20]). Hypothyroidism was over-reported for patients treated with ICI combination therapy versus those treated with ICI monotherapy (ROR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), and the same was observed for hyperthyroidism (ROR 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]), thyroiditis (ROR 3.3 [95% CI 2.3-4.8]), thyrotoxic crisis (ROR 11.5 [95% CI 2.4-53.8]). All 11 thyrotoxic crisis cases were malignant melanoma patients, of which 7 occurred under ICI combination therapy.Thyroid dysfunction may occur after ICI therapies, and severe thyrotoxic crisis may even occurs. Raising awareness of ICI-associated thyroid dysfunction can improve the detection and treatment of these diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625630>Association of combined PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes features with survival and treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma.</a></h2><p>Recent advances obtained with   inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the Programmed  death-1 (PD-1) protein have significantly improved the outcome of patients with metastatic melanoma. The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry is a predictive biomarker in some solid tumors, but appears insufficient as prognostic or predictive factor of response to ICIs in metastatic melanomas.We investigated whether the presence and the features of pretreatment CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) could be a complementary prognostic or predictive biomarker in patients with metastatic melanoma.In this retrospective study, we evaluated the association of PD-L1 expression ≥5% of tumor cells combined with TILs features (CD8, CD28, Ki67) with the overall survival (OS) among 51 patients treated with ICIs and 54 patients treated with other treatment options (non-ICIs).PD-L1 positivity was observed in 33% and 39% of primary melanomas and matched metastases, respectively, with, however, poor concordance between the primary and the matched metastatic site (κ=0.283). No significant association was noted between PD-L1 expression and CD8+TILs profile analyzed as single markers and OS or response to immunotherapy. Instead, their combined analysis in primary melanoma samples showed that the PD-L1-/CD8+ status was significantly associated with prolonged OS in the whole population (P=0.04) and in the subgroup treated with non-ICIs (P=0.009). Conversely, the PD-L1+/CD8+ status was a good prognostic factor in patients treated with ICIs (P=0.022), whereas was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients treated with non-ICIs (P=0.014). While the expression of CD28 was not related to outcome, the Ki67 expression was significantly associated to poor OS in the subgroup CD8+TIL+/PD-L1- (P=0.02).The pre-treatment combination of PD-L1 expression with the level of CD8+TILs could better assess OS and predict therapeutic response of patients with metastatic melanoma treated either by immunotherapy or other treatments regimens.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672768>How to Train your T cells: Overcoming  Dysfunction in Multiple Myeloma.</a></h2><p>The progression of multiple myeloma (MM), a hematologic malignancy characterized by unregulated plasma  growth, is associated with increasing innate and adaptive  system dysfunction, notably in the T- repertoire. Although treatment advances in MM have led to deeper and more durable clinical responses, the disease remains incurable for most patients. Therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and activating the host  system have recently shown promise in MM, particularly in the relapsed and/or refractory disease setting. As the efficacy of T--dependent immuno-oncology therapy is likely affected by the health of the endogenous T- repertoire, these therapies may also provide benefit in alternate treatment settings (e.g., precursor disease; after stem  transplantation). This review describes T--associated changes during the evolution of MM and provides an overview of T--dependent immuno-oncology approaches under investigation. Vaccine and  inhibitor interventions are being explored across the MM disease continuum; treatment modalities that redirect patient T cells to elicit an anti-MM response, namely chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and bispecific antibodies (including BiTE [bispecific T- engager] molecules), have been primarily evaluated to date in the relapsed and/or refractory disease setting. CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies/antibody constructs directed against B- maturation antigen (BCMA) have generated excitement, with clinical data demonstrating deep responses. An increased understanding of the complex interplay between the  system and MM throughout the disease course will aid in maximizing the potential for T--dependent immuno-oncology strategies in MM.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p></html>
