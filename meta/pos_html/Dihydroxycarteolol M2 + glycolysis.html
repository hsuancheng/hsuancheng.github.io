Twelve female CBA/J, four male DBA/2, and four male BALB/c mice were included and mating carried out. The 12 CBA/J pregnant mice were then categorized into three groups of four mice: healthy control group CBA/J×BALB/c, abortion-prone pregnant group CBA/J×DBA/2 and normal pregnancies CBA/J×BALB/c treated with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.The profile of DMs, and the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in DMs from women with NP and RM were measured by flow cytometry. PD-L1 expression in human villi was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. An in vitro model consisting of peripheral CD14+ monocytes isolated from women with NP was used. The profile of differentiated macrophages and their phagocytotic activity were then measured by flow cytometry. The mRNA levels of genes potentially underlying macrophage polarization modulated by PD-1 signaling were determined by qRT-PCR. Twelve pregnant mice were included in our in vivo model and underwent different treatment. The embryo resorption rate, and macrophage profile as well as PD-1 expression in murine spleens and uterus were analyzed by flow cytometry.Compared with NP, women with RM had elevated percentages of M1 DMs (P < 0.01), and reduced frequencies of  DMs (P < 0.05), as well as decreased PD-1 protein expression (P < 0.05) in the DMs. In addition, decreased mRNA and protein levels of PD-L1 expression in placental villi were observed in women with RM (P < 0.001). Using in vitro experiments, compared to the control group, we found that PD-1 activation by recombinant human (rh) PD-L1 Fc (human PD-L1 fused to the Fc region of human IgG1) drove the differentiation of macrophages with immuno-modulatory characteristics (P < 0.01). However, PD-1 blockade promoted dominance of the M1 phenotype (P < 0.01). PD-1 polarized macrophages showed enhanced phagocytic activity (P < 0.01), which was decreased with PD-1 blockade (P < 0.001). Furthermore, PD-1 blockade promoted the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 5 (P < 0.05), while IRF4 expression was inhibited (P < 0.05). In addition, PD-1 blockade promoted macrophage  (P < 0.01) and inhibited fatty acid oxidation (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of both phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase were upregulated (P < 0.05) with PD-1 blockade during DM metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, in vivo mice data showed that PD-1 blockade or deficiency was associated with decreased  percentages at the maternal-fetal interface (P < 0.05) and embryo loss (P < 0.05).N/A.Whether the changes in DM polarization seen in miscarriage tissues are a cause or consequence of the demise of the pregnancy still requires further investigation. In addition, conducting metabolite analysis is required to further measure bioenergetic profiles.This is the first study on the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in macrophage polarization during early pregnancy; such exploration enhances our understanding of the physiology of early pregnancy. Our study also indicates that targeting the PD-1 pathway may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent pregnancy loss.This study was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 81671490) and Integrated Innovative Team for Major Human Diseases Program of Tongji Medical College, HUST (No. 5001519002).

Glyoxalase I (GLO I) is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the detoxification of cytotoxic methylglyoxal formed in  and which is known to be highly expressed in many cancer cells. Thus, specific inhibitors of GLO I are expected to be effective anticancer drugs. We previously discovered a novel GLO I inhibitor named TLSC702. Although the strong inhibitory activity of TLSC702 was observed in the in vitro enzyme assay, higher concentrations were required to induce apoptosis at the cellular level. One of the proposed reasons for this difference is that cancer cells alter the energy metabolism leading them to become more dependent on mitochondrial respiration than  (Metabolic shift) to avoid apoptosis induction. Thus, we assumed that combination of TLSC702 with shikonin-a specific inhibitor of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) that acts as a driver of TCA cycle by supplying pyruvate and which is known to be specifically expressed in cancer cells-would have anticancer effects. We herein show the anticancer effects of combination treatment with TLSC702 and shikonin, and a possible anticancer mechanism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The lack of effective anti-inflammatory therapies for people with CF (PWCF) represents a significant challenge.To identify altered immunometabolism in the CF neutrophil, and investigate the feasibility of specific inhibition of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as a CF anti-inflammatory strategy in vivo.Key markers of increased aerobic , known as a Warburg effect, including cytosolic pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), phosphorylated PKM2, succinate, HIF-1α, lactate and the interleukin (IL)-1β precursor pro-IL-1β, as well as caspase-1 activity and processing of pro-IL-1β to IL-1β by the NLRP3 inflammasome, were measured in neutrophils from blood and airway secretions from healthy controls (n=12), PWCF (n=16) and PWCF post-double-lung transplant (n=6). The effects of specific inhibition of NLRP3 on airway inflammation and bacterial clearance in a murine CF model were subsequently assessed in vivo.CF neutrophils display increased aerobic  in the systemic circulation. This effect is driven by low-level endotoxemia, unaffected by CFTR modulation, and resolves post-transplant. The increased pro-IL-1β produced is processed to its mature active form in the lipopolysaccharide-rich CF lung by the NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-1. Specific NLRP3 inhibition in vivo with MCC950 inhibited IL-1β in the lungs of CF mice (P<0.0001), resulting in significantly reduced airway inflammation and improved Pseudomonas clearance (P<0.0001).CF neutrophil immunometabolism is altered in response to inflammation. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition may have an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective role in CF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30821169>Polychlorinated biphenyls promote cell survival through pyruvate kinase -dependent  in HeLa cells.</a></h2><p>It is well known that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment. The present study investigated the effects of three PCBs including 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126), 2,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118), and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB153) on human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell survival and the possible underlying mechanisms. The results showed that PCB126, PCB118, or PCB153 exposure for 48 h significantly promoted HeLa cell survival. Meanwhile, glucose consumption, lactate production, and -related proteins including glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) were remarkably elevated after three PCBs treatment, indicated PCBs stimulating . Moreover, we found that the expression and nuclear distribution of PKM2 protein was significantly increased in PCB126, PCB118, or PCB153-treated HeLa cells. However, the enzymatic activity of PKM2 was reduced. In addition, the three congeners exposure elevated ROS levels and the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits such as NOX2, p47, and p40. The addition of antioxidant NAC antagonized the three PCBs-induced effects on PKM2, cell survival, and . Taken together, these results indicated that PCB126, PCB118, or PCB153 exposure promotes cervical cancer HeLa cell survival by PKM2-dependent upregulation of , which is mediated by NADPH oxidase-induced ROS production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29902837>Tazarotene-Induced Gene 1 Interacts with DNAJC8 and Regulates  in Cervical Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>The tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) protein is a retinoid-inducible growth regulator and is considered a tumor suppressor. Here, we show that DnaJ heat shock protein family member C8 (DNAJC8) is a TIG1 target that regulates . Ectopic DNAJC8 expression induced the translocation of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) into the nucleus, subsequently inducing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression to promote glucose uptake. Silencing either DNAJC8 or PKM2 alleviated the upregulation of GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake induced by ectopic DNAJC8 expression. TIG1 interacted with DNAJC8 in the cytosol, and this interaction completely blocked DNAJC8-mediated PKM2 translocation and inhibited glucose uptake. Furthermore, increased glycose uptake was observed in cells in which TIG1 was silenced. In conclusion, TIG1 acts as a pivotal repressor of DNAJC8 to enhance glucose uptake by partially regulating PKM2 translocation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30548595>Mandibular osteotomy-induced hypoxia enhances osteoclast activation and acid secretion by increasing .</a></h2><p>The rapid bone remodeling after osteotomy has been reported for a long time. However, the underlying mechanism promoting the active bone reconstruction was still to be elucidated. Since not only the bone, blood vessels, and supportive tissues, but also the local microenvironment were destroyed, if the changes on the cell metabolism was contributed to the accelerated bone remodeling came into sight. In present study, we found that the mandibular osteotomy in rabbit activated osteoclasts, as well as the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) in alveolar bone. Hypoxia or HIF-1α could enhanced osteoclastogenesis, bone absorption, and lactic acid concentration in receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand-induced RAW264.7 cells. Coincided with the upregulated HIF-1α expression, HIF-driven glycolytic enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucokinase (GCK), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), and phosphofructokinase1 (PFK1), were found massively increased in both hypoxic RAW264.7 cells and the alveolar HIF-1α-positive osteoclasts after mandibular osteotomy. Knockdown of HIF-1α suppressed not only the hypoxia-mediated , but also the hypoxia-induced acid secretion and bone resorption in RAW264.7 cells. Application of inhibitor on  gave rise to the similar results as HIF-1α knockdown. Our findings suggested that hypoxia-driven  in osteoclasts was an adaptive mechanism to permit alveolar bone remodeling after mandibular osteotomy.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31106485>Antitumor activity of SR splicing-factor 5 knockdown by downregulating pyruvate kinase  in non-small cell lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>SR splicing-factors (SRSFs) play a vital role in carcinogenesis. SRSF5 was demonstrated to be upregulated in lung cancer and identified as a novel prognostic indicator for small-cell lung cancer. However, the role of SRSF5 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the molecular mechanism involved are still undefined. The expression of SRSF5 in NSCLC cells was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The proliferation of cells was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 and BrdU assays. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis of apoptosis-associated proteins including B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, and cytochrome C (Cyt C).  was detected by determining glucose consumption, lactate production, and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) expression. We found that SRSF5 messenger RNA and protein levels were elevated in NSCLC cells. SRSF5 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and Ki67 expression in NSCLC cells. SRSF5 silencing increased the apoptotic rate, upregulated Bax and Cyt C, and decreased Bcl-2 level in NSCLC cells. Moreover, Knockdown of SRSF5 repressed  in NSCLC cells via reducing PKM2 expression. Enhanced  by PKM2 overexpression attenuated the effects of SRSF5 silencing on NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis. Overall, knockdown of SRSF5 inhibited proliferative ability and induced apoptosis by suppressing PKM2 expression in NSCLC cells.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30029001>Macrophage-Associated PGK1 Phosphorylation Promotes Aerobic  and Tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a dominant leukocyte population in the tumor microenvironment and actively promote cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of macrophages remains poorly understood. Here we show that polarized  macrophages enhance 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1)-mediated phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) threonine (T) 243 phosphorylation in tumor cells by secreting interleukin-6 (IL-6). This phosphorylation facilitates a PGK1-catalyzed reaction toward  by altering substrate affinity. Inhibition of PGK1 T243 phosphorylation or PDPK1 in tumor cells or neutralization of macrophage-derived IL-6 abrogates macrophage-promoted , proliferation, and tumorigenesis. In addition, PGK1 T243 phosphorylation correlates with PDPK1 activation, IL-6 expression, and macrophage infiltration in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Moreover, PGK1 T243 phosphorylation also correlates with malignance and prognosis of human GBM. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of macrophage-promoted tumor growth by regulating tumor cell metabolism, implicating the therapeutic potential to disrupt the connection between macrophages and tumor cells by inhibiting PGK1 phosphorylation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PKM2 is found in high levels in glioblastoma (GBM) cells with marginal expression within healthy brain tissue, rendering it a key biomarker of GBM metabolic re-programming. Our group has reported the development of a novel radiotracer, 1-((2-fluoro- 6-[F]fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine ([F]DASA- 23), to non-invasively detect PKM2 levels with positron emission tomography (PET).U87 human GBM cells were treated with the IC50 concentration of various agents used in the treatment of GBM, including alkylating agents (temozolomide, carmustine, lomustine, procarbazine), inhibitor of topoisomerase I (irinotecan), vascular endothelial and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cediranib and erlotinib, respectively) anti-metabolite (5-fluorouracil), microtubule inhibitor (vincristine), and metabolic agents (dichloroacetate and IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib). Following drug exposure for three or 6 days (n = 6 replicates per condition), the radiotracer uptake of [F]DASA-23 and 2-deoxy-2-[F]fluoro-D-glucose ([F]FDG) was assessed. Changes in PKM2 protein levels were determined via Western blot and correlated to radiotracer uptake.Significant interactions were found between the treatment agent (n = 12 conditions total comprised 11 drugs and vehicle) and the duration of treatment (3- or 6-day exposure to each drug) on the cellular uptake of [F]DASA-23 (p = 0.0001). The greatest change in the cellular uptake of [F]DASA-23 was found after exposure to alkylating agents (p < 0. 0001) followed by irinotecan (p = 0. 0012), erlotinib (p = 0. 02), and 5-fluorouracil (p = 0. 005). Correlation of PKM2 protein levels and [F]DASA-23 cellular uptake revealed a moderate correlation (r = 0.44, p = 0.15).These proof of principle studies emphasize the superiority of [F]DASA-23 to [F]FDG in detecting the glycolytic response of GBM to multiple classes of anti-neoplastic drugs in cell culture.

Inflammatory processes are associated with upregulation of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway in exudative AMD. We focus this review on the link between WNT/beta-catenin pathway activation and neovascular progression in exudative AMD through activation of aerobic  for production of angiogenic factors. Increased WNT/beta-catenin pathway involves hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). WNT/beta-catenin pathway stimulates PI3K/Akt pathway and then HIF-1alpha which activates glycolytic enzymes: glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A), and monocarboxylate lactate transporter (MCT-1). This phenomenon is called aerobic  or the Warburg effect. Consequently, phosphorylation of PDK-1 inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Thus, a large part of pyruvate cannot be converted into acetyl-CoA in mitochondria and only a part of acetyl-CoA can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Cytosolic pyruvate is converted into lactate through the action of LDH-A. In exudative AMD, high level of cytosolic lactate is correlated with increase of VEGF expression, the angiogenic factor of CNV. Photoreceptors in retina cells can metabolize glucose through aerobic  to protect them against oxidative damage, as cancer cells do.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661041>Metabolic control of type 2 immunity.</a></h2><p>Type 2 immune responses play key roles in protection against parasitic worm infections, whole-body metabolic homeostasis, wound healing, and the development of allergies. As a result, there is considerable interest in understanding the pathways that regulate type 2 immunity in order to identify strategies of targeting and controlling these responses. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the functional properties of immune cells, including those involved in type 2 immune responses, are dependent on the engagement of specific metabolic pathways such as aerobic  and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). We here discuss the latest insights in the metabolic regulation of immune cells that initiate type 2 immune responses, such as dendritic cells and innate lymphoid cells, as well as immune cells involved in the effector phase, like T helper 2 (Th2) cells, B cells and alternatively activated macrophages ( macrophages).

Deregulation of  is often observed in human endothelial cells during angiogenesis. In the present study, we first report that resveratrol (RST), which has been intensively studied in glucose metabolism of various cancer cells, has a profound inhibitory effect on tube formation and migration via suppression of  in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, we further reveal that RST reduced the mRNA and protein level of glucose transporter-1(GLUT1), hexokinase II (HK2), phosphofructokinase-1(PFK1) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) through modulation of ERK-mediated PKM2 nuclear translocation. Our results provide a novel mechanism to account for the inhibition of RST on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and suggest that targeting aerobic  or nuclear PKM2 may be a new approach for pathological angiogenesis prevention or treatment.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29619774>Pyruvate Kinase Isozyme  Plays a Critical Role in the Interactions Between Pancreatic Stellate Cells and Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>The interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic stellate cells plays a pivotal role in the progression of pancreatic cancer. Pyruvate kinase isozyme  is a key enzyme in . Previous studies have shown that pyruvate kinase isozyme  is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and that it regulates the aggressive behaviors of pancreatic cancer cells.To clarify the role of pyruvate kinase isozyme  in the interactions between pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic stellate cells.Pyruvate kinase isozyme -knockdown pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1 and SUIT-2 cells) and pancreatic stellate cells were generated by the introduction of small interfering RNA-expressing vector against pyruvate kinase isozyme . Cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were examined in vitro. The impact of pyruvate kinase isozyme  knockdown on the growth of subcutaneous tumors was examined in nude mice in vivo.Pyruvate kinase isozyme -kockdown pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic stellate cells showed decreased proliferation and migration compared to their respective control cells. Pancreatic stellate cell-induced proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were inhibited when pyruvate kinase isozyme  expression was knocked down in pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo, co-injection of pancreatic stellate cells increased the size of the tumor developed by the control SUIT-2 cells, but the effects were less evident when pyruvate kinase isozyme  was knocked down in SUIT-2 cells or pancreatic stellate cells.Our results suggested a critical role of pyruvate kinase isozyme  in the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic stellate cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738168>Alpha-synuclein induces microglial migration via PKM2-dependent .</a></h2><p>After spinal cord injury, microglial cells are activated and converted to an M1 phenotype. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that glucose reprogramming accompanies microglial activation. What contributes to the activation of microglia and glucose reprogramming, however, remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of a-synuclein in regulating the aerobic  in microglia. We found that a-synuclein contributed to the reprogramming of glucose metabolism in microglia by promoting  and inhibiting mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Further studies demonstrated that pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), a rate-limiting enzyme in , mediated glucose reprogramming regulated by a-synuclein. A co-immunoprecipitation assay and Western blot assay demonstrated that a-synuclein interacted with PKM2. Further studies demonstrated that knockdown of PKM2 in a-synuclein-exposed microglia markedly reduced  and lactate production. Additionally, a-synuclein exposure promoted migration abilities in glucose-cultured microglia, whereas migration ability was suppressed in PKM2 knockdown microglia. Additionally, the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 promoted migration ability in a-synuclein-treated microglia, compared to treatment with a-synuclein alone. In conclusion, we demonstrate a PKM2-dependent  of a-synuclein in microglial.Copyright © 2019.

PCR and western blotting were used to measure PKM2 expression in GC cells. PKM2 was knocked down to examine the biological behavior of tumors, glycometabolism, and apoptosis. PKM2 was upregulated in GC tissues (65%, 34/52) compared with that in adjacent normal tissues (27%, 10/37). Moreover, PKM2 knockdown inhibited proliferation of BGC823 GC cells, and elevated PKM2 levels were associated with poor survival of GC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of PKM2 altered the biological behavior of BGC823 cells through induction of apoptosis.

However, how this layer of gene expression regulation is coordinated with other aspects of the cell metabolism is still largely undefined. Glucose is the main energy and carbon source of the cell. Not surprisingly, its metabolism is finely tuned to satisfy growth requirements and in response to nutrient availability. A number of studies have begun to unveil the connections between glucose metabolism and splicing programs. Alternative splicing modulates the ratio between M1 and  isoforms of pyruvate kinase in this way determining the choice between aerobic  and complete glucose oxidation in the Krebs cycle.

To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we studied protective factors for DN using proteomics on glomeruli from individuals with extreme duration of diabetes (ł50 years) without DN and those with histologic signs of DN. Enzymes in the glycolytic, sorbitol, methylglyoxal and mitochondrial pathways were elevated in individuals without DN. In particular, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) expression and activity were upregulated. Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased PKM2 tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and cultured podocytes. Pkm-knockdown immortalized mouse podocytes had higher levels of toxic glucose metabolites, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse albuminuria and glomerular pathology. Conversely, we found that pharmacological activation of PKM2 by a small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1α mRNA in cultured podocytes. In intervention studies using DBA2/J and Nos3 (eNos) KO mouse models of diabetes, TEPP-46 treatment reversed metabolic abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction and kidney pathology. Thus, PKM2 activation may protect against DN by increasing glucose metabolic flux, inhibiting the production of toxic glucose metabolites and inducing mitochondrial biogenesis to restore mitochondrial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29394289>Lapachol inhibits  in cancer cells by targeting pyruvate kinase .</a></h2><p>Reliance on aerobic  is one of the hallmarks of cancer.

The expression of PKM2 in ER BC MCF-7 cells, T47D cells and MCF-7/ADR cells (which are subject to adriamycin/ADR induction) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. MCF-7/ADR (M/A) cells were grouped into blank group (M/A), negative group (M/A+NC), low expression of PKM2 group (M/A+si-PKM2 group), overexpression of PKM2 group (M/A+PKM2 group) and  inhibition group (M/A+PKM2+2-DG group). Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were applied to measure the expressions of PKM2, multidrug resistance, and glutathione-S-transferase π. Glucose and lactic acid kit was used to detect the amount of glucose uptake and lactic production. Cell variability, clone formation ability, and cell apoptosis were respectively measured by MTT, clone formation assay, and flow cytometry. Transwell assay and scratch assay were applied for cell invasion and migration ability. By overexpressing PKM2 in MCF-7 and T47D cells and using 2-DG, the effect on sensitivity of adriamycin amycin was explored. MCF-7/ADR cells have both elevated mRNA and protein expressions of PKM2 when compared with MCF-7 cells (both P<0.05). The cell activity of the M/A+si-PKM2+ADR group was notably lower than that in the M/A+ADR group and M/A+NC+ADR group (both P<0.05). In the M/A+si-PKM2 group, expressions of PKM2, multidrug resistance, and glutathione-S-transferase π, along with the amount of glucose uptake and lactic production, as well as cell variability, clone formation ability, and cell invasion and migration ability were inhibited, whereas cell apoptosis was increased in comparison with the M/A group and M/A+NC group (all P<0.05).

Firstly, trans-well invasion assay and wound healing assay indicated that quercetin effectively suppressed cell mobility. The corresponding western blot revealed that quercetin treatment down-regulated the expression of cell migration marker proteins, such as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The further experiments exhibited that quercetin successfully blocked cell  by inhibiting the level of glucose uptake and the production of lactic acid, and also decreased the level of -related proteins Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), Glucose transporter1(GLUT1) and Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). The above results revealed that quercetin might inhibit  to limit the migration of tumor cells by reducing the acidity of the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, our further investigation showed that quercetin induced obvious autophagy via inactivating the Akt-mTOR pathway. At the same time, the application of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and Akt-mTOR pathway inducer IGF-1 further demonstrated that quercetin exerted inhibiting effect on cell mobility and  through Akt-mTOR pathway mediated autophagy induction. At last, the in vivo experiments also showed that quercetin treatment could suppress tumor growth and metastasis, inhibit  and induce autophagy through the inhibition of p-AKT/AKT. Taken together, we firstly revealed that quercetin suppressed the progression of breast cancer by inhibiting cell mobility and  through Akt-mTOR pathway mediated autophagy induction and may provide a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) regulates the final step of  levels and provides a growth advantage to tumors. However, it is unclear whether the change of PKM2 has an effect on FASN and what is the mechanisms underlying. Here we describe a novel function of PKM2 in control of lipid metabolism by mediating transcriptional activation of FASN, showing the reduced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c). We first discovered that PKM2 physically interacts with the SREBP-1c using biochemical approaches, and downregulation of PKM2 reduced the expression of SREBP-1c by inactivating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn directly suppressed the transcription of major lipogenic genes FASN to reduce tumor growths. Furthermore, either PKM2 inhibitor-Shikonin or FASN inhibitor-TVB-3166 alone induced a strong antiproliferative and anticolony forming effect in bladder cancer cell line. The combination of both inhibitors exhibits a super synergistic effect on blocking the bladder cancer cells growth. It provides a new target and scientific basis for the treatment of bladder cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642061>Cancer-associated mutations in human pyruvate kinase  impair enzyme activity.</a></h2><p>Mammalian pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of , and its  isoform (PKM2) is widely expressed in proliferative tissues. Mutations in PKM2 are found in some human cancers, however, the effects of these on enzyme activity and regulation are unknown. Here, we characterized five cancer-associated PKM2 mutations, occurring at various locations on the enzyme, with respect to substrate kinetics and activation by the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The mutants exhibit reduced maximal velocity, reduced substrate affinity, and/or altered activation by FBP. The kinetic parameters of five additional PKM2 mutants that have been used to study enzyme function or regulation also demonstrate the deleterious effects of mutations on PKM2 function. Our findings indicate that PKM2 is sensitive to many amino acid changes and support the hypothesis that decreased PKM2 activity is selected for in rapidly proliferating cells.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28607489>The metabolic function of cyclin D3-CDK6 kinase in cancer cell survival.</a></h2><p>D-type cyclins (D1, D2 and D3) and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6) are components of the core cell cycle machinery that drives cell proliferation. Inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 are currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with several cancer types, with promising results. Here, using human cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts in mice, we show that the cyclin D3-CDK6 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits the catalytic activity of two key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 6-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase . This re-directs the glycolytic intermediates into the pentose phosphate (PPP) and serine pathways. Inhibition of cyclin D3-CDK6 in tumour cells reduces flow through the PPP and serine pathways, thereby depleting the antioxidants NADPH and glutathione. This, in turn, increases the levels of reactive oxygen species and causes apoptosis of tumour cells. The pro-survival function of cyclin D-associated kinase operates in tumours expressing high levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 complexes. We propose that measuring the levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 in human cancers might help to identify tumour subsets that undergo cell death and tumour regression upon inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. Cyclin D3-CDK6, through its ability to link cell cycle and cell metabolism, represents a particularly powerful oncoprotein that affects cancer cells at several levels, and this property can be exploited for anti-cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483829>MiR-21-mediated Metabolic Alteration of Cancer-associated Fibroblasts and Its Effect on Pancreatic Cancer Cell Behavior.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated whether the metabolic alteration of  (CAFs) occurs via miR-21 remodeling and the effect of this alteration on pancreatic cancer cells. CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated and cultured. Glucose consumption and lactic acid production were tested, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), and miR-21 expression were examined. The level of  in CAFs was determined after treatment with a miR-21 inhibitor. Primary miR-21-NC CAFs and miR-21-inhibitor CAFs were indirectly co-cultured with BxPc-3 , and the invasion capacity of these cells was determined. The aerobic oxidation index of cancer cells and the expression of succinodehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH) were assessed. Compared with NFs, CAFs showed enhanced glucose uptake capacity, lactic acid production, and elevated LDHA, PKM2, and miR-21 expression. After miR-21 inhibitor treatment, the extent of  in CAFs was reduced. After indirect co-culture with CAFs, oxidative phosphorylation and SDH, FH, and MCT expression increased in BxPc-3 cells. After co-culture with miR-21-inhibitor-CAFs, oxidative phosphorylation and invasion ability of the pancreatic cancer cells decreased. MiR-21 was involved in metabolic alteration of CAFs and affected the development of cancer cells.

Defining risk factors for DKD using a reductionist approach has proven challenging. Integrative omics-based systems biology tools have shed new insights in our understanding of DKD and have provided several key breakthroughs for identifying novel predictive and diagnostic biomarkers. In this review, we highlight the role of the Warburg effect in DKD and potential regulating factors such as sphingomyelin, fumarate, and pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  in shifting glucose flux from complete oxidation in mitochondria to the glycolytic pathway and its principal branches. With the development of highly sensitive instruments and more advanced automatic bioinformatics tools, we believe that omics analyses and imaging techniques will focus more on singular-cell-level studies, which will allow in-depth understanding of DKD and pave the path for personalized kidney precision medicine.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658475>[Aerobic  activation through canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ALS].</a></h2><p>Energy is the major determinant of neuronal viability. We focus our synthesis on the hypothesis of the development of aerobic  by the stimulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The stimulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway induces the activation of aerobic , also called Warburg effect, via the stimulation of glycolytic enzymes such as Glut (glucose transporter), PKM2 (pyruvate kinase ), PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1), LDH-A (lactate dehydrogenase A) and MCT-1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1). The aerobic  consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic  is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation due to the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of cellular energy metabolism promotes cell death and participates to the progression of ALS. Controlling the expression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway is an attractive strategy to regulate aerobic  initiation and the progression of ALS.© 2018 médecine/sciences – Inserm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087897>Tyrosine Kinase Signaling in Cancer Metabolism: PKM2 Paradox in the Warburg Effect.</a></h2><p>The Warburg Effect, or aerobic , is one of the major metabolic alterations observed in cancer. Hypothesized to increase a cell's proliferative capacity via regenerating NAD, increasing the pool of glycolytic biosynthetic intermediates, and increasing lactate production that affects the tumor microenvironment, the Warburg Effect is important for the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. The mechanisms by which a cell acquires the Warburg Effect phenotype are regulated by the expression of numerous oncogenes, including oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Oncogenic tyrosine kinases play a significant role in phosphorylating and regulating the activity of numerous metabolic enzymes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of glycolytic enzymes increases the activities of a majority of glycolytic enzymes, thus promoting increased glycolytic rate and tumor cell proliferation. Paradoxically however, tyrosine phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) results in decreased PKM2 activity, and this decrease in PKM2 activity promotes the Warburg Effect. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that PKM2 is also able to act as a protein kinase using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate to promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated both the role of the classical and non-canonical activity of PKM2 in promoting the Warburg Effect and tumor growth, which raise further interesting questions. In this review, we will summarize these recent advances revealing the importance of tyrosine kinases in the regulation of the Warburg Effect as well as the role of PKM2 in the promotion of tumor growth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335522>Pyruvate kinase  promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma invasion and metastasis through phosphorylation and stabilization of PAK2 protein.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase muscle isozymes (PKMs) have crucial roles in regulating metabolic changes during carcinogenesis. A switch from PKM1 to PKM2 isoform was thought to lead to aerobic  promoting carcinogenesis, and was considered as one of the cancer signatures. However, recent evidence has argued against the existence of PKM isoform switch and related metabolic effects during cancer progression. We compared the effects of PKM1 and PKM2 in cell invasiveness and metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Both PKM1 and PKM2 expression affected cell migration and invasion abilities of PDAC cells, but only knockdown of PKM2 suppressed metastasis in a xenograft model. By comparing the established PKM2 mutants in the regulation of cell invasion, we found that PKM2 may control cell mobility through its protein kinase and phopho-peptide binding abilities. Further survey for PKM2-associated proteins identified PAK2 as a possible phosphorylation target in PDAC. In vitro binding and kinase assays revealed that PKM2 directly phosphorylated PAK2 at Ser20, Ser141, and Ser192/197. Knockdown of PKM2 decreased PAK2 protein half-life by increasing ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Moreover, we identified PAK2 as an HSP90 client protein and the mutation at Ser192/197 of PAK2 reduced PAK2-HSP90 association. Knockdown of PAK2 diminished in vitro cell mobility and in vivo metastatic ability of PKM2 overexpressed PDAC cells. PKM2 and PAK2 protein expression also positively correlated with each other in PDAC tissues. Our findings indicate that PKM2-PAK2 regulation is critical for developing metastasis in PDAC, and suggest that targeting the PKM2/HSP90/PAK2 complex has a potential therapeutic value in this deadly disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29692543>Transcriptome analysis of  in response to exogenous methyl jasmonate provides novel insights into regulation of jasmonate-elicited rubber biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>The phytohomorne methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is known to trigger extensive reprogramming of gene expression leading to transcriptional activation of many secondary metabolic pathways. However, natural rubber is a commercially important secondary metabolite and little is known about the genetic and genomic basis of jasmonate-elicited rubber biosynthesis in rubber tree (). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of  bark treated with 1 g lanolin paste containing 0.02% w/w MeJA for 24 h () and 0.04% w/w MeJA for 24 h (M4) was performed. A total of 2950 and 2850 differentially expressed genes in  and M4 compared with control (C) were respectively detected. Key genes involved in 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate, rubber biosynthesis,  and carbon fixation (Calvin cycle) pathway were found to be up-regulated by MeJA treatment. Particularly, the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-metylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in MVA pathway was down-regulated by MeJA treatment, but the expression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) and cis-prenyltransferase (CPT, or rubber transferase) in rubber biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated by MeJA treatment. Up-regulation of critical genes in JA biosynthesis in response to MeJA treatment exhibited the self-activation of JA biosynthesis. In addition, up-regulated genes of great regulatory importance in cross-talk between JA and other hormone signaling, and of transcriptional regulation were identified. The increased expression levels of FPS and CPT in rubber biosynthesis pathway possibly resulted in an increased latex production in rubber tree treated with MeJA. The present results provide insights into the mechanism by which MeJA activates the rubber biosynthesis and the transcriptome data can also serve as the foundation for future research into the molecular basis for MeJA regulation of other cellular processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28822229>Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis initiation under normoxic conditions through Wnt/β-catenin pathway in gliomas.</a></h2><p>The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is up-regulated in gliomas and involved in proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Nuclear β-catenin accumulation correlates with malignancy. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α by inhibiting HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation, which promotes glycolytic energy metabolism, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, whereas HIF-1α is degraded by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase under normoxic conditions. We focus this review on the links between the activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the mechanisms underlying vasculogenesis and angiogenesis through HIF-1α under normoxic conditions in gliomas. Wnt-induced epidermal growth factor receptor/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, Wnt-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, and Wnt/β-catenin target gene transduction (c-Myc) can activate HIF-1α in a hypoxia-independent manner. The PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activates HIF-1α through eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and STAT3. The β-catenin/T-cell factor 4 complex directly binds to STAT3 and activates HIF-1α, which up-regulates the Wnt/β-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc in a positive feedback loop. Phosphorylated STAT3 by interleukin-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor activates HIF-1α even under normoxic conditions. The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces, via the Wnt target genes c-Myc and cyclin D1 or via HIF-1α, gene transactivation encoding aerobic  enzymes, such as glucose transporter, hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase , pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase-A, leading to lactate production, as the primary alternative of ATP, at all oxygen levels, even in normoxic conditions. Lactate released by glioma cells via the monocarboxylate lactate transporter-1 up-regulated by HIF-1α and lactate anion activates HIF-1α in normoxic endothelial cells by inhibiting HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation and preventing HIF labeling by the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Increased lactate with acid environment and HIF-1α overexpression induce the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis under normoxic conditions.

Targeting these enzymes could attenuate aerobic  and inhibit tumor proliferation. We investigated whether the PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, and the LDHA inhibitor, FX-11, can be combined to inhibit in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. We assessed PKM2 and LDHA expression, enzyme activity, and cell proliferation rate after treatment with TEPP-46, FX-11, or a combination of both. Efficacy was validated in vivo by evaluating tumor growth, PK and LDHA activity in plasma and tumors, and PKM2, LDHA, and Ki-67 expression in tumor tissues following treatment. Dual therapy synergistically inhibited pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo without apparent toxicity. Treatment with TEPP-46 and FX-11 resulted in increased PK and reduced LDHA enzyme activity in plasma and tumor tissues and decreased PKM2 and LDHA expression in tumors, which was reflected by a decrease in tumor volume and proliferation.

However, the molecular pathways that regulate glucose metabolism are still elusive. We discovered that co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) suppresses glucose metabolism toward serine biosynthesis. By tracing the C-labeled glucose, we found that  knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit significantly increased  serine synthesis than WT cells. This is caused, at least in part, by the reduced pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in these cells. The  isoform of PK (PKM2) is arginine-methylated by CARM1, and methylation enhances its activity. Mechanistically, CARM1 methylates PKM2 at arginines 445 and 447, which enhances PKM2 tetramer formation. Consequently,  knockout cells exhibit significant survival advantages over WT cells when extracellular serine is limited, likely due to their enhanced  serine synthesis capacity. Altogether, we identified CARM1 as an important regulator of glucose metabolism and serine synthesis.© 2018 Abeywardana et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718296>Insulin Resistance in Macrophages Alters Their Metabolism and Promotes an -Like Phenotype.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance influences metabolic processes, but whether it affects macrophage metabolism is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that chronic exposure of macrophages to insulin either in culture or in vivo in diet-induced, glucose-intolerant mice rendered them resistant to insulin signals marked by failure to induce Akt2 phosphorylation. Similarly, macrophages lacking Akt2 or IGF1 receptor were also resistant to insulin signals. Insulin-resistant macrophages had increased basal mTORC1 activity, possessed an -like phenotype, and reduced LPS responses. Moreover, they exhibited increased  and increased expression of key glycolytic enzymes. Inhibition of mTORC1 reversed the -like phenotype and suppressed  in insulin-resistant macrophages.

O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is an enzyme harboring O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) hydrolase and cryptic lysine acetyltransferase activities. Here, we report that OGA is upregulated in a wide range of human cancers and drives aerobic  and tumor growth by inhibiting pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). PKM2 is dynamically O-GlcNAcylated in response to changes in glucose availability. Under high glucose conditions, PKM2 is a target of OGA-associated acetyltransferase activity, which facilitates O-GlcNAcylation of PKM2 by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcylation inhibits PKM2 catalytic activity and thereby promotes aerobic  and tumor growth.

Currently, diagnostic strategies tend to be subjective and limited quantitative tools exist to monitor optimal treatment strategies. Pro-inflammatory M1 polarized macrophages exhibit a distinct metabolic glycolytic phenotype compared to the continuum of  polarization states. In the present study, the distinct metabolic phenotypes of resting and activated macrophages were successfully characterized and quantified using hyperpolarized carbon-13 (C) labeled pyruvate and its metabolic products, i.e. lactate, as a biomarker of resting, disease and treated states. : Mouse macrophage J774A.1 cells were used as a model system in an NMR compatible bioreactor to facilitate dynamic hyperpolarized C measurements. The glycolytic metabolism of the cells in the quiescent or resting state were compared with macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, a classical M1 activator using hyperpolarized C labeled pyruvate. Additionally, the activated macrophages were also treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to assess the changes in hyperpolarized lactate signal.

However, our results reported here indicate co-expression of PKM1 and PKM2 and their possible physical interaction in cancer cells. We show that knockdown of either PKM1 or PKM2 differentially affects net PK activity, viability, and cellular ATP levels of the lung carcinoma cell lines H1299 and A549. The stable knockdown of PK isoforms in A549 cells significantly reduced the cellular ATP level, whereas in H1299 cells the level of ATP was unaltered. Interestingly, the PKM1/2 knockdown in H1299 cells activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy to maintain energy homeostasis. In contrast, knocking down either of the PKM isoforms in A549 cells lacking LKB1, a serine/threonine protein kinase upstream of AMPK, failed to activate AMPK and sustain energy homeostasis and resulted in apoptosis. Moreover, in a similar genetic background of silenced PKM1 or PKM2, the knocking down of AMPKα1/2 catalytic subunit in H1299 cells induced apoptosis. Our findings help explain why previous targeting of PKM2 in cancer cells to control tumor growth has not met with the expected success. We suggest that this lack of success is because of AMPK-mediated energy metabolism rewiring, protecting cancer cell viability. On the basis of our observations, we propose an alternative therapeutic strategy of silencing either of the PKM isoforms along with AMPK in tumors.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333642>The Metabolic Signature of Macrophage Responses.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of immune cells playing several and diverse functions in homeostatic and immune responses. The broad spectrum of macrophage functions depends on both heterogeneity and plasticity of these cells, which are highly specialized in sensing the microenvironment and modify their properties accordingly. Although it is clear that macrophage phenotypes are difficult to categorize and should be seen as plastic and adaptable, they can be simplified into two extremes: a pro-inflammatory (M1) and an anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving () profile. Based on this definition, M1 macrophages are able to start and sustain inflammatory responses, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, activating endothelial cells, and inducing the recruitment of other immune cells into the inflamed tissue; on the other hand,  macrophages promote the resolution of inflammation, phagocytose apoptotic cells, drive collagen deposition, coordinate tissue integrity, and release anti-inflammatory mediators. Dramatic switches in cell metabolism accompany these phenotypic and functional changes of macrophages. In particular, M1 macrophages rely mainly on  and present two breaks on the TCA cycle that result in accumulation of itaconate (a microbicide compound) and succinate. Excess of succinate leads to Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) stabilization that, in turn, activates the transcription of glycolytic genes, thus sustaining the glycolytic metabolism of M1 macrophages. On the contrary,  cells are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), their TCA cycle is intact and provides the substrates for the complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC). Moreover, pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages are characterized by specific pathways that regulate the metabolism of lipids and amino acids and affect their responses. All these metabolic adaptations are functional to support macrophage activities as well as to sustain their polarization in specific contexts.

In this study, we conditionally deleted PKM2 in cones (cone-cre PKM2-KO) and found that loss of PKM2 results in the upregulation of PKM1 and a significant loss of cone function and cone degeneration in an age-dependent manner. Gene expression studies on cone-cre PKM2-KO show decreased expression of genes regulating , PPP shunt, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Consistent with these observations, cones lacking PKM2 have significantly shorter cone outer segments than cones with PKM2. Our studies clearly suggest that PKM2 is essential for the anabolic process in cones to keep them alive for normal functioning and to support cone structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911326>Combination of shikonin with paclitaxel overcomes multidrug resistance in human ovarian carcinoma cells in a P-gp-independent manner through enhanced ROS generation.</a></h2><p>Shikonin (SKN), a naphthoquinone compound, is isolated from Chinese herbal medicine  root and has been studied as an anticancer drug candidate in human tumor models. This study is designed to investigate whether SKN can sensitize the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel (PTX) in drug-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells.Human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cell along with the paired PTX-resistant A2780/PTX cells were used. The effects of SKN, PTX or their combination on cell viability were conducted using Sulforhodamine B assay. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with P-gp-FITC anti-body. P-gp activity was determined by a fluorometric MDR assay kit or a rhodamine 123-based efflux assay, respectively. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC/PI co-staining. The effect of SKN, PTX or their combination on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and expression of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) were investigated using flow cytometry or western blotting, respectively. PKM2 activity was detected by a Pyruvate Kinase Assay Kit.SKN/PTX co-treatment led to synergistically enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PTX-resistant ovarian cancer cells, indicating the circumvention of multidrug resistance (MDR) of PTX by SKN. Further study indicated that the MDR reversal effect of SKN was independent of inhibiting activity of the efflux transporter P-gp. Notably, SKN/PTX significantly increased the generation of intracellular ROS in A2780/PTX cells, and scavenging intracellular ROS blocked the sensitizing effects of SKN in PTX-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in A2780/PTX cells, but not in A2780 cells. Furthermore, SKN/PTX-induced downregulation of PKM2 (a key enzyme in ) and the suppression of its activity were inhibited by a ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), suggesting that the synergy of the SKN/PTX combination may be not rely on PKM2 suppression.These results reveal a P-gp-independent mechanism through ROS generation for the SKN/PTX combination to overcome MDR in ovarian cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29550120>α-Lactalbumin-oleic acid complex kills tumor cells by inducing excess energy metabolism but inhibiting mRNA expression of the related enzymes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the anti-tumor α-lactalbumin-oleic acid complex (α-LA-OA) may target the  of tumor cells. However, few data are available regarding the effects of α-LA-OA on energy metabolism. In this study, we measured  and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to α-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in , tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that α-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal  and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to α-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase , lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the  process and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein β subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that α-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the energy demand. Our results may help clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial destruction.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), a critical regulator of the metabolism, growth and metastasis of cancer cells, has been confirmed to be overexpressed in various human cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of HSP90 and PKM2 overexpression in HCC remain unknown.The expression of HSP90 and PKM2 in HCC specimens and cells were detected by immunoblotting and immunostaining. The interaction between HSP90 and PKM2 was confirmed by tandem affinity purification, co-immunoprecipitation and Glutathione S transferase (GST)-pulldown assay.In this study, we found that HSP90 could bind to PKM2 and subsequently increased PKM2 abundance in HCC cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that HSP90 level was positively correlated with PKM2 level in HCC tissues. Mechanistically, HSP90 was found to increase the phosphorylation of PKM2 at Thr-328. Protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) formed a protein complex with HSP90 and PKM2, and directly mediated Thr-328 phosphorylation of PKM2 induced by HSP90. Thr-328 phosphorylation was critical for maintaining PKM2 stability and its biological functions in regulating , mitochondria respiration, proliferation and apoptosis. Functionally, we found that HSP90 promoted the  and proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells in a PKM2 dependent manner. In vivo experiments disclosed that PKM2 was required for the promoting effects of HSP90 on the growth of HCC cells in mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2 was correlated with poor clinicopathological features including high alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level, large tumor size, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that positive expression of HSP90 and PKM2, and a combination of these proteins could strongly predict the poor prognosis of HCC patients.We suggest that HSP90 potentiates the  and proliferation, reduces the apoptosis and thus enhances the growth of HCC cells through PKM2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30526248>Centromere protein F (CENPF), a microtubule binding protein, modulates cancer metabolism by regulating pyruvate kinase  phosphorylation signaling.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and is the second leading cause of male cancer-related death in North America. Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered metabolism and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase , a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in . Furthermore, CENPF cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer metabolism, potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients. Based on these findings, we suggest the CENPF may be an important regulator of PC metabolism through its role in the mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29512924>Down-regulation of PKM2 enhances anticancer efficiency of THP on bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) regulates the final step of  levels that are correlated with the sensitivity of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs. THP is one of the major drugs used in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer instillation chemotherapy. However, low response ratio of THP (19.7%) treatment to human genitourinary tumours using collagen gel matrix has been observed. This study aims to investigate the effect of down-regulation of PKM2 on THP efficiency. Via inhibitor or siRNA, the effects of reduced PKM2 on the efficiency of THP were determined in 2 human and 1 murine bladder cancer cell lines, using MTT, cologenic and fluorescence approaches. Molecular mechanisms of PKM2 on THP sensitization were explored by probing p-AMPK and p-STAT3 levels via WB. Syngeneic orthotopic bladder tumour model was applied to evaluate this efficiency in vivo, analysed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves, body and bladder weights plus immunohistochemistric tumour biomarkers. PKM2 was overexpressed in bladder cancer cells and tissues, and down-regulation of PKM2 enhanced the sensitivity of THP in vitro. Activation of AMPK is essential for THP to exert anti-bladder cancer activities. On the other hand, down-regulating PKM2 activates AMPK and inhibits STAT3, correlated with THP sensitivity. Compared with THP alone (400 μmol L , 50 μL), the combination with metformin (60 mmol L , 50 μL) stopped growth of bladder cancer completely in vivo (combination group VS normal group P = .078). Down-regulating the expression of PKM2 enhances the anticancer efficiency of THP. This study provides a new insight for improving the chemotherapeutic effect of THP.© 2018 The Authors.

OSCC frequently leads to oral dysfunction, which worsens a patient's quality of life. Moreover, its prognosis remains poor. Unlike normal cells, tumor cells preferentially metabolize glucose by aerobic . Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final step in , and the transition from PKM1 to PKM2 is observed in many cancer cells. However, little is known about PKM expression and function in OSCC. In this study, we investigated the expression of PKM in OSCC specimens and performed a functional analysis of human OSCC cells. We found that the / ratio was higher in OSCC cells than in adjacent normal mucosal cells and in samples obtained from dysplasia patients. Furthermore, PKM2 expression was strongly correlated with OSCC tumor progression on immunohistochemistry. PKM2 expression was higher during cell growth, invasion, and apoptosis in HSC3 cells, which show a high energy flow and whose metabolism depends on aerobic  and oxidative phosphorylation. PKM2 expression was also associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and integration of glutamine into lactate.

Recent studies challenge this traditional view, indicating that  may also be critically important for  macrophage differentiation, based on experiments with 2-DG. Here we confirm the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on , but also demonstrate that 2-DG impairs oxidative phosphorylation and significantly reduces C-labeled Krebs cycle metabolites and intracellular ATP levels. These metabolic derangements were associated with reduced JAK-STAT6 pathway activity and  differentiation marker expression. While glucose deprivation and glucose substitution with galactose effectively suppressed glycolytic activity, there was no effective suppression of oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular ATP levels, STAT6 phosphorylation, and  differentiation marker expression. These data indicate that glycolytic stimulation is not required for  macrophage differentiation as long as oxidative phosphorylation remains active.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether miR-214 can regulate  in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells has not yet been investigated. The expression levels of miR-214 in 7 NSCLC cell lines were measured by qRT-PCR. MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cell proliferation. Glucose consumption and lactate production were measured to assess the level of . The expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase isozyme  (PKM2) was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Luciferase reporter assay was carried out to confirm the target gene of miR-214. The levels of PTEN, p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, mTOR, p-S6K, and S6K were assessed by western blot analysis. Results showed that miR-214 levels were significantly increased in the 7 NSCLC cell lines compared with those in the human bronchial epithelial cell line. Down-regulation of miR-214 inhibited cell proliferation, glucose consumption, lactate production, and expression of HK2 and PKM2 in NSCLC cells. We also confirmed that miR-214 directly targeted PTEN and regulated the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway. Inhibition of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway attenuated the effect of miR-214 mimics on glucose consumption, lactate production, and expression of HK2 and PKM2 in NSCLC cells. These results demonstrated that miR-214 down-regulation inhibited cell proliferation and  by down-regulating the expression of HK2 and PKM2 via the PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in NSCLC cells.

Energy is the primary determinant of neuronal viability. In neurodegenerative cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD), WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focused this review on the hypothesis of aerobic  stimulated by the upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway in ALS and HD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic , named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A), and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Aerobic  consists of a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic  is less efficient in terms of ATP production compared with oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle.

Because of differential regulation of enzymatic activities, PKM2, but not PKM1, has been thought to favor cell proliferation. However, the role of PKM2 in tumorigenesis has been recently challenged. Here we report that increased glucose catabolism through  and increased pyruvate kinase activity in c-MYC-driven liver tumors are associated with increased expression of both PKM1 and PKM2 isoforms and decreased expression of the liver-specific isoform of pyruvate kinase, PKL. Depletion of PKM2 at the time of c-MYC overexpression in murine livers did not affect c-MYC-induced tumorigenesis and resulted in liver tumor formation with decreased pyruvate kinase activity and decreased catabolism of glucose into alanine and the Krebs cycle. An increased PKM1/PKM2 ratio by ectopic PKM1 expression further decreased glucose flux into serine biosynthesis and increased flux into lactate and the Krebs cycle, resulting in reduced total levels of serine. However, these changes also did not affect c-MYC-induced liver tumor development. These results suggest that increased expression of PKM2 is not required to support c-MYC-induced tumorigenesis in the liver and that various PKM1/PKM2 ratios and pyruvate kinase activities can sustain glucose catabolism required for this process. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352904>Targeting Cancer Cells and Tumor Microenvironment in Preclinical and Clinical Models of Hodgkin Lymphoma Using the Dual PI3Kδ/γ Inhibitor RP6530.</a></h2><p>Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma and affect disease outcome. Because the δ and γ isoforms of PI3K are overexpressed in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), we propose that the PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor RP6530 might affect both HRS cells and TME, ultimately leading to an enhanced antitumor response.Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines (L-540, KM-H2, and L-428) and primary human macrophages were used to investigate the activity of RP6530  and  in Hodgkin lymphoma cell line xenografts., RP6530 besides killing and inhibiting the proliferation of Hodgkin lymphoma cells, downregulated lactic acid metabolism, switching the activation of macrophages from an immunosuppressive -like phenotype to a more inflammatory M1-like state. By RNA sequencing, we define tumor  as a specific PI3Kδ/γ-dependent pathway implicated in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. We identify the metabolic regulator pyruvate kinase  as the main mediator of tumor-induced immunosuppressive phenotype of macrophages.

Alveolar macrophages are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. However, systematic characterization of expression profile in these cells is still lacking. Furthermore, main metabolic programs and their regulation of cellular phenotype are completely unknown. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the expression profile and main metabolic programs in alveolar macrophages from mice with or without experimental pulmonary fibrosis. We found that alveolar macrophages from both bleomycin and active TGF-β1-induced fibrotic mouse lungs demonstrated a primarily profibrotic -like profile that was distinct from the well-defined M1 or any of the  subtypes. More importantly, we found that fibrotic lung alveolar macrophages assumed augmented , which was likely attributed to enhanced expression of multiple key glycolytic mediators. We also found that fatty acid oxidation was upregulated in these cells. However, the profibrotic -like profile of fibrotic lung alveolar macrophages was not dependent on fatty acid oxidation and synthesis or lipolysis, but instead on , in contrast to the typical IL-4-induced macrophages M(IL-4). Additionally, glutaminolysis, a key metabolic program that has been implicated in numerous pathologies, was not required for the profibrotic -like phenotype of these macrophages.

Nitric oxide-based cellular signalling is generally mediated by protein S-nitrosylation, the oxidative modification of Cys residues to form S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). S-nitrosylation regulates proteins in all functional classes, and is controlled by enzymatic machinery that includes S-nitrosylases and denitrosylases, which add and remove SNO from proteins, respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the classic metabolic intermediate co-enzyme A (CoA) serves as an endogenous source of SNOs through its conjugation with nitric oxide to form S-nitroso-CoA (SNO-CoA), and S-nitrosylation of proteins by SNO-CoA is governed by its cognate denitrosylase, SNO-CoA reductase (SCoR). Mammals possess a functional homologue of yeast SCoR, an aldo-keto reductase family member (AKR1A1) with an unknown physiological role. Here we report that the SNO-CoA-AKR1A1 system is highly expressed in renal proximal tubules, where it transduces the activity of eNOS in reprogramming intermediary metabolism, thereby protecting kidneys against acute kidney injury. Specifically, deletion of Akr1a1 in mice to reduce SCoR activity increased protein S-nitrosylation, protected against acute kidney injury and improved survival, whereas this protection was lost when Enos (also known as Nos3) was also deleted. Metabolic profiling coupled with unbiased mass spectrometry-based SNO-protein identification revealed that protection by the SNO-CoA-SCoR system is mediated by inhibitory S-nitrosylation of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) through a novel locus of regulation, thereby balancing fuel utilization (through ) with redox protection (through the pentose phosphate shunt). Targeted deletion of PKM2 from mouse proximal tubules recapitulated precisely the protective and mechanistic effects of S-nitrosylation in Akr1a1 mice, whereas Cys-mutant PKM2, which is refractory to S-nitrosylation, negated SNO-CoA bioactivity. Our results identify a physiological function of the SNO-CoA-SCoR system in mammals, describe new regulation of renal metabolism and of PKM2 in differentiated tissues, and offer a novel perspective on kidney injury with therapeutic implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511554>A genome-wide screen for human salicylic acid (SA)-binding proteins reveals targets through which SA may influence development of various diseases.</a></h2><p>Salicylic acid (SA) is the major metabolite and active ingredient of aspirin; both compounds reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. Despite over a century of research, aspirin/SA's mechanism(s) of action is still only partially understood. Here we report the results of a genome-wide, high-throughput screen to identify potential SA-binding proteins (SABPs) in human HEK293 cells. Following photo-affinity crosslinking to 4-azidoSA and immuno-selection with an anti-SA antibody, approximately 2,000 proteins were identified. Among these, 95 were enriched more than 10-fold. Pathway enrichment analysis with these 95 candidate SABPs (cSABPs) revealed possible involvement of SA in multiple biological pathways, including (i) , (ii) cytoskeletal assembly and/or signaling, and (iii) NF-κB-mediated immune signaling. The two most enriched cSABPs, which corresponded to the glycolytic enzymes alpha-enolase (ENO1) and pyruvate kinase isozyme  (PKM2), were assessed for their ability to bind SA and SA's more potent derivative amorfrutin B1 (amoB1).

Radiobiological studies were performed at the molecular and cellular levels to provide insights into DNA damage and repair, and the apoptosis mechanism of cells that were exposed to different doses of X-ray irradiation (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy). Evidence of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA double strand breaks (DSB), cellular apoptosis, G2/M phase proportion and inhibition of cell proliferation were observed following irradiation. Differences in the ROS amount and apoptotic percentages of cells between the 2 and 4 Gy groups were insignificant. Compared with 0 Gy, the expression of the apoptosis suppression protein B-cell lymphoma-2 was decreased following at increased irradiation doses. However, apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), caspase-9 and BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid) were elevated following irradiation, compared with the control group (0 Gy). Furthermore, the expression levels of Bax in the 6, 8, 10 and 12.5 Gy groups were significantly increased, compared with the other groups. Caspase-9 expression with 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy were increased compared with other groups, and the Bid levels with 6 and 8 Gy were also increased compared with other groups. G2/M phase arrest was associated with the increase of checkpoint kinase 1 and reduction of cyclin dependent kinase 1. DNA damage repair was associated with the protein Ku70 in the 2, 8, 10, 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy groups were less than other group. Compared with other group, Ku80 levels were reduced in the 6 and 8 Gy groups, and Rad51 levels were reduced in the 2, 8 and 10 Gy groups. The expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α, c-Myc and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) demonstrated an increasing trend following irradiation in a dose-dependent manner, but the expression of pyruvate kinase , in the 2-10 Gy irradiation groups, and GLUT1, in the 12.5, 15 and 20 Gy irradiation groups, were reduced, compared with the other groups. Considering the DNA damage repair and apoptosis mechanisms at molecular and cellular levels, it was concluded that 2, 6, 8 and 10 Gy may be the optimal fractional dose that can promote cell apoptosis, and inhibit DNA damage repair and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205544>AMPK Inhibition Suppresses the Malignant Phenotype of Pancreatic Cancer Cells in Part by Attenuating Aerobic .</a></h2><p>Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive tumor characterized by enhanced aerobic . AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is identified as a well-known regulator of , plays an essential role in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we aim to explore the function of AMPK in pancreatic cancer cells and attempt to clarify the possible underlying mechanism. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed that elevated AMPK expression highly correlated with lower median survival time. In an  study, inhibition of AMPK blocked the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of four cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia. Additionally, AMPK suppression led to cell cycle arrest and remarkably induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the lactic acid content, ATP content, and the glucose consumption rate were significantly reduced in all four cell lines under different conditions, accompanied by down-regulation of glycolytic biomarkers including phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR)/total mTOR (t-mTOR), Pyruvate kinase  (Pkm2), and Hexokinase 2 (Hk2). Collectively, our data showed that AMPK activation is highly involved in pancreatic cancer progression and exerts its pro-tumorigenic functions partly by sustaining glycolytic activity. Hence, AMPK is expected to be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29468140>Posttranslational Modifications of Pyruvate Kinase : Tweaks that Benefit Cancer.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells rewire metabolism to meet biosynthetic and energetic demands. The characteristic increase in , i.e., Warburg effect, now considered as a hallmark, supports cancer in various ways. To attain such metabolic reshuffle, cancer cells preferentially re-express the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2, -PK) and alter its quaternary structure to generate less-active PKM2 dimers. The relatively inactive dimers cause the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates that are redirected into anabolic pathways. In addition, dimeric PKM2 also benefits cancer cells through various non-glycolytic moonlight functions, such as gene transcription, protein kinase activity, and redox balance. A large body of data have shown that several distinct posttranslation modifications (PTMs) regulate PKM2 in a way that benefits cancer growth, e.g., formation of PKM2 dimers. This review discusses the recent advancements in our understanding of various PTMs and the benefits they impart to the sustenance of cancer. Understanding the PTMs in PKM2 is crucial to assess their therapeutic potential and to design novel anticancer strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31303531>PKM2 upregulation promotes malignancy and indicates poor prognosis for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Although pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) has been shown to be among the crucial enzymes that regulate aerobic  in multiple tumour cells, its role in the treatment and prognosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains unclear. This study primarily aimed to determine whether the expression status of PKM2 is potentially associated with the clinical outcomes of ICC.PKM2 expression was evaluated in ICC cell lines and tissues via real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence assays, and Western blot, and its prognostic value was determined according to its impact on the overall survival of patients.We found that PKM2 is highly expressed in ICC, and this was correlated with patient survival. Moreover, we found that PKM2 knockdown could considerably inhibit ICC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro.PKM2 was overexpressed in ICC, and it may regulate proliferation, invasion, and migration and lead to poor prognosis. Thus, PKM2 might be a potential independent prognostic factor for ICC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It has been well documented that butyrate, by serving as an energetic metabolite, promotes the proliferation of normal colonocytes while, by serving as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, epigenetically suppressing the proliferation of cancerous counterparts undergoing the Warburg effect. However, how butyrate interrupts the metabolism of colorectal cancer cells and ultimately leads to the suppression of cell proliferation remains unclear. Here, we employed a metabolomics-proteomics combined approach to explore the link between butyrate-mediated proliferation arrest and cell metabolism. A metabolomics study revealed a remodeled metabolic profile with pronounced accumulation of pyruvate, decreased glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate and reduced levels of nucleotides in butyrate-treated HCT-116 cells. Supplementation of key metabolite intermediates directly affected cancer-cell metabolism and modulated the suppressive effect of butyrate in HCT-116 cells. By a Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS)-based quantitative proteomics approach, we revealed the  isoform of a pyruvate kinase, PKM2, as a direct binding target of butyrate. Butyrate activates PKM2 via promoting its dephosphorylation and tetramerization and thereby reprograms the metabolism of colorectal cancer cells, inhibiting the Warburg effect while favoring energetic metabolism. Our study thus provides a mechanistic link between PKM2-induced metabolic remodeling and the antitumorigenic function of butyrate and demonstrates a widely applicable approach to uncovering unknown protein targets for small molecules with biological functions.© 2018 Li et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572723>Thermodynamics in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Interplay Between Canonical WNT/Beta-Catenin Pathway-PPAR Gamma, Energy Metabolism and Circadian Rhythms.</a></h2><p>Entropy production rate is increased by several metabolic and thermodynamics abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Irreversible processes are quantified by changes in the entropy production rate. This review is focused on the opposing interactions observed in NDs between the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway and PPAR gamma and their metabolic and thermodynamic implications. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, WNT/beta-catenin pathway is upregulated, whereas PPAR gamma is downregulated. In Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, WNT/beta-catenin pathway is downregulated while PPAR gamma is upregulated. The dysregulation of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway is responsible for the modification of thermodynamics behaviors of metabolic enzymes. Upregulation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway leads to aerobic , named Warburg effect, through activated enzymes, such as glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactic dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Downregulation of WNT/beta-catenin pathway leads to oxidative stress and cell death through inactivation of Glut, PKM2, PDK1, MCT-1, LDH-A but activation of PDH. In addition, in NDs, PPAR gamma is dysregulated, whereas it contributes to the regulation of several key circadian genes. NDs show many dysregulation in the mediation of circadian clock genes and so of circadian rhythms. Thermodynamics rhythms operate far-from-equilibrium and partly regulate interactions between WNT/beta-catenin pathway and PPAR gamma. In NDs, metabolism, thermodynamics and circadian rhythms are tightly interrelated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29051480>NOX4 functions as a mitochondrial energetic sensor coupling cancer metabolic reprogramming to drug resistance.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanisms that couple  to cancer drug resistance remain unclear. Here we identify an ATP-binding motif within the NADPH oxidase isoform, NOX4, and show that ATP directly binds and negatively regulates NOX4 activity. We find that NOX4 localizes to the inner mitochondria membrane and that subcellular redistribution of ATP levels from the mitochondria act as an allosteric switch to activate NOX4. We provide evidence that NOX4-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibits P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-dependent acetylation and lysosomal degradation of the pyruvate kinase- isoform (PKM2). Finally, we show that NOX4 silencing, through PKM2, sensitizes cultured and ex vivo freshly isolated human-renal carcinoma cells to drug-induced cell death in xenograft models and ex vivo cultures. These findings highlight yet unidentified insights into the molecular events driving cancer evasive resistance and suggest modulation of ATP levels together with cytotoxic drugs could overcome drug-resistance in glycolytic cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242420>Metallothionein 3 Controls the Phenotype and Metabolic Programming of Alternatively Activated Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Alternatively activated () macrophages promote wound healing but weaken antimicrobial defenses. The mechanisms that enforce macrophage divergence and dictate the phenotypic and metabolic characteristics of  macrophages remain elusive.

MT3 was requisite for metabolic reprograming in IL-4-stimulated macrophages or M(IL-4) macrophages to promote mitochondrial respiration and suppress . MT3 fostered an M(IL-4) phenotype, suppressed hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α activation, and thwarted the emergence of a proinflammatory M1 program in macrophages. MT3 deficiency augmented macrophage plasticity, resulting in enhanced interferon γ (IFNγ) responsiveness and a dampened M(IL-4) phenotype. Thus, MT3 programs the phenotype and metabolic fate of M(IL-4) macrophages.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466915>Dysregulated miR-125a promotes angiogenesis through enhanced .</a></h2><p>Although neoangiogenesis is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory arthritis and many cancers, therapeutic agents targeting the vasculature remain elusive. Here we identified miR-125a as an important regulator of angiogenesis.MiRNA levels were quantified in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) synovial-tissue by RT-PCR and compared to macroscopic synovial vascularity. HMVEC were transfected with anti-miR-125a and angiogenic mechanisms quantified using tube formation assays, transwell invasion chambers, wound repair, RT-PCR and western blot. Real-time analysis of EC metabolism was assessed using the XF-24 Extracellular-Flux Analyzer. Synovial expression of metabolic markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining. MiR-125a CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-out zebrafish were generated and vascular development assessed. Finally, glycolytic blockade using 3PO, which inhibits Phosphofructokinase-fructose-2,6-bisphophatase 3 (PFKFB3), was assessed in miR-125a-/- ECs and zebrafish embryos.MiR-125a is significantly decreased in PsA synovium and inversely associated with macroscopic vascularity. In-vivo, CRISPR/cas9 miR-125a zebrafish displayed a hyper-branching phenotype. In-vitro, miR-125a inhibition promoted EC tube formation, branching, migration and invasion, effects paralleled by a shift in their metabolic profile towards . This metabolic shift was also observed in the PsA synovial vasculature where increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), PFKFB3 and Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (PKM2) were demonstrated. Finally, blockade of PFKFB3 significantly inhibited anti-miR-125a-induced angiogenic mechanisms in-vitro, paralleled by normalisation of vascular development of CRISPR/cas9 miR-125a zebrafish embryos.Our results provide evidence that miR-125a deficiency enhances angiogenic processes through metabolic reprogramming of endothelial cells.

However, its role in cancer metastasis was rarely understood. Cantharidin a natural compound from an arthropod insect cantharis exerts potent anticancer activity. Here we found cantharidin possesses significant anti-metastatic activity on breast cancer dependent on inhibition of aerobic . Cantharidin indicates significant inhibition on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, angiogenesis , and inhibits breast cancer cells metastasizing to liver and lung . Subsequent results revealed that cantharidin decreases the extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) but increases the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in high metastatic cells, leading to suppression of aerobic . This was considered to be due to inhibiting the activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) and further blocking pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) translocation in nucleus. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and L-cysteine can significantly reverse cantharidin inhibition on breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and PKM2 translocation. Furthermore, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) forming a metabolic loop with PKM2 is downregulated, as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the regulator of the glycolytic loop. Totally, cantharidin inhibits the PKM2 nuclear translocation and breaks GLUT1/PKM2 glycolytic loop, resulting in aerobic  transformation to oxidation and subsequent reversing the metastases in breast cancer. Based on inhibiting multi signals mediated aerobic , cantharidin could be prospectively used for prevention of metastasis in breast cancer patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554233>Vacuolar H-ATPase Subunit V0C Regulates Aerobic  of Esophageal Cancer Cells via PKM2 Signaling.</a></h2><p>The vacuolar H-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subunit V0C (ATP6V0C), a proton-conducting, pore-forming subunit of vacuolar ATPase, maintains pH homeostasis and induces organelle acidification. The intracellular and extracellular pH of cancer cells affects their growth; however, the role of ATP6V0C in highly invasive esophageal cancer cells (ECCs) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the role of ATP6V0C in glucose metabolism in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion attenuated ECC proliferation, invasion, and suppressed glucose metabolism, as indicated by reduced glucose uptake and decreased lactate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in cells. Consistent with this, expression of glycolytic enzyme and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were also decreased by ATP6V0C knockdown. Mechanistically, ATP6V0C interacted with pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2), a key regulator of  in ECCs. The ATP6V0C depletion reduced PKM2 phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 105 (Tyr), leading to inhibition of nuclear translocation of PKM2.

The aim of the current study was to elucidate the role of PKM2 in pancreatic cancer progression and the potential of PKM2 as a therapeutic target. In this study, we observed that PKM2 is highly expressed in patients with pancreatic cancer and is correlated to survival. Elevated PKM2 expression promoted cell proliferation, migration and tumor formation. The inhibition of cell growth by silencing PKM2 is caused by impairment of the autophagy process. To test the potential effects of downregulating PKM2 as a clinical therapy, we constructed an RGD-modified oncolytic adenovirus containing shPKM2 (O.R.shPKM2) to knock down PKM2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Cells transduced with O.R.shPKM2 exhibited decreased cell viability, and, in a PANC-1 xenograft model, intratumoral injection of O.R.shPKM2 resulted in reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, O.R.shPKM2 induced apoptosis and impaired autophagy in PANC-1 cells. Our results suggested that targeting PKM2 with an oncolytic adenovirus produced a strong antitumor effect, and that this strategy could broaden the therapeutic options for treating pancreatic cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193922>Dietary exacerbation of metabolic stress leads to accelerated hepatic carcinogenesis in glycogen storage disease type Ia.</a></h2><p>Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa) is a rare genetic disease associated with glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes and steatosis. With age, most adult patients with GSDIa develop hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), which can progress to hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In this study, we characterized metabolic reprogramming and cellular defense alterations during tumorigenesis in the liver of hepatocyte-specific G6pc deficient (L.G6pc) mice, which develop all the hepatic hallmarks of GSDIa.Liver metabolism and cellular defenses were assessed at pretumoral (four months) and tumoral (nine months) stages in L.G6pc mice fed a high fat/high sucrose (HF/HS) diet.In response to HF/HS diet, hepatocarcinogenesis was highly accelerated since 85% of L.G6pc mice developed multiple hepatic tumors after nine months, with 70% classified as HCA and 30% as HCC. Tumor development was associated with high expression of malignancy markers of HCC, i.e. alpha-fetoprotein, glypican 3 and β-catenin. In addition, L.G6pc livers exhibited loss of tumor suppressors. Interestingly, L.G6pc steatosis exhibited a low-inflammatory state and was less pronounced than in wild-type livers. This was associated with an absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis, while HCA/HCC showed a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the absence of TGF-β1 increase. In HCA/HCC,  was characterized by a marked expression of PK-, decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS and a decrease of pyruvate entry in the mitochondria, confirming a "Warburg-like" phenotype. These metabolic alterations led to a decrease in antioxidant defenses and autophagy and chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress in L.G6pc livers and tumors. Interestingly, autophagy was reactivated in HCA/HCC.The metabolic remodeling in L.G6pc liver generates a preneoplastic status and leads to a loss of cellular defenses and tumor suppressors that facilitates tumor development in GSDI.Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD1a) is a rare metabolic disease characterized by hypoglycemia, steatosis, excessive glycogen accumulation and tumor development in the liver. In this study, we have observed that GSDIa livers reprogram their metabolism in a similar way to cancer cells, which facilitates tumor formation and progression, in the absence of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, hepatic burden due to overload of glycogen and lipids in the cells leads to a decrease in cellular defenses, such as autophagy, which could further promote tumorigenesis in the case of GSDI.Copyright © 2018 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

It is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for the developed world. Hyperglycemia and genetics are major causal factors for the initiation and progression of DN. Multiple abnormalities in glucose and mitochondrial metabolism induced by diabetes likely contribute to the severity of DN. Recent clinical studies in people with extreme duration of T1DM (> 50 years, Joslin Medalist Study) have supported the importance of endogenous protective factors to neutralize the toxic effects of hyperglycemia on renal and other vascular tissues. Using renal glomeruli from these patients (namely Medalists) with and without DN, we have shown the importance of increased glycolytic flux in decreasing the accumulation of glucose toxic metabolites, improving mitochondrial function, survival of glomerular podocytes, and reducing glomerular pathology.

Our previous study revealed a novel role of exogenous GAPDH in the amelioration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis-related, severe acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Here, we show the effect of extracellular GAPDH on the physiological functions of macrophages, which play an important role in the onset of sepsis and ALI. GAPDH has no effect on cell viability, while it strongly suppressed cell adhesion, spreading, and phagocytic function of LPS-stimulated macrophages. GAPDH treatment significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while it induced interleukin (IL)-10 production from LPS-stimulated macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that heat inactivation of GAPDH lost its immunomodulatory activity. Correspondingly, NADH significantly inhibited TNF-α and enhanced IL-10 production with elevation of both M1/ macrophage markers. These data suggest that extracellular GAPDH induces intermediate M1/ macrophages for termination of inflammation, partly through its enzyme activity for generation of NADH.© 2018 BioFactors, 44(6):597-608, 2018.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764507>Aldolase A promotes proliferation and G/S transition via the EGFR/MAPK pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.</a></h2><p>Our previous study demonstrated that aldolase A (ALDOA) is overexpressed in clinical human lung squamous cell carcinoma and that ALDOA promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis.

Here we address the in vivo significance of Sphingosine Kinase -2 in renal inflammation/fibrosis in response to unilateral ureteral obstruction using both genetic and pharmacological strategies. Obstructed kidneys of Sphk2-/- mice showed reduced renal damage and diminished levels of the renal injury markers TGFβ1 and αSMA when compared to wild type controls. We found a consistently significant increase in anti-inflammatory () macrophages in obstructed Sphk2-/- kidneys by flow cytometry and a decrease in mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines, MCP1, TNFα, CXCL1 and ILβ1, suggesting an anti-inflammatory bias in the absence of Sphk2. Indeed, metabolic profiling showed that the pro-inflammatory glycolytic pathway is largely inactive in Sphk2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with the -promoting cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 demonstrated that macrophages lacking Sphk2 polarized more efficiently to the  phenotype than wild type cells. Bone marrow transplant studies indicated that expression of Sphk2-/- on either the hematopoietic or parenchymal cells did not fully rescue the pro-healing phenotype, confirming that both infiltrating -macrophages and the kidney microenvironment contribute to the damaging Sphk2 effects. Importantly, obstructed kidneys from mice treated with an Sphk2 inhibitor recapitulated findings in the genetic model. These results demonstrate that reducing Sphk2 activity by genetic or pharmacological manipulation markedly decreases inflammatory and fibrotic responses to obstruction, resulting in diminished renal injury and supporting Sphk2 as a novel driver of the pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659108>Myeloid -Deficient Murine Model Revealed Macrophage Activation and Metabolic Phenotype Are Fueled by GLUT1.</a></h2><p>Macrophages (MΦs) are heterogeneous and metabolically flexible, with metabolism strongly affecting immune activation. A classic response to proinflammatory activation is increased flux through  with a downregulation of oxidative metabolism, whereas alternative activation is primarily oxidative, which begs the question of whether targeting glucose metabolism is a viable approach to control MΦ activation. We created a murine model of myeloid-specific glucose transporter GLUT1 () deletion. Bone marrow-derived MΦs (BMDM) from  mice failed to uptake glucose and demonstrated reduced  and pentose phosphate pathway activity. Activated BMDMs displayed elevated metabolism of oleate and glutamine, yet maximal respiratory capacity was blunted in MΦ lacking GLUT1, demonstrating an incomplete metabolic reprogramming.  BMDMs displayed a mixed inflammatory phenotype with reductions of the classically activated pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, yet less oxidative stress.  BMDMs had reduced proinflammatory metabolites, whereas metabolites indicative of alternative activation-such as ornithine and polyamines-were greatly elevated in the absence of GLUT1. Adipose tissue MΦs of lean  mice had increased alternative -like activation marker mannose receptor CD206, yet lack of GLUT1 was not a critical mediator in the development of obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation. However,  mice lacking myeloid GLUT1 developed unstable atherosclerotic lesions. Defective phagocytic capacity in  BMDMs may have contributed to unstable atheroma formation. Together, our findings suggest that although lack of GLUT1 blunted  and the pentose phosphate pathway, MΦ were metabolically flexible enough that inflammatory cytokine release was not dramatically regulated, yet phagocytic defects hindered MΦ function in chronic diseases.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30430110>High Expression of Glycolytic Genes in Cirrhosis Correlates With the Risk of Developing Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>A marked increase in the rate of  is a key event in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the main type of primary liver cancer.

An XF  stress test showed that aerobic  was augmented up to the cancer cell's maximal glycolytic capacity in CK2α cells. Molecular analysis revealed that pyruvate kinase M1 was downregulated and pyruvate kinase  was nuclear localized in CK2α cells. Consequently, the expression and activity of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were upregulated. Treatment with FX11-a specific LDHA inhibitor-or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated knockout of LDHA inhibited the CK2-driven proliferation of cancer cells. We conclude that CK2 augments the Warburg effect, resulting in increased proliferation of cancer cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28614718>SIRT5 Desuccinylates and Activates Pyruvate Kinase  to Block Macrophage IL-1β Production and to Prevent DSS-Induced Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>LPS-activated macrophages undergo a metabolic shift from dependence on mitochondria-produced ATP to reliance on aerobic , where PKM2 is a critical determinant. Here, we show that PKM2 is a physiological substrate of SIRT5 and that SIRT5-regulated hypersuccinylation inhibits the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2 by promoting its tetramer-to-dimer transition. Moreover, a succinylation-mimetic PKM2 K311E mutation promotes nuclear accumulation and increases protein kinase activity. Furthermore, we show that SIRT5-dependent succinylation promotes PKM2 entry into nucleus, where a complex of PKM2-HIF1α is formed at the promoter of IL-1β gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Activation of PKM2 using TEPP-46 attenuates Sirt5-deficiency-mediated IL-1β upregulation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Finally, we find that Sirt5-deficient mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis, which is associated with Sirt5 deficiency prompted PKM2 hypersuccinylation and boosted IL-1β production. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism by which SIRT5 suppresses the pro-inflammatory response in macrophages at least in part by regulating PKM2 succinylation, activity, and function.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

However, the regulatory role of Dppa4 in non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological function of Dppa4 in NSCLC and its underlying mechanism of action. Dppa4 expression was measured in NSCLC tissue samples and cell lines, and its effect on cell proliferation and the expression of glycolytic enzymes was determined. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of Dppa4‑induced alterations in  were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed to analyze the prognostic significance of clinicopathological characteristics. Dppa4 was found to be highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, it was observed that Dppa4 was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation and TNM stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified Dppa4 expression and clinical stage as prognostic factors for NSCLC patients. Kaplan‑Meier analysis further revealed that patients with lower Dppa4 expression exhibited a better prognosis. In NSCLC cells, Dppa4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, while Dppa4 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, which was likely mediated by  promotion. Dppa4 knockdown had no evident effect on the majority of enzymes examined; however, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT‑4) and pyruvate kinase isozyme  were significantly upregulated, and hexokinase II (HK‑II) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) were downregulated following Dppa4 knockdown. By contrast, Dppa4 overexpression resulted in downregulation of GLUT‑4, and upregulation of HK‑II, enolase and LDHB, whereas it had no effect on other enzymes. Since the most evident effect was observed on LDHB, further functional experiments demonstrated that this enzyme reversed the promoting effects of Dppa4 in NSCLC. In conclusion, Dppa4 promotes NSCLC progression, partly through  by LDHB. Thus, the Dppa4‑LDHB axis critically contributes to  in NSCLC cells, thereby promoting NSCLC development and progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741686>GPR55 receptor antagonist decreases glycolytic activity in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell line and tumor xenografts.</a></h2><p>The Warburg effect is a predominant metabolic pathway in cancer cells characterized by enhanced glucose uptake and its conversion to l-lactate and is associated with upregulated expression of HIF-1α and activation of the EGFR-MEK-ERK, Wnt-β-catenin, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. (R,R')-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol ((R,R')-MNF) significantly reduces proliferation, survival, and motility of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells through inhibition of the GPR55 receptor. We examined (R,R')-MNF's effect on  in PANC-1 cells and tumors. Global NMR metabolomics was used to elucidate differences in the metabolome between untreated and (R,R')-MNF-treated cells. LC/MS analysis was used to quantify intracellular concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate, carnitine, and l-lactate. Changes in target protein expression were determined by Western blot analysis. Data was also obtained from mouse PANC-1 tumor xenografts after administration of (R,R')-MNF. Metabolomics data indicate that (R,R')-MNF altered fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and amino acid metabolism and increased intracellular concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and carnitine while reducing l-lactate content. The cellular content of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and hexokinase 2 was reduced consistent with diminished PI3K-AKT signaling and glucose metabolism. The presence of the GLUT8 transporter was established and found to be attenuated by (R,R')-MNF. Mice treated with (R,R')-MNF had significant accumulation of l-lactate in tumor tissue relative to vehicle-treated mice, together with reduced levels of the selective l-lactate transporter MCT4. Lower intratumoral levels of EGFR, pyruvate kinase , β-catenin, hexokinase 2, and p-glycoprotein were also observed. The data suggest that (R,R')-MNF reduces  in PANC-1 cells and tumors through reduced expression and function at multiple controlling sites in the glycolytic pathway.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171973>Dauricine upregulates the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells: Role of repressing  via miR-199a:HK2/PKM2 modulation.</a></h2><p>Dauricine (Dau) is a natural alkaloid exhibiting anti-proliferative activity against several different types of malignant cell. However, effects of Dau on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that Dau elevated the sensitivities of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic reagents, including cisplatin, sorafenib, and isoliensinine. Moreover, Dau promoted apoptosis of HCC cells triggered by these chemotherapeutic reagents. Consistently, in a xenograft mouse model, Dau sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib. In HCC cells, Dau dose-dependently inhibited glucose  and increased oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Dau downregulated the expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). HK2 and PKM2 can be directly targeted by miR-199a. Dau dose-dependently increased miR-199a expression in HCC cells. Transfection of anti-miR-199a abrogated Dau-mediated suppression of HK2 and PKM2. Dau-induced metabolic shift was thereby severely crippled by anti-miR-199a. In addition, the incremental activity of Dau on sorafenib sensitivity of HCC cells was diminished in response to the transfection of anti-miR-199a. Taken together, our findings provided novel insights into the impact of Dau on HCC cells and supported considering Dau as an adjuvant reagent in the clinical treatment of HCC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultrastructural and biochemical evidence shows that GBM cells exhibit mitochondrial abnormalities incompatible with energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Under such conditions, the mitochondrial F0-F1 ATP synthase operates in reverse at the expense of ATP hydrolysis to maintain a moderate membrane potential. Moreover, expression of the dimeric  isoform of pyruvate kinase in GBM results in diminished ATP output, precluding a significant ATP production from . If ATP synthesis through both  and OxPhos was impeded, then where would GBM cells obtain high-energy phosphates for growth and invasion? Literature is reviewed suggesting that the succinate-CoA ligase reaction in the tricarboxylic acid cycle can substantiate sufficient ATP through mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation (mSLP) to maintain GBM growth when OxPhos is impaired. Production of high-energy phosphates would be supported by glutaminolysis-a hallmark of GBM metabolism-through the sequential conversion of glutamine → glutamate → alpha-ketoglutarate → succinyl CoA → succinate. Equally important, provision of ATP through mSLP would maintain the adenine nucleotide translocase in forward mode, thus preventing the reverse-operating F0-F1 ATP synthase from depleting cytosolic ATP reserves. Because glucose and glutamine are the primary fuels driving the rapid growth of GBM and most tumors for that matter, simultaneous restriction of these two substrates or inhibition of mSLP should diminish cancer viability, growth, and invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30266938>Shikonin Inhibits Tumor Growth in Mice by Suppressing Pyruvate Kinase -mediated Aerobic .</a></h2><p>Shift metabolism profile from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic  (Warburg effect) is a key for tumor cell growth and metastasis. Therefore, suppressing the tumor aerobic  shows a great promise in anti-tumor therapy. In the present study, we study the role of shikonin, a naphthoquinone isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Lithospermum, in inhibiting tumor aerobic  and thus tumor growth. We found that shikonin dose-dependently inhibited glucose uptake and lactate production in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and B16 melanoma cells, confirming the inhibitory effect of shikonin on tumor aerobic . Treatment of shikonin also decreased tumor cell ATP production. Furthermore, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) inhibitor or activator respectively altered the effect of shikonin on tumor cell aerobic , suggesting that suppression of cell aerobic  by shikonin is through decreasing PKM2 activity. Western blot analysis confirmed that shikonin treatment reduced tumor cell PKM2 phosphorylation though did not reduce total cellular PKM2 level. In vitro assay also showed that shikonin treatment significantly promoted tumor cell apoptosis compared to untreated control cells. Finally, when mice implanted with B16 cells were administered with shikonin or control vehicle, only shikonin treatment significantly decreased B16 tumor cell growth. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that shikonin inhibits tumor growth in mice by suppressing PKM2-mediated aerobic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343107>Beta-elemene inhibits breast cancer metastasis through blocking pyruvate kinase  dimerization and nuclear translocation.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), playing a central role in regulating aerobic , was considered as a promising target for cancer therapy. However, its role in cancer metastasis is rarely known. Here, we found a tight relationship between PKM2 and breast cancer metastasis, demonstrated by the findings that beta-elemene (β-elemene), an approved drug for complementary cancer therapy, exerted distinct anti-metastatic activity dependent on PKM2. The results indicated that β-elemene inhibited breast cancer cell migration, invasion in vitro as well as metastases in vivo. β-Elemene further inhibited the process of aerobic  and decreased the utilization of glucose and the production of pyruvate and lactate through suppressing pyruvate kinase activity by modulating the transformation of dimeric and tetrameric forms of PKM2. Further analysis revealed that β-elemene suppressed aerobic  by blocking PKM2 nuclear translocation and the expression of EGFR, GLUT1 and LDHA by influencing the expression of importin α5. Furthermore, the effect of β-elemene on migration, invasion, PKM2 transformation, and nuclear translocation could be reversed in part by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and L-cysteine. Taken together, tetrameric transformation and nuclear translocation of PKM2 are essential for cancer metastasis, and β-elemene inhibited breast cancer metastasis via blocking aerobic  mediated by dimeric PKM2 transformation and nuclear translocation, being a promising anti-metastatic agent from natural compounds.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the mechanisms underlying nucleosome disassembly for gene expression remain elusive. We show here that epidermal growth factor receptor activation results in the binding of the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain to pyruvate kinase -phosphorylated histone H3-T11, leading to K48-linked polyubiquitylation of histone H3 at K4 and subsequent proteasome-dependent protein degradation. In addition, H3 polyubiquitylation induces histone dissociation from chromatin, nucleosome disassembly, and binding of RNA polymerase II to  and  promoter regions for transcription.

One example of metabolic remodeling in cancerous tissue is the upregulation of pyruvate kinase isoenzyme  (PKM2), which is involved in aerobic . Indeed, PKM2 has previously been identified as a tumor biomarker and as a potential target for cancer therapy. Here, the role of PKM2 in the anticancer efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was evaluated in colorectal cancer (CRC).HCT116, SW480 and HT-29 cells were used by transfection with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against PKM2. In response to 5-FU treatment, cellular proliferation was examined, the levels of ATP/ADP ratio were monitored, the intracellular accumulation of 5-FU was measured, and intracellular levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate and lactate were evaluated by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). A CRC subcutaneous tumor model was performed to investigate the effect of PKM2 inhibition on 5-FU efficacy in vivo.Suppression of PKM2 resulted in changes in glucose metabolism, leading to decreased synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Reduced levels of ATP/ADP ratio resulted in the intracellular accumulation of 5-FU, consequently enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of this drug in several CRC cell lines. Furthermore, the enhanced efficacy of 5-FU by simultaneous inhibition of PKM2 was demonstrated in an in vivo HCT116 CRC model.We show that the combination treatment showed superior anticancer efficacy as compared to 5-FU alone.

Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) has been found to be a regulator of , however, the role of PTBP1 in drug resistance remains to be elucidated. Herein, we found that PTBP1 was highly expressed in two drug-resistant colon cancer cell lines, vincristine-resistant HCT-8 cell line (HCT-8/V) and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cell line (HCT116/L-OHP). The levels of glucose consumption and lactate production as well as expression of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) and hexokinase II (HK2) were elevated, while PKM1 level was reduced in HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells when compared with the HCT-8 and HCT116 cells. PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of HCT-8/V and HCT116/L-OHP cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin, and caused reduction in glucose consumption and lactate production. PKM2 expression, but not HK2, was decreased and PKM1 expression level was increased in cells transfected with si-PTBP1. In addition, PTBP1 overexpression significantly induced  and reduced drug sensitivity, whereas the effects were attenuated by si-PKM2. Treatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) also attenuated the effect of PTBP1 overexpression on drug sensitivity.

Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a negative regulator of bioenergetic reprogramming in immune cells and suppresses sepsis development in vivo. Mechanistically, AMPK deficiency increases pyruvate kinase isozyme  (PKM2)-dependent aerobic , which leads to the release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1, a late mediator of lethal systemic inflammation) in macrophages and monocytes. Consequently, activation of AMPK by A-769662 protects whereas depletion of AMPKα in myeloid cells promotes endotoxic shock and polymicrobial sepsis in mice. Additionally, administration of the PKM2 inhibitor shikonin reduces lactate production, HMGB1 release, and septic death in AMPKα-deficient mice.

Regulation of these cell types is a primary goal for achieving efficient cancer immunotherapy. We found that metformin (Met) induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of a K7M2neo osteosarcoma independent of T cells, as growth inhibition of K7M2neo was still observed in wild-type (WT) mice depleted of T cells by antibodies and in SCID; this contrasted with the effect of Met on Meth A fibrosarcoma, which was entirely T-cell-dependent. Moreover, the inhibitory effect seen in SCID was abrogated by anti-CD11b antibody injection. PMN-MDSCs were significantly reduced in both spleens and tumors following Met treatment. In TAMs, production of IL-12 and TNF-α, but not IL-10, became apparent, and elevation of MHC class II with reduction of CD206 was observed, indicating a shift from an - to M1-like phenotype via Met administration. Metabolically, Met treatment decreased basal respiration and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratio of CD11b+ cells in tumors, but not in the spleen. In addition, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and proton leakage in MDSCs and TAMs were consistently observed in tumors. Uptake of both 2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (2-NBDG) and BODIPY® decreased in MDSCs, but only BODIPY® incorporation was decreased in TAMs. Overall, our results suggest that Met redirects the metabolism of CD11b+ cells to lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) while elevating , thereby pushing the microenvironment to a state that inhibits the growth of certain tumors.© The Author(s) 2018.

As crucial rate-limiting enzymes in aerobic  and glutaminolysis, pyruvate kinase  type (PKM2) and kidney-type glutaminase (GLS1) are proposed to carry important implications in colorectal carcinogenesis and drug-resistance. This study aimed to explore the possible association of oxaliplatin-resistance with aerobic /glutaminolysis indexed by PKM2/GLS1 expression. PKM2 and GLS1 expression was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot techniques in CRC cell lines. The abilities of cell formation, kinetics, migration, invasion, survival and apoptosis, as well as permeability glycoprotein (Pgp) expression were inspected before and after knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression. In addition, the influence of knocking-down PKM2/GLS1 expression was evaluated in vivo. Differentiated PKM2 and GLS1 expression in both THC8307 and THC8307/Oxa cell lines was identified. In the THC8307 cell line, PKM2 and GLS1 can accelerate malignant behaviors, increase oxaliplatin-resistance, upregulate Pgp expression, and inhibit cell apoptosis. Contrastingly in the THC8307/Oxa cell line, knockdown of PKM2/GLS1 expression can restrain malignant behaviors, reestablish oxaliplatin-sensitivity, downregulate Pgp expression, and induce cell apoptosis. In xenograft, knockdown of PKM2/GLS1 expression can significantly inhibit tumor growth, reduce Pgp expression, and increase tumor apoptosis. Taken together, the present findings enriched our knowledge by demonstrating a significant association of PKM2 and GLS1 with oxaliplatin-resistance in CRC. We further propose that knockdown of PKM2/GLS1 expression may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy toward effective treatment for CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745857>Differential Expression Patterns of Glycolytic Enzymes and Mitochondria-Dependent Apoptosis in PCOS Patients with Endometrial Hyperplasia, an Early Hallmark of Endometrial Cancer,  and the Impact of Metformin .</a></h2><p>The underlying mechanisms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)-induced endometrial dysfunction are not fully understood, and although accumulating evidence shows that the use of metformin has beneficial effects in PCOS patients, the precise regulatory mechanisms of metformin on endometrial function under PCOS conditions have only been partially explored. To address these clinical challenges, this study aimed to assess the protein expression patterns of glycolytic enzymes, estrogen receptor (ER), and androgen receptor (AR) along with differences in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in PCOS patients with and without endometrial hyperplasia  and to investigate the effects of metformin in PCOS patients with endometrial hyperplasia . Here, we showed that compared to non-PCOS patients and PCOS patients without hyperplasia, the endometria from PCOS patients with hyperplasia had a distinct protein expression pattern of glycolytic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase isozyme  isoform (PKM2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). In PCOS patients with endometrial hyperplasia, increased glandular epithelial cell secretion and infiltrated stromal cells in the glands were associated with decreased PDH immunoreactivity in the epithelial cells. Using endometrial tissues from PCOS patients with hyperplasia, we found that in response to metformin treatment , hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression was decreased, whereas phosphofructokinase (PFK), PKM2, and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression was increased compared to controls. Although there was no change in PDH expression, metformin treatment increased the expression of TFAM and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, our  study showed that while endometrial ERβ expression was no different between non-PCOS and PCOS patients regardless of whether or not hyperplasia was present, ERα and AR protein expression was gradually increased in women with PCOS following the onset of endometrial hyperplasia. Our  study showed that treatment with metformin inhibited ERα expression without affecting ERβ expression.

During diabetes, macrophages and other innate immune cells are known to have a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of various diabetic complications. However, diabetic patients are highly susceptible to bacterial infections, and often have impaired wound healing. The molecular mechanism underlying the paradox of macrophage function in diabetes is not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that macrophage functions are governed by metabolic reprograming. Diabetes is a disorder that affects glucose metabolism; dysregulated macrophage function in diabetes may be related to alterations in their metabolic pathways. In this study, we seek to understand the effect of high glucose exposure on macrophage phenotype and functions.Bone marrow cells were cultured in short or long term high glucose and normal glucose medium; the number and phenotype of bone marrow derived macrophages were not affected by long-term high glucose treatment. Short-term high glucose increased the expression of IL-1β. Long-term high glucose increased the expression of IL-1β and TNFα but reduced the expression of IL-12p40 and nitric oxide production in M1 macrophage. The treatment also increased Arg-1 and IL-10 expression in  macrophages. Phagocytosis and bactericidal activity was reduced in long-term high glucose treated macrophages and peritoneal macrophages from diabetic mice. Long-term high glucose treatment reduced macrophage glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve without affecting mitochondrial ATP production and oxidative respiration.Long-term high glucose sensitizes macrophages to cytokine stimulation and reduces phagocytosis and nitric oxide production, which may be related to impaired glycolytic capacity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971999>Identification of MicroRNA-124 as a Major Regulator of Enhanced Endothelial Cell  in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension via PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein) and Pyruvate Kinase .</a></h2><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by abnormal growth and enhanced  of pulmonary artery endothelial cells.

We hypothesized that in BOECs from patients with PAH, the downregulation of microRNA-124 (miR-124), determined with a tiered systems biology approach, is responsible for increased expression of the splicing factor  (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), resulting in alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms 1 and 2 (PKM1 and 2) and consequently increased PKM2 expression. We questioned whether this alternative regulation plays a critical role in the hyperglycolytic phenotype of PAH endothelial cells.Heritable PAH and idiopathic PAH BOECs recapitulated the metabolic abnormalities observed in pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with idiopathic PAH, confirming a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic .

The results of this study show that epidermal growth factor receptor activation induces pyruvate kinase type  nuclear translocation. To further determine the relationship between pyruvate kinase type  and epidermal growth factor receptor, we analyzed pathological data from mammary glands and performed epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 knockdown to reveal that pyruvate kinase type  is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Lapatinib is a small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, though its effect on pyruvate kinase type  remains elusive. Accordingly, we performed Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and analyzed pathological data from mammary glands, with results suggesting that lapatinib inhibits pyruvate kinase type  expression. We further found that the antitumor drug lapatinib inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by influencing pyruvate kinase type  expression, as based on Cell Counting Kit-8 analyses and pyruvate kinase type  overexpression experiments. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which is a transcription factor-associated cell proliferation and the only transcription factor that interacts with pyruvate kinase type , we performed pyruvate kinase type  knockdown experiments in Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and Human breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 cell lines and examined the effect on levels of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. The results indicate that pyruvate kinase type  regulates Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705) expression. Together with previous reports, our findings show that lapatinib inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by influencing pyruvate kinase type  expression, which results in a reduction in both Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and phosphorylated Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28863345>The Stromal Microenvironment Modulates Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cells.</a></h2><p>Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are replicationally quiescent mature B-cells. In short-term cultures, supporting stromal cells provide a survival advantage to CLL cells by inducing transcription and translation without promoting proliferation. We hypothesized that the stromal microenvironment augments malignant B cells' metabolism to enable the cells to cope with their energy demands for transcription and translation. We used extracellular flux analysis to assess the two major energy-generating pathways, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and , in primary CLL cells in the presence of three different stromal cell lines. OxPhos, measured as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximum respiration capacity, was significantly higher in 28 patients' CLL cells cocultured with bone marrow-derived NK.Tert stromal cells than in CLL cells cultured alone (P = .004 and <.0001, respectively). Similar OCR induction was observed in CLL cells cocultured with -10B4 and HS-5 stromal lines. In contrast, heterogeneous changes in the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of ) were observed in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of CLL cells' metabolomics profile indicated stroma-mediated stimulation of nucleotide synthesis. Quantitation of ribonucleotide pools showed a significant two-fold increase in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells, indicating that the stroma may induce CLL cellular bioenergy and the RNA building blocks necessary for the transcriptional requirement of a prosurvival phenotype. The stroma did not impact the proliferation index (Ki-67 staining) of CLL cells. Collectively, these data suggest that short-term interaction (≤24 hours) with stroma increases OxPhos and bioenergy in replicationally quiescent CLL cells.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), an alternative metabolic pathway that operates parallel to , not only provides key intermediates for biosynthetic reactions but also controls the fate of neural stem/progenitor cells. We have previously shown that glutamate application leads to the induction of neural progenitor cells in mature ex vivo rat retina. In this study, we investigated whether regulation of the PPP might be changed following glutamate treatment of the retina. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP as well as that of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), another enzyme in this pathway, increased in the glutamate-treated retina. Consistent with the fact that both these enzymes generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the amount of NAPDH in the treated retina was significantly higher compared with that in the untreated retina. We also found that both DNA synthesis as well as the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) increased significantly in the glutamate-treated retina. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), a positive transcriptional regulator of PPP enzymes, was up-regulated at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Finally, we found the interaction of HIF-1α with the  isozyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), with this interaction having been shown to contribute to a positive feedback loop in the control of .

We hypothesized that antibiotics cause mammalian mitochondrial damage while causing bacterial lethality. Mitochondrial toxicity of azithromycin in human mammary epithelia MCF-12A and fibroblasts were tested by fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. Gene expression and DNA damage were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. We found azithromycin suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential gradient of MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Ultrastructure exams showed that the antibiotic caused vacuolated and swollen mitochondria with disrupted cristae in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts compared to the morphology of mitochondria in the cells without antibiotic treatment. Fluorescent microscopy also showed azithromycin-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide, after 3 h of culture. The DNA oxidative damage product, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, significantly increased in the media after MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts were cultured in the media containing azithromycin for 24 h. Azithromycin upregulated gene expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (), glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase 2 (), phosphofructokinase 1 (), pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme  (), and glucose transporters in MCF-12A cells and fibroblasts. Lactate production also increased in the culture media. After treatment with azithromycin, healthy MCF-12A and fibroblast cells increased aerobic -the "Warburg Effect"-to generate energy. In summary, azithromycin caused mitochondrial toxicity, ROS overproduction, DNA oxidative damage, upregulation of the  gene, and aerobic  in healthy mammalian cells. Over-usage of antibiotics could contribute to tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration and aggravate existing mitochondria-associated diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532192>Repolarization of  to M1 Macrophages Triggered by Lactate Oxidase Released from Methylcellulose Hydrogel.</a></h2><p>Deregulated proliferation of tumors is generally associated with altered energy metabolism.

In altered cells, metabolic enzymes are modified by the dysregulation of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway. In ASD, the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway is upregulated. We focus this review on the hypothesis of Warburg effect stimulated by the overexpression of the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway in ASD. Upregulation of WNT/β-catenin pathway induces aerobic , named Warburg effect, through activation of glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). The aerobic  consists to a supply of a large part of glucose into lactate regardless of oxygen. Aerobic  is less efficient in terms of ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation because of the shunt of the TCA cycle. Dysregulation of energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation and progression of ASD.

To correlate STS with cancer metabolism, we determined the effects of STS on aerobic . STS overexpression increased cellular levels of lactic acid, the final product of aerobic . Moreover, STS suppressed the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), which represents mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition of STS by the specific inhibitor STX064 recovered STS-induced OCR repression and lactic acid over-production. DHEA, but not DHEA-S, suppressed the OCR level and enhanced lactic acid production. To understand the molecular mechanism of STS-induced cancer metabolism, we measured the expression of glycolytic enzymes hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), which was highly upregulated by STS and DHEA at both protein and mRNA levels. HIF1α is a key mediator of aerobic , and STS enhanced HIF1α promoter activity, mRNA expression, and protein expression. Down-regulation of HIF1α by siRNA suppressed the HK2 and PKM2 expression induced by both STS and DHEA. HIF1α siRNA also recovered the OCR repression and lactic acid over-production induced by both STS and DHEA. To explore the mechanism in vivo, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing STS and found that STS expression was particularly enhanced in the lung. Consistent with our in vitro results, the expression of HIF1α, HK2, and PKM2 was also increased in mouse lung tissues. In conclusion, we suggest that STS may induce aerobic  through enhancing HIF1α expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we developed a guanidine-rich, spherical helical polypeptide (DPP) with multivalency-assisted strong membrane penetrating capability, which mediated effective RNAi against tumor  metabolism to sensitize PTT. ICG was loaded into the internal cavity of DPP, and siRNA against pyruvate kinase  (siPKM2) was condensed by DPP to form positively charged nanocomplexes (NCs). The NCs were further coated with human serum albumin to enhance serum stability, prolong blood circulation, and improve tumor targeting. Due to its multivalent topology, DPP exhibited stronger membrane activity yet lower cytotoxicity than its linear analogue (LPP), thus enabling efficient PKM2 silencing in MCF-7 cells in vitro (~75%) and in vivo (~70%). The PKM2 silencing inhibited tumor  metabolism and further depleted the energy supply for HSPs production, thus overcoming the heat endurance of tumor cells to strengthen ICG-mediated photothermal ablation. Additionally, siPKM2-mediated energy depletion led to tumor cell starvation, which imparted synergistic anti-cancer effect with PTT. This study therefore provides a promising strategy for designing membrane-penetrating siRNA delivery materials, and it renders a unique RNAi-mediated anti-metabolic mechanism in sensitizing PTT and enabling starvation therapy.Copyright © 2019.

The high expression of PKM2 in various solid tumors renders it a potential biomarker of tumorigenesis and tumor invasion, but the expression and role of PKM2 in bladder cancer have not been studied extensively.Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to measure the expression of PKM2, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to determine PKM2 mRNA levels. The relationships between PKM2 expression and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier plots and a Cox proportional hazards regression model.Compared with paired adjacent normal bladder tissues, PKM2 mRNA and protein levels were found to be higher in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) samples by real-time PCR and Western blot. By IHC, high expression of PKM2 was seen in 117 of 215 UCBs (54.4%) and in eight of 90 adjacent normal bladder tissues (8.9%). The expression of PKM2 was significantly associated with grade, stage, and lymph node status (<0.001). In the univariate survival analysis, a significant association between PKM2 expression and shorter patient survival was observed (<0.001).

The Chinese live EIAV vaccine is attenuated from long-term passaging of a highly virulent strain  The parent pathogenic strain (EIAV) induces a host inflammatory storm to cause severe pathological injury of animals. However, the vaccine strain (EIAV) induces a high level of apoptosis to eliminate infected cells. To investigate how these processes are regulated, we performed a comparative proteomics analysis and functional study in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs) and found that the divergent mitochondrial protein expression profiles caused by EIAV strains with different virulence led to disparate mitochondrial function, morphology, and metabolism. This in turn promoted the distinct transformation of macrophage inflammatory polarization and intrinsic apoptosis. In EIAV-infected cells, a high level of  and increased mitochondrial fragmentation were induced, resulting in the M1-polarized proinflammatory-type transformation of macrophages and the subsequent production of a strong inflammatory response. Following infection with EIAV, the infected cells were transformed into -polarized anti-inflammatory macrophages by inhibition of . In this case, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and impairment of the electron transport chain led to increased levels of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. These results correlated with viral pathogenicity loss and may help provide an understanding of the key mechanism of lentiviral attenuation. Following viral infection, the working pattern and function of the cell can be transformed through the impact on mitochondria. It still unknown how the mitochondrial response changes in cells infected with viruses in the process of virulence attenuation. EIAV is the only effective lentiviral vaccine for large-scale use in the world. EIAV is the parent pathogenic strain. Unlike EIAV-induced inflammation storms, EIAV can induce high levels of apoptosis. For the first time, we found that, after the mitochondrial protein expression profile is altered, EIAV-infected cells are transformed into M1-polarized-type macrophages and cause inflammatory injury and that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is activated in EIAV-infected cells. These studies shed light on how the mitochondrial protein expression profile changes between cells infected by pathogenic lentivirus strains and cells infected by attenuated lentivirus strains to drive different cellular responses, especially from inflammation to apoptosis.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058718>PKM2 methylation by CARM1 activates aerobic  to promote tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. Herein we discover that the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), but not the related isoform PKM1, is methylated by co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). PKM2 methylation reversibly shifts the balance of metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic  in breast cancer cells. Oxidative phosphorylation depends on mitochondrial calcium concentration, which becomes critical for cancer cell survival when PKM2 methylation is blocked. By interacting with and suppressing the expression of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsPRs), methylated PKM2 inhibits the influx of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Inhibiting PKM2 methylation with a competitive peptide delivered by nanoparticles perturbs the metabolic energy balance in cancer cells, leading to a decrease in cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. Collectively, the CARM1-PKM2 axis serves as a metabolic reprogramming mechanism in tumorigenesis, and inhibiting PKM2 methylation generates metabolic vulnerability to InsPR-dependent mitochondrial functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30622429>Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Immunometabolism: New Frontiers for Treatment of Metabolic Diseases.</a></h2><p>Maintenance of healthy human metabolism depends on a symbiotic consortium among bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and host eukaryotic cells throughout the human gastrointestinal tract. Microbial communities provide the enzymatic machinery and the metabolic pathways that contribute to food digestion, xenobiotic metabolism, and production of a variety of bioactive molecules. These include vitamins, amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and metabolites, which are essential for the interconnected pathways of , the tricarboxylic acid/Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. Recent studies have been elucidating how nutrients that fuel the metabolic processes impact on the ways immune cells, in particular, macrophages, respond to different stimuli under physiological and pathological conditions and become activated and acquire a specialized function. The two major inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages are controlled through differential consumption of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen. M1 phenotype is triggered by polarization signal from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Th1 proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-, TNF-, and IL-1, or both, whereas  phenotype is triggered by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF, or glucocorticoids. Glucose utilization and production of chemical mediators including ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and NADPH support effector activities of M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis is an imbalance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the production of microbial antigens and metabolites.

It is diverse in different cancers as it reflects different combinations of oncogenic drivers, tumor suppressors, and the microenvironment. Metabolic rewiring is essential to cancer as it enables uncontrolled proliferation and adaptation to the fluctuating availability of nutrients and oxygen caused by poor access to the vasculature due to tumor growth and a foreign microenvironment encountered during metastasis. Increasing evidence now indicates that the metabolic state in cancer cells also plays a causal role in tumor growth and metastasis, for example through the action of oncometabolites, which modulate cell signaling and epigenetic pathways to promote malignancy. In addition to altering the metabolic state in cancer cells, some multifunctional enzymes possess non-metabolic functions that also contribute to cell transformation. Some multifunctional enzymes that are highly expressed in cancer, such as pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), have non-canonical functions that are co-opted by oncogenic signaling to drive proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Other multifunctional enzymes that are frequently downregulated in cancer, such as fructose-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), are tumor suppressors, directly opposing mitogenic signaling via their non-canonical functions. In some cases, the enzymatic and non-canonical roles of these enzymes are functionally linked, making the modulation of non-metabolic cellular processes dependent on the metabolic state of the cell.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28543190>Effects of shRNA-Mediated Silencing of PKM2 Gene on Aerobic , Cell Migration, Cell Invasion, and Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>This study aims to explore the effects of shRNA-mediated silencing on Pyruvate kinase type  (PKM2) gene during aerobic  in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 136 patients diagnosed with qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to detect mRNA and protein expressions of PKM2. CRC cells were divided into a blank, vector, and PKM2-shRNA groups. Hexokinase (HK) and PKM2 activity were both determined by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) coupled colorimetric assay and enzyme coupling rate method. The extracellular lactate concentration was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer and caspase activity was measured using spectrophotometry. The proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of CRC cells were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, transwell assay, and scratch test. Three groups of nude mice were injected with 0.2 mL single-cell suspension from the blank, vector, and PKM2-shRNA groups, respectively. PKM2 protein content in CRC tissues was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. Results showed that the PKM2-shRNA group exhibited significantly lower mRNA and protein expressions of PKM2, decreased PKM2 activity, reduced lactate metabolism level, increased cell apoptosis rate, elevated caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, weakened proliferation, and a reduction in cell invasion and migration ability compared to the vector and blank groups. The optical density (OD) value was lower in the PKM2-shRNA group than in the blank and vector groups. These findings indicate that shRNA-mediated silencing of PKM2 gene promotes apoptosis and inhibits aerobic , proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRC cells. J. Cell.

Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed the protein expression of PKM2 peaking at 24 h after HIE. Double immunofluorescence labeling showed that PKM2 was mainly located in the neurons of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, not in astrocytes or microglia. The increased level of active caspase-3 and the decreased level of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) were consistent with the PKM2 expression.

We demonstrated that Ben directly binds to and blocks PKM2 enzyme activity, leading to inhibition of aerobic  concurrent up-regulation of OXPHOS. Of note, despite PKM2 is very similar to PKM1, Ben does not affect PKM1 enzyme activity. We showed that Ben significantly inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The specificity of Ben was demonstrated by the findings that, suppression of PKM2 expression diminishes the efficacy of Ben in inhibtion of melanoma cell growth; ectopic PKM2 expression in normal cells sensitizes cells to Ben treatment. Interestingly, PKM2 activity and aerobic  are up-regulated in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. As a result, BRAFi-resistant cells exhibit a heightened sensitivity to suppression of PKM2 expression or treatment with Ben both in vitro and in vivo. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the role of PKM2 on the  of osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes is still unclear. In present study, we investigate the function of PKM2 on OA chondrocyte  and the collagen matrix generation in vitro. Results showed that PKM2 was upregulated in OA chondrocytes compared with healthy control chondrocytes. In OA chondrocytes, ATP expression was lower compared with healthy control chondrocytes. Loss-of-function experiment showed that PKM2 knockdown mediated by lentivirus transfection could significantly suppress the glucose consumption and lactate secretion levels and decrease glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), indicating the inhibition of PKM2 knockdown on . Moreover, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that PKM2 knockdown inhibited OA chondrocyte proliferation and promoted the apoptosis. Western blot and immunocytochemical staining showed that PKM2 knockdown downregulated the expression levels of COL2A1 and SOX-9. In summary, our results conclude that PKM2 modulates the  and extracellular matrix generation, providing the vital role of PKM2 on OA pathogenesis and a novel therapeutic target for OA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970216>Exosomes from activated hepatic stellate cells contain GLUT1 and PKM2: a role for exosomes in metabolic switch of liver nonparenchymal cells.</a></h2><p>The mechanism of exosomes derived from activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) involved in liver fibrosis is poorly understood. We previously reported that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif-1) regulated HSC activation, and, therefore, we investigated in current work whether Hif-1 regulates exosome secretion and the metabolic switch of HSCs, thus affecting the metabolism of liver nonparenchymal cells. In this study, the characteristics of exosomes from HSCs were assessed  electron microscopy, Western blot analysis, and acetylcholinesterase activity. Confocal microscopy was used to measure the uptake of exosomes by quiescent HSCs, Kupffer cells (KCs), and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Hif-1α was inhibited  2-ME or specific small interfering RNAs to investigate its role in exosomes derived from HSCs. It was determined that glucose transporter 1 and pyruvate kinase  were increasingly expressed in fibrotic liver samples, cell lysates, and exosomes derived from activated HSCs. Exosomes released from HSCs were associated with activation and glucose uptake of HSCs. Delivery of exosomes from activated HSCs induced  of quiescent HSCs, KCs, and LSECs. Disruption of Hif-1 expression suppressed the  effect delivered by exosomes. Conclusively, our results demonstrated that exosomes secreted by activated HSCs affect the metabolic switch of liver nonparenchymal cells  delivery of -related proteins. These findings represent a novel mechanism that contributes to liver fibrosis and has significant implications for new diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases.-Wan, L., Xia, T., Du, Y., Liu, J., Xie, Y., Zhang, Y., Guan, F., Wu, J., Wang, X., Shi, C.

Expression of the pyruvate kinase (PK)  isoform, rather than the PKM1 isoform, serves important functions in reprogramming the glucose metabolism of cancer cells. Preferential expression of PKM2 is primarily driven by alternative splicing, which is coordinated by a group of splicing factors including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)A1, hnRNPA2 and RNA binding motif containing. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with cancer cell expression of PKM2, instead of PKM1, remain unknown. The mRNA levels of PKM isoform and glucose metabolism were analyzed in CRC cells. The results of the present study indicated that S6 kinase 2 (S6K2) promotes  and growth of CRC cells by regulating alternative splicing of the PKM gene. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that S6K2 phosphorylation of Ser of hnRNPA1 facilitated hnRNPA1 binding to the splicing site of the PKM gene. As a result, cancer cells preferentially expressed the PKM2 isoform, instead of the PKM1 isoform. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Ser of hnRNPA1 was a predictor of poor prognosis for patients with CRC. Therefore, the results of the present study revealed that the phosphorylation of Ser in hnRNPA1 by S6K2 was a novel mechanism underlying glucose metabolic reprogramming, and suggested that S6K2 is a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391063>Long non-coding RNA MACC1-AS1 promoted pancreatic carcinoma progression through activation of PAX8/NOTCH1 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Accumulated evidences have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dysregulated and correlate with the pathophysiological basis of malignant tumors. The objective of this research is to uncover the possible molecular mechanism of MACC1-AS1 regarding the regulation of pancreatic carcinoma (PC) metastasis.lncRNA microarray and qRT-PCR were applied to identify differentially expressed lncRNA profile in PC. The function and role of MACC1-AS1 in PC were assessed via in vitro as well as in vivo assays. Luciferase analyses, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down were performed to determined the underlying MACC1-AS1 mechanisms.Numbers of differentially expressed lncRNAs in PC were identified via lncRNA microarrays, among which MACC1-AS1 was revealed as the most abundant lncRNA. The upregulation of MACC1-AS1 in PC was further confirmed in two expanded PC cohorts, which showed that MACC1-AS1 expression was upregulated in those PC patients with poor survival. Functionally, knockdown of MACC1-AS1 inhibited the proliferation as well as metastasis of PC cells. Meanwhile, MACC1-AS1 upregulated the expression of PAX8 protein, which promoted aerobic  and activated NOTCH1 signaling. Additionally, PAX8 was upregulated in PC tissues, which was correlated with the expression of MACC1-AS1 and the overall survival of PC patients.Together, our findings indicate a critical role of MACC1-AS1/PAX8/NOTCH1 signaling, which may be an alternative treatment target in PC therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263041>Enzyme Kinetic Assay to Measure the Activity of Tumor  Pyruvate Kinase in Breast Cancer Patients.</a></h2><p> type Pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is the key rate-limiting enzyme of , and it mainly exists as a dimer in tumor cells. This study aims to establish an enzyme kinetic assay for serum tumor  pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK), and to evaluate its diagnostic value in breast cancer.The catalytic kinetics of Pyruvate Kinase (PK) was examined. Its allosteric regulation property and Michaelis constant were then measured. Next, the levels of TuM2-PK in serum were detected and compared with results from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, the levels of TuM2-PK among breast cancer patients, post-mastectomy patients, patients with benign breast diseases, and healthy controls were compared.A PK kinetic assay was established in this study. The assay reaction time is 108 seconds, and the optimum pH level is 8.0. In the presence of the allosteric activator fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), the Km of PK for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is 0.15 mmol/L and the Vmax is 330 μmol/min. The levels of TuM2-PK in serum obtained by enzyme kinetics are comparable to the ELISA results. Both assays showed that TuM2-PK in breast cancer patients was increased from stage I to IV. Importantly, TuM2-PK levels were significantly different between early and late-stage breast cancer patients (stage I and stage II vs. stage III and IV), as well as between late-stage and non-malignant patients (<0.05). No statistical difference was found between benign breast disease patients and healthy controls.An enzyme kinetic assay of serum TuM2-PK was successfully established and may be useful for breast cancer diagnosis.© 2017 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183810>Pyruvate Kinase : a Metabolic Bug in Re-Wiring the Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h2><p>Metabolic reprogramming is a newly emerged hallmark of cancer attaining a recent consideration as an essential factor for the progression and endurance of cancer cells. A prime event of this altered metabolism is increased glucose uptake and discharge of lactate into the cells surrounding constructing a favorable tumor niche. Several oncogenic factors help in promoting this consequence including, pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) a rate-limiting enzyme of  in tumor metabolism via exhibiting its low pyruvate kinase activity and nuclear moon-lightening functions to increase the synthesis of lactate and macromolecules for tumor proliferation. Not only its role in cancer cells but also its role in the tumor microenvironment cells has to be understood for developing the small molecules against it which is lacking with the literature till date. Therefore, in this present review, the role of PKM2 with respect to various tumor niche cells will be clarified.

In this study, we investigated the effects of qiliqiangxin (QL) on primary rat CMECs exposed to hypoxia and the underlying mechanisms. Rat CMECs were successfully isolated and passaged to the second generation. CMECs that were pre-treated with QL (0.5 mg/mL) and/or HIF-1α siRNA were cultured in a three-gas hypoxic incubator chamber (5% CO , 1% O , 94% N ) for 12 hours. Firstly, we demonstrated that compared with hypoxia group, QL effectively promoted the proliferation while attenuated the apoptosis, improved mitochondrial function and reduced ROS generation in hypoxic CMECs in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Meanwhile, QL also promoted angiogenesis of CMECs via HIF-1α/VEGF signalling pathway. Moreover, QL improved glucose utilization and metabolism and increased ATP production by up-regulating HIF-1α and a series of -relevant enzymes, including glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Our findings indicate that QL can protect CMECs against hypoxia injury via promoting  in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Lastly, the results suggested that QL-dependent enhancement of HIF-1α protein expression in hypoxic CMECs was associated with the regulation of AMPK/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway, and we speculated that QL also improved HIF-1α stabilization through down-regulating prolyl hydroxylases 3 (PHD3) expression.© 2018 The Authors.

Traditional treatment of ESCC has usually been disappointing. The development of novel therapy is worth investigation. We have previously demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has anticancer effect on esophageal cancer. However, the mechanism has not been completely known. In this present study, we explored the effect of DHA on cancer cell , also known as Warburg effect. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is a key regulatory factor of , and our results showed that it is significantly overexpressed in patients with ESCC and ESCC cell lines. In DHA treatment cells, PKM2 was down-regulated and lactate product and glucose uptake were inhibited. Overexpression of PKM2 by lentiviral transfection abrogated the inhibition effect of DHA. These results suggested that DHA might repress esophageal cancer  partly by down-regulating PKM2 expression. We believe that DHA might be a prospective agent against esophageal cancer.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, modulation of anti-inflammatory and phagocytic properties of microglial cells could represent a novel therapeutic approach. In the present study, we investigated the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from stem cells from the dental pulp of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) on the inflammatory response and functional properties of immortalized human microglial cells. NFκB reporter assays demonstrated that EVs suppressed LPS-induced activation of NFκB signalling pathway in human microglial cells. The effect was similar to that obtained with anti-TLR4 blocking antibody. We also show that EVs differentially affected phagocytic activity of unpolarized (M0) and polarized (M1 and ) microglial cells. EVs induced significant upregulation of phagocytic activity in M0 cells (by 39%), slight decrease in M1 cells, and moderate increase (by 21%) in  cells. The Seahorse XF  Stress Test revealed that EVs induced an immediate and sustained increase of glycolytic activity in M0, M1, and  cells. Interestingly, EVs acted in an inverse dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that EVs can induce glycolytic reprogramming of unpolarized and polarized human microglial cells. In conclusion, our pilot study demonstrates that EVs derived from SHEDs can act as a potent immunomodulators of human microglial cells. These findings could be potentially exploited for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammatory microglia.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31509699>Natural Product Albiziabioside A Conjugated with Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase Inhibitor Dichloroacetate To Induce Apoptosis-Ferroptosis--TAMs Polarization for Combined Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>The reprogramming of energy metabolism is considered to be one of the main characteristics of cancer.

Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type  (PKM2) is crucial for tumor cell aerobic . We established a role for let-7a-5p/Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 signaling in breast cancer cell glucose metabolism. PKM2 depletion via small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits cell proliferation and aerobic  in breast cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) promotes upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A1 expression, hnRNP-A1 binding to pyruvate kinase isoenzyme (PKM) pre messenger RNA, and the subsequent formation of PKM2. This pathway is downregulated by the microRNA let-7a-5p, which functionally targets Stat3, whereas hnRNP-A1 blocks the biogenesis of let-7a-5p to counteract its ability to downregulate the Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 signaling pathway. The downregulation of Stat3/hnRNP-A1/PKM2 by let-7a-5p is verified using a breast cancer. These results suggest that let-7a-5p, Stat3, and hnRNP-A1 form a feedback loop, thereby regulating PKM2 expression to modulate glucose metabolism of breast cancer cells.

Aerobic  is considered the seventh hallmark of cancer. The  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is an important rate-limiting enzyme in glycolytic pathway, and is strongly expressed in several types of cancer. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of regulation of PKM2 is of great value for targeted therapy for lung cancer.Seventy-three lung adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed in our study. The expression levels of PKM2 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissues. The effect of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) on PKM2 expression was investigated using Western blot assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PKM2 SUMO1 modification was determined by in vitro and in vivo SUMOylation assays. F-deoxyglucose uptake and lactate production measurements were conducted to research the levels of . The level of oxidative phosphorylation in cells was determined by cellular oxygen consumption rate measurements. Cell proliferation assays were carried out to confirm the growth ability of tumor cells.PKM2 was overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients based on immunohistochemical staining. Patients with high PKM2 expression had reduced overall survival rate (=0.017) and disease-free survival rate (=0.027) compared with those with low PKM2 expression. SUMO1 promoted PKM2-dependent . Western blotting analysis showed that SUMO1 knockdown in A549 cells led to a significant decrease in PKM2 protein expression. PKM2 could be covalently modified by SUMO1 at K336 (Lys336) site.

A vivid example is aerobic  ('Warburg effect'), which is used not only by cancer cells but also by normal cells that undergo rapid proliferation. A common feature of this metabolic adaptation is a shift in the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) isoform M1 to isoform .

Since anabolic processes are highly energy dependent, the fate of glucose in energy production versus the contribution of carbon in biosynthetic processes needs to be finely synchronised. PKM2 acts to integrate cellular signalling and allosteric regulation of metabolites in order to align metabolic activities with the changing needs of the cell.The central role of PKM2 in directing the flow of carbon between catabolic (ATP-producing) and anabolic processes provides unique opportunities for extending the therapeutic window of currently available and/or novel anti-neoplastic agents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565219>Uterine glycolytic enzyme expression is affected by knockout of different estrogen receptor subtypes.</a></h2><p>The estrogen signaling pathway via nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) α and β is considered to be the master regulator of the cellular glucose metabolism in the uterus. While  animal studies have demonstrated that 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment increases the expression levels and activities of several glycolytic enzymes in the uterus, the specific ER subtype-dependent regulation of key glycolytic enzymes in the uterus has not been experimentally verified.

This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect. Previous studies have revealed that various types of cancer selectively express the pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), and that PKM2 plays a pivotal role in the Warburg effect. Although elevated PKM2 levels have been observed in pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer, little is known about the biological function of PKM2. In this study, in order to examine the expression and role of PKM2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we knocked down PKM2 in PDAC cells by introducing small interfering and short hairpin RNAs, and examined the gene expression profiles in the cells by microarray analysis. We analyzed the energy-producing pathways in the cells by XFe Extracellular Flux Analyzers, and detected intracellular metabolites by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found that the RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKM2 diminished the proliferative, migratory and tumorigenic ability of the PDAC cell-lines. PKM2 knockdown also resulted in lower glycolytic activities and decreased levels of some intracellular metabolites, such as pyruvate and polyamine; however, it led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Microarray analysis revealed the functional association between PKM2 and the expression of genes that drive the cell cycle. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that PKM2 plays an important role in metabolic activities, as well as in the malignancy of PDAC cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537064>Prognostic implications of markers of the metabolic phenotype in human cutaneous melanoma.</a></h2><p>Reprogramming of energy metabolism to enhanced aerobic  has been defined as a hallmark of cancer.To investigate the role of the mitochondrial proteins, β-subunit of the H -ATP synthase (β-F1-ATPase), and heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60), and the glycolytic markers, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), as well as the bioenergetic cellular (BEC) index, in melanoma progression.The expression of energy metabolism proteins was assessed on a set of different melanoma cells representing the natural biological history of the disease: primary cultures of melanocytes, radial (WM35) and vertical (WM278) growth phases, and poorly (C81-61-PA) and highly (C8161-HA) aggressive melanoma cells. Cohorts of 63 melanocytic naevi, 55 primary melanomas and 35 metastases were used; and 113 primary melanoma and 33 metastases were used for validation.The BEC index was significantly reduced in melanoma cells and correlated with their aggressive characteristics. Overexpression of HSP60, GAPDH and PKM2 was detected in melanoma human samples compared with naevi, showing a gradient of increased expression from radial growth phase to metastatic melanoma. The BEC index was also significantly reduced in melanoma samples and correlated with worse overall and disease-free survival; the multivariate Cox analysis showed that the BEC index (hazard ratio 0·64; 95% confidence interval 0·4-1·2) is an independent predictor for overall survival.A profound alteration in the mitochondrial and glycolytic proteins and in the BEC index occurs in the progression of melanoma, which correlates with worse outcome, supporting that the alteration of the metabolic phenotype is crucial in melanoma transformation.© 2018 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900055>pH regulators to target the tumor immune microenvironment in human hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Interfering with tumor metabolism is an emerging strategy for treating cancers that are resistant to standard therapies. Featuring a rapid proliferation rate and exacerbated , hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) creates a highly hypoxic microenvironment with excessive production of lactic and carbonic acids. These metabolic conditions promote disease aggressiveness and cancer-related immunosuppression. The pH regulatory molecules work as a bridge between tumor cells and their surrounding milieu. Herein, we show that the pH regulatory molecules CAIX, CAXII and V-ATPase are overexpressed in the HCC microenvironment and that interfering with their pathways exerts antitumor activity. Importantly, the V-ATPase complex was expressed by -like tumor-associated macrophages. Blocking  V-ATPase activity established a less immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and reversed the mesenchymal features of HCC. Thus, targeting the unique cross-talk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment played by pH regulatory molecules holds promise as a strategy to control HCC progression and to reduce the immunosuppressive pressure mediated by the hypoxic/acidic metabolism, particularly considering the potential combination of this strategy with emerging immune checkpoint-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29545180>Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase-α deficiency leads to metabolic reprogramming in glycogen storage disease type Ia.</a></h2><p>Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC), a key enzyme in endogenous glucose production. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis and long-term complications of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (HCA/HCC). We have shown that hepatic G6Pase-α deficiency-mediated steatosis leads to defective autophagy that is frequently associated with carcinogenesis. We now show that hepatic G6Pase-α deficiency also leads to enhancement of hepatic  and hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) that can contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. The enhanced hepatic  is reflected by increased lactate accumulation, increased expression of many glycolytic enzymes, and elevated expression of c-Myc that stimulates . The increased HMS is reflected by increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and elevated production of NADPH and the reduced glutathione. We have previously shown that restoration of hepatic G6Pase-α expression in G6Pase-α-deficient liver corrects metabolic abnormalities, normalizes autophagy, and prevents HCA/HCC development in GSD-Ia. We now show that restoration of hepatic G6Pase-α expression normalizes both  and HMS in GSD-Ia. Moreover, the HCA/HCC lesions in L-G6pc-/- mice exhibit elevated levels of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) which play an important role in aerobic  and cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, hepatic G6Pase-α deficiency causes metabolic reprogramming, leading to enhanced  and elevated HMS that along with impaired autophagy can contribute to HCA/HCC development in GSD-Ia.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29916308>The mTOR Pathway Regulates PKM2 to Affect  in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a highly prevalent cancer withpoor survival rate and prognosis. Increasing evidence suggests an important role for metabolic regulation in treating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The pyruvate kinase  isoform is a key enzyme in the energy production process, and the upregulation of pyruvate kinase  isoform also plays a crucial role in gene transcription and tumorigenesis. The mammalian target of rapamycin pathway regulates an array of cellular functions, including protein synthesis, metabolism, and cell proliferation. The pyruvate kinase  isoform and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways both affect metabolism in cancers, and evidence also suggests that the mammalian target of rapamycin downstream transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α regulates pyruvate kinase  isoform. We therefore investigated the regulatory mechanism among pyruvate kinase  isoform, mammalian target of rapamycin, and aerobic  in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, hoping to prove that mammalian target of rapamycin pathway regulates pyruvate kinase  isoform to affect  in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Immunohistochemical staining was used to compare pyruvate kinase  isoform and phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin expression in 30 human pathological esophageal squamous cell carcinoma sections and 30 nontumoral esophageal tissues. Short hairpin RNA was used to inhibit pyruvate kinase  isoform and activate mammalian target of rapamycin, after which we monitored changes in glucose consumption and lactate production. Finally, we determined the expression of pyruvate kinase  isoform and the mammalian target of rapamycin downstream transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, as well as glucose consumption and lactate production, following the modification of mammalian target of rapamycin expression.Immunohistochemical staining showed that both phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin and pyruvate kinase  isoform expression were higher in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma than in nontumor tissues. Glucose consumption and lactate production measurements demonstrated that altering mammalian target of rapamycin and pyruvate kinase  isoform levels caused corresponding changes in  in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. When mammalian target of rapamycin was activated or inhibited, expression of pyruvate kinase  isoform and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α as well as  were altered, indicating that mammalian target of rapamycin regulates pyruvate kinase  isoform via the downstream transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, thereby affecting  in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Mammalian target of rapamycin pathway promotes aerobic  in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by upregulating pyruvate kinase  isoform.

Here we show that the production of α-ketoglutarate (αKG) via glutaminolysis is important for alternative () activation of macrophages, including engagement of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and Jmjd3-dependent epigenetic reprogramming of  genes. This -promoting mechanism is further modulated by a high αKG/succinate ratio, whereas a low ratio strengthens the proinflammatory phenotype in classically activated (M1) macrophages. As such, αKG contributes to endotoxin tolerance after M1 activation.

Although under normoxia C4-2AT6, it is a CRPC cell line, expressed elevated pAkt, pS6 and Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) accompanied by elevated HIF-1a expression, 5% hypoxic condition further induced expression of these proteins. These results indicate hypoxic environment elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in aggressive prostate cancer. However, C4-2AT6 cells treated with mTOR inhibitor under hypoxia less decreased compared to cells treated with the same dose drugs under normoxia. Western blot analysis showed mTOR inhibitor: RAD001 not only inhibited pS6, but also increased the expression of PKM2 in a dose and time dependent manner. Pyruvate kinase acts on . PKM2, which is frequently express in tumor cells, is one isoform of pyruvate kinase. PKM2 is reported to act as a transcription factor. In the present study overexpression of PKM2 in C4-2AT6 induced resistance to RAD001 under normoxia. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of targeting PKM2, we inhibited PKM2 in C4-2AT6 under hypoxia using si-PKM2. The number of C4-2AT6 under chronic hypoxia exposed to siPKM2 significantly decreased compared to intact C4-2AT6 under chronic hypoxia. Furthermore, si-PKM2 improved resistance to mTOR inhibitor in C4-2AT6. When examined using clinical samples, high PKM2 expression was correlated with a high Gleason score and poor PSA free survival. These results suggested that up-regulation of PKM2 is one possibility of resistance to mTOR inhibitor in CRPC. And it is possible that PKM2 is a useful therapeutic target of CRPC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757909>Metabolic Reprogramming, Autophagy, and Reactive Oxygen Species Are Necessary for Primordial Germ Cell Reprogramming into Pluripotency.</a></h2><p>Cellular reprogramming is accompanied by a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) toward . Previous results from our laboratory showed that hypoxia alone is able to reprogram primordial germ cells (PGCs) into pluripotency and that this action is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). As HIF1 exerts a myriad of actions by upregulating several hundred genes, to ascertain whether the metabolic switch toward  is solely responsible for reprogramming, PGCs were cultured in the presence of a pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) activator, or  was promoted by manipulating PPAR. Conversely, OXPHOS was stimulated by inhibiting PDK1 activity in normoxic or in hypoxic conditions. Inhibition or promotion of autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was performed to ascertain their role in cell reprogramming. Our results show that a metabolic shift toward , autophagy, and mitochondrial inactivation and an early rise in ROS levels are necessary for PGC reprogramming. All of these processes are governed by HIF1/HIF2 balance and strict intermediate Oct4 levels. Histone acetylation plays a role in reprogramming and is observed under all reprogramming conditions. The pluripotent cells thus generated were unable to self-renew, probably due to insufficient  downregulation and a lack of Klf4 and cMyc expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462699>Intestinal epithelial PKM2 serves as a safeguard against experimental colitis via activating β-catenin signaling.</a></h2><p>The pyruvate kinase  (PKM2)-mediated aerobic  has been shown to play a critical role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. However, little is known about the function of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in intestine homeostasis. Here we investigate whether and how intestinal epithelial PKM2 modulates the morphology and function of the adult intestine in experimental colitis. Analyzing colonoscopic biopsies from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, we found significantly decreased level of intestinal epithelial PKM2 in patients compared to that in non-inflamed tissues. Similar reduction of intestinal epithelial PKM2 was observed in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Moreover, intestinal epithelial-specific PKM2-knockout (Pkm2) mice displayed more severe intestinal inflammation, as evidenced by a shortened colon, disruption of epithelial tight junctions, an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels, and immune cell infiltration, when compared to wild-type mice. Gene profiling, western blot, and function analyses indicated that cell survival signals, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin pathways, were associated with PKM2 activity. Increasing mouse intestinal epithelial PKM2 expression via delivery of a PKM2-expressing plasmid attenuated experimental colitis. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that intestinal epithelial PKM2 increases cell survival and wound healing under the colitic condition via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29452935>E3 Ligase VHL Promotes Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cell Maturation and Function via  Inhibition and Induction of Interleukin-33 Receptor.</a></h2><p>Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are a specialized subset of lymphoid effector cells that are critically involved in allergic responses; however, the mechanisms of their regulation remain unclear. We report that conditional deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL in innate lymphoid progenitors minimally affected early-stage bone marrow ILC2s but caused a selective and intrinsic decrease in mature ILC2 numbers in peripheral non-lymphoid tissues, resulting in reduced type 2 immune responses. VHL deficiency caused the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and attenuated interleukin-33 (IL-33) receptor ST2 expression, which was rectified by HIF1α ablation or inhibition. HIF1α-driven expression of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase  downmodulated ST2 expression via epigenetic modification and inhibited IL-33-induced ILC2 development. Our study indicates that the VHL-HIF- axis is essential for the late-stage maturation and function of ILC2s via targeting IL-33-ST2 pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

His experiments were conducted in the presence of excess oxygen, but today tumor tissue is known to be a hypoxic environment. However, an increase of  and lactate production is still a valid observation. Numerous abnormalities and mutations of metabolic enzymes have been found in many cancers. For example, pyruvate kinase  has been associated with many cancers and is a major contributor to directing  into fermentation, forming lactate. Increases in several enzymes, including glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase , Rad6, or deficiency of other enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase, all may contribute directly or indirectly to increases in lactate associated with the Warburg effect. In addition, the increased lactate and acid-base changes are modified further by monocarboxylate transporters and carbonic anhydrase, which contribute to alkalinizing tumor cells while acidifying the tumor extracellular environment. This acidification leads to cancer spread. Fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect should provide new approaches to cancer treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family that has been shown to influence macrophage activation and polarization, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Mitochondrial metabolism has been reported to be a central player in shaping macrophage polarization; previous studies have shown that both aerobic  and oxidative phosphorylation uniquely regulate the functions of M1 and  macrophages. Whether IL-33 polarizes macrophages by reshaping mitochondrial metabolism requires further investigation. In this work, we examined the mitochondrial metabolism of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from either wild type (WT), -overexpressing, or IL-33 receptor knockout ( ) mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that after LPS stimulation, compared with WT BMDMs,   BMDMs had reduced cytokine production and increased numbers and activity of mitochondria  the metabolism regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-C coactivator-1 α (PGC1α). This was demonstrated by increased mitochondrial DNA copy number, mitochondria counts, mitochondria fission- and fusion-related gene expression, oxygen consumption rates, and ATP production, and decreased glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rates. For -overexpressing BMDMs, the metabolic reprogramming upon LPS stimulation was similar to WT BMDMs, and was accompanied by increased M1 macrophage activity. Our findings suggested that the pleiotropic IL-33/ST2 pathway may influence the polarization and function of macrophages by regulating mitochondrial metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299177>PKM2 in carcinogenesis and oncotherapy.</a></h2><p>Tumor cell metabolism is characterized by abundant glucose consumption and aerobic .

The dysregulation of metabolism and autophagy contributes to the progression of PCa. The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is implicated in the regulation of metabolism and autophagy. We confirmed that Sp1 is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. However, the roles of Sp1 in PCa metabolism and autophagy remain unclear. Thus, in the present study, we retrieved the GSE35988 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to reinvestigate Sp1 expression and its role in PCa.We found that in PCa, Sp1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth, aerobic , and hypoxia-induced autophagy, which were accompanied by an increased G1 cell cycle arrest. Pearson correlation indicated that pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type  (PKM2) is positively correlated with Sp1 expression. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Sp1 directly regulates PKM2; therefore, Sp1 modulates metabolism and autophagy in CRPC. Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay also indicated that the tumor suppressor miR-361-5p inversely regulates Sp1 by directly targeting the binding site in the 3'UTR of Sp1. miR-361-5p overexpression presented effects that are similar to Sp1 depletion in PCa. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that miR-361-5p suppresses the Sp1/PKM2 axis, consequently affecting the progression of PCa and the metabolism and autophagy of PCa cells. Therefore, targeting the miR-361-5p/Sp1/PKM2 pathway has considerable clinical significance in preventing the malignant progression of PCa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31101057>PKM2 is the target of proanthocyanidin B2 during the inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The treatment for advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sorafenib (SORA), while HCC has become increasingly drug resistant with enhanced aerobic .

Their metabolism is elevated, which allows them to sustain higher proliferative rate and resist some cell death signals. This phenomenon, known as the "Warburg effect", has become the focus of intensive efforts in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and new cancer drugs. Both  and glutaminolysis pathways are enhanced in cancer cells. While  is enhanced to satisfy the increasing energy demand of cancer cells, glutaminolysis is enhanced to provide biosynthetic precursors for cancer cells. It was recently discovered that there is a tyrosine phosphorylation of a specific isoform of pyruvate kinase, the  isoform, that is preferentially expressed in all cancer cells, which results in the generation of pyruvate through a unique enzymatic mechanism that is uncoupled from ATP production. Pyruvate produced through this unique enzymatic mechanism is converted primarily into lactic acid, rather than acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of citrate, which would normally then enter the citric acid cycle. Inhibition of key enzymes in  and glutaminolysis pathways with small molecules has provided a novel but emerging area of cancer research and has been proven effective in slowing the proliferation of cancer cells, with several inhibitors being in clinical trials.

Here we show that chloroquine (CQ), a proven anti-malarial drug, can function as an antitumor immune modulator that switches TAMs from  to tumor-killing M1 phenotype. Mechanistically, CQ increases macrophage lysosomal pH, causing Ca release via the lysosomal Ca channel mucolipin-1 (Mcoln1), which induces the activation of p38 and NF-κB, thus polarizing TAMs to M1 phenotype.

Here, we show that embryogenesis-associated mouse RGC differentiation depends on mitophagy, the programmed autophagic clearance of mitochondria. The elimination of mitochondria during RGC differentiation was coupled to a metabolic shift with increased lactate production and elevated expression of glycolytic enzymes at the mRNA level. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of either mitophagy or  consistently inhibited RGC differentiation. Local hypoxia triggered expression of the mitophagy regulator BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L, best known as NIX) at peak RGC differentiation. Retinas from NIX-deficient mice displayed increased mitochondrial mass, reduced expression of glycolytic enzymes and decreased neuronal differentiation. Similarly, we provide evidence that NIX-dependent mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial elimination during macrophage polarization towards the proinflammatory and more glycolytic M1 phenotype, but not to  macrophage differentiation, which primarily relies on oxidative phosphorylation. In summary, developmentally controlled mitophagy promotes a metabolic switch towards , which in turn contributes to cellular differentiation in several distinct developmental contexts.© 2017 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428057>Metabolic regulation of T cell development by Sin1-mTORC2 is mediated by pyruvate kinase .</a></h2><p>Glucose metabolism plays a key role in thymocyte development.

Herein, we found that AP could block cellular  through restraining the tumor-specific pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) activity and expression and further significantly induce anti-colon cancer effects. The IC values of AP against HCT116, HT29, and DLD1 cells were 27.9 ± 2.45, 48.2 ± 3.01 and 89.5 ± 4.89 μM, respectively. Fluorescence spectra and solid-phase AP extraction assays proved that AP could directly bind to PKM2 and markedly inhibit PKM2 activity in vitro and in HCT116 cells. Interestingly, in the presence of d-fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FBP), the inhibitory effect of AP on PKM2 was not reversed, which suggests that AP is a new allosteric inhibitor of PKM2. RT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that AP could ensure a low PKM2/PKM1 ratio in HCT116 cells via blocking the β-catenin/c-Myc/PTBP1 signal pathway.

In addition to its well established cytosolic functions as a glycolytic enzyme, PKM2 displays nuclear localization and important nonmetabolic functions in tumorigenesis. Herein, we report that nuclear PKM2 interacts with histone H2AX under DNA damage conditions. Depletion of PKM2 decreased the level of serine 139-phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) in response to DNA damage. The  kinase assay reveals that PKM2 directly phosphorylates H2AX at serine 139, which is abolished by the deletion of FBP-binding pocket of PKM2 (PKM2-Del). Replacement of wild type PKM2 with the kinase dead mutant PKM2-Del leads to decreased cell proliferation and chromosomal aberrations under DNA damage conditions. Together, we propose that PKM2 promotes genomic instability in tumor cells which involves direct phosphorylation of H2AX. These findings reveal PKM2 as a novel modulator for genomic instability in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884457>Distinct Activities of Glycolytic Enzymes Identify Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients with a more Aggressive Course and Resistance to Chemo-Immunotherapy.</a></h2><p>A higher capacity to grow under hypoxic conditions can lead to a more aggressive behavior of tumor cells.

HR patients had a significantly shorter progression-free survival after treatment compared to LR patients (median 216 days vs not reached, p = .008). Multivariate analysis evaluating age, IGHV, TP53 deletion or mutation and 11q22-23 deletion besides the capacity of tumor cells to grow under severe hypoxic conditions identified the metabolic profile as the strongest independent risk factor for shorter TFS (hazard ratio 2.37, p = .011). The metabolic risk can provide prognostic and predictive information complementary to genetic biomarkers and identify patients who might benefit from alternative treatment approaches.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) catalyzes the concluding step in  and is a key regulator of tumor growth and metabolism. Elevation of PKM2 expression was detected in Gleason 8-10 tumors compared to Gleason 6-7 carcinomas, indicating that PKM2 may potentially be a marker of aggressive prostate cancer. We have recently reported the development of a PKM2-specific radiopharmaceutical [F]DASA-23 and herein describe its evaluation in cell culture and preclinical models of prostate cancer.The cellular uptake of [F]DASA-23 was evaluated in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and compared to that of [F]FDG. The specificity of [F]DASA-23 to measure PKM2 levels in cell culture was additionally confirmed through the use of PKM2-specific siRNA. PET imaging studies were then completed utilizing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts using either PC3 or DU145 cells in mice.[F]DASA-23 uptake values over 60-min incubation period in PC3, LnCAP, and DU145 respectively were 23.4 ± 4.5, 18.0 ± 2.1, and 53.1 ± 4.6 % tracer/mg protein. Transient reduction in PKM2 protein expression with siRNA resulted in a 50.1 % reduction in radiotracer uptake in DU145 cells. Small animal PET imaging revealed 0.86 ± 0.13 and 1.6 ± 0.2 % ID/g at 30 min post injection of radioactivity in DU145 and PC3 subcutaneous tumor bearing mice respectively.Herein, we evaluated a F-18-labeled PKM2-specific radiotracer, [F]DASA-23, for the molecular imaging of prostate cancer with PET. [F]DASA-23 revealed rapid and extensive uptake levels in cellular uptake studies of prostate cancer cells; however, there was only modest tumor uptake when evaluated in mouse subcutaneous tumor models.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29163707>N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 restrains  and glutaminolysis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p> and glutaminolysis are heavily involved in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes has a marked effect on the cellular metabolic processes  and glutaminolysis. N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a tumor suppressor gene that previous studies have demonstrated can inhibit the growth, proliferation and metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells. However, the function of NDRG2 in ccRCC metabolism remains unknown. In the present study, NDRG2 significantly inhibited the consumption of glucose and glutamine, as well as the production of lactate and glutamate in ccRCC. NDRG2 significantly suppressed the expression of glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase , lactate dehydrogenase A, glutamine transporter ASC amino acid transporter 2 and glutaminase 1 at the mRNA (by quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein level (by western blot analysis), all of which are key regulators and enzymes in  and glutaminolysis. Data from the present study also revealed that overexpression of NDRG2 suppressed cell proliferation in ccRCC  and , demonstrated by colony formation assays, wound healing assay and nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. The present findings demonstrate for the first time that NDRG2 acts as a key inhibitor of  and glutaminolysis in ccRCC and could be a promising target for the metabolic treatment of ccRCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30072740>KDM8/JMJD5 as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 integrates AR/EZH2 network and tumor metabolism in CRPC.</a></h2><p>During the evolution into castration or therapy resistance, prostate cancer cells reprogram the androgen responses to cope with the diminishing level of androgens, and undergo metabolic adaption to the nutritionally deprived and hypoxia conditions. AR (androgen receptor) and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase ) have key roles in these processes. We report in this study, KDM8/JMJD5, a histone lysine demethylase/dioxygnase, exhibits a novel property as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 and as such, it is a potent inducer of castration and therapy resistance. Previously, we showed that KDM8 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor metabolism in breast cancer cells. Its role in prostate cancer has not been explored. Here, we show that KDM8's oncogenic properties in prostate cancer come from its direct interaction (1) with AR to affect androgen response and (2) with PKM2 to regulate tumor metabolism. The interaction with AR leads to the elevated expression of androgen response genes in androgen-deprived conditions. They include ANCCA/ATAD2 and EZH2, which are directly targeted by KDM8 and involved in sustaining the survival of the cells under hormone-deprived conditions. Notably, in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the expressions of both KDM8 and EZH2 are further elevated, so are neuroendocrine markers. Consequently, EZH2 inhibitors or KDM8 knockdown both resensitize the cells toward enzalutamide. In the cytosol, KDM8 associates with PKM2, the gatekeeper of pyruvate flux and translocates PKM2 into the nucleus, where the KDM8/PKM2 complex serves as a coactivator of HIF-1α to upregulate glycolytic genes. Using shRNA knockdown, we validate KDM8's functions as a regulator for both androgen-responsive and metabolic genes. KDM8 thus presents itself as an ideal therapeutic target for metabolic adaptation and castration-resistance of prostate cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31246990>Tumor -PK: A novel urine marker of bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>Bladder cancer is a "Warburg-like" tumor characterized by a reliance on aerobic  and expression of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2). PKM2 oscillates between an active tetramer and an inactive dimer. We aim to further characterize PKM2, in particular PKM2 dimer, as a urinary biomarker of bladder cancer and a potential target for treatment.HTB-9, HTB-5, and UM-UC3 bladder cancer cells were assessed for proliferation under differential glucose levels using the hexosaminidase assay. Western blot and Blue-native analysis was performed for protein expression of PKM2. Shikonin, an herb that is known to bind and inhibit PKM2, was utilized to determine if PKM2 has a role in glucose usage and cellular proliferation in bladder cancer cells by caspase activity assay. Institutional review board approval was obtained to collect healthy control and bladder cancer patient urine samples. The ScheBo -PK EDTA Plasma Test was performed on urine samples to assess urine Tumor -PK values.The three bladder cancer cell lines tested all demonstrate statistically significant increases in proliferation when exposed to higher level of glucose (200mg/dL). Similarly, low doses of glucose (25mg/dL) result in reduced proliferation. Increased cell growth in higher glucose concentration correlated with up-regulation of PKM2 protein expression. Shikonin, a PKM2 inhibitor, reduced cell proliferation and switched PKM2 isoforms from the dimer to tetramer. Lastly, dimer PKM2 (Tumor-M2PK) levels were assessed in the urine samples from bladder cancer (Bca) patients and healthy controls. Tumor -PK significantly correlated with the presence of BCa in our subjects.Our studies demonstrate the potential of PKM2, specifically the dimer (Tumor-M2PK) as a target of drug therapy and as a urinary marker for bladder cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469916>CRAF methylation by PRMT6 regulates aerobic  driven hepatocarcinogenesis via ERK-dependent PKM2 nuclear relocalization and activation.</a></h2><p>Most tumor cells use aerobic  (the Warburg effect) to support anabolic growth and promote tumorigenicity and drug resistance. Intriguingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. In this work, using gain- and loss-of-function in vitro studies in patient-derived organoid and cell cultures as well as in vivo PET-MRI animal models, we showed that PRMT6 regulates aerobic  in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through nuclear relocalization of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), a key regulator of the Warburg effect. We found PRMT6 to methylate CRAF at arginine 100, interfere with its RAS/RAF binding potential and as a result alter ERK-mediated PKM2 translocation into the nucleus. This altered PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 signaling axis was further confirmed in both a HCC mouse model with endogenous knockout of PRMT6 as well as in HCC clinical samples. We also identified PRMT6 as a novel target of hypoxia via the transcriptional repressor REST, linking PRMT6 with hypoxia in driving glycolytic events. Finally, we showed as a proof-of-concept the therapeutic potential of using 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), a  inhibitor, to reverse tumorigenicity and sorafenib resistance mediated by PRMT6 deficiency in HCC. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the PRMT6-ERK-PKM2 regulatory axis is an important determinant of the Warburg effect in tumor cells and provide a mechanistic link between tumorigenicity, sorafenib resistance and glucose metabolism.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381300>Aerobic  fuels platelet activation: small-molecule modulators of platelet metabolism as anti-thrombotic agents.</a></h2><p>Platelets are critical to arterial thrombosis, which underlies myocardial infarction and stroke. Activated platelets, regardless of the nature of their stimulus, initiate energy-intensive processes that sustain thrombus, while adapting to potential adversities of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation within the densely packed thrombotic milieu. We report here that stimulated platelets switch their energy metabolism to aerobic  by modulating enzymes at key checkpoints in glucose metabolism. We found that aerobic , in turn, accelerates flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and supports platelet activation. Hence, reversing metabolic adaptations of platelets could be an effective alternative to conventional anti-platelet approaches, which are crippled by remarkable redundancy in platelet agonists and ensuing signaling pathways. In support of this hypothesis, small-molecule modulators of pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase  and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, all of which impede aerobic  and/or the pentose phosphate pathway, restrained the agonist-induced platelet responses  These drugs, which include the anti-neoplastic candidate, dichloroacetate, and the Food and Drug Administration-approved dehydroepiandrosterone, profoundly impaired thrombosis in mice, thereby exhibiting potential as anti-thrombotic agents.Copyright© 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365092>COX-2 induces apoptosis-resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the HIF-1α/PKM2 pathway.</a></h2><p>The pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) is a key component of aerobic  and has been reported to regulate apoptosis. However, it is unclear whether PKM2 is involved in cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2) induced apoptosis‑resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the present study, it was observed that COX‑2 and PKM2 were significantly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent liver tissues (P<0.05). Furthermore, their expression was positively associated with worse clinicopathological characteristics, which indicates poor prognosis in patients with HCC. COX‑2 knockdown significantly reduced the expression of PKM2 and hypoxia inducible factor‑1α (HIF‑1α) at the mRNA and protein levels in addition to inhibiting proliferation (P<0.05), whereas apoptosis was notably increased. Furthermore, HIF‑1α and PKM2‑knockdown increased cell apoptosis without inhibiting COX‑2 expression. PKM2 inhibition did not have a marked effect on COX‑2 and HIF‑1α expression. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that HIF‑1α/PKM2 pathway‑associated metabolic changes may facilitate COX‑2‑induced apoptosis resistance in HCC cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588255>PKM2 promotes cell migration and inhibits autophagy by mediating PI3K/AKT activation and contributes to the malignant development of gastric cancer.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) is a key kinase of  and is characteristic of all proliferating cells. The role of PKM2 in gastric cancer (GC) is still ambiguous and yet to be determined. To better understand the role of PKM2 in both the migration and invasion of GC, we measured the expression of PKM2 in GC cell lines using qRT-PCR and western blot. The prognostic value of PKM2 was analyzed by Immunohistochemistry in a cohort containing 88 GC patients. PKM2 was knocked down by the short hairpin RNA plasmid vector in NCI-N87 and BGC-823 cells, and the biological behavior and downstream signaling pathways were also investigated in vitro. Subcutaneous xenografts and pulmonary metastases models were constructed in nude mice to compare the differences in tumorgenesis and metastasis after Knockdown of PKM2. Our results obtained from in vitro cell biological behavior, in vivo tumorigenicity studies, and primary GC samples revealed an oncogenic role for PKM2 in GC. Furthermore, for those GC patients who received radical resection, PKM2 might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and target which would allow for a brand new treatment strategy for GC in the clinical settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31181442>LncRNA LINC00689 promotes the growth, metastasis and  of glioma cells by targeting miR-338-3p/PKM2 axis.</a></h2><p>Accumulating evidence supports that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma. Recent studies find that lncRNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 689 (LINC00689) is associated with obesity and participates in eukaryotic gene expression. However, whether LINC00689 plays a critical role in glioma progression remains unknown. Here, we identified a highly expressed lncRNA LINC00689 in gliomas compared to normal brain tissues based on the GSE dataset (GSE4290). The analysis of our data indicated that the expression of LINC00689 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the high expression of LINC00689 was closely correlated with tumor size ≥3 cm, high tumor grade, low KPS scores and poor prognosis of glioma patients. Further investigation demonstrated that LINC00689 knockdown markedly repressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and  of glioma cells. Additionally, silencing of LINC00689 significantly suppressed the growth of glioma cells in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00689 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by directly interacting with miR-338-3p to promote pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) expression. Notably, we also revealed that restoration of PKM2 abolished the effects of LINC00689 silencing on glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and . In summary, our results suggested that LINC00689/miR-338-3p/PKM2 axis might play an essential role in glioma progression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Curcumin is an extensively-studied anti-cancer compound, however, its role in affecting cancer metabolism remains poorly understood. Herein, we show that curcumin inhibits glucose uptake and lactate production (Warburg effect) in a variety of cancer cell lines by down-regulating PKM2 expression, via inhibition of mTOR-HIF1α axis. Stable PKM2 silencing revealed that PKM2 is required for Warburg effect and proliferation of cancer cells. PKM2 over-expression abrogated the effects of curcumin, demonstrating that inhibition of Warburg effect by curcumin is PKM2-mediated. High PKM2 expression correlated strongly with poor overall survival in cancer, suggesting the requirement of PKM2 in cancer progression. The study unravels novel PKM2-mediated inhibitory effect of curcumin on metabolic capacities of cancer cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study linking curcumin with PKM2-driven cancer , thus, providing new perspectives into the mechanism of its anticancer activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927711>Human metapneumovirus infection of airway epithelial cells is associated with changes in core metabolic pathways.</a></h2><p>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an important cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Ingenuity pathway analysis of microarrays data showed that 20% of genes affected by hMPV infection of airway epithelial cells (AECs) were related to metabolism. We found that levels of the glycolytic pathway enzymes hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase , and lactate dehydrogenase A were significantly upregulated in normal human AECs upon hMPV infection, as well as levels of enzymes belonging to the hexosamine biosynthetic and glycosylation pathways. On the other hand, expression of the majority of the enzymes belonging to the tricarboxylic acid cycle was significantly diminished. Inhibition of hexokinase 2 and of the glycosylating enzyme O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase led to a significant reduction in hMPV titer, indicating that metabolic changes induced by hMPV infection play a major role during the virus life cycle, and could be explored as potential antiviral targets.Copyright © 2019.

Pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2) is a key player in such metabolic reshuffle, which functions as a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme in the cytosol of highly-proliferative cancer cells. During the recent decades, PKM2 has been extensively studied in non-canonical localizations such as nucleus, mitochondria, and extracellular secretion, and pertained to novel biological functions in tumor progression. Such functions of PKM2 open a new avenue for cancer researchers. This review summarizes up-to-date functions of PKM2 at various subcellular localizations of cancer cells and draws attention to the translocation of PKM2 from cytosol into the nucleus induced by posttranslational modifications. Moreover, PKM2 in tumor cells could have an important role in resistance acquisition processes against various chemotherapeutic drugs, which have raised a concern on PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target. Finally, we summarize the current status and future perspectives to improve the potential of PKM2 as a therapeutic target for the development of anticancer therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Two major types of NETosis have been described - NOX-dependent and independent. The present study was undertaken to assess metabolic requirements of NETs formation by using PMA and A23187 as the inducers of NOX-dependent and NOX-independent NETosis respectively. Both these inducers caused an increase in ECAR, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, PKM2 dimerization and reduction in pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) activity, promoting lactate formation through Warburg effect. Interestingly exogenous treatment with lactate also induced NETs formation in human neutrophils, while inhibition of LDH activity significantly reduced NETosis by both the pathways. Moreover, NETosis and lactate accumulation during LPS induced sepsis in mice was inhibited by sodium oxamate, LDH inhibitor, demonstrating the importance of lactate in an experimental model of NETosis. Present study thus confirms importance of  in NETosis and also reveals role of lactate in NETs formation.

Several MET-targeting inhibitors and antagonistic antibodies have shown promising data in clinical trials of lung adenocarcinoma. Finding noninvasive diagnostic tools to estimate the status of MET is helpful in clinical practice. F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (F-FDG PET/CT) has been used routinely for the diagnosis and staging of tumors. However, the relationship between MET expression and F-FDG uptake has not been investigated yet. This study aimed to determine the correlation of MET expression with F-FDG uptake on PET-CT scan and whether or not F-FDG PET/CT can be used to predict the MET status of lung adenocarcinoma patients.Fifty-seven lung adenocarcinoma patients were analyzed in our study. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated in all PET/CT images. The expression levels of MET and two important -related markers, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and pyruvate kinase , were analyzed by immunohistochemistry of tissues. Spearman rank correlation was used to analyze the association between MET expression and SUV. In vitro MET knockdown in lung adenocarcinoma cells was used to examine the role of MET in tumor metabolism. The effect of MET on GLUT1 expression was investigated using Western blot assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.SUV was positively correlated with the expression levels of MET (=0.458; <0.001) and GLUT1 (=0.551; <0.001). SUV was significantly higher in patients with positive MET expression than in those with negative MET expression (9.92±6.62 vs 4.60±3.00; =0.002).

The effect of PKM2 inhibition on radiosensitivity, the cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis was evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis, colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting.PKM2 expression was more highly expressed in the nCR group than that in CR group and PKM2 expression was enhanced in CC cells after ionizing radiation (IR). In addition, knockdown of PKM2 combined with IR significantly reduced cell growth, promoted apoptosis, and enhanced radiosensitivity. Additionally, knockdown of PKM2 with IR resulted in increased phosphorylation of DNA repair checkpoint proteins (ATM) and phosphorylated-H2AX. Moreover, knockdown of PKM2 combined with IR significantly increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9, whereas Bcl2 expression was suppressed. Furthermore, knockdown of PKM2 combined with IR markedly reduced the expression of several cancer stem cell biomarkers in vitro, including NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and Bmi1.The results of our study suggests that PKM2 might be involved in mediating CC radiosensitivity and is identified as a potentially important target to enhance radiosensitivity in patients with CC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31401304>Pyruvate kinase : A simple molecule with complex functions.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate kinase  is a critical enzyme that regulates cell metabolism and growth under different physiological conditions.

But thyroid hormones also produce non-genomic effects that typically start at the plasma membrane and are mediated mainly by integrin αvβ3, although other receptors such as TRα and TRβ are also able to elicit non-genomic responses. In the liver, the effects of thyroid hormones appear to be particularly important. The liver is able to regenerate, but it is subject to pathologies that may lead to cancer, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In addition, cancer cells undergo a reprogramming of their metabolism, resulting in drastic changes such as aerobic  instead of oxidative phosphorylation. As a consequence, the pyruvate kinase isoform , the rate-limiting enzyme of , is dysregulated, and this is considered an important factor in tumorigenesis. Redox equilibrium is also important, in fact cancer cells give rise to the production of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than normal cells. This increase may favor the survival and propagation of cancer cells. We evaluate the possible mechanisms involving the plasma membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 that may lead to cancer progression. Studying diseases that affect the liver and their experimental models may help to unravel the cellular pathways mediated by integrin αvβ3 that can lead to liver cancer. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 might represent a future therapeutic tool against liver cancer.

For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. , fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions.

High levels of PD-L1 promote tumor growth by restraining CD8 T-cell responses against tumors. Limiting PD-L1 expression and function is therefore critical for allowing the development of antitumor immune responses and effective tumor clearance. Pyruvate kinase isoform  (PKM2) is also a key player in regulating cancer as well as immune responses. PKM2 catalyzes the final rate-limiting step of . Furthermore, PKM2 as a dimer translocates to the nucleus, where it stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) transactivation domain function and recruitment of p300 to the hypoxia response elements (HRE) of Hif-1α target genes. Here, we provide the first evidence of a role for PKM2 in regulating the expression of PD-L1 on macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and tumor cells. LPS-induced expression of PD-L1 in primary macrophages was inhibited by the PKM2 targeting compound TEPP-46. Furthermore, RNA silencing of PKM2 inhibited LPS-induced PD-L1 expression. This regulation occurs through direct binding of PKM2 and Hif-1α to HRE sites on the PD-L1 promoter. Moreover, TEPP-46 inhibited expression of PD-L1 on macrophages, DCs, and T cells as well as tumor cells in a mouse CT26 cancer model.

ROS inhibits multiple glycolytic enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase , and phosphofructokinase-1. Consistently, glycolytic inhibition promotes flux into the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH. NADPH is critically important, as it provides the reducing power that fuels the protein-based antioxidant systems and recycles oxidized glutathione. The unique ability of pyruvate kinase  inhibition to promote serine synthesis in the context of oxidative stress is also discussed.Copyright 2015, The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555797>Reversal of the Warburg phenomenon in chemoprevention of prostate cancer by sulforaphane.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of metabolic re-programming represents an attractive approach for prevention of prostate cancer. Studies have implicated increased synthesis of fatty acids or  in pathogenesis of human prostate cancers. We have shown previously that prostate cancer prevention by sulforaphane (SFN) in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model is associated with inhibition of fatty acid metabolism. This study utilized human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3), two different transgenic mouse models (TRAMP and Hi-Myc), and plasma specimens from a clinical study to explore the  inhibition potential of SFN. We found that SFN treatment: (a) decreased real-time extracellular acidification rate in LNCaP, but not in PC-3 cell line ; (b) significantly downregulated expression of hexokinase II (HKII), pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), and/or lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro in cells and in vivo in neoplastic lesions in the prostate of TRAMP and Hi-Myc mice; and (c) significantly suppressed  in prostate of Hi-Myc mice as measured by ex vivo1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SFN treatment did not decrease glucose uptake or expression of glucose transporters in cells. Overexpression of c-Myc, but not constitutively active Akt, conferred protection against SFN-mediated downregulation of HKII and LDHA protein expression and suppression of lactate levels. Examination of plasma lactate levels in prostate cancer patients following administration of a SFN-rich broccoli sprout extract failed to show declines in its levels. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether SFN treatment can decrease lactate production in human prostate tumors.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

Here, we report that hypoxia disassembles 14-3-3ζ from YAP and thereby promotes YAP nuclear localization mediated by ERK2, which directly binds to the D-site of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) docking domain in 14-3-3ζ Leu98/100 and phosphorylates 14-3-3ζ at Ser37. When localizing in nucleus, YAP recruits at pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) gene promoter with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), for which PKM2 transcription is required. 14-3-3ζ Ser37 phosphorylation is instrumental for the hypoxia-induced glucose uptake, lactate production, and clonogenicity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, as well as tumorigenesis in mice. The 14-3-3ζ Ser37 phosphorylation positively correlates with p-ERK1/2 activity and HIF-1α expression in clinical samples from patients with PDAC and predicts unfavorable prognosis. Our findings underscore an appreciable linkage between YAP transcriptional activation and hypoxic  governed by ERK2-dependent 14-3-3ζ Ser37 phosphorylation for malignant progression of PDAC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29290976>Neuron-derived transthyretin modulates astrocytic  in hormone-independent manner.</a></h2><p>It has been shown that neurons alter the expression of astrocytic metabolic enzymes by secretion of until now unknown molecule(s) into extracellular fluid. Here, we present evidence that neuron-derived transthyretin (TTR) stimulates expression of glycolytic enzymes in astrocytes which is reflected by an increased synthesis of ATP. The action of TTR is restricted to regulatory enzymes of : phosphofructokinase P (PFKP) and pyruvate kinase M1/ isoforms (PKM1/2). The regulation of PFK and PKM expression by TTR is presumably specific for brain tissue and is independent of the role of TTR as a carrier protein for thyroxine and retinol. TTR induced expression of PKM and PFK is mediated by the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway and is antagonized by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for action of TTR as a neuron-derived energy metabolism activator in astrocytes and describe the mechanisms of its action. The data presented here suggest that TTR is involved in a mechanism in which neurons stimulate degradation of glycogen-derived glucosyl units without significant modulation of glucose uptake by glial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30070144>The Role of Metabolic Remodeling in Macrophage Polarization and Its Effect on Skeletal Muscle Regeneration.</a></h2><p>Macrophages are crucial for tissue homeostasis. Based on their activation, they might display classical/M1 or alternative/ phenotypes. M1 macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO).  macrophages upregulate arginase-1 and reduce NO and ROS levels; they also release anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and polyamines, thus promoting angiogenesis and tissue healing. Moreover, M1 and  display key metabolic differences; M1 polarization is characterized by an enhancement in  and in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) along with a decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), whereas  are characterized by an efficient OxPhos and reduced PPP. Recent Advances: The glutamine-related metabolism has been discovered as crucial for  polarization. Vice versa, flux discontinuities in the Krebs cycle are considered additional M1 features; they lead to increased levels of immunoresponsive gene 1 and itaconic acid, to isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-downregulation and to succinate, citrate, and isocitrate over-expression.A macrophage classification problem, particularly in vivo, originating from a gap in the knowledge of the several intermediate polarization statuses between the M1 and  extremes, characterizes this field. Moreover, the detailed features of metabolic reprogramming crucial for macrophage polarization are largely unknown; in particular, the role of β-oxidation is highly controversial.Manipulating the metabolism to redirect macrophage polarization might be useful in various pathologies, including an efficient skeletal muscle regeneration. Unraveling the complexity pertaining to metabolic signatures that are specific for the different macrophage subsets is crucial for identifying new compounds that are able to trigger macrophage polarization and that might be used for therapeutical purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996297>Loss of PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells promotes colitis-associated colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>The regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase  isoform (PKM2), the key glycolytic enzyme, influence altered energy metabolism including  in cancer. In this study, we found that PKM2 was highly expressed in patients with ulcerative colitis or colorectal cancer (CRC). We then investigated the effectiveness of conditionally ablating PKM2 in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISC) using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC (AOM plus DSS). Tamoxifen-inducible Lgr5-driven deletion of PKM2 in ISC (PKM2-Tx) significantly promoted tumor incidence and size in the colon and lower body weight compared with findings in vehicle-treated mice (PKM2-Veh). Histopathologic analysis revealed considerable high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in the colon of PKM2-Tx mice while PKM2-Veh mice had low- and high-grade dysplasia. Loss of PKM2 was associated with dominant expression of PKM1 in Lgr5 ISC and their progeny cells. Further, the organoid-forming efficiency of whole cancer cells or Lgr5 cells obtained from colon polyps of PKM2-Tx mice was significantly increased when compared with PKM2-Veh mice. Cancer organoids from PKM2-Tx mice exhibited increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a shift of metabolites involved in energy metabolism. These findings suggest that loss of PKM2 function in ISC promotes colitis-associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133040>Computer-aided identification of a novel pyruvate kinase  activator compound.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to obtain antitumour molecules targeting to activate PKM2 through adequate computational methods combined with biological activity experiments.The structure-based virtual screening was utilized to screen effective activator targeting PKM2 from ZINC database. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the stability of the small molecule-binding PKM2 complex systems. Then, cell survival experiments, glutaraldehyde crosslinking reaction, western blot, and qPCR experiments were used to detect the effects of top hits on various cancer cells and the targeting specificity of PKM2.Two small molecules in 1,5-2H-pyrrole-dione were obtained after virtual screening. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ZINC08383544 specifically activated PKM2 and affected the expression of upstream and downstream genes of PKM2 during , leading to the inhibition of tumour cell growth. These results indicate that ZINC08383544 conforms to the characteristics of PKM2 activator and is potential to be a novel PKM2 activator as antitumour drug.This work proves that ZINC08383544 promotes the formation of PKM2 tetramer, effectively blocks PKM2 nuclear translocation, and inhibits the growth of tumour, and ZINC08383544 may be a novel activator of PKM2. This work may provide a good choice of drug or molecular fragments for the antitumour strategy targeting PKM2. Screening of targeted drugs by combination of virtual screening and bioactivity experiments is a rapid method for drug discovery.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108954>Anti-cancer effect of a novel 2,3-didithiocarbamate-substituted naphthoquinone as a tumor metabolic suppressor  and .</a></h2><p>Tumor cells reprogram their cellular metabolism by switching from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic  to support aberrant cell proliferation. Suppressing tumor cell metabolism has become an attractive strategy for treating cancer patients. In this study, we identified a 2,3-didithiocarbamate-substituted naphthoquinone  that inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells by disturbing their metabolism. Compound  reduced cancer cell viability with IC values from 50 nM to 150 nM against HCT116, MCF7, MDA-MB231, HeLa, H1299 and B16 cells. Further, compound  was found to suppress ATP production in cultured cancer cells, inhibit the  isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway and block the subsequent transcription of the downstream genes GLUT1, LDH and CCND1. In addition, exposure to compound  significantly suppressed tumor growth in a B16 melanoma transplantation mouse model and a spontaneous breast carcinoma mouse model . The identification of compound  as a tumor metabolic suppressor not only offers a candidate compound for cancer therapy, but also provides a tool for an in-depth study of tumor metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30631356>Glucose and Lactate Transport in Pancreatic Cancer: Glycolytic Metabolism Revisited.</a></h2><p>Membrane transporters fulfill essential roles in maintaining normal cellular function in health. In cancer, transporters likewise facilitate the aberrant characteristics typical of proliferating tumor cells. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is remarkable in its aggressiveness, and its metabolism is supported by a variety of membrane transporters. Glucose transporter 1 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer, enables rapid cellular uptake of glucose, and contributes to the invasiveness and metastatic ability of the disease. Likewise, the machinery of , enzymes such as pyruvate kinase type  and hexokinase 2, is particularly active and ultimately leads to both lactate and tumor formation. Lactic acid channels and transporters include monocarboxylate transporters 1 and 4, connexin43, and CD147. In conjunction with glucose transporters and glycolytic metabolism, lactic acid transport helps perpetuate tumor cell metabolism and contributes to the formation of the unique tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. These transporters may serve as potential therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31251971>2,3'4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl induces hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation through pyruvate kinase -dependent .</a></h2><p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and are associated with the progression of many cancers, including liver cancer. The present study investigated the effect of 2,3'4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB118) on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and its underlying mechanisms. The results indicated that PCB118 exposure promotes the proliferation and  of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, PCB118 exposure increased the expression level of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) and its nuclear translocation, whereas treatment with PKM2 shRNA suppressed the induction of cell proliferation and  by PCB118. PCB118 stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by activating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Treatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and . Furthermore, we found that PCB118 activated NADPH oxidase through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in SMMC-7721 cells. Consistently, treatment with AhR shRNA suppressed PCB118-induced effects on PKM2, cell proliferation and . Overall, these results indicated that PCB118 promotes HCC cell proliferation via PKM2-dependent upregulation of , which is mediated by AhR/NADPH oxidase-induced ROS production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is termed as Warburg effect and is necessary for the tumorigenesis. Studies showed pyruvate kinase  (PKM2), a key regulator of the Warburg effect, is overexpressed and involved in numerous cancers. However, the expression and function of PKM2 in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain undefined. Our results showed that PKM2 is overexpressed in the PC tissue compared to the peritumoral tissue. Unexpected, the downregulation of PKM2 did not affect the proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance of PC cells. Since pancreatic cancer is a hypovascular tumor with comparably insufficient energy supply, we further investigate the relationship between PKM2 and hypoglucose. Interestingly, we further discovered that decreased expression of PKM2 was detected in PC samples with lower microvessel density as well as in PC cells treated with hypoglucose condition (0.5 mM). Furthermore, the downregulation of PKM2 facilitated, while the upregulation of PKM2 inhibited, PC cells survival during hypoglucose. We further revealed that the repressed PKM2 induced autophagy, high NADPH/NADP ratio, and biomacromolecule production, but reduced ROS accumulation. Moreover, AMPKα1 knockdown repressed the autophagy and survival of PC cells during hypoglucose, which were promoted by PKM2 knockdown. Collectively, our study indicates that decreased PKM2 diverts glucose metabolism to biomacromolecule accumulation and antioxidants generation during glucose deprivation. This metabolism alteration elevates AMPKα1-dependent autophagy, which facilitates PC cell survival during glucose deprivation. Therefore, functions of PKM2 are complicated and cannot be defined as oversimplified promoter or inhibitor in PC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28489603>18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake predicts PKM2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is widely used in the management of lung adenocarcinoma. Pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) plays a key role in . We therefore investigated whether PKM2 expression affects 18F-FDG uptake in a retrospective analysis of 76 patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) scans for staging before surgical resection. We found that PKM2 expression was higher in tumors than peritumoral tissue (p < 0.05). Patients with high PKM2 expression had reduced overall (p < 0.05) and disease-free (p < 0.05) survival as compared to those with low PKM2 expression. Comparison of the primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) between patients with high and low PKM2 expression revealed that the SUVmax was higher in primary tumors with high PKM2 expression than low PKM2 expression (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between SUVmax and PKM2 expression (p < 0.05). PKM2 status was predicted with 81.6% accuracy when the SUVmax cutoff value of 6.4. Thus,18F-FDG PET/CT is predictive of the PKM2 status in lung adenocarcinoma patients and could aid in determining therapeutic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744642>Blockade of -dependent contraction by oroxylin a via inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase-a in hepatic stellate cells.</a></h2><p>Contraction of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis by regulating sinusoidal blood flow and extracellular matrix remodeling. Here, we investigated how HSC contraction was affected by the natural compound oroxylin A, and elucidated the underlying mechanism.Cell contraction and  were examined in cultured human HSCs and mouse liver fibrosis model upon oroxylin A intervention using diversified cellular and molecular assays, as well as genetic approaches.Oroxylin A limited HSC contraction associated with inhibiting myosin light chain 2 phosphorylation. Oroxylin A blocked aerobic  in HSCs evidenced by reduction in glucose uptake and consumption and lactate production. Oroxylin A also decreased extracellular acidification rate and inhibited the expression and activity of  rate-limiting enzymes (hexose kinase 2, phosphofructokinase 1 and pyruvate kinas type ) in HSCs. Then, we identified that oroxylin A blockade of aerobic  contributed to inhibition of HSC contraction. Furthermore, oroxylin A inhibited the expression and activity of lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) in HSCs, which was required for oroxylin A blockade of  and suppression of contraction. Oral administration of oroxylin A at 40 mg/kg reduced liver injury and fibrosis, and inhibited HSC  and contraction in mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis. However, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of LDH-A significantly counteracted the oroxylin A's effects in fibrotic mice.Blockade of aerobic  by oroxylin A via inhibition of LDH-A reduced HSC contraction and attenuated liver fibrosis, suggesting LDH-A as a promising target for intervention of hepatic fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257387>Oviductus ranae protein hydrolysate (ORPH) inhibits the growth, metastasis and  of HCC by targeting miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis.</a></h2><p>Oviductus Ranae (OR) is a valuable Chinese crude drug and has been reported to have a range of biological activities. Protein hydrolysate extracted from OR (ORPH) was previously found to have immune regulatory effect and anti-glioma activity. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of ORPH on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression.MTT, BrdU, colony formation and transwell assays were used to determine proliferation and mobility of HCC cells in vitro. Glucose consumption and lactate production assays were carried out to measure the  of HCC cells. The subcutaneous tumor model and lung metastasis model in nude mice were established to detect tumor growth and metastasis of HCC in vivo. The direct binding of miR-491-5p to 3'UTR of pyruvate kinase  (PKM2) was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.In vitro experiments showed that ORPH significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and  of HCC cells. Moreover, ORPH treatment prominently suppressed HCC growth and metastasis in mice. We demonstrated that ORPH effectively decreased the expression of PKM2 in HCC cells. Forced expression of PKM2 abrogated the inhibitory effects of ORPH on HCC cells. Mechanically, ORPH reduced PKM2 expression in a post-transcriptional manner by up-regulating miR-491-5p. miR-491-5p exhibited a similar tumor suppressive effects with ORPH in HCC cells. Moreover, ORPH exerted its inhibitory effects on HCC cells through regulating miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis. Lastly, decreased miR-491-5p level and increased PKM2 expression were correlated with unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC patients.In all, this study reveals that ORPH inhibits the growth, metastasis and  of HCC cells by targeting miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis.

Although high PKM2 expression is observed in various cancer tissues, its functional role in cancer metabolism is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PKM2 in regulating autophagy and its associated pathways in prostate cancer cells.Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the expression level of PKM2 in prostate cancer patients and normal human, whereas expression of PKM2 in several cell lines was also examined by using western blot. PKM2 expression was silenced using various small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cell viability was examined using IncuCyte ZOOM™ live cell imaging system. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the PKM2 knockdown on other cellular signaling molecules. Acridine orange and Monodansylcadaverine staining was performed to check effect of PKM2 knockdown on autophagy induction. High performance thin layer chromatography was carried out to quantify the level of different cellular metabolites (pyruvate and lactate). Colony formation assay was performed to determine the ability of a cells to form large colonies.PKM2 was highly expressed in prostate cancer patients as compared to normal human. PKM2 siRNA-transfected prostate cancer cells showed significantly reduced viability. Acridine orange, Monodansylcadaverine staining and western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 downregulation markedly increased autophagic cell death. Results of western blotting analysis showed that PKM2 knockdown affected protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 pathway, which consequently downregulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase A and glucose transporter 1. Knockdown of PKM2 also reduced the colony formation ability of human prostate cancer cell DU145.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that PKM2 inhibition alters prostate cancer cell metabolism and induces autophagy, thus providing new perspectives for developing PKM2-targeting anticancer therapies for treating prostate cancer.© Copyright by the Author(s).
