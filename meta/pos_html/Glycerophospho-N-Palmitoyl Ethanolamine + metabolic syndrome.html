Significant effort is invested in understanding how pollutants encountered by the lung might induce effects in distant organs. The role of circulating mediators has been predicted; however, their origin and identity have not been confirmed. New evidence has emerged which implicates the role of neuroendocrine sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axes in mediating a wide array of systemic and pulmonary effects. Our recent studies using ozone exposure as a prototypical air pollutant demonstrate that increases in circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones (epinephrine and cortisol/corticosterone) contribute to lung injury/inflammation and  effects in the liver, pancreas, adipose, and muscle tissues. When stress hormones are depleted by adrenalectomy in rats, most ozone effects including lung injury/inflammation are diminished. Animals treated with antagonists for adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors show inhibition of the pulmonary and systemic effects of ozone, whereas treatment with agonists restore and exacerbate the ozone-induced injury/inflammation phenotype, implying the role of neuroendocrine activation. The neuroendocrine system is critical for normal homeostasis and allostatic activation; however, chronic exposure to stressors may lead to increases in allostatic load. The emerging mechanisms by which circulating mediators are released and are responsible for producing multiorgan effects of air pollutants insists upon a paradigm shift in the field of air pollution and health. Moreover, since these neuroendocrine responses are linked to both chemical and nonchemical stressors, the interactive influence of air pollutants, lifestyle, and environmental factors requires further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590214>Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with insulin clearance in obese individuals with .</a></h2><p>Impaired insulin clearance contributes to the hyperinsulinemia of obesity, yet relatively little is known concerning the pathophysiological determinants of insulin clearance in obese populations.To examine the cross-sectional relationship between insulin clearance and resting sympathetic nervous system activity in a cohort of obese subjects with .Unmedicated, nonsmoking subjects (31 male, 27 female; aged 56 ± 1 year; body mass index 33.7 ± 0.6 kg/m(2)) underwent euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine insulin sensitivity (M) and insulin clearance, assessment of norepinephrine kinetics, peripheral arterial tonometry, Doppler echocardiography, and oral glucose tolerance test.Univariate correlation analyses showed inverse associations between insulin clearance and arterial norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.44, P = .0006), calculated norepinephrine spillover rate (r = -0.33, P = .01), augmentation index (AI, r = -0.37, P = .005), and positive associations with M (r = 0.30, P = .02), Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (r = 0.27, P = .04), and cardiac output (r = 0.27, P = .04). Insulin clearance and sensitivity did not differ between genders, however females had higher AI compared to males (35 ± 3% versus 14 ± 2%, P < .001). In age and gender adjusted stepwise regression analyses, arterial norepinephrine concentration alone explained 19% of the variance in insulin clearance. When all significant variables were entered into the regression model, arterial norepinephrine, AI, gender, and M were independent predictors of insulin clearance, together explaining 41% of the variance.Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with whole-body insulin clearance rate in obese individuals with . Prospective studies are needed to determine the direction of causality and the chronology of interactions between insulin clearance and sympathetic neural activity.ClinicalTrials.gov  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256679>Improved glucose homeostasis in male obese Zucker rats coincides with enhanced baroreflexes and activation of the nucleus tractus solitarius.</a></h2><p>Young adult male obese Zucker rats (OZR) develop insulin resistance and hypertension with impaired baroreflex-mediated bradycardia and activation of nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but insulin was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25660758>Difference of catecholamine responses to exercise in men with trisomy 21, with or without chronotropic incompetence.</a></h2><p>Our purpose was to analyse if catecholamine responses to exercise would be different in Down  (DS) with or without chronotropic incompetence.Twenty five men with DS (mean age 22.2 ± 3.2) and twenty six controls (CONT, mean age 22.5 ± 1.4) participated in the study, and are divided into 3 groups: CONT, DS with chronotropic incompetence (DS+) and DS without chronotropic incompetence (DS-). During two treadmill incremental tests, blood samples were collected for the determination of hormonal and  variables.Ten out of 25 DS had chronotropic incompetence whereas no CONT. At rest, compared to CONT, despite similar physical activity, DS with chronotropic incompetence had significantly higher subcutaneous fat mass (p<0.001), lower epinephrine concentration (p<0.01), and higher leptin (p<0.01) and insulin concentrations (p<0.05). At peak exercise, all DS had lower heart rate, oxygen uptake and blood lactate concentrations than controls (p<0.001). During a 'Submaximal incremental test', DS with chronotropic incompetence had lower HR and lactate values (p<0.001) compared to CONT and DS without chronotropic incompetence (p<0.01). They also had blunted epinephrine and impaired norepinephrine responses to exercise compared to DS without chronotropic incompetence and CONT (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively).Our results indicate that catecholamine adaptations to exercise are not adequate in DS+ and are associated with exercise intolerance. Thus, this endocrine profile at rest and during exercise may limit endurance performance of DS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the isolated and combined effects of aerobic training and arginine supplementation on  variables and vascular reactivity in rats at high risk for developing the . Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control and fructose (F - water with 10 % fructose). After 2 weeks, the F group was divided into four groups: F, fructose+arginine (FA, 880 mg/kg per d of l-arginine), fructose+training (FT) and fructose+arginine+training (FTA); treatments lasted for 8 weeks, and no difference was observed in body mass gain. Arginine did not improve the body protein content, and both the FA and FT groups show a reversal of the increase in adipose tissue. Insulin increase was prevented by training and arginine, without additive effect, and the increase in serum TAG was prevented only by training. The F group showed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and hyperreactivity to phenylephrine, but arginine and training were capable of preventing these effects, even separately. Higher nitric oxide level was observed in the FA and FT groups, and no potentiating effect was detected. Thus, only training was able to prevent the increase in TAG and improve the protein mass, and training and arginine exert similar effects on fat content, insulin and endothelial function, but these effects are not additive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with  and NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940403>Markers of sympathetic nervous system activity associate with complex plasma lipids in  subjects.</a></h2><p>Plasma sphingolipids including ceramides, and gangliosides are associated with insulin resistance (IR) through effects on insulin signalling and glucose metabolism. Our studies of subjects with  (MetS) showed close relationships between IR and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity including arterial norepinephrine (NE). We have therefore investigated possible associations of IR and SNS activity with complex lipids that are involved in both insulin sensitivity and neurotransmission.We performed a cross-sectional assessment of 23 lipid classes/subclasses (total 339 lipid species) by tandem mass spectrometry in 94 overweight untreated subjects with IR (quantified by HOMA-IR, Matsuda index and plasma insulin).Independently of IR parameters, several circulating complex lipids associated significantly with arterial NE and NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) and marginally with heart rate (HR). After accounting for BMI, HOMA-IR, systolic BP, age, gender, and correction for multiple comparisons, these associations were significant (p < 0.05): NE with ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine and free cholesterol; NEFA with mono- di- and trihexosylceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol; HR marginally (p = or <0.1>0.05) with ceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol. Multiple subspecies of these lipids significantly associated with NE and NEFA. None of the IR biomarkers associated significantly with lipid classes/subclasses after correction for multiple comparisons.This is the first demonstration that arterial norepinephrine and NEFA, that reflect both SNS activity and IR, associate significantly with circulating complex lipids independently of IR, suggesting a role for such lipids in neural mechanisms operating in MetS.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is supposed that lovastatin not only decreases the rate of  but also impacts some brain metabolites and their ratio like common treatments that are measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.27 Manic phase patients were randomly allocated into two groups, lovastatin and placebo as their adjuant medication. Clinical symptoms were assessed at baseline, weeks 2, 4. The brain metabolites were measured at baseline and week 4.Regarding the change of clinical symptoms, no significant difference was found between two groups. However, lovastatin significantly increased the level of NAA in cingulate gyrus in comparison to the placebo group. Moreover, lovastatin more than placebo increased creatine in the left basal ganglia. Furthermore, choline/ creatine showed a significant decrease in the left basal ganglia in lovastatin group.Using MRS after treating with lovastatin showed lovastatin increases NAA in cingulate gyrus, indicating the possible effect of NAA for increasing the reduced viable neuron. Moreover, the increment of Cr by lovastatin in the left basal ganglia suggests the role of lovastatin for maintaining energy homeostasis, anti-apoptotic activity and ATP production in bipolar disorder. Some patents using lovastatin as an adjuant therapy for treating bipolar patients and depression in MDD patients are also outlined.

Several studies have shown that wheatgrass extract Triticum aestivum (TA) improves lipid metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of GM-T (an ethanolic TA extract) in a murine NAFLD model. Mice were separated into 12 groups (n = 10): two groups of normal diet, choline-deficient diet (CDD) or high-fat diet (HFD) with vehicle, CCD or HFD with silymarin (400 mg kg day ), and CCD or HFD with GM-T (100, 200 or 400 mg kg day ). The study was performed for 8 weeks for the CDD groups and 12 weeks for the HFD groups.In the CDD-fed mice, GM-T improved serum liver enzyme activities and liver inflammation score compared to vehicle. In the HFD-fed mice, GM-T improved blood lipid profiles, liver inflammation score, steatosis score and obesity compared to vehicle.The present study demonstrated that GM-T effectively improved NAFLD in mice via a mechanism that improved insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, suggesting the possibility of a functional dietary supplement to improve liver health, overall  and obesity. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26554714>Plasma levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide are confounded by impaired kidney function and poor  control.</a></h2><p>After ingestion of phosphatidylcholine, l-carnitine or betaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is formed by gut microbiota and liver enzymes.

Specifically, a vegan diet was associated with decreased plasma TMAO levels and nearly absent TMAO production on carnitine challenge.We performed a double-blind randomized controlled pilot study in which 20 male  patients were randomized to single lean vegan-donor or autologous fecal microbiota transplantation. At baseline and 2 weeks thereafter, we determined the ability to produce TMAO from d-choline and d-carnitine (eg, labeled and unlabeled TMAO in plasma and 24-hour urine after oral ingestion of 250 mg of both isotope-labeled precursor nutrients), and fecal samples were collected for analysis of microbiota composition. F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans of the abdominal aorta, as well as ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production assays, were performed. At baseline, fecal microbiota composition differed significantly between vegans and  patients. With vegan-donor fecal microbiota transplantation, intestinal microbiota composition in  patients, as monitored by global fecal microbial community structure, changed toward a vegan profile in some of the patients; however, no functional effects from vegan-donor fecal microbiota transplantation were seen on TMAO production, abdominal aortic F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, or ex vivo cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Single lean vegan-donor fecal microbiota transplantation in  patients resulted in detectable changes in intestinal microbiota composition but failed to elicit changes in TMAO production capacity or parameters related to vascular inflammation.URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

A considerable number of factors affects the course of pregnancy and its outcome, their effect is realized at the level of the central nervous system through numerical  interactions, where monoaminergic systems play an important role. Objective - to study the features of the sympathoadrenal system state by determining the excretion level of DOPHA, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine in women's daily urine with different periods of abortion. 227 pregnant women who were admitted to the Kharkiv perinatal center have been examined, 190 of them had clinical signs of premature delivery in the gestation period of 23-36 weeks. Formation of clinical groups was carried out depending on the pregnancy term in the form of premature and timely delivery. Diagnosis of preterm labor was carried out in the presence of abdominal pain  and structural changes in the cervix. Consequently, pregnancy compensatory and adaptive mechanisms are complex of neurohumoral process, which are realized through monoaminergic systems and a significant factor in its interruption is their destabilization. Reducing of sympathoadrenal system activity and reserve capacity in pregnant women may be a pathogenetic factor in the development of preterm labor. Therefore determination of the imbalance initial manifestations in the catecholamines exchange may possibly prevent the loss of pregnancy in the early stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29070666>Multiparametric MRI changes persist beyond recovery in concussed adolescent hockey players.</a></h2><p>To determine whether multiparametric MRI data can provide insight into the acute and long-lasting neuronal sequelae after a concussion in adolescent athletes.Players were recruited from Bantam hockey leagues in which body checking is first introduced (male, age 11-14 years). Clinical measures, diffusion metrics, resting-state network and region-to-region functional connectivity patterns, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy absolute metabolite concentrations were analyzed from an independent, age-matched control group of hockey players (n = 26) and longitudinally in concussed athletes within 24 to 72 hours (n = 17) and 3 months (n = 14) after a diagnosed concussion.There were diffusion abnormalities within multiple white matter tracts, functional hyperconnectivity, and decreases in choline 3 months after concussion. Tract-specific spatial statistics revealed a large region along the superior longitudinal fasciculus with the largest decreases in diffusivity measures, which significantly correlated with clinical deficits. This region also spatially intersected with probabilistic tracts connecting cortical regions where we found acute functional connectivity changes. Hyperconnectivity patterns at 3 months after concussion were present only in players with relatively less severe clinical outcomes, higher choline concentrations, and diffusivity indicative of relatively less axonal disruption.Changes persisted well after players' clinical scores had returned to normal and they had been cleared to return to play. Ongoing white matter maturation may make adolescent athletes particularly vulnerable to brain injury, and they may require extended recovery periods. The consequences of early brain injury for ongoing brain development and risk of more serious conditions such as second impact  or neural degenerative processes need to be elucidated.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Rats receiving an acute isoproterenol (ISO) overdose (OV) suffer cardiac apex ischemia-reperfusion damage and arrhythmia, and then undergo cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Nevertheless, the subcellular mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction after acute damage subsides are not thoroughly understood. To address this question, Wistar rats received a single ISO injection (67 mg/kg). We found in vivo moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction at 2 wk post-ISO-OV; however, systolic dysfunction recovered after 4 wk, while diastolic dysfunction worsened. At 2 wk post-ISO-OV, cardiac function was assessed ex vivo, while mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and stress were assessed in vitro, and Ca(2+) handling in ventricular myocytes. These were complemented with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and RyR2 expression studies. Ex vivo, basal mechanical performance index (MPI) and oxygen consumption rate (MVO2) were unchanged. Nevertheless, upon increase of  demand, by β-adrenergic stimulation (1-100 nM ISO), the MPI versus MVO2 relation decreased and shifted to the right, suggesting MPI and mitochondrial energy production uncoupling. Mitochondria showed decreased oxidative metabolism, membrane fragility, and enhanced oxidative stress. Myocytes presented systolic and diastolic Ca(2+) mishandling, and blunted response to ISO (100 nM), and all these without apparent changes in SERCA, PLB, or RyR2 expression. We suggest that post-ISO-OV mitochondrial dysfunction may underlie decreased cardiac contractility, mainly by depletion of ATP needed for myofilaments and Ca(2+) transport by SERCA, while exacerbated oxidative stress may enhance diastolic RyR2 activity.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216413>MELAS: Monitoring treatment with magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>To assess the utility of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) as a biomarker of response to L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).To describe a case of MELAS treated with L-arginine that showed improvement clinically and on serial MRS METHODS: MRS was performed on a 1.5-Tesla scanner to evaluate a MELAS patient before, during, and after intravenous (IV) L-arginine therapy for the treatment of stroke-like episodes.

The rats were treated accordingly for 4 wk. Glycaemic parameters, lipid profile, stress hormones, and adiponectin levels were measured after the treatment. Relative gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ, lipoprotein lipase as well as gluconeogenic enzymatic activities in different tissues were also determined.Consumption of high-fat, high-sucrose diet triggered hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, which were effectively attenuated by supplementation with glycyrrhizic acid. Glycyrrhizic acid supplementation also effectively reduced circulating adrenaline, alleviated gluconeogenic enzymes overactivity, and promoted the upregulation of lipoprotein lipase expression in the cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscles. A high calorie diet also triggered hypoadiponectinaemia and suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression, which did not improve with glycyrrhizic acid treatment.Supplementation with glycyrrhizic acid could alleviate high calorie diet-induced glucose and lipid  dysregulations by reducing circulatory stress hormones, normalizing gluconeogenic enzyme activities, and elevating muscular lipid uptake. The beneficial effects of these bioactivities outweighed the adverse effects caused by diet-induced repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ expression, resulting in the maintenance of lipid and glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Increased levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite derived from choline and L-carnitine, correlates with CVD and T2DM. However, the precise role of TMAO and its precursors in MetS remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that choline, L-carnitine and TMAO in MetS patients without CVD or T2DM would be altered and correlate with inflammatory markers. Materials and methods This was an exploratory study of 30 patients with nascent MetS (without CVD or T2DM) and 20 matched controls. MetS was defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. TMAO and its precursors were evaluated from each patient's frozen early morning urine samples and quantified using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These amines were correlated with a detailed repertoire of biomarkers of inflammation and adipokines. Results L-carnitine was significantly increased (p = 0.0002) compared to controls. There was a trend for a significant increase in TMAO levels (p = 0.08). Choline was not significantly altered in MetS. L-carnitine correlated significantly with soluble tumor necrosis factor 1 (sTNFR1) and leptin, and inversely to adiponectin. TMAO correlated with IL-6, endotoxin and chemerin. Neither choline, nor L-carnitine significantly correlated with TMAO. Conclusion L-carnitine is directly correlated with markers of inflammation in nascent MetS. Cellular L-carnitine could be a biomediator or marker of inflammation in the pathogenesis of MetS, and the sequelae of CVD and T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26587661>Increased Contractile Response to Noradrenaline Induced By Factors Associated with the  in Cultured Small Mesenteric Arteries.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effect of the  associated risk factors hyperglycemia (glucose [Glc]), hyperinsulinemia (insulin [Ins]) and low-grade inflammation (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα]) on the vasomotor responses of resistance arteries. Isolated small mesenteric arteries from 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats, were suspended for 21-23 h in tissue cultures containing either elevated Glc (30 mmol/l), Ins (100 nmol/l), TNFα (100 ng/ml) or combinations thereof. After incubation, the vascular response to noradrenaline (NA), phenylephrine, isoprenaline and NA in the presence of propranolol (10 µmol/l) was measured by wire myography.Arteries exposed only to combinations of the risk factors showed a significant 1.6-fold increase in the contractile NA sensitivity, which suggests that complex combinations of  risk factors might lead to changes in vascular tone.© 2015 S.

The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in AgRP neurons serves as a major signaling molecule for leptin and insulin, the hormones regulating feeding behavior, energy homeostasis and circulation. However, it is unclear whether PDK1 in AGRP neurons is also involved in regulation of blood pressure. This study explored it by generating and analyzing AgRP neuron-specific PDK1 knockout (Agrp-Pdk1) mice and effect of high salt diet on blood pressure in KO and WT mice was analyzed. Under high salt diet feeding, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of Agrp-Pdk1 mice was significantly elevated compared to Agrp-Cre mice. When the high salt diet was switched to control low salt diet, SBP of Agrp-Pdk1 mice returned to the basal level observed in Agrp-Cre mice within 1 week. In Agrp-Pdk1 mice, urinary noradrenalin excretion and NUCB2 mRNA expression in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were markedly upregulated. Moreover, silencing of NUCB2 in the PVN counteracted the rises in urinary noradrenalin excretions and SBP. These results demonstrate a novel role of PDK1 in AgRP neurons to counteract the high salt diet-induced hypertension by preventing hyperactivation of PVN nesfatin-1 neurons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The relationship between folate-homocysteine  pathway gene polymorphism and Down  (DS) risk has been widely analyzed, but there are limited reports on its correlation with choline metabolism. In the present case-control association study, we investigated the relationship of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) rs12325817, choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) rs12676 and homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) rs3733890) of choline metabolism with risk for DS.Genotyping of 228 mothers of a down  child (DSM) and 200 control mothers (CMs) for all SNPs was performed by PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism method.A significantly increased risk for BHMT +742AA genotype with an odds ratio of 4.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-14.88, P=0.0036) was observed. For PEMT rs12325817 and CHDH rs12676, no significant difference in allelic and genotypic frequencies was observed. In genotypic combination analysis considering PEMT -744GG/CHDH +432GG/BHMT +742GG as the reference combination, PEMT -744GC/CHDH +432GG/BHMT +742GG genotypic combination was significantly higher in DSM compared with that in CMs with an odds ratio of 2.061 (95% CI: 1.10-3.86, P=0.0342). We also observed an epistatic interaction between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133 and choline  pathway gene variants.Our findings indicate impaired choline metabolism showing a greater risk for DS, especially in a population associated with homocysteine-folate impairment.

A global hypothesis.</a></h2><p>Exact cause of the  [MS], a global epidemic, is still unclear. Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man's life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder. This may pave a better way in deciding a personalized holistic protocol with combination of counter regulatory psychoactive medications.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This diet induces a type 2 diabetes/ phenotype with hypertension. In diabetic meriones, body weight increase was associated with hyperglycemia, increased insulinemia, and insulin resistance. Compared to lean meriones, diabetic meriones showed decreased aorta contraction to noradrenaline, which was normalized after NOS inhibition. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to carbachol was enhanced, while relaxing effects of the NO donor SNAP and of diazoxide were unchanged. Insulin-evoked relaxation was depressed in aorta from diabetic meriones, and L-arginine relaxed contracted arteries from diabetic meriones, but not from lean meriones. Urine NOX level and iNOS mRNA muscle expression were significantly higher in diabetic meriones compared to lean animals. These data strongly suggest that iNOS may have a pathogenic role in vascular dysfunction observed in diet-induced diabetic meriones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200465>Glucose and Fat Tolerance Tests Induce Differential Responses in Plasma Choline Metabolites in Healthy Subjects.</a></h2><p>Plasma choline shows associations with plasma glucose and lipids.

This review addresses the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the pathophysiology and therapy of human hypertension. We first discuss the strengths and limitations of various techniques for assessing the sympathetic nervous system in humans, with a focus on heart rate, plasma norepinephrine, microneurographic recording of sympathetic nerve traffic, and measurements of radiolabeled norepinephrine spillover. We then examine the evidence supporting the importance of neuroadrenergic factors as promoters and amplifiers of human hypertension. We expand on the role of the sympathetic nervous system in 2 increasingly common forms of secondary hypertension, namely hypertension associated with obesity and with renal disease. With this background, we examine interventions of sympathetic deactivation as a mode of antihypertensive treatment. Particular emphasis is given to the background and results of recent therapeutic approaches based on carotid baroreceptor stimulation and radiofrequency ablation of the renal nerves.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26805814>VLDL from  Individuals Enhanced Lipid Accumulation in Atria with Association of Susceptibility to Atrial Fibrillation.</a></h2><p> (MetS) represents a cluster of  derangements. Dyslipidemia is an important factor in MetS and is related to atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in MetS (MetS-VLDL) may induce atrial dilatation and vulnerability to AF. VLDL was therefore separated from normal (normal-VLDL) and MetS individuals. Wild type C57BL/6 male mice were divided into control, normal-VLDL (nVLDL), and MetS-VLDL (msVLDL) groups. VLDL (15 µg/g) and equivalent volumes of saline were injected via tail vein three times a week for six consecutive weeks. Cardiac chamber size and function were measured by echocardiography. MetS-VLDL significantly caused left atrial dilation (control, n = 10, 1.64 ± 0.23 mm; nVLDL, n = 7, 1.84 ± 0.13 mm; msVLDL, n = 10, 2.18 ± 0.24 mm; p < 0.0001) at week 6, associated with decreased ejection fraction (control, n = 10, 62.5% ± 7.7%, vs. msVLDL, n = 10, 52.9% ± 9.6%; p < 0.05). Isoproterenol-challenge experiment resulted in AF in young msVLDL mice. Unprovoked AF occurred only in elderly msVLDL mice.

Blood sample collection, and MRS were carried out before and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after SIV inoculation. Significant reduction of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho)/Cr ratios in prefrontal gray matter (PGM) and glutamate/glutamine(Glx)/Cr ratio in striatum, and increase of myo-inositol (mI)/Cr in striatum were observed during acute SIV infection. The metabolite alterations during the SIVsmmFGb infection are largely in agreement with previous findings in other non-human primate models and HIV patients. Also, NAA/Cr in PGM and striatum and Glx/Cr in striatum are negatively correlated with the percentage of CD8+ T cells after the SIV infection, suggesting the interaction between brain metabolite and immune dysfunction. The present study complements previous studies by describing the time course of alterations of brain metabolites during SIVsmmFGb infection. The findings further demonstrate the efficacy of the SIVsmmFGb-infected macaque as a model to characterize central nervous system infection using novel neuroimaging approaches and also as a tool for exploration of novel and advanced neuroimaging techniques in HIV/AIDS studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111740>Anaesthetic-induced cardioprotection in an experimental model of the Takotsubo  - isoflurane vs. propofol.</a></h2><p>Takotsubo  (TS) is an acute cardiac condition with a substantial mortality for which no specific treatment is available. We have previously shown that isoflurane attenuates the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in an experimental TS-model. We compared the effects of equi-anaesthetic doses of isoflurane, propofol and ketamine+midazolam on haemodynamics, global and regional LV systolic function and the activation of intracellular  pathways in experimental TS. We hypothesized that cardioprotection in experimental TS is specific for isoflurane.Forty-five rats were randomized to isoflurane (0.6 MAC, n = 15), propofol (bolus 200 mg/kg+360 mg/kg/h, n = 15) or ketamine (100 mg/kg)+midazolam (10 mg/kg, n = 15) anaesthesia. Arterial pressure, heart rate and body temperature were continuously measured and arterial blood gas analysis was performed intermittently. TS was induced by intraperitoneal injection of isoprenaline, 50 mg/kg. LV echocardiography was performed 90 min after isoprenaline injection. Apical cardiac tissue was analysed by global discovery proteomics and pathway analysis.Isoprenaline-induced changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate or body temperature did not differ between groups. LV ejection fraction was higher and extent of LV akinesia was lower with isoflurane, when compared with the propofol and the ketamine+midazolam groups. In this TS-model, the proteomic analysis revealed an up-regulation of pathways involved in inflammation, coagulation, endocytosis and lipid metabolism. This up-regulation was clearly attenuated with isoflurane compared to propofol.In an experimental model of TS, isoflurane, but not propofol, exerts a cardioprotective effect.

Besides effective control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension, third-generation beta-blockers such as nebivolol offer additional benefits for central hemodynamics and neutral or beneficial effects on metabolism. Emerging clinical data suggest that nebivolol also has similar effects on metabolism in obese hypertensive and hypertensive diabetic patients. The present article will provide a systematic analysis of the pathophysiological links among hypertension, insulin resistance, and . We will also summarize the available clinical evidence regarding the  effects of beta-blockers in hypertensive patients, with an emphasis on nebivolol. Nebivolol exerts neutral or beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients, owing to its nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory and antioxidative properties. Thus, nebivolol could be a favorable therapeutic option for the treatment of hypertension in patients with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770247>Restraint stress exacerbates cardiac and adipose tissue pathology via β-adrenergic signaling in rats with .</a></h2><p>Restraint stress stimulates sympathetic nerve activity and can affect adiposity and metabolism. However, the effects of restraint stress on cardiovascular and  disorders in  (MetS) have remained unclear. We investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade on cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and  disorders in a rat model of MetS. DahlS.Z-Lepr(fa)/Lepr(fa) (DS/obese) rats, derived from a cross between Dahl salt-sensitive and Zucker rats. Rats were exposed to restraint stress (restraint cage, 2 h/day) for 4 wk from 9 wk of age with or without daily subcutaneous administration of the β-AR blocker propranolol (2 mg/kg). Age-matched homozygous lean littermates of DS/obese rats (DahlS.Z-Lepr(+)/Lepr(+) rats) served as control animals. Chronic restraint stress exacerbated hypertension as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress in a manner sensitive to propranolol treatment. Restraint stress attenuated body weight gain in DS/obese rats, and this effect tended to be reversed by propranolol (P = 0.0682). Restraint stress or propranolol did not affect visceral or subcutaneous fat mass. However, restraint stress potentiated cardiac and visceral adipose tissue inflammation in DS/obese rats, and these effects were ameliorated by propranolol. Restraint stress also exacerbated glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid metabolism in a manner sensitive to propranolol. In addition, restraint stress increased urinary norepinephrine excretion, and propranolol attenuated this effect. Our results thus implicate β-ARs in the exacerbation of cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism induced by restraint stress in this model of MetS.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27755119>Sympathetic nerves and hypertension in stress, sleep apnea, and caregiving.</a></h2><p>The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates short-term increases in blood pressure.

The SNS activation found in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caregiving for a severely demented spouse, and obesity more specifically address whether SNS activation might lead to the  and hypertension.Obesity is associated with both increased SNS electrical activity and plasma norepinephrine. This is partly because of frequent OSA among the obese, but OSA does not fully explain SNS activation in obesity. Large stresses activate adrenal epinephrine release, but both animal and human studies indicate that epinephrine decreases aspects of the . On the other hand, norepinephrine is chronically elevated in OSA and among markedly stressed caregivers, and they have an increased incidence of hypertension. This is most striking in OSA, which causes a nocturnal diuresis. Hypertensive patients with OSA are resistant to the antihypertensive effects of diuretics, but respond to drugs that block SNS activity and the effects of renin.The SNS may mediate chronic blood pressure increases in response to specific stresses and alter responses to therapy.

To date, only flibanserin, a centrally acting medication targeting the serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite statistically significant effects on sexual desire, sexual distress, and sexually satisfying events, side-effects are significant, and flibanserin is completely contraindicated with alcohol.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902449>Is N,N-dimethylglycine N-oxide a choline and betaine metabolite?</a></h2><p>Choline metabolism is by oxidation to betaine, which is demethylated to N,N-dimethylglycine; dimethylglycine is oxidatively demethylated to sarcosine. This pathway is important for osmoregulation and as a source of methyl groups. We asked whether another metabolite was involved. We synthesized the N-oxide of dimethylglycine (DMGO) by oxidizing dimethylglycine with peracetic acid, and measured DMGO in human plasma and urine by HPLC-MS/MS with positive ion detection, using two chromatography procedures, based on ion exchange and HILIC separations. The molecular ion DMGOH+ (m/z=120) yielded four significant fragments (m/z=103, 102, 58 and 42). The suspected DMGO peak in human body fluids showed all these fragments, and co-chromatographed with added standard DMGO in both HPLC systems. Typical plasma concentrations of DMGO are under 1 μmol/l. They may be lower in  patients. Urine concentrations are higher, and DMGO has a higher fractional clearance than dimethylglycine, betaine and choline. It was present in all of over 80 human urine and plasma samples assayed. Plasma DMGO concentrations correlate with plasma DMG concentrations, with betaine and choline concentrations, with the osmolyte myo-inositol, and strongly with urinary DMGO excretion.

We examined the impact of PVAT on phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction in the aorta of obese Zucker rats (OZR) and their lean littermates (LZR) by comparing aortic rings with or without PVAT. Subsequently we placed OZR and LZR on a control (C) or an 8% wild blueberry (WB) diet and evaluated the effect of WB consumption on such response. PVAT-released adipokine concentrations were also measured as a function of WB diet. Maximal constrictor force (Fmax) in aortic rings without PVAT was significantly lower in OZR-C compared with LZR-C (0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.06 g, respectively). Following WB diet, Fmax significantly increased in OZR (0.54 ± 0.06 g). In aortas with intact PVAT, Fmax was significantly lower in all groups (0.31 ± 0.06 OZR-C, 0.30 ± 0.05 OZR-WB, 0.29 ± 0.03 LZR-C, and 0.30 ± 0.04 g LZR-WB), but no difference was observed between treatments. PVAT concentrations of monocyte chemoactractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and adiponectin were significantly higher in OZR compared with LZR (+102%, +108%, and +45%, respectively). Following WB diet, PVAT concentrations of interleukin-8 were significantly lower in both OZR (-37%) and LZR (-30%), while adiponectin concentrations significantly increased in both OZR (+11%) and LZR (+16%). MCP-1 concentrations significantly decreased (-31%) in the PVAT of OZR with the WB diet.

Male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either an amino acid control diet (CD) or a methionine-choline deficient diet (MCD) during the 12-week study. Mice were subsequently exposed to either PCB126 (4.9mg/kg) or the PCB mixture, Arcolor1260 (20mg/kg) and analyzed for inflammatory, calorimetry and  parameters. Consistent with the literature, MCD diet-fed mice demonstrated steatosis, indicative of a compromised liver. Mice fed the MCD-diet and subsequently exposed to PCB126 showed observable wasting  leading to mortality. PCB126 and Aroclor1260 exposure worsened hepatic fibrosis exhibited by the MCD groups. Interestingly, PCB126 but not Aroclor1260 induced steatosis and inflammation in CD-fed mice. Mice with liver injury and subsequently exposed to PCBs also manifested  disturbances due to alterations in hepatic gene expression. Furthermore, PCB exposure in MCD-fed mice led to extra-hepatic toxicity such as upregulated circulating inflammatory biomarkers, implicating endothelial cell dysfunction. Taken together, these results indicate that environmental pollution can exacerbate toxicity caused by diet-induced liver injury which may be partially due to dysfunctional energy homeostasis. This is relevant to PCB-exposed human cohorts who suffer from alcohol or diet-induced fatty liver diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Choline is required for the synthesis of the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) and for betaine, an important osmoregulator. Here, choline transport, lipid homeostasis, and mitochondria function were analyzed in skin fibroblasts from POTS and compared with control cells. The choline transporter-like protein 1/solute carrier 44A1 (CTL1/SLC44A1) and mRNA expression were 2-3 times lower in POTS fibroblasts, and choline uptake was reduced 60% (P < 0.05). Disturbances of membrane homeostasis were observed by reduced ratios between PC:phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin:cholesterol, as well as by modified phospholipid fatty acid composition. Choline deficiency also impaired mitochondria function, which was observed by a reduction in oxygen consumption, mitochondrial potential, and glycolytic activity. When POTS cells were treated with choline, transporter was up-regulated, and uptake of choline increased, offering an option for patient treatment. The characteristics of the POTS fibroblasts described here represent a first model of choline and CTL1/SLC44A1 deficiency, in which choline transport, membrane homeostasis, and mitochondrial function are impaired.© FASEB.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827058>Pioglitazone treatment enhances the sympathetic nervous system response to oral carbohydrate load in obese individuals with .</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is associated with blunted sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response to carbohydrate ingestion which may contribute to postprandial hypotension and impaired body weight homeostasis.This study was conducted to examine the effects of pharmacological insulin sensitization on whole-body norepinephrine kinetics during a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in obese, insulin resistant subjects with .Un-medicated individuals (n=42, mean age 56±0.8 yrs, body mass index 34±0.6 kg/m(2)) were randomised to 12-weeks pioglitazone (PIO, 15 mg for 6 weeks, then 30 mg daily) or placebo using a double-blind, parallel group design. Whole-body norepinephrine kinetics (arterial norepinephrine concentration, calculated spillover and clearance rates), spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate and blood pressure were measured at times 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes during OGTT. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (M) and Matsuda index.PIO increased clamp derived glucose utilisation by 35% (P<0.001) and there were concurrent reductions in inflammatory status and plasma triglycerides (P<0.05).

We determined the relationship between adipocyte size and lipid metabolism with cardiovascular risk.Adipocyte size as well as spontaneous (basal) and hormone-stimulated effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism (lipolysis and lipogenesis) were investigated in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of 304 men and 775 women. Subjects were classified into five categories according to Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII)  criteria.Adipocyte size increased with increasing ATPIII score (P < 0.0001). For lipolysis, there was a gradual increase in basal and catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis and a decrease in insulin-mediated inhibition of stimulated lipolysis with ATPIII (P < 0.0001). In contrast, the lipolytic action of atrial natriuretic peptide was similar between ATPIII classes. Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis decreased with increasing score (P < 0.0001). Circulating free fatty acid levels were 50% higher in the top risk category (4-5) compared with the lowest score (P < 0.0001). Fat cell size correlated positively with increasing ATPIII score and lipolysis but negatively with lipogenesis. All these differences were independent of age, sex and body weight status (P < 0.0001 to 0.02 after correction). When all functional measures were put together, maximum insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, insulin-antilipolytic sensitivity and basal lipolysis together explained about 20% in the variation of ATPIII in score.Independently of sex, age and body weight status, a high cardiovascular risk score associates with increased circulating free fatty acid levels and hormone-specific alterations of lipolysis/lipogenesis in enlarged subcutaneous fat cells.© 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28408641>Gastroparesis and lipid metabolism-associated dysbiosis in Wistar-Kyoto rats.</a></h2><p>Altered gastric accommodation and intestinal morphology suggest impaired gastrointestinal (GI) transit may occur in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain, as common in stress-associated functional GI disorders. Because changes in GI transit can alter microbiota composition, we investigated whether these are altered in WKY rats compared with the resilient Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under basal conditions and characterized plasma lipid and metabolite differences. Bead transit was tracked by X-ray imaging to monitor gastric emptying (4 h), small intestine (SI) transit (9 h), and large intestine transit (12 h). Plasma extracts were analyzed by lipid and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cecal microbial composition was determined by Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis using the QIIME pipeline. Stomach retention of beads was 77% for WKY compared with 35% for SD rats. GI transit was decreased by 34% (9 h) and 21% (12 h) in WKY compared with SD rats. Excluding stomach retention, transiting beads moved 29% further along the SI over 4-9 h for WKY compared with SD rats. Cecal , , and unclassified  genera were less abundant in WKY rats, whereas the minor taxa , , and  were higher. Diglycerides, triglycerides, phosphatidyl-, and phosphatidylserine were lower in WKY rats, whereas cholesterol esters and taurocholic acids were higher. The unexpected WKY rat phenotype of delayed gastric emptying, yet rapid SI transit, was associated with altered lipid and metabolite profiles. The delayed gastric emptying of the WKY phenotype suggests this rat strain may be useful as a model for gastroparesis. This study reveals that the stress-prone Wistar-Kyoto rat strain has a baseline physiology of gastroparesis and rapid small intestine transit, together with  changes consistent with lipid metabolism-associated dysbiosis, compared with nonstress-prone rats. This suggests that the Wistar-Kyoto rat strain may be an appropriate animal model for gastroparesis.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29201273>Proinflammatory Cytokines Are Soluble Mediators Linked with Ventricular Arrhythmias and Contractile Dysfunction in a Rat Model of .</a></h2><p> (MS) increases cardiovascular risk and is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias, although the precise mechanisms are still under study.

To date, none of the recent pertaining reports provide deep understanding of the SCO2 disease pathophysiology. To investigate the cardiac pathology of the disease, we were the first to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from SCO2-mutated patients. For iPSC generation, we reprogrammed skin fibroblasts from two SCO2 patients and healthy controls. The first patient was a compound heterozygote to the common E140K mutation, and the second was homozygote for the less common G193S mutation. iPSC were differentiated into cardiomyocytes through embryoid body (EB) formation. To test the hypothesis that the SCO2 mutation is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities, and intracellular Ca -overload resulting in functional derangements and arrhythmias, we investigated in SCO2-mutated iPSC-CMs (compared to control cardiomyocytes): (i) the ultrastructural changes; (ii) the inotropic responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation, increased [Ca ] and angiotensin-II (AT-II); and (iii) the Beat Rate Variability (BRV) characteristics. In support of the hypothesis, we found in the mutated iPSC-CMs major ultrastructural abnormalities and markedly attenuated response to the inotropic interventions and caffeine, as well as delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and increased BRV, suggesting impaired SR Ca handling due to attenuated SERCA activity caused by ATP shortage.

Decreases in ether phospholipids (plasmalogens) in serum (plasma) have been reported in several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, , schizophrenia. Therefore, need for assay of ether phospholipids in plasma may increase in the future. Nowadays, measurement of the ether phospholipids in human plasma seem to depend on tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), but a system for LC/MS/MS is too expensive for most of ordinary clinical laboratories, moreover, use and maintenance of the system are time consuming.Phospholipase A (PLA1) hydrolyzes ester (acyl) bond at the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipids, but it does not act on ether bond at the sn-1 position. We confirmed by a HPLC method that treatment of plasma with PLA1 causes complete disappearance of all diacyl phospholipids, but ether phospholipids remain intact. On the basis of these observations, we developed an enzymatic assay method for ePE and ePC in human plasma by use of a fluorescence plate reader.The amount of ePE in human plasma measured by the enzymatic method was well correlated to that by LC/ESI-MS method (R > 0.94), but the correlation of ePC between the two methods was bit poorer (R > 0.77) than that of ePE.The enzymatic method may be applied to assay of ether phospholipids (ePE and ePC) not only in human plasma but also to assay of ePE and ePC in the other tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26881746>Hepatoprotective Effect and Synergism of Bisdemethoycurcumin against MCD Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the , has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease over the last decade in developed countries. NAFLD includes a spectrum of pathological hepatic changes, such as steatosis, steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) is polyphenolic compounds with a diarylheptanoid skeleton, curcumin close analogues, which is derived from the Curcumae Longae Rhizoma. While the rich bioavailability research of curcumin, BDMC is the poor studies. We investigated whether BDMC has the hepatoprotective effect and combinatory preventive effect with silymarin on methionine choline deficient (MCD)-diet-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups of normal (normal diet without any treatment), MCD diet (MCD diet only), MCD + silymarin (SIL) 100 mg/kg group, MCD + BDMC 100 mg/kg group, MCD + SIL 50 mg/kg + BDMC 50 mg/kg group. Body weight, liver weight, liver function tests, histological changes were assessed and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were conducted after 4 weeks. Mice lost body weight on the MCD-diet, but BDMC did not lose less than the MCD-diet group. Liver weights decreased from BDMC, but they increased significantly in the MCD-diet groups. All liver function test values decreased from the MCD-diet, whereas those from the BDMC increased significantly. The MCD- diet induced severe hepatic fatty accumulation, but the fatty change was reduced in the BDMC. The BDMC showed an inhibitory effect on liver lipogenesis by reducing associated gene expression caused by the MCD-diet. In all experiments, the combinations of BDMC with SIL had a synergistic effect against MCD-diet models. In conclusion, our findings indicate that BDMC has a potential suppressive effect on NAFLD. Therefore, our data suggest that BDMC may act as a novel and potent therapeutic agent against NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581238>Role of dysfunctional adipocytes in cholesterol-induced nonobese .</a></h2><p>Many studies have reported the causes of obese  (MS); however, the causes of nonobese MS (NMS) remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused  problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol. Together, our findings indicate that inflamed dysfunctional adipocytes are critical in NMS, supporting the development of anti-inflammatory agents as potential therapeutic drugs for treating NMS.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27802175>Neurotransmitter alteration in a testosterone propionate-induced polycystic ovarian  rat model.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovarian  (PCOS), one of the leading causes of infertility seen in women, is characterized by anovulation and hyperandrogenism, resulting in ovarian dysfunction. In addition, associations of several  complications like insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia and psychological co-morbidities are well known in PCOS. One of the major factors influencing mood and the emotional state of mind is neurotransmitters. Also, these neurotransmitters are very crucial for GnRH release. Hence, the current study investigates the status of neurotransmitters in PCOS.A PCOS rat model was developed using testosterone. Twenty-one-day-old rats were subcutaneously injected with 10 mg/kg body weight of testosterone propionate (TP) for 35 days. The animals were validated for PCOS characteristics by monitoring estrus cyclicity, serum testosterone and estradiol levels and by histological examination of ovarian sections. Neurotransmitter estimation was carried out using fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods.TP-treated animals demonstrated increased serum testosterone levels with unaltered estradiol content, disturbed estrus cyclicity and many peripheral cysts in the ovary compared to control rats mimicking human PCOS. Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, serotonin, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and epinephrine levels were significantly low in TP-induced PCOS rats compared to control ones, whereas the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the PCOS brain was markedly elevated.Neurotransmitter alteration could be one of the reasons for disturbed gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, consequently directing the ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. Also, decrease in neurotransmitters, mainly NE, serotonin and dopamine (DA) attributes to mood disorders like depression and anxiety in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27247212>Systematic biomarker discovery and coordinative validation for different primary nephrotic syndromes using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The goal of this study is to identify systematic biomarker panel for primary nephrotic syndromes from urine samples by applying a non-target metabolite profiling, and to validate their utility in independent sampling and analysis by multiplex statistical approaches. Nephrotic  (NS) is a nonspecific kidney disorder, which is mostly represented by minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). Since urine metabolites may mirror disease-specific functional perturbations in kidney injury, we examined urine samples for distinctive  changes to identify biomarkers for clinical applications. We developed unbiased multi-component covarianced models from a discovery set with 48 samples (12 healthy controls, 12 MCD, 12 FSGS, and 12 MGN). To extensively validate their diagnostic potential, new batch from 54 patients with primary NS were independently examined a year after. In the independent validation set, the model including citric acid, pyruvic acid, fructose, , and cysteine effectively discriminated each NS using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis except MCD-MGN comparison; nonetheless an additional metabolite multi-composite greatly improved the discrimination power between MCD and MGN. Finally, we proposed the re-constructed  network distinctively dysregulated by the different NSs that may deepen comprehensive understanding of the disease mechanistic, and help the enhanced identification of NS and therapeutic plans for future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, some obese subjects with autonomic imbalance present a dissociation between sympathetic activity-mediated vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Here, we aimed to determine in a rat model of  whether the endothelium endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-NO pathway contributes to counteract the vasopressor effect of the sympathetic system. Rats were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 15 wk. Sympathovagal balance was evaluated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability and plasmatic catecholamine measurements. Blood pressure was measured in the presence or absence of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit the contribution of eNOS. Vascular reactivity was assessed on isolated aortic rings in response to α-adrenergic agonist. The HFS diet increased sympathetic tone, which is characterized by a higher low on the high-frequency spectral power ratio and a higher plasmatic concentration of epinephrine. Despite this, no change in blood pressure was observed. Interestingly, HFS rats exhibited vascular hyporeactivity (-23.6%) to α-adrenergic receptor stimulation that was abolished by endothelial removal or eNOS inhibition (l-NAME). In addition, eNOS phosphorylation (Ser) was increased in response to phenylephrine in HFS rats only. Accordingly, eNOS inhibition in vivo revealed higher blood pressure in HFS rats compared with control rats (147 vs. 126 mmHg for mean blood pressure, respectively). Restrain of adrenergic vasopressor action by endothelium eNOS is increased in HFS rats and contributes to maintained blood pressure in the physiological range. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite the fact that prohypertensive sympathetic nervous system activity is markedly increased in rats with early , they present with normal blood pressure. These observations appear to be explained by increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase response to adrenergic stimulation, which results in vascular hyporeactivity to α-adrenergic stimulation, and therefore blood pressure is preserved in the physiological range.

Cardiovascular and  disorders, the most prevalent clinical challenges worldwide, are epidemiologically linked to poor nutritional habits throughout life. We aimed to understand whether postnatal overnutrition (PO) initiated during lactation affects  markers and vascular function later in life. To test this hypothetical effect, we studied a PO Wistar rat model based on adjusting litter size at the third day of age to three pups and eight for the control group (C). Systemic parameters such as body weight and food intake were significantly increased in adult rats, measured up to 36 weeks. Moreover, fat mass, triglycerides, insulin and systolic blood pressure were all significantly increased in the PO group. Furthermore, we assessed whether these alterations would affect morphological and functional parameters in isolated vessels. Consistent with systemic alterations of the vasculature, contraction of thoracic aortic rings, determined by dose-response curves to norepinephrine (NE), was significantly reduced in PO rats. Histological stains revealed that the relative area of collagen was higher and the elastic fiber density was lower in the distal rings of PO rats. Altogether, our results highlight the critical importance of having a healthy neonatal nutrition to prevent harmful  and vascular alterations during adulthood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060873>Assessment of Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and Left Cerebellar Metabolism in Asperger's  with Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).</a></h2><p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging method to quantify biochemical metabolites in vivo and it can serve as a powerful tool to monitor neurobiochemical profiles in the brain. Asperger's  (AS) is a type of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired social skills and restrictive, repetitive patterns of interest and activities, while intellectual levels and language skills are relatively preserved. Despite clinical aspects have been well-characterized, neurometabolic profiling in the brain of AS remains to be clear. The present study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to investigate whether pediatric AS is associated with measurable neurometabolic abnormalities that can contribute new information on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder.Study participants consisted of 34 children with AS (2-12 years old; mean age 5.2 (±2.0); 28 boys) and 19 typically developed children (2-11 years old; mean age 5.6 (±2.6); 12 boys) who served as the normal control group. The 1H MRS data were obtained from two regions of interest: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left cerebellum.In the ACC, levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), total choline-containing compounds (tCho) and myo-Inositol (mI) were significantly decreased in children with AS compared to controls. On the other hand, no significant group differences in any of the metabolites were found in the left cerebellum. Neither age nor sex accounted for the  findings in the regions.The finding of decreased levels of NAA, tCr, tCho, and mI in the ACC but not in left cerebellar voxels in the AS, suggests a lower ACC neuronal density in the present AS cohort compared to controls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29087480>Myeloid adrenergic signaling via CaMKII forms a feedforward loop of catecholamine biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Type 2 immune response has been shown to facilitate cold-induced thermogenesis and browning of white fat. However, whether alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamine and substantially promote adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue remains controversial. Here, we show that tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was expressed and phosphorylated in adipose-resident macrophages. In addition, the plasma level of adrenaline was increased by cold stress in mice, and treatment of macrophages with adrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TyrH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII or PKA signaling diminished adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of TyrH in primary macrophages. Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII upregulated basal TyrH phosphorylation, while suppressing the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on TyrH in macrophages. Myeloid-specific disruption of CaMKIIγ suppressed both the cold-induced production of norepinephrine and adipose UCP1 expression in vivo and the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on macrophage-dependent activation of brown adipocytes in vitro. Lack of CaMKII signaling attenuated catecholamine production mediated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key inducers of type 2 immune response in primary macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest a feedforward mechanism of adrenaline in adipose-resident macrophages, and that myeloid CaMKII signaling plays an important role in catecholamine production and subsequent beige fat activation.© The Author (2017).

Expression of  was investigated using RNA from different human adult and fetal tissues, transcription of RNA into cDNA, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The  gene was found to be expressed in many human tissues, in particular the brain. The CYB561 protein defect leads to a shortage of ascorbate inside the catecholamine secretory vesicles leading to a functional dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency. The concentration of the catecholamines and downstream metabolites was measured in brain and adrenal tissue of 6  knockout mice (reporter-tagged deletion allele [post-Cre], genetic background C57BL/6NTac). The concentration of norepinephrine and normetanephrine was decreased in whole-brain homogenates of the  mice compared with wild-type mice (<0.01), and the concentration of normetanephrine and metanephrine was decreased in adrenal glands (<0.01), recapitulating the clinical phenotype. The patients responded favorably to treatment with l-dihydroxyphenylserine, which can be converted directly to norepinephrine.This study is the first to implicate cytochrome b561 in disease by showing that pathogenic mutations in  cause an as yet unknown disease in neurotransmitter metabolism causing orthostatic hypotension.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27042260>Effect of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester on Vascular Damage Caused by Consumption of High Fructose Corn Syrup in Rats.</a></h2><p>Fructose corn syrup is cheap sweetener and prolongs the shelf life of products, but fructose intake causes hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. All of them are referred to as  and they are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the harmful effects of increased fructose intake on health and their prevention should take greater consideration. Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE) has beneficial effects on  and vascular function which is important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, there are no known studies about the effect of CAPE on fructose-induced vascular dysfunction. In this study, we examined the effect of CAPE on vascular dysfunction due to high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS (6 weeks, 30% fed with drinking water) caused vascular dysfunction, but treatment with CAPE (50 micromol/kg i.p. for the last two weeks) effectively restored this problem. Additionally, hypertension in HFCS-fed rats was also decreased in CAPE supplemented rats. CAPE supplements lowered HFCS consumption-induced raise in blood glucose, homocysteine, and cholesterol levels. The aorta tissue endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) production was decreased in rats given HFCS and in contrast CAPE supplementation efficiently increased its production. The presented results showed that HFCS-induced cardiovascular abnormalities could be prevented by CAPE treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073300>Association of Oral Contraceptives With Drug-Induced QT Interval Prolongation in Healthy Nonmenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>Women are at higher risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) than men. Androgens are protective. Influence of oral contraception on drug-induced TdP and QT prolongation is controversial.To determine if the extent of sotalol-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and specific T-wave morphological changes, which are biomarkers for the risk of drug-induced TdP, differ in patients according to the androgenic activity of the type of oral contraceptive (OCs) they take compared with patients who took no pills.A cohort of 498 healthy, nonmenopausal women received 80 mg of oral sotalol, a drug with known risk of drug-induced TdP, during this study in a clinical investigation center. The participants also took either no oral contraception or received OCs with different types of progestin: levonorgestrel (which has high androgenic potency), desogestrel or gestodene (which has intermediate androgenic potency), or drospirenone (which has antiandrogenic properties). Women were enrolled from February 2008 to February 2012, and data analysis took place from September 2014 to May 2018.Electrocardiographic changes 3 hours after sotalol administration.A total of 137 women received levonorgestrel, 41 received desogestrel, 51 received gestodene, and 62 received drospirenone; another 207 received no OCs. Baseline QTc duration, plasma sotalol levels, and potassium levels did not significantly differ among groups. However, 3 hours after sotalol exposure, QTc prolongation was greater in women taking drospirenone (mean [SD] increase, 31.2 [12.6] milliseconds from baseline) than in women taking no OCs (mean [SD] increase, 24.6 [12.5] milliseconds; P = .005) or those taking levonorgestrel (mean [SD] increase, 24.2 [13.7] milliseconds; P = .005). The frequency of sotalol-induced T-wave alteration was higher in women taking drospirenone (n = 13 of 61 [21.0%]) than those taking levonorgestrel (n = 20 of 137 [14.6%]) or women taking no OCs (n = 24 of 207 [11.6%]; P = .01). Disproportionality analysis using the European pharmacovigilance database showed a higher reporting rate of OC-induced prolonged QT and ventricular arrhythmias in women taking drospirenone than levonorgestrel (drug-induced long QT : reporting odds ratio [ROR], 6.2 [95% CI, 1.3-30.8]; P = .01; ventricular arrhythmia: ROR, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.7-6.3]; P < .001).Contraceptive pills are associated with variable drug-induced alterations of ventricular repolarization in healthy nonmenopausal women. Drospirenone, an antiandrogenic pill, was associated with increased sotalol-induced QTc prolongation, although absolute QTc prolongation was modest. This finding was supported by the European pharmacovigilance database, which showed a higher reporting rate of suspected OC-induced ventricular arrhythmias on drospirenone compared with levonorgestrel. More data are required on whether antiandrogenic OCs lead to clinically significant adverse events in patients taking QTc-prolonging drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25553245>Discrimination of sepsis stage  profiles with an LC/MS-MS-based metabolomics approach.</a></h2><p>To identify  biomarkers that can be used to differentiate sepsis from systemic inflammatory response  (SIRS), assess severity and predict outcomes.65 patients were involved in this study, including 35 patients with sepsis, 15 patients with SIRS and 15 normal patients. Small metabolites that were present in patient serum samples were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry techniques and analysed using multivariate statistical methods.The  profiling of normal patients and patients with SIRS or sepsis was markedly different. A significant decrease in the levels of lactitol dehydrate and S-phenyl-d-cysteine and an increase in the levels of S-(3-methylbutanoyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E and N-nonanoyl glycine were observed in patients with sepsis in comparison to patients with SIRS (p<0.05). Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock displayed lower levels of glyceryl-phosphoryl-, Ne, Ne dimethyllysine, phenylacetamide and d-cysteine (p<0.05) in their sera. The profiles of patients with sepsis 48 h before death illustrated an obvious state of  disorder, such that S-(3-methylbutanoyl)-dihydrolipoamide-E, phosphatidylglycerol (22:2 (13Z, 16Z)/0:0), glycerophosphocholine and S-succinyl glutathione were significantly decreased (p<0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve of the differential expression of these metabolites was also performed.The body produces significant evidence of  disorder during SIRS or sepsis. Seven metabolites may potentially be used to diagnose sepsis.ClinicalTrial.gov identifier .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459435>Brown-adipose-tissue macrophages control tissue innervation and homeostatic energy expenditure.</a></h2><p>Tissue macrophages provide immunological defense and contribute to the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Here we used constitutive and inducible mutagenesis to delete the nuclear transcription regulator Mecp2 in macrophages. Mice that lacked the gene encoding Mecp2, which is associated with Rett , in macrophages did not show signs of neurodevelopmental disorder but displayed spontaneous obesity, which was linked to impaired function of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Specifically, mutagenesis of a BAT-resident CxCr1 macrophage subpopulation compromised homeostatic thermogenesis but not acute, cold-induced thermogenesis. Mechanistically, malfunction of BAT in pre-obese mice with mutant macrophages was associated with diminished sympathetic innervation and local titers of norepinephrine, which resulted in lower expression of thermogenic factors by adipocytes. Mutant macrophages overexpressed the signaling receptor and ligand PlexinA4, which might contribute to the phenotype by repulsion of sympathetic axons expressing the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A. Collectively, we report a previously unappreciated homeostatic role for macrophages in the control of tissue innervation. Disruption of this circuit in BAT resulted in  imbalance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28654829>Fructose intake exacerbates the contractile response elicited by norepinephrine in mesenteric vascular bed of rats via increased endothelial prostanoids.</a></h2><p>Chronic fructose intake induces major cardiovascular and  disturbances and is associated with the development of hypertension due to changes in vascular function. We hypothesized that high fructose intake for 6 weeks would cause  and lead to initial vascular dysfunction. Male Wistar rats were assigned to receive fructose (FRU, 10%) or drinking water (CON) for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was evaluated by tail plethysmography. Fasting glucose, insulin and glucose tolerance were measured at the end of the follow-up. Mesenteric vascular bed reactivity was tested before and after pharmacological blockade. Western blot analysis was performed for iNOS, eNOS, Nox2 and COX-2. DHE staining was used for vascular superoxide anion detection. Vessel structure was evaluated by optical and electronic microscopy. Fructose intake did not alter blood pressure, but did increase visceral fat deposition and fasting glucose as well as impair insulin and glucose tolerance. Fructose increased NE-induced vasoconstriction compared with CON, and this difference was abrogated by indomethacin perfusion as well as endothelium removal. ACh-induced relaxation was preserved, and the NO modulation tested after L-NAME perfusion was similar between groups. SNP-induced relaxation was not altered. Inducible NOS was increased; however, there were no changes in eNOS, Nox2 or COX-2 protein expression. Basal or stimulated superoxide anion production was not changed by fructose intake. In conclusion, high fructose intake increased NE-induced vasoconstriction through the endothelial prostanoids even in the presence of a preserved endothelium-mediated relaxation. No major changes in vessel structure were detected.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In order to identify nutrients required for the survival or multiplication of EHEC in the bovine GIT, we compared the transcriptomes of the EHEC O157:H7 reference strain EDL933 cultured in vitro in bovine digestive contents (DCs) (rumen, small intestine and rectum) using RNA-sequencing.Gene expression profiles showed that EHEC EDL933 activated common but also specific  pathways to survive in the different bovine DCs. Mucus-derived carbohydrates seem important in EHEC nutrition in posterior DCs (small intestine and rectum) but not in rumen content. Additional carbohydrates (xylose, ribose, mannitol, galactitol) as well as gluconeogenic substrates (aspartate, serine, glycerol) would also be used by EHEC as carbon and/or nitrogen sources all along the bovine GIT including the rumen. However, xylose, GalNac, ribose and fucose transport and/or assimilation encoding genes were over-expressed during incubation in rectum content compared with rumen and intestine contents, and genes coding for maltose transport were only induced in rectum. This suggests a role for these carbohydrates in the colonization of the cattle rectum, considered as the major site for EHEC multiplication. In contrast, the transcription of the genes associated with the assimilation of , an important nitrogen source for EHEC, was poorly induced in EHEC growing in rectum content, suggesting that  is mainly assimilated in the cattle rumen and small intestine. Respiratory flexibility would also be required for EHEC survival because of the redundancy of dehydrogenases and reductases simultaneously induced in the bovine DCs, probably in response to the availability of electron donors and acceptors.EHEC EDL933 showed a high flexibility in the activation of genes involved in respiratory pathways and assimilation of carbon and nitrogen sources, most of them from animal origin. This may allow the bacterium to adapt and survive in the various bovine GIT compartments. Obtaining a better understanding of EHEC physiology in bovine GIT is a key step to ultimately propose strategies to limit EHEC carriage and shedding by cattle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25689120>Early glial activation precedes neurodegeneration in the cerebral cortex after SIV infection: a 3D, multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.</a></h2><p>As ∼40% of HIV-infected individuals experience neurocognitive decline, we investigated whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ((1) H-MRSI) detects early  abnormalities in the cerebral cortex of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus monkey model of neuroAIDS.The brains of five rhesus monkeys before and 4 or 6 weeks after SIV infection (with CD8(+) T-cell depletion) were assessed with T2 -weighted quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 16×16×4 multivoxel (1) H-MRSI (echo time/repetition time = 33/1440 ms). Grey matter and white matter masks were segmented from the animal MRIs and used to produce cortical masks co-registered to (1) H-MRSI data to yield cortical metabolite concentrations of the glial markers myo-inositol (mI), creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho), and of the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA). The cortex volume within the large, 28 cm(3) (∼35% of total monkey brain) volume of interest was also calculated for each animal pre- and post-infection. Mean metabolite concentrations and cortex volumes were compared pre- and post-infection using paired sample t-tests.The mean (± standard deviation) pre-infection concentrations of the glial markers mI, Cr and Cho were 5.8 ± 0.9, 7.2 ± 0.4 and 0.9 ± 0.1 mM, respectively; these concentrations increased 28% (p ≈ 0.06), 15% and 10% (both p < 0.05), respectively, post-infection. The mean concentration of neuronal marker NAA remained unchanged (7.0 ± 0.6 mM pre-infection vs. 7.3 ± 0.8 mM post-infection; p ≈ 0.37). The mean cortex volume was also unchanged (8.1 ± 1.1 cm(3) pre-infection vs. 8.3 ± 0.5 cm(3) post-infection; p ≈ 0.76).These results support the hypothesis that early cortical glial activation occurs after SIV infection prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This suggests HIV therapeutic interventions should potentially target early glial activation in the cerebral cortex.© 2015 British HIV Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27138530>The role of rumen-protected choline in hepatic function and performance of transition dairy cows.</a></h2><p>High-producing dairy cows enter a period of negative energy balance during the first weeks of lactation. Energy intake is usually sufficient to cover the increase in energy requirements for fetal growth during the period before calving, but meeting the demand for energy is often difficult during the early stages of lactation. A catabolic state predominates during the transition period, leading to the mobilisation of energy reserves (NEFA and amino acids) that are utilised mainly by the liver and muscle. Increased uptake of mobilised NEFA by the liver, combined with the limited capacity of hepatocytes to either oxidise fatty acids for energy or to incorporate esterified fatty acids into VLDL results in fatty liver  and ketosis. This  disturbance can affect the general health, and it causes economic losses. Different nutritional strategies have been used to restrict negative effects associated with the energy challenge in transition cows. The provision of choline in the form of rumen-protected choline (RPC) can potentially improve liver function by increasing VLDL exportation from the liver. RPC increases gene expression of microsomal TAG transfer protein and APOB100 that are required for VLDL synthesis and secretion. Studies with RPC have looked at gene expression,  hormones, metabolite profiles, milk production and postpartum reproduction. A reduction in liver fat and enhanced milk production has been observed with RPC supplementation. However, the effects of RPC on health and reproduction are equivocal, which could reflect the lack of sufficient dose-response studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965593>Isoproterenol exacerbates hyperglycemia and modulates chromium distribution in mice fed with a high fat diet.</a></h2><p>Isoproterenol (ISO), a nonselective β-adrenoceptor agonist for treating bradycardia and asthma, has been proposed to raise blood glucose level. Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an obesity mouse model.Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an obesity animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their  parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile, insulin level time profile, insulin sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas insulin levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic  in the obesity animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
