The purpose of this study was to create a baseline carbon (C) budget of a conventionally managed sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) production system on Maui, Hawaii, and compare it to three different future  cropping scenarios: (1) conventional sugarcane with a 50% deficit irrigation (sugarcane 50%), () ratoon harvested napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.) with 100% irrigation (napier 100%), and (3) ratoon harvested napiergrass with a 50% deficit irrigation (napier 50%).The differences among cropping scenarios for the fossil fuel-based emissions associated with agricultural inputs and field operations were small compared to the differences associated with pre- burn emissions and soil C stock under ratoon  and zero-tillage management. Burn emissions were nearly 2000 kg C ha year in the conventional sugarcane; whereas soil C gains were approximately 4500 kg C ha year in the surface layer of the soil profile for napiergrass. Further, gains in deep soil profile C were nearly three times greater than in the surface layer. Therefore, net global warming potential was greatest for conventional sugarcane and least for napier 50% when deep profile soil C was included. Per unit of biomass yield, the most greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive scenario was sugarcane 50% with a GHG Index (GHGI, positive values imply a climate impact, so a more negative value is preferable for climate change mitigation) of 0.11 and the least intensive was napiergrass 50% when a deep soil profile was included (GHGI = - 0.77).Future scenarios for  or fuel production on former sugarcane land across the Pacific Basin or other volcanic islands should concentrate on ratoon-harvested crops that maintain yields under zero-tillage management for long intervals between kill  and reduce costs of field operations and agricultural input requirements. For napiergrass on Maui and elsewhere, deficit irrigation maximized climate change mitigation of the system and reduced water use should be part of planning a sustainable, diversified agricultural landscape.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31450636>A High-Voltage -Harvesting Interface for Irregular Kinetic  Harvesting in IoT Systems with 1365% Improvement Using All-NMOS Power Switches and Ultra-low Quiescent Current Controller.</a></h1><p>An -harvesting interface for kinetic  harvesting from high-voltage piezoelectric and triboelectric generators is proposed in this paper. Unlike the conventional kinetic -harvesting interfaces optimized for continuous sinusoidal input, the proposed harvesting interface can efficiently handle irregular and random high voltage  inputs. An N-type mosfet (NMOS)-only power stage design is introduced to simplify power switch drivers and minimize conduction loss. Controller active mode power is also reduced by introducing a new voltage peak detector. For efficient operation with potentially long intervals between random kinetic  inputs, standby power consumption is minimized by monitoring the input with a 43 pW wake-up controller and power-gating all other circuits during the standby intervals. The proposed harvesting interface can   from a wide range of  inputs, 10 s of nJ to 10 s of µJ /pulse, with an input voltage range of 5-200 V and an output range of .4-4 V under discontinuous as well as continuous excitation. The proposed interface is examined in two scenarios, with integrated power stage devices (maximum input 45 V) and with discrete power stage devices (maximum input 200 V), and the harvesting efficiency is improved by up to 600% and 1350%, respectively, compared to the case when harvesting is performed with a full bridge rectifier.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28852736>EFFECT OF  DATE AND STALK SECTION ON SELECTED STRENGTH CHARACTERISTICS OF TURKISH OREGANO ( L).</a></h1><p>The time required to  plant crops is important to the plant properties. It is affected by design of the  equipment and the desire for high-quality products with low  usage.Strength characteristics of  L., an important medicinal aromatic plant, harvested on , 9, 16 and 23 July, 2012-2014 (H1, H2, H3 and H4, respectively) were measured at the bottom and top sections of the stalk. Measurements included maximum force, bio-yield force, shearing force, bending stress, shearing stress, shearing , and shearing deformation.The highest maximum force (35.17 N) was at H4 on the bottom section, and the lowest was at H1 on the top. Maximum values for bio-yield force, shearing force, and bending stress were at H4 on the bottom section, and corresponding minimum values were at H1 on the top section. Shearing stress decreased at successive  dates for both stalk sections. The minimum shearing  was at H4, (0.13 J and 0.06 J for bottom and top, respectively). Strength measurements for bottom sections of the stalk were greater than those for top sections.When reduced harvesting force is needed because of harvester design or  procedures, harvesting near the top of the stalk is recommended.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984885>Comparative field performances between conventional combine and mid-size combine in wetland rice cultivation.</a></h1><p>In paddy cultivation, harvesting is the most important operation, which needs suitable machinery. Thus, this study was carried out to compare field performances and  and environmental effect between the conventional 5 m cutting width NEW HOLLAND CLAYSON 8080, 82 kW@2500 rpm combine harvester running on a total net area of 42.78 ha of plots for two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation seasons and the new mid-size .7 m cutting width WORLD STAR WS7.0, 76 kW@2600 rpm combine harvester running on a total net area of 16.95 ha of plots for two rice cultivation seasons. The conventional combine as compared to mid-size combine showed 14.4% greater mean fuel consumptions (21.13 versus 18.46 l/ha), 31.1% greater mean effective field capacity (0.69 versus 0.53 ha/h), 5.23% greater cornering time (turning time) percentage of total time (8.28% versus 3.05%) and 1.41% greater reversing time percentage of total time (7.% versus 5.79%) but 20.90% lesser mean operational speed (3.24 versus 4.10 km/h), 11.69% lesser effective time percentage of total time (60.0%versus 71.69%h/ha), 10.8% lesser mean field efficiency (64.3% versus 72.1%). In terms of total  use the conventional combine showed 24.64% greater mean total  use in the harvesting operation (1445.81 versus 1160.00 MJ/ha), 14.46% greater mean fuel  (1010.014 versus 882.39 MJ/ha), 56.47% greater mean machinery  (431.32 versus 275.65 MJ/ha) and 59.25% greater mean human  (3.48 and .18 MJ/ha), this cause 26.12% greater mean total Green House Gas emission (GHG) than the mid-size combine. The results revealed that the mid-size combine is more suitable in conducting the  operation in rice field in Malaysia than the conventional combine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29393876>La-CTP: Loop-Aware Routing for -Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks.</a></h1><p>In emerging -harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSN), the sensor nodes can  environmental  to drive their operation, releasing the user's burden in terms of frequent battery replacement, and even enabling perpetual sensing systems. In EH-WSN applications, usually, the node in -harvesting or recharging state has to stop working until it completes the  replenishment. However, such temporary departures of recharging nodes severely impact the packet routing, and one immediate result is the routing loop problem. Controlling loops in connectivity-intermittent EH-WSN in an efficient way is a big challenge in practice, and so far, users still lack of effective and practicable routing protocols with loop handling. Based on the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) widely used in traditional wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a loop-aware routing protocol for real-world EH-WSNs, called La-CTP, which involves a new parent updating metric and a proactive, adaptive beaconing scheme to effectively suppress the occurrence of loops and unlock unavoidable loops, respectively. We constructed a 100-node testbed to evaluate La-CTP, and the experimental results showed its efficacy and efficiency.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420011>Liquid-Metal-Based Super-Stretchable and Structure-Designable Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Wearable Electronics.</a></h1><p>The rapid advancement of intelligent wearable electronics imposes the emergent requirement for power sources that are deformable, compliant, and stretchable. Power sources with these characteristics are difficult and challenging to achieve. The use of liquid metals as electrodes may provide a viable strategy to produce such power sources. In this work, we propose a liquid-metal-based triboelectric nanogenerator (LM-TENG) by employing Galinstan as the electrode and silicone rubber as the triboelectric and encapsulation layer. The small Young's modulus of the liquid metal ensures the electrode remains continuously conductive under deformations, stretching to a strain as large as ∼300%. The surface oxide layer of Galinstan effectively prevents the liquid Galinstan electrode from further oxidization and permeation into silicone rubber, yielding outstanding device stability. Operating in the single-electrode mode at 3 Hz, the LM-TENG with an area of 6 × 3 cm produces an open-circuit voltage of 354.5 V, transferred short-circuit charge of 123. nC, short-circuit current of 15.6 μA, and average power density of 8.43 mW/m, which represent outstanding performance values for TENGs. Further, the LM-TENG maintains stable performance under various deformations, such as stretching, folding, and twisting. LM-TENGs in different forms, such as bulk-shaped, bracelet-like, and textile-like, are all able to  mechanical  from human walking, arm shaking, or hand patting to sustainably drive wearable electronic devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569377>Immune regulation by microbiome metabolites.</a></h1><p>Commensal microbes and the host immune system have been co-evolved for mutual regulation. Microbes regulate the host immune system, in part, by producing metabolites. A mounting body of evidence indicates that diverse microbial metabolites profoundly regulate the immune system via host receptors and other target molecules. Immune cells express metabolite-specific receptors such as P2X , GPR41, GPR43, GPR109A, aryl hydrocarbon receptor precursor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), TGR5 and other molecular targets. Microbial metabolites and their receptors form an extensive array of signals to respond to changes in nutrition, health and immunological status. As a consequence, microbial metabolite signals contribute to nutrient  from diet, and regulate host metabolism and the immune system. Importantly, microbial metabolites bidirectionally function to promote both tolerance and immunity to effectively fight infection without developing inflammatory diseases. In pathogenic conditions, adverse effects of microbial metabolites have been observed as well. Key immune-regulatory functions of the metabolites, generated from carbohydrates, proteins and bile acids, are reviewed in this article.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31187039>Nutritional Composition, Antinutritional Factors, Antioxidant Activities, Functional Properties, and Sensory Evaluation of Cactus Pear () Seeds Grown in Tigray Region, Ethiopia.</a></h1><p>Cactus pear () seed is one of the main components of fruit crops. The seed is tightly packed together in a mucilaginous structure inside the endocarp of the fruit. The present study investigated the nutritional composition, antinutritional factors, and phytochemical and sensory attributes of cactus pear seeds collected from Hatset Kebele, Hawzen Woreda, Tigray region.

Recent advances in high-throughput MS combined with improved metabolomics techniques and bioinformatic tools provide new opportunities for dietary biomarker development. In September 2018, the NIH organized a -d workshop to engage nutrition and omics researchers and explore the potential of multiomics approaches in nutritional biomarker research. The current Perspective summarizes key gaps and challenges identified, as well as the recommendations from the workshop that could serve as a guide for scientists interested in dietary biomarkers research. Topics addressed included study designs for biomarker development, analytical and bioinformatic considerations, and integration of dietary biomarkers with other omics techniques. Several clear needs were identified, including larger controlled feeding studies, testing a variety of foods and dietary patterns across diverse populations, improved reporting standards to support study replication, more chemical standards covering a broader range of food constituents and human metabolites, standardized approaches for biomarker validation, comprehensive and accessible food composition databases, a common ontology for dietary biomarker literature, and methodologic work on statistical procedures for intake biomarker discovery. Multidisciplinary research teams with appropriate expertise are critical to moving forward the field of dietary biomarkers and producing robust, reproducible biomarkers that can be used in public health and clinical research.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29714332>Spectral Monte Carlo simulation of collimated solar irradiation transfer in a water-filled prismatic louver.</a></h1><p>The Monte Carlo model was developed to simulate the collimated solar irradiation transfer and   in a hollow louver made of silica glass and filled with water. The full solar spectrum from the air mass 1.5 database was adopted and divided into various discrete bands for spectral calculations. The band-averaged spectral properties for the silica glass and water were obtained. Ray tracing was employed to find the solar  harvested by the louver. Computational efficiency and accuracy were examined through intensive comparisons of different band partition approaches, various photon numbers, and element divisions. The influence of irradiation direction on the solar   efficiency was scrutinized.

Recently, black phosphorus (BP), as a new staring 2D material, has been extensively studied as photocatalytic materials due to its broad light absorption and tunable bandgap. Herein, we report a novel ternary nanocomposite, BP-Ag/TiO, prepared through controlled deposition of Ag clusters on the surface of TiO nanocrystals and then incorporated to BP nanosheets. The BP-Ag/TiO nanocomposite has shown excellent photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible and NIR light irradiation. About 100% and even 25% of MB was degraded in 85 min under >420 nm and >780 nm irradiation, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BP-Ag/TiO nanocomposite was mainly ascribed to the sensitization of BP nanosheets by fully  of solar light and high electron-hole separation efficiency. We believe that the BP-Ag/TiO nanocomposite will be an effective photofunctional material in full-spectrum solar  conversion and opens up a new door for the development of solar light driven photocatalysts for the remediation of environmental pollution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although caribou populations observe natural cycles of abundance and scarcity, several caribou herds across the Circumpolar North have experienced dramatic declines in recent decades due to a range of interrelated factors. Broadly, the objectives of this study are to examine food and nutrition security in relation to wildlife population and management status across Inuit Nunangat (the Inuit homeland, consisting of four regions across the Canadian Arctic). Specifically, we: (1) characterize the contribution of caribou to Inuit nutrition across northern Canada and () evaluate the population and management status of caribou herds/populations harvested by Inuit. Dietary data were derived from the 2007-2008 Inuit Health Survey, which included dietary information for Inuit adults (n = 2097) residing in thirty-six communities, spanning three regions (the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut, and Nunatsiavut) of the Canadian North. Published information regarding the range, abundance, status, and management status of caribou herds/populations was collected through document analysis and was validated through consultation with northern wildlife experts (territorial governments, co-management, and/or Inuit organizations). While caribou contributed modestly to total diet  (3-11% of intake) across the regions, it was the primary source of iron (14-37%), zinc (18-41%), copper (12-39%), riboflavin (15-39%), and vitamin B12 (27-52%), as well as a top source of protein (13-35%). Restrictions on Inuit subsistence  ( quotas or bans) are currently enacted on at least six northern caribou herds/populations with potential consequences for country food access for over twenty-five Inuit communities across Canada. A holistic multi-sectorial approach is needed to ensure the sustainability of wildlife populations, while supporting Inuit food and nutrition security in the interim.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847167>Nutritional and sensory quality of composite extruded complementary food.</a></h1><p>Complementary foods in Ethiopia have nutritional and sensory limitations which can be attributed to cereal-dominated ingredients and lack of appropriate processing techniques. This study aimed to optimize the nutritional and sensory quality of complementary food product through compositing and extrusion of various local ingredients. A constrained D-optimal mixture experiment with 13 runs was designed. Accordingly, 55-65 g/100 g oats, 11-23 g/100 g soybean and 6-11 g/100 g linseed, and a premix of 9.9 g/100 g sugar, 0.6 g/100 g table salt, three g/100 g moringa and 1.5 g/100 g fenugreek were blended and extruded using a co-rotating twin screw extruder with set parameters. Statistical model evaluation and optimization were done using Minitab version 16 software package. There is a statistically significant ( < 0.05) association between the blend of oats and soybean, oats and linseed, soybean and linseed, and the protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, ash, β-carotene content as well as aroma, taste, and consistency. On the contrary, there is a no statistically significant ( < 0.05) association between the blends and moisture, , and zinc content together with appearance and overall acceptability. The optimal blending ratio was 55.0 g/100 g oats, 21.0 g/100 g soybean, and 9.0 g/100 g linseed plus 15.0 g/100 g premix.

All the silages were stored at 25 ºC. Parameters such as pH, microorganism and volatile fatty acid contents, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, net gas, metabolizable , organic matter digestibility, dry matter intake and relative feed value were measured to determine fermentation quality, chemical compositions and relative feed value of alfalfa silages.Significant differences were found among the control and treated groups in terms of pH and microorganism contents at all opening times and crude protein, net gas, metabolizable  and organic matter digestibility of final silage. The pH values ranged from 4.70 to 5.52 for all treatments and control silage had the highest value of overall treatments at T75d silages.

The obtained physical properties together with theoretical calculations analyzed from these new molecules establish a clear structure-property relationship, in which the feature of central acceptor ,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), naphtho[1,-c:5,6-c']bis[1,,5]thiadiazole (NT), and ,1,3-naphthothiadiazole (NBT) plays the crucial role for governing the physical characteristics. The optimized device configured as ITO/HAT-CN/TAPC/TCTA/TCTA:3P-T2T:5% emitter/3P-T2T/LiF/Al gave a record-high efficiency of orange red (591 nm, 15%), red (647 nm, 10%), and deep-red/NIR (689 nm, 9%) electroluminescent devices. The effective  of triplet excitons with an exciplex-forming system in conjunction with efficient  transfer between the exciplex and the dopant is beneficial for such high device efficiencies. More importantly, the stable exciplex-forming cohost and fast radiative decay rate of DTPNT render this particular device exhibiting high device stability as indicated by the low efficiency roll-off under high current densities (EQE (external quantum efficiency) values of 8.1% at 1000 cd m and 6.8% at 10,000 cd m).

Phycobiliproteins in the phycobilisome cores, such as allophycocyanins, absorb far-red light to funnel  to the reaction centers. Therefore, allophycocyanin subunits have been engineered as far-red fluorescent proteins, such as BDFP1.6. However, most current fluorescent probes have small Stokes shifts, which limit their applications in multicolor bioimaging. mCherry is an excellent fluorescent protein that has maximal emittance in the red spectral range and a high fluorescence quantum yield, and thus, can be used as a donor for  transfer to a far-red acceptor, such as BDFP1.6, by FRET. In this study, mCherry was fused with BDFP1.6, which resulted in a highly bright far-red fluorescent protein, BDFP2.0, with a large Stokes shift (≈79 nm). The excitation  was absorbed maximally at 587 nm by mCherry and transferred to BDFP1.6 efficiently; thus emitting strong far-red fluorescence maximally at 666 nm. The effective brightness of BDFP2.0 in mammalian cells was 4.-fold higher than that of iRFP670, which has been reported as the brightest far-red fluorescent protein. The large Stokes shift of BDFP2.0 facilitates multicolor bioimaging. Therefore, BDFP2.0 not only biolabels mammalian cells, including human cells, but also biolabels various intracellular components in dual-color imaging.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, cost-efficient  of microalgae remains a major challenge to commercial-scale algal biofuel production. We first investigated the potential of electrolytic water as a flocculant for harvesting  sp. Alkaline electrolyzed water (AEW) is produced at the cathode through water electrolysis. It contains mineral ions such as Na, K, Ca, and Mg that can act as flocculants. The flocculation activity with AEW was evaluated via culture density, AEW concentration, medium pH, settling time, and ionic strength analyses. The flocculation efficiency was 88.7% at 20% AEW (pH 8, 10 min) with a biomass concentration of  g/l. The initial biomass concentration and medium pH had significant influences on the flocculation activity of AEW. A viability test of flocculated microalgal cells was conducted using Evans blue stain, and the cells appeared intact. Furthermore, the growth rate of  sp. in recycled flocculation medium was similar to the growth rate in fresh F/ medium. Our results suggested that AEW flocculation could be a very useful and affordable methodology for fresh biomass harvesting with environmentally friendly easy operation in part of the algal biofuel production process.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30093831>Climate change mitigation strategies in the forest sector: biophysical impacts and economic implications in British Columbia, Canada.</a></h1><p>Managing forests to increase carbon sequestration or reduce carbon emissions and using wood products and bioenergy to store carbon and substitute for other emission-intensive products and fossil fuel  have been considered effective ways to tackle climate change in many countries and regions. The objective of this study is to examine the climate change mitigation potential of the forest sector by developing and assessing potential mitigation strategies and portfolios with various goals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. From a systems perspective, mitigation potentials of five individual strategies and their combinations were examined with regionally differentiated implementations of changes. We also calculated cost curves for the strategies and explored socio-economic impacts using an input-output model. Our results showed a wide range of mitigation potentials and that both the magnitude and the timing of mitigation varied across strategies. The greatest mitigation potential was achieved by improving the  utilization, shifting the commodity mix to longer-lived wood products, and using  residues for bioenergy. The highest cumulative mitigation of 421 MtCOe for BC was estimated when employing the strategy portfolio that maximized domestic mitigation during 2017-2050, and this would contribute 35% of BC's greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2050 at less than $100/tCOe and provide additional socio-economic benefits. This case study demonstrated the application of an integrated systems approach that tracks carbon stock changes and emissions in forest ecosystems, harvested wood products (HWPs), and the avoidance of emissions through the use of HWPs and is therefore applicable to other countries and regions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28950057>Effect of Divalent Cations on RED Performance and Cation Exchange Membrane Selection to Enhance Power Densities.</a></h1><p>Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a membrane-based renewable  technology that can   from salinity gradients. The anticipated feed streams are natural river and seawater, both of which contain not only monovalent ions but also divalent ions. However, RED using feed streams containing divalent ions experiences lower power densities because of both uphill transport and increased membrane resistance. In this study, we investigate the effects of divalent cations (Mg and Ca) on RED and demonstrate the mitigation of those effects using both novel and existing commercial cation exchange membranes (CEMs). Monovalent-selective Neosepta CMS is known to block divalent cations transport and can therefore mitigate reductions in stack voltage. The new multivalent-permeable Fuji T1 is able to transport divalent cations without a major increase in resistance. Both strategies significantly improve power densities compared to standard-grade CEMs when performing RED using streams containing divalent cations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892809>An Integrated Approach Toward Renewable  Storage Using Rechargeable Ag@Ni Co S-Based Hybrid Supercapacitors.</a></h1><p>Self-powered charging systems in conjunction with renewable  conversion and storage devices have attracted promising attention in recent years. In this work, a prolific approach to design a wind/solar-powered rechargeable high- density pouch-type hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is proposed. The pouch-type HSC is fabricated by engineering nature-inspired nanosliver (nano-Ag) decorated Ni Co S forest-like nanostructures on Ni foam (nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam) as a battery-type electrode and porous activated carbon as a capacitive-type electrode. Initially, the core-shell-like NCS FNs/Ni foam is prepared via a single-step wet-chemical method, followed by a light-induced growth of nano-Ag onto it for enhancing the conductivity of the composite. Utilizing the synergistic effects of forest-like nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam as a composite electrode, the fabricated device shows a maximum capacitance of 1104.14 mF cm at a current density of 5 mA cm and it stores superior  and power densities of 0.36 mWh cm and 27.22 mW cm , respectively along with good cycling stability, which are higher than most of previous reports. The high- storage capability of HSCs is further connected to wind fans and solar cells to  renewable . The wind/solar charged HSCs can effectively operate various electronic devices for a long time, enlightening its potency for the development of sustainable  systems.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The great challenge is to optimize trade-offs between carbon  and water use by choosing cultivars that combine low water use with high productivity.Regional scenarios were simulated over a range of willow genotype × environment interactions for the major UK soil × climate variations with the process-based model LUCASS. Soil available water capacity (SAWC) ranged from 51 to 251 mm and weather represented the north-west (wet, cool), north-east (dry, cool), south-west (wet, warm) and south-east (dry, warm) of the UK. Scenario simulations were evaluated for small/open narrow-leaf (NL) versus large/closed broad-leaf (BL) willow canopy phenotypes using baseline (1965-89) and warmer recent (1990-2014) weather data.The low productivity under baseline climate in the north could be compensated by choosing BL cultivars (e.g. 'Endurance'). Recent warmer climate increased average productivity by 0.5-.5 t ha-1, especially in the north. The modern NL cultivar 'Resolution' had the smallest and most efficient water use. On marginal soils (SAWC <100 mm), yields remained below an economic threshold of 9 t ha-1 more frequently under baseline than recent climate. In the drought-prone south-east, 'Endurance' yielded less than 'Resolution', which consumed on average 17 mm year-1 less water. Assuming a planting area of 10 000 ha, in droughty years between 1.3 and 4.5 × 106 m3 of water could be saved, with a small yield penalty, for 'Resolution'.With an increase in air temperature and occasional water scarcities expected with climate change, high-yielding NL cultivars should be the preferred choice for sustainable use of marginal lands and reduced competition with agricultural food crops.© The Author(s) 2019.

The recently developed thermo-osmotic  conversion (TOEC) process has the potential to   from low-grade heat sources by using a temperature difference to create a pressurized liquid flux across a membrane, which can be converted to mechanical work via a turbine. In this study, we perform the first analysis of  efficiency and the expected performance of the TOEC technology, focusing on systems utilizing hydrophobic porous vapor-gap membranes and water as a working fluid. We begin by developing a framework to analyze realistic mass and heat transport in the process, probing the impact of various membrane parameters and system operating conditions. Our analysis reveals that an optimized system can achieve heat-to-electricity  conversion efficiencies up to 4.1% (34% of the Carnot efficiency) with hot and cold working temperatures of 60 and 20 °C, respectively, and an operating pressure of 5 MPa (50 bar). Lower  efficiencies, however, will occur in systems operating with high power densities (>5 W/m) and with finite-sized heat exchangers. We identify that the most important membrane properties for achieving high performance are an asymmetric pore structure, high pressure resistance, a high porosity, and a thickness of 30 to 100 μm. We also quantify the benefits in performance from utilizing deaerated water streams, strong hydrodynamic mixing in the membrane module, and high heat exchanger efficiencies. Overall, our study demonstrates the promise of full-scale TOEC systems to extract  from low-grade heat and identifies key factors for performance optimization moving forward.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29595054>High-Output Lead-Free Flexible Piezoelectric Generator Using Single-Crystalline GaN Thin Film.</a></h1><p>Piezoelectric generators (PEGs) are a promising power source for future self-powered electronics by converting ubiquitous ambient mechanical  into electricity. However, most of the high-output PEGs are made from lead zirconate titanate, in which the hazardous lead could be a potential risk to both humans and environment, limiting their real applications. III-Nitride (III-N) can be a potential candidate to make stable, safe, and efficient PEGs due to its high chemical stability and piezoelectricity. Also, PEGs are preferred to be flexible rather than rigid, to better  the low-magnitude mechanical . Herein, a high-output, lead-free, and flexible PEG (F-PEG) is made from GaN thin film by transferring a single-crystalline epitaxial layer from silicon substrate to a flexible substrate. The output voltage, current density, and power density can reach 28 V, 1 μA·cm, and 6 μW·cm, respectively, by bending the F-PEG. The generated electric power by human finger bending is high enough to light commercial visible light-emitting diodes and charge commercial capacitors. The output performance is maintained higher than 95% of its original value after 10 000-cycle test. This highly stable, high-output, and lead-free GaN thin-film F-PEG has the great potential for future self-powered electronic devices and systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036641> rates and foraging strategy of Carollia perspicillata (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) in an artificial food patch.</a></h1><p>An organism's foraging strategy depends on its ability to acquire and use information from food patches. A forager that does not obtain information from a food patch should remain there for a fixed time or a fixed amount of . Foragers that obtain partial or complete information from the patch should be able to estimate costs and benefits from its exploitation. The foraging strategy used by a forager can be determined using the giving-up density (GUD) technique. The GUD is the amount of food left by a forager after feeding in a patch with diminishing returns. We constructed an artificial feeder to examine the foraging strategy of the short-tailed fruit bat Carollia perspicillata (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). In this feeder, the bat's  rate declined with time, i.e., they experienced diminishing returns. When offered feeders with different initial food densities, bats consumed proportionately more from rich patches than from poor ones, but they equalized GUDs. When offered feeders with different concentrations of sugar (i.e., different  content), the higher the sugar concentration in the food, the more they consumed. Altogether, the evidence indicates that these fruit bats used complete, unbiased information to decide how much time to stay in a food patch.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The UF-PENG has demonstrated good capabilities to act as not only an  generator but also a wind velocity/direction sensor. Using the same procedure, the ZnO nanorods have been doped with lanthanum, and the doped device was found to exhibit three times the output of intrinsic PENG. Furthermore, through the process of annealing, the output of the PENG was enhanced. Peak power density calculations, capacitance charging, and stability analysis (1500 cycles) were performed.

The device was able to  a voltage of over 1.6 V at 3.8 m s. The observed results indicate that the developed device could work as a self-powered wind velocity sensor. It can also function as a wind direction sensor (0-90°). Finite element simulation was performed to investigate the underlying mechanism. Additionally, the stability analysis of the sensor for more than 4500 cycles was conducted, and the obtained results showed the high stability of the device.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29595525>Electrical and optical evaluation of n-type doping in In  GaP nanowires.</a></h1><p>To  the benefits of III-V nanowires in optoelectronic devices, the development of ternary materials with controlled doping is needed. In this work, we performed a systematic study of n-type dopant incorporation in dense In  GaP nanowire arrays using tetraethyl tin (TESn) and hydrogen sulfide (HS) as dopant precursors. The morphology, crystal structure and material composition of the nanowires were characterized by use of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and  dispersive x-ray analysis. To investigate the electrical properties, the nanowires were broken off from the substrate and mechanically transferred to thermally oxidized silicon substrates, after which electron beam lithography and metal evaporation were used to define electrical contacts to selected nanowires. Electrical characterization, including four-probe resistivity and Hall effect, as well as back-gated field effect measurements, is combined with photoluminescence spectroscopy to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the carrier concentration in the doped nanowires. We measure a carrier concentration of ∼1 × 10 cm in nominally intrinsic nanowires, and the maximum doping level achieved by use of TESn and HS as dopant precursors using our parameters is measured to be ∼ × 10 cm, and ∼1 × 10 cm, respectively (by Hall effect measurements).

In NM/FMI heterostructures, increasing the spin mixing conductance (SMC) at the interface comes as an important step towards devices with maximized SMR. Here we report on the study of SMR in Pt/FeO bilayers at cryogenic temperature, and identify a strong dependence of the determined real part of the complex SMC on the interface roughness. We tune the roughness of the Pt/FeO interface by controlling the growth conditions of the FeO films, namely by varying the thickness, growth technique, and post-annealing processes. Field-dependent and angular-dependent magnetoresistance measurements sustain the clear observation of SMR. The determined real part of the complex SMC of the Pt/FeO bilayers ranges from 4.96 × 10 Ω m to 7.16 × 10 Ω m and increases with the roughness of the FeO underlayer.

Thus, the search for a cost-effective microalgal harvesting method is extremely important. Using chitosan as a natural flocculant to  microalgal biomass seems to be an efficient and convenient solution. Although microalgal biomass flocculation by chitosan has been reported in some previous studies, literature on the harvesting of microalgae  biomass using such polymer is scanty. In addition, there is limited information available on whether the usage of chitosan during the harvesting will affect downstream lipid extraction. Still, whether microalgae can be re-grown with the spent medium after chitosan flocculation is still unknown.In this study, microalgal biomass harvesting using chitosan as a natural flocculant and aluminum sulfate as a traditional flocculant was compared and evaluated. Optimal doses and effects on biomass sedimentation, spent medium recycling and lipid extraction were investigated. The results showed that the optimal doses for chitosan and aluminum sulfate to achieve more than 90% biomass recovery were 0.25 and .5 g/L, respectively. The sedimentation time of 10 min was found to be the most appropriate to remove over 90% biomass from culture. The spent medium after chitosan flocculation could be potentially recycled for the re-cultivation of microalgae, which demonstrated robust growth in comparison with those grown in the recycled medium from aluminum sulfate flocculation. The lipid content of microalgae harvested by chitosan reached 32.9, 4.6% higher than that of those harvested by aluminum sulfate, indicating that the application of the natural flocculant would not impact the downstream extraction of microalgal lipids.The results herein presented, demonstrated that chitosan is applicable for microalgal harvesting during the upscaling process. Flocculation method developed by using chitosan as a natural flocculant is a worthy microalgal harvesting method for microalgae-based biofuel production. There is hope that chitosan can be reasonably and technically realistically applied in a full-scale process for the harvesting of microalgal biomass.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29333350>Scale-up of a Luminescent Solar Concentrator-Based Photomicroreactor via Numbering-up.</a></h1><p>The use of solar  to power chemical reactions is a long-standing dream of the chemical community. Recently, visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis has been recognized as the ideal catalytic transformation to convert solar  into chemical bonds.

These devices  solar , convert the broad solar  spectrum to a narrow-wavelength region, and subsequently waveguide the re-emitted photons to the reaction channels. Herein, we report on the scalability of such LSC-PMs via a numbering-up strategy. Paramount in our work was the use of molds that were fabricated via 3D printing. This allowed us to rapidly produce many different prototypes and to optimize experimentally key design aspects in a time-efficient fashion. Reactors up to 32 parallel channels have been fabricated that display an excellent flow distribution using a bifurcated flow distributor (standard deviations below 10%). This excellent flow distribution was crucial to scale up a model reaction efficiently, displaying yields comparable to those obtained in a single-channel device. We also found that interchannel spacing is an important and unique design parameter for numbered-up LSC-PMs, which influences greatly the photon flux experienced within the reaction channels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30221623>Luminescence light collection technology in the aragonite of stone corals.</a></h1><p>Stone corals do not use calcium carbonate in the form of calcite, which has a calculated  gap of 3.93 eV, but in the form of aragonite, which has a calculated  gap of .88 eV (here experimentally determined to amount to .46 eV) as a building material. This enables the coral to  blue light, which is penetrating and filtering deep into the surface water of the ocean. White luminescence, which is composed of different wave lengths, is generated, and then conducted and redistributed within the aragonite structure to be supplied to the symbiotic photosynthetic algae. This mechanism of light concentration and adaptation via the aragonite structure leads to a smaller amount of light-absorbing phosphorescent pigments being required for the symbionts to survive. The resulting advantages are a significantly smaller exposure to photo-degradation, less effort for chemical synthesis and higher efficiency for solar  conversion. The mechanism of luminescence light collection in the aragonite network is discussed on the basis of spectroscopic measurements on thin coral slices and in context with its architecture and the coral's living activities. The relevance of the stone coral's fractal geometry, both for broadband solar light harvesting and luminescence light collection within non-imaging optics, is emphasized.

In this study, the bioelectricity generation, containment removal and microbial community distribution in CW-MFC as affected by substrate material sizes and aquatic macrophyte were investigated. The planted CW-MFC with larger filler size showed a significant promotion of the relative abundance of electrochemically active bacteria (beta-Proteobacteria), which might result in the increase of bioelectricity generation in CW-MFC (8.91mWm). Additionally, a sharp decrease of voltage was observed in unplanted CW-MFC with smaller filler size in Cycle eight. However, the peak COD (86.7%) and NO-N (87.1%) removal efficiencies were observed in planted CW-MFC with smaller filler size, which was strongly related to the biodiversity of microorganisms. Generally, the acclimation of exoelectrogens as dominant microbes in the anode chamber of planted CW-MFC with larger filler size could promote the bioelectricity generation during wastewater treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current work, the principles that take the full advantage of metal Mg anode and Na-battery cathode to construct high-performance Mg-Na hybrid battery are described.

The Mg-NaCrO cell delivered an  density of 183 Wh kg at the voltage of .3 V averaged in 50 cycles. We found that the amount of electrolyte can be reduced by using solid MgCl as additional magnesium reservoir while maintaining comparable electrochemical performance.

We calculate the influence of various loss mechanisms on the performance potential under real-world operation conditions using a variety of silicon base cells with different efficiencies. We find that the photon multiplier is more stable against changes in the solar spectrum than two-terminal tandem solar cells. We furthermore find that, as the efficiency of the silicon base cell increases, the efficiency of the photon multiplier increases at a rate higher than that of the tandem solar cell. For current record silicon solar cells, the photon multiplier has the potential to increase the efficiency by up to 4.% absolute.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h1><p>Evidence has proven that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host  harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus.

The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. -Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed.

The large size of BChl molecules has prevented accurate computational determination of the electronic structures for the relevant states, until we recently succeeded in obtaining the excitation energies and transition dipole moments of the first (Q ) transition for all BChls in LH2 and LH3 using multi-state multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory calculations. In this work, we go one step further, compute the corresponding values for the Q  transition, in line with previous work [ J. Am. Chem.

Interestingly, we find that the two transitions respond differently to BChls' geometrical factors, such as the macrocycle ring curvature and the dihedral torsion of the acetyl moiety. These findings will aid the unraveling of structure-function relationships for absorption and  transfer processes in purple bacteria, and once again this demonstrates the viability of multireference quantum chemical methods as computational tools for the photophysics of biomolecules.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28805864>Novel synthesis of magnetic, porous C/ZnFeO photocatalyst with enhanced activity under visible light based on the Fenton-like reaction.</a></h1><p>Magnetic visible-light-driven photocatalyst, porous C/ZnFeO (denoted as C/ZFO-CE) was fabricated via a CO-mediated ethanol route. CO-mediated ethanol route largely mitigated the solvent strength and facilitated the homogenous deposition of ZnFeO (ZFO) through the coordination of metallic cation with CO and HCO anions, which were hydrolyzed from CO and HO, thereby avoiding additional precipitant. Moreover, the HCO, CO and NO in the system acted as templates for the formation of porous C avoiding the additional organic mesoporous templates, thus reducing the synthesis cost. For the degradation of RhB and phenol, the C/ZFO-CE system in presence of minute HO exhibited remarkably improved catalytic performance compared with the systems of HO, ZFO, C/ZFO-CE, C/ZFO-E (C/ZnFeO synthesized in pure ethanol) and C/ZFO-E in the presence of minute HO. Furthermore, .0 mL of HO (30%) combined with C/ZFO-CE obtained the maximum degradation efficiencies of 100% for RhB within 60 min and 91% for phenol within 120 min. The high efficiency for degradation of pollutants over C/ZFO-CE catalyst in the presence of minute HO was possibly attributed to the strong  of visible light, the improved separation efficiency of the photoinduced charges and the overall ˙OH production by the "photo-Fenton" process. The existence of ˙OH during photodegradation process was evidenced via the PL-TA (photoluminescence-terephthalic acid) technique, ESR spectra and trapping experiments of active species using different scavengers.

Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is an oilseed crop that has great potential to provide sustainable feedstock for biofuel production and to improve dryland agriculture. A major breeding objective for camelina is to increase seed size and oil content. Understanding the genetics behind variations of seed size and associated traits such as oil content would help breeders develop varieties of increased oil yield that are more robust, easier to plant and , and better for oil processing. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred population derived from the two camelina accessions, Suneson and Pryzeth, with contrasting traits, especially seed size and oil content. Using 189 lines, a genetic map was constructed containing 2376 single nucleotide polymorphism markers spanning 2034.6 cM of 20 linkage groups with an average density of 1.5 cM per locus. Field trials were conducted for  years (2017 and 2018) in two environments (dryland and irrigated) in Bozeman, Montana.

The harvesting process includes two steps, which are the separation of microalgae from the culture solution with the magnetic nanoparticles and then the separation of the algae from the magnetic nanoparticles. The optimal dosages and pH values for the magnetic harvesting of microalgal biomass were determined. Results showed that YFeO nanoparticles were more efficient in microalgal biomass harvesting than FeO nanoparticles. In an effort to achieve more than 90% of harvesting efficiency, optimal dosages for FeO and YFeO to  microalgal biomass were 10 and .5 g/L, while the appropriate pH values were 6. and 7.3, respectively. The harvesting efficiency of FeO and YFeO nanoparticles increased as the pH value decreased. The experimental results also showed that under a higher pH value FeO nanoparticles were much easier to be separated from the flocs than YFeO. 62.9% of FeO nanoparticles could be de-attached from the aggregates, when the floc pH value reached 12.3.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216503>The Dissipative Potential of Gamma Irradiation in Residues of Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam in the Postharvest of Common Beans.</a></h1><p>Gamma irradiation ( Co) in postharvest of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), has already proven beneficial, regarding the prolongation of shelf life and physical, chemical, and organoleptic aspects of grains. However, few prior studies have investigated the effect of gamma irradiation on the dissipation of pesticides in foods, especially insecticides in beans. This study aimed to evaluate the waste dissipation of two insecticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, used in the cultivation of common bean, a variety of Carioca, using gamma irradiation. Ground bean samples were spiked each insecticide in the laboratory at 3, 4, and 5 mg/kg, and were then irradiated at 0, 1, and  kGy per irradiator with a  Co source. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify the insecticides. The irradiation promoted dissipation of thiamethoxam at 1 and  kGy doses, with the highest dissipation verified at  kGy. In general, at this higher dose of irradiation the reduction dissipation of thiamethoxam was 66% of the mean value found in the treatment without irradiation and ∼44% relative to the 1 kGy dose. Conversely, imidacloprid showed no effect of irradiation on waste dissipation, except in the treatment of 5 mg/kg at  kGy dose. From the results, it was concluded that the gamma irradiation might have applicability in dissipating thiamethoxam in real bean samples.Pesticide residues remaining from bean cultivation, sensitive to optimal doses of gamma irradiation, can be transformed into other less harmful or nonharmful substances, increasing the quality of the beans before the food arrives at the consumer's table. Irradiation of the grains after  also eliminates the need for application of other pesticides to preserve the grains during storage, as the technique is capable of eradicating deteriorating agents, such as microorganisms and insects.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925579>Nutrient and acetate amendment leads to acetoclastic methane production and microbial community change in a non-producing Australian coal well.</a></h1><p>Coal mining is responsible for 11% of total anthropogenic methane emission thereby contributing considerably to climate change. Attempts to  coalbed methane for  production are challenged by relatively low methane concentrations. In this study, we investigated whether nutrient and acetate amendment of a non-producing sub-bituminous coal well could transform the system to a methane source. We tracked cell counts, methane production, acetate concentration and geochemical parameters for 25 months in one amended and one unamended coal well in Australia. Additionally, the microbial community was analysed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at 17 and 25 months after amendment and complemented by metagenome sequencing at 25 months. We found that cell numbers increased rapidly from 3.0 × 10 cells ml to 9.9 × 10 in the first 7 months after amendment. However, acetate depletion with concomitant methane production started only after 12-19 months. The microbial community was dominated by complex organic compound degraders (Anaerolineaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Geobacter spp.), acetoclastic methanogens (Methanothrix spp.) and fungi (Agaricomycetes). Even though the microbial community had the functional potential to convert coal to methane, we observed no indication that coal was actually converted within the time frame of the study. Our results suggest that even though nutrient and acetate amendment stimulated relevant microbial species, it is not a sustainable way to transform non-producing coal wells into bioenergy factories.© 2017 The Authors.

This study investigated the potential of Serratia sp. K3 (K3) assisted with straw biogas residue (SBR) or leavening fertilizer (LF) on improving the Cd migration efficiency and micro-environment in soil-vetiveria zizanioides L. system. The results showed that the acid soluble Cd in soil was increased by .83-29.79% in treatments compared with control (CK). In addition, Cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of vetiveria zizanioides were significantly enhanced by the combination of K3 and SBR/LF. Especially, the translocation factor of Cd increased by 21.53-62.37% in groups with K3 compared with the groups without K3, correspondingly. Furthermore, SBR/LF effectively changed bacterial community structure, and improved bacterial abundance. Relative abundance of functional genes related with carbohydrate//amino acid metabolism were increased in groups of SBRB/LFB rhizosphere compared with CK. These results provide insight into the change of phytoremediation efficiency and soil bacterial communities in the vetiveria zizanioides rhizosphere after inoculation.

Grass is a potential lignocellulosic biomass which can be utilised for biorefinery-based bioethanol production. Grass biomass is a suitable feedstock for bioethanol production due to its all the year around production, requirement of less fertile land and noninterference with food system. However, the processes involved, i.e. pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation for bioethanol production from grass biomass, are both time consuming and costly. Developing the grass biomass in planta for enhanced bioethanol production is a promising step for maximum utilisation of this valuable feedstock and, thus, is the focus of the present review. Modern breeding techniques and transgenic processes are attractive methods which can be utilised for development of the feedstock. However, the outcomes are not always predictable and the time period required for obtaining a robust variety is generation dependent. Sophisticated genome editing technologies such as synthetic genetic circuits (SGC) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems are advantageous for induction of desired traits/heritable mutations in a foreseeable genome location in the 1st mutant generation. Although, its application in grass biomass for bioethanol is limited, these sophisticated techniques are anticipated to exhibit more flexibility in engineering the expression pattern for qualitative and qualitative traits. Nevertheless, the fundamentals rendered by the genetics of the transgenic crops will remain the basis of such developments for obtaining biorefinery-based bioethanol concepts from grass biomass. Grasses which are abundant and widespread in nature epitomise attractive lignocellulosic feedstocks for bioethanol production. The complexity offered by the grass cell wall in terms of lignin recalcitrance and its binding to polysaccharides forms a barricade for its commercialization as a biofuel feedstock. Inspired by the possibilities for rewiring the genetic makeup of grass biomass for reduced lignin and lignin-polysaccharide linkages along with increase in carbohydrates, innovative approaches for in planta modifications are forging ahead. In this review, we highlight the progress made in the field of transgenic grasses for bioethanol production and focus our understanding on improvements of simple breeding techniques and post- techniques for development in shortening of lignin-carbohydrate and carbohydrate-carbohydrate linkages. Further, we discuss about the designer lignins which are aimed for qualitable lignins and also emphasise on remodelling of polysaccharides and mixed-linkage glucans for enhancing carbohydrate content and in planta saccharification efficiency. As a final point, we discuss the role of synthetic genetic circuits and CRISPR systems in targeted improvement of cell wall components without compromising the plant growth and health. It is anticipated that this review can provide a rational approach towards a better understanding of application of in planta genetic engineering aspects for designing synthetic genetic circuits which can promote grass feedstocks for biorefinery-based bioethanol concepts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28921469>Microbial Factors in Inflammatory Diseases and Cancers.</a></h1><p>The intestinal microbes form a symbiotic relationship with their human host to   for themselves and their host and to shape the immune system of their host. However, alteration of this relationship, which is named as a dysbiosis, has been associated with the development of different inflammatory diseases and cancers. It is found that metabolites, cellular components, and virulence factors derived from the gut microbiota interact with the host locally or systemically to modulate the dysbiosis and the development of these diseases. In this book chapter, we discuss the role of these microbial factors in regulating the host signaling pathways, the composition and load of the gut microbiota, the co-metabolism of the host and the microbiota, the host immune system, and physiology. In particular, we highlight how each microbial factor can contribute in the manifestation of many diseases such as cancers, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, obesity, type- diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and cardiovascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28864653>Chemical Pretreatment-Independent Saccharifications of Xylan and Cellulose of Rice Straw by Bacterial Weak Lignin-Binding Xylanolytic and Cellulolytic Enzymes.</a></h1><p>Complete utilization of carbohydrate fractions is one of the prerequisites for obtaining economically favorable lignocellulosic biomass conversion. This study shows that xylan in untreated rice straw was saccharified to xylose in one step without chemical pretreatment, yielding 58.% of the theoretically maximum value by  B-6 PcAxy43A, a weak lignin-binding trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme, endoxylanase/β-xylosidase/arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase. Moreover, xylose yield from untreated rice straw was enhanced to 78.9% by adding endoxylanases PcXyn10C and PcXyn11A from the same bacterium, resulting in improvement of cellulose accessibility to cellulolytic enzyme. After autoclaving the xylanolytic enzyme-treated rice straw, it was subjected to subsequent saccharification by a combination of the  endoglucanase CtCel9R and  β-glucosidase TbCglT, yielding 88.5% of the maximum glucose yield, which was higher than the glucose yield obtained from ammonia-treated rice straw saccharification (59.6%). Moreover, this work presents a new environment-friendly xylanolytic enzyme pretreatment for beneficial hydrolysis of xylan in various agricultural residues, such as rice straw and corn hull. It not only could improve cellulose saccharification but also produced xylose, leading to an improvement of the overall fermentable sugar yields without chemical pretreatment. Ongoing research is focused on improving "green" pretreatment technologies in order to reduce  demands and environmental impact and to develop an economically feasible biorefinery. The present study showed that PcAxy43A, a weak lignin-binding trifunctional xylanolytic enzyme, endoxylanase/β-xylosidase/arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase from  B-6, was capable of conversion of xylan in lignocellulosic biomass such as untreated rice straw to xylose in one step without chemical pretreatment. It demonstrates efficient synergism with endoxylanases PcXyn10C and PcXyn11A to depolymerize xylan in untreated rice straw and enhanced the xylose production and improved cellulose hydrolysis. Therefore, it can be considered an enzymatic pretreatment. Furthermore, the studies here show that glucose yield released from steam- and xylanolytic enzyme-treated rice straw by the combination of CtCel9R and TbCglT was higher than the glucose yield obtained from ammonia-treated rice straw saccharification. This work presents a novel environment-friendly xylanolytic enzyme pretreatment not only as a green pretreatment but also as an economically feasible biorefinery method.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29346109>Endocardial  Harvesting by Electromagnetic Induction.</a></h1><p>cardiac pacemakers require regular medical follow-ups to ensure proper functioning.

However, achieving a high output voltage and power performance simultaneously from low-grade thermal  remains challenging. Here, we introduce strong chaotropic cations (guanidinium) and highly soluble amide derivatives (urea) into aqueous ferri/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)]/[Fe(CN)]) electrolytes to significantly boost their thermopowers.

However, the conventional analysis of seafood deterioration using chromatography instruments and bacterial colony counting depends on time-consuming and food-destructive treatments. In this study, we demonstrate a non-destructive and rapid food freshness monitoring system by a triangular study of sensory evaluation, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and a bioelectronic nose. The sensory evaluation indicated that the acceptability and flavor deteriorated gradually during post- storage (4 °C) for 6 days. The GC-MS analysis recognized the reduction of freshness by detecting a generation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) from the headspace of oyster in a refrigerator (4 °C) at 4 days post-. However, the bioelectronic nose incorporating human olfactory receptor peptides with the carbon nanotube field-effect transistor sensed trimethylamine (TMA) from the oyster at  days post- with suggesting early recognition of oysters' quality and freshness deterioration. Given that the bacterial species producing DMS or TMA along with toxins were found in the oyster, the bacterial contamination-driven food deterioration is rapidly monitored using the bioelectronic nose with a targeted non-destructive freshness marker.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293531>Spotlight on the   of Electroactive Microorganisms: The Impact of the Applied Anode Potential.</a></h1><p>Electroactive microorganisms (EAM)   by reducing insoluble terminal electron acceptors (TEA) including electrodes via extracellular electron transfer (EET). Therefore, compared to microorganisms respiring soluble TEA, an adapted approach is required for thermodynamic analyses. In EAM, the thermodynamic frame (i.e., maximum available ) is restricted as only a share of the  difference between electron donor and TEA is exploited via the electron-transport chain to generate proton-motive force being subsequently utilized for ATP synthesis. However, according to a common misconception, the anode potential is suggested to co-determine the thermodynamic frame of EAM. By comparing the model organism  spp. and microorganisms respiring soluble TEA, we reason that a considerable part of the electron-transport chain of EAM performing direct EET does not contribute to the build-up of proton-motive force and thus, the anode potential does not co-determine the thermodynamic frame. Furthermore, using a modeling platform demonstrates that the influence of anode potential on   is solely a kinetic effect. When facing low anode potentials, NADH is accumulating due to a slow direct EET rate leading to a restricted exploitation of the thermodynamic frame. For anode potentials ≥ 0. V (vs. SHE), EET kinetics, NAD/NADH ratio as well as exploitation of the thermodynamic frame are maximized, and a further potential increase does not result in higher  . Considering the limited influence of the anode potential on   of EAM is a prerequisite to improve thermodynamic analyses, microbial resource mining, and to transfer microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) into practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397324>Fabrication of highly effective hybrid biofuel cell based on integral colloidal platinum and bilirubin oxidase on gold support.</a></h1><p>A hybrid biofuel cell (HBFC) is explored as a low-cost alternative to abiotic and enzymatic biofuel cells. Here the HBFC provides an enzymeless approach for the fabrication of the anodic electrode while employing an enzymatic approach for the fabrication of the cathodic electrode to develop  harvesting platform to power bioelectronic devices. The anode employed 250 μm braided gold wire modified with colloidal platinum (Au-co-Pt) and bilirubin oxidase (BODx) modified gold coated Buckypaper (BP-Au-BODx) cathode. The functionalization of the gold coated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) structures of the BP electrodes is achieved by 3-mercaptopropionic acid surface modification to possess negatively charged carboxylic groups and subsequently followed by EDC/Sulfo-NHS (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide) crosslinking with BODx. The integration of the BODx and gold coated MWCNTs is evaluated for bioelectrocatalytic activity. The Au-co-Pt and BP-Au-BODx exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards glucose oxidation with a linear dynamic range up to 20 mM glucose and molecular oxygen reduction, respectively. The HBFC demonstrated excellent performance with the largest open circuit voltages of 0.735 V and power density of 46.31 μW/cm in 3 mM glucose. In addition, the HBFC operating on 3 mM glucose exhibited excellent uninterrupted operational stability while continuously powering a small electronic device.

The objective of this work was to evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios from 2018 to 2050 by applying a systems-based approach that accounts for net emissions across four interdependent components: (1) forest ecosystem, () land-use change, (3) harvested wood products, and (4) substitution benefits from using wood products and bioenergy. We assessed a range of land management and harvested wood product scenarios for two case studies in the U.S: coastal South Carolina and Northern Wisconsin. We integrated forest inventory and remotely-sensed disturbance data within a modelling framework consisting of a growth-and-yield driven ecosystem carbon model; a harvested wood products model that estimates emissions from commodity production, use and post-consumer treatment; and displacement factors to estimate avoided fossil fuel emissions. We estimated biophysical mitigation potential by comparing net emissions from land management and harvested wood products scenarios with a baseline ('business as usual') scenario.Baseline scenario results showed that the strength of the ecosystem carbon sink has been decreasing in the two sites due to age-related productivity declines and deforestation. Mitigation activities have the potential to lessen or delay the further reduction in the carbon sink. Results of the mitigation analysis indicated that scenarios reducing net forest area loss were most effective in South Carolina, while extending  rotations and increasing longer-lived wood products were most effective in Wisconsin. Scenarios aimed at increasing bioenergy use either increased or reduced net emissions within the 32-year analysis timeframe.It is critical to apply a systems approach to comprehensively assess net emissions from forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios. Although some scenarios produced a benefit by displacing emissions from fossil fuel  or by substituting wood products for other materials, these benefits can be outweighed by increased carbon emissions in the forest or product systems. Maintaining forests as forests, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to longer-lived products had the strongest mitigation benefits over several decades. Carbon cycle impacts of bioenergy depend on timeframe, feedstocks, and alternative uses of biomass, and cannot be assumed carbon neutral.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30167480>Outlook: Sorghum as a feed grain for Australian chicken-meat production.</a></h1><p>This review is an outlook for sorghum as a feed grain for broiler chickens based on a survey of relevant stake-holders and recent research outcomes. Australian grain sorghum production will probably continue to generate a  in the order of .5 × 10 t of which some 7.9 × 10 t will be used as a feed grain for poultry and pigs. Feed grains are included primarily to provide  from starch, but  utilisation by broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets is relatively inferior, because of incomplete starch digestion. Kafirin, the dominant protein fraction, 'non-tannin' phenolic compounds and phytate are 3 'starch extrinsic' factors in sorghum that compromise starch digestibility and  utilisation in broiler chickens offered sorghum-based diets. Kafirin concentrations in 6 sorghum varieties were negatively correlated with metabolizable  to gross  (ME:GE) ratios ( = -0.891;  < 0.02) or the efficiency of  utilisation in broiler chickens. Importantly, kafirin proportions of sorghum protein may be increasing with time in Australia. If so, this represents a fundamental challenge to sorghum breeders which presumably could be met by the development of sorghum varieties with different characteristics, especially in relation to the γ- and β-kafirin fractions. White sorghum varieties contain lower polyphenol concentrations which should be advantageous as concentrations of total phenolic compounds were negatively correlated to ME:GE ratios ( = -0.838;  < 0.04) in 6 sorghum varieties. It would be desirable if more white varieties were to become available. It is suggested that responses to exogenous phytase in birds offered sorghum-based diets would be more robust if sorghum were to contain lower concentrations of kafirin and phenolic compounds. Paradoxically, while better sorghum varieties almost certainly could be developed, it may not necessarily follow that they will command a price premium from poultry and pig producers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29112140>Dual-Located WHIRLY1 Interacting with LHCA1 Alters Photochemical Activities of Photosystem I and Is Involved in Light Adaptation in Arabidopsis.</a></h1><p>Plastid-nucleus-located WHIRLY1 protein plays a role in regulating leaf senescence and is believed to associate with the increase of reactive oxygen species delivered from redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. In order to make sure whether WHIRLY1 plays a role in photosynthesis, in this study, the performances of photosynthesis were detected in  knockout () and plastid localized WHIRLY1 overexpression () plants. Loss of WHIRLY1 leads to a higher photochemical quantum yield of photosystem I Y(I) and electron transport rate (ETR) and a lower non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) involved in the thermal dissipation of excitation  of chlorophyll fluorescence than the wild type. Further analyses showed that WHIRLY1 interacts with Light-harvesting protein complex I (LHCA1) and affects the expression of genes encoding photosystem I (PSI) and light  complexes (LHCI). Moreover, loss of WHIRLY1 decreases chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) activity and the accumulation of NDH supercomplex. Several genes encoding the PSI-NDH complexes are also up-regulated in  and the  double mutant () but steady in  plants. However, under high light conditions (800 μmol m s), both  and  plants show lower ETR than wild-type which are contrary to that under normal light condition. Moreover, the expression of several PSI-NDH encoding genes and  which is related to jasmonate (JA) response varied in  under different light conditions.

A key goal is the harvesting of photons from below the bandgap of crystalline silicon 1.12 eV (≈1100 nm) and their upconversion into the visible region. In practice, the systems demonstrated so far have been limited to harvesting photons with energies above 1. eV (≈1 μm), due to two reasons: firstly the need to use transmitter ligands which allow efficient  harvesting from the QD but introduce an  loss of larger than 200 meV in transmission from the QD to the annihilator, and secondly due to the use of molecules such as tetracene which cannot accept smaller  than 1. eV. Here, we introduce a new strategy to overcome these difficulties by using a low  triplet annihilator that also harvests excitations efficiently from QDs. Specifically, we show that 5,11-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (TES-ADT, triplet  of 1.08 eV:  1150 nm) functions as a triplet annihilator (20% TTA efficiency) while also rapidly extracting triplet excitons from lead sulfide (PbS) QDs with a rate constant of  =   × 10 s with an excitation at 1064 nm. This rate is consistent with an orbital overlap between TES-ADT and PbS QDs, which we propose is due to the thiophene group of TES-ADT, which enables a close association with the PbS surface, allowing this system to function both as annihilator and transmitter. Our results pave the way for the design of triplet annihilators that can closely associate with the QD surface and  low  excitons with minute losses in  during the TET process, with the ultimate goal of efficiently utilizing photon  beyond the bandgap of crystalline silicon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599594>Note: Weak acoustic  harvesting and high-efficiency storage- management circuit for wireless sensor.</a></h1><p>A Helmholtz resonator can  the weak acoustic , but the traditional management circuits hardly efficiently obtain the weak  due to the diode drop of the rectifier.

To better understand this phenomenon, a tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analysis of soft wheat seeds was performed at different storage times during accelerated ageing (germination ratios of 97%, 45%, 28%, and 6%). A total of 1,010 proteins were differentially regulated, of which 519 and 491 were up- and downregulated, respectively. Most of the differentially expressed proteins were predicted to be involved in nutrient reservoir, enzyme activity and regulation,  and metabolism, and response to stimulus functions, consistent with processes occurring in hard wheat during artificial ageing. Notably, defense-associated proteins including wheatwin-, pathogenesis-related proteins protecting against fungal invasion, and glutathione S-transferase and glutathione synthetase participating in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, were upregulated compared to levels in hard wheat during accelerated ageing. These upregulated proteins might be responsible for the superior post- storage-tolerance of soft wheat cultivars during accelerated ageing compared with hard wheat. Although accelerated ageing could not fully mimic natural ageing, our findings provided novel dynamic proteomic insight into soft wheat seeds during seed deterioration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28804512>Engineering  enables xylose-fed microbial fuel cell.</a></h1><p>The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a green and sustainable technology for electricity   from biomass, in which exoelectrogens use metabolism and extracellular electron transfer pathways for the conversion of chemical  into electricity.

Scientific evidence on nutritional adequacy of predominant complementary foods is critical for planning and prioritising interventions. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the quality of complementary foods and the optimality of complementary feeding practices in Southwest Ethiopia.In this cross-sectional study, a stratified multistage sampling procedure was used to sample 433 children, 6-24 months old. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic, socio-economic and dietary data. Dietary diversity score was measured using a 24-h dietary recall. Six customary complementary food types were assayed for proximate composition,  and mineral density using standard methods. Adequacy of the complementary foods in nutrients for complementary feeding purposes was assessed as a ratio between actual composition and recommended composition of complementary foods.Only 16.1% of the children get the minimum dietary diversity. The children were reported to be fed with cereals & grains (68.8%), discretionary calories (53.6%), protein-rich foods (44.6%), oils and fat (40.5%), vegetables (38.5%), dairy products (17.9%) and fruits (28.1%). The sampled foods contained 4.3-24.4%, 0.9-8.5%, 8.-11.9%, 27.9-162.6 Kcal/100 g, 168.4-250.4 mg/100 g, 1.8-4.1 mg/100 g and 22.5-42.4 mg/100 g of total carbohydrate, crude fat, protein,  content, calcium, zinc and iron, respectively. All the complementary food samples predominantly fed to children were not composed of adequate protein, fat, carbohydrate,  and calcium as recommended for complementary feeding purposes. However, most of the complementary foods are composed of adequate iron and zinc.The nutrient density and diversity of complementary foods of 6-24-month-old children in the study area were found to be sub-optimal. Upgrading the nutritional composition of the starchy complementary foods should be of highest priority to improve nutrition of the infants and young children.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29044893>Synthetic Klebsiella pneumoniae-Shewanella oneidensis Consortium Enables Glycerol-Fed High-Performance Microbial Fuel Cells.</a></h1><p>Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an eco-friendly bio-electrochemical sys-tem that uses microorganism as biocatalyst to convert biomass into electricity. Glycerol, as a waste in the biodiesel refinery processes, is an appealing substrate for MFC. Nevertheless, glycerol cannot be utilized as carbon source by well-known exoelectrogens such as Shewanella oneidensis. Herein, to generate electricity by rapidly harnessing glycerol, the authors rationally constructed a Klebsiella pneumoniae-Shewanella oneidensis microbial consortium to efficiently  electricity from glyc-erol, in which K. pneumoniae converted glycerol into lactate, fed to S. oneidensis as carbon source and electron donor. To improve electricity output, the authors systematically engineered the consortium in terms of carbon flux distribution and efficiency of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To direct more carbon flux to lactate biosynthesis in K. pneumoniae, the authors eliminated the ethanol pathway by knocking out the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE), and enhanced lactate biosynthesis by heterologously expressing a lactate dehydrogen-ase gene (ldhD) from Lactobacillus bulgaricus and a lactate transporter gene (lldP) from Escherichia coli. To facilitate EET between S. oneidensis and anode surfaces, a biosynthetic flavins pathway from Bacillus subtilis is introduced into S. oneidensis. The author further optimized the glycerol concentration, thus S. oneidensis could be continuously fed with lactate synthesized from K. pneumoniae at a constant rate. Our glycerol-fed MFC generated a maximum power density of 19.9 mW/m , significantly higher than that of the wild-type consor-tium. This work suggested that engineering microbial consortia is an effi-cient strategy to expand the spectrum of usable carbon sources and promote electricity power production in MFCs.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In particular, for OLEDs it is required to  all singlet and triplet excitons that are generated in the emission layer. This can be achieved using the so-called triplet harvesting mechanism. However, the materials to be applied are based on high-cost rare metals and therefore, it has been proposed already more than one decade ago by our group to use the effect of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) to  all generated excitons in the lowest excited singlet state S . In this situation, the resulting emission is an S →S fluorescence, though a delayed one. Hence, this mechanism represents the singlet harvesting mechanism. Using this effect, high-cost and strong SOC-carrying rare metals are not required. This mechanism can very effectively be realized by use of Cu or Ag complexes and even by purely organic molecules. In this investigation, we focus on photoluminescence properties and on crucial requirements for designing Cu and Ag materials that exhibit short TADF decay times at high emission quantum yields. The decay times should be as short as possible to minimize non-radiative quenching and, in particular, chemical reactions that frequently occur in the excited state. Thus, a short TADF decay time can strongly increase the material's long-term stability. Here, we study crucial parameters and analyze their impact on the TADF decay time. For example, the  separation ΔE(S -T ) between the lowest excited singlet state S and the triplet state T should be small. Accordingly, we present detailed photophysical properties of two case-study materials designed to exhibit a large ΔE(S -T ) value of 1000 cm (120 meV) and, for comparison, a small one of 370 cm (46 meV). From these studies-extended by investigations of many other Cu TADF compounds-we can conclude that just small ΔE(S -T ) is not a sufficient requirement for short TADF decay times. High allowedness of the transition from the emitting S state to the electronic ground state S , expressed by the radiative rate k (S →S ) or the oscillator strength f(S →S ), is also very important. However, mostly small ΔE(S -T ) is related to small k (S →S ). This relation results from an experimental investigation of a large number of Cu complexes and basic quantum mechanical considerations. As a consequence, a reduction of τ(TADF) to below a few μs might be problematic. However, new materials can be designed for which this disadvantage is not prevailing. A new TADF compound, Ag(dbp)(P -nCB) (with dbp=,9-di-n-butyl-1,10-phenanthroline and P -nCB=bis-(diphenylphosphine)-nido-carborane) seems to represent such an example. Accordingly, this material shows TADF record properties, such as short TADF decay time at high emission quantum yield. These properties are based (i) on geometry optimizations of the Ag complex for a fast radiative S →S rate and (ii) on restricting the extent of geometry reorganizations after excitation for reducing non-radiative relaxation and emission quenching. Indeed, we could design a TADF material with breakthrough properties showing τ(TADF)=1.4 μs at 100 % emission quantum yield.© 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we report on TB-based PSCs containing two donor materials; poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) and Rhodamine B (RhB) laser organic dye, and [6,6]-phenyl C butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor. The influence of RhB weight percentage and injection volume was extensively studied. To gain insight into the influences of RhB on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, physicochemical and optical properties of TBs were compared with those of BHJ binary blend as a standard. RhB broadened the light absorption properties of the active layer and played a bridging role between P3HT and PCBM. The PCE and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the optimized TB-based PSCs comprising of 0.5 wt% RhB reached 5% and 12.12 mA/cm, respectively. Compared to BHJ standard cell, the PCE and the generated current was improved by two orders of magnitude due to higher photon  of the active layer, cascade  level structure of TB components and a considerable decrease in the charge carrier recombination. The results suggest that RhB can be considered as an effective material for application in PSCs to attain high photovoltaic performance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of PSI-LHCR from the red alga  in two forms, one with three Lhcr subunits attached to the side, similar to that of higher plants, and the other with two additional Lhcr subunits attached to the opposite side, indicating an ancient form of PSI-LHCI. Furthermore, the red algal PSI core showed features of both cyanobacterial and higher plant PSI, suggesting an intermediate type during evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The structure of PsaO, existing in eukaryotic organisms, was identified in the PSI core and binds three chlorophylls  and may be important in harvesting  and in mediating  transfer from LHCII to the PSI core under state- conditions. Individual attaching sites of LHCRs with the core subunits were identified, and each Lhcr was found to contain 11 to 13 chlorophylls  and 5 zeaxanthins, which are apparently different from those of LHCs in plant PSI-LHCI.

In particular, the thermoelectric generator (TEG) is being studied for its ability to  waste heat . However, studies on organic TEGs conducted thus far have mostly used conductive polymers, making the application range of TEGs relatively narrow. In this study, we fabricated organic TEGs using carbonaceous nanomaterials (i.e., graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) and single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)) with polyelectrolytes (i.e., poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly (diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA)) via layer-by-layer (LbL) coating on polymeric substrates. The thermoelectric performance of the carbonaceous multilayer structure was measured, and it was confirmed that the thermoelectric performance of the TEG in this study was not significantly different from that of the existing organic TEG fabricated using the conductive polymers. The 10 bilayer SWNT thin films with polyelectrolyte exhibited a thermopower of -14 μV·K and a power factor of 25 μW·mK.

Their atomic thickness and large-scale synthesis capability could enable the development of 'smart skin', which could transform ordinary objects into an intelligent distributed sensor network. However, although many important components of such a distributed electronic system have already been demonstrated (for example, transistors, sensors and memory devices based on two-dimensional materials), an efficient, flexible and always-on -harvesting solution, which is indispensable for self-powered systems, is still missing. Electromagnetic radiation from Wi-Fi systems operating at .4 and 5.9 gigahertz is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and would be ideal to  for powering future distributed electronics. However, the high frequencies used for Wi-Fi communications have remained elusive to radiofrequency harvesters (that is, rectennas) made of flexible semiconductors owing to their limited transport properties. Here we demonstrate an atomically thin and flexible rectenna based on a MoS semiconducting-metallic-phase heterojunction with a cutoff frequency of 10 gigahertz, which represents an improvement in speed of roughly one order of magnitude compared with current state-of-the-art flexible rectifiers. This flexible MoS-based rectifier operates up to the X-band (8 to 12 gigahertz) and covers most of the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical radio band, including the Wi-Fi channels. By integrating the ultrafast MoS rectifier with a flexible Wi-Fi-band antenna, we fabricate a fully flexible and integrated rectenna that achieves wireless  harvesting of electromagnetic radiation in the Wi-Fi band with zero external bias (battery-free). Moreover, our MoS rectifier acts as a flexible mixer, realizing frequency conversion beyond 10 gigahertz.

Both childhood undernutrition and obesity are linked to alterations in composition and functionality of the gut microbiome. One of the possible mechanisms underlying the interplay between microbiota and host metabolism is through appetite-regulating hormones (including leptin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1). Short chain fatty acids, the end product of bacterial fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, might be able to alter   and metabolism through enteroendocrine cell signaling, adipogenesis and insulin-like growth factor-1 production. Elucidating these mechanisms may lead to development of new modulation practices of the gut microbiota as a potential prevention and treatment strategy for childhood malnutrition. The present overview will briefly outline the gut microbiota development in the early life, gut microbiota alterations in childhood undernutrition and obesity, and whether this relationship is causal. Further we will discuss possible underlying mechanisms in relation to the gut-brain axis and short chain fatty acids, and the potential of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics for modulating the gut microbiota during childhood as a prevention and treatment strategy against undernutrition and obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Temperate agriculture has been threatened by the negative impact of temperature increases caused by climate change. Soil temperature closely correlates with the growth of temperate crops, and affects plant processes and soil microbial diversity. The present study focuses on the effects of soil temperatures on lettuce growth and soil microbial diversity that maintains the growth of lettuce at low soil temperatures. A model temperate crop, loose leaf lettuce, was grown on eutrophic soil under soil cooling and a number of parameters, such as fresh weight, height, the number of leaves, and root length, were evaluated upon . Under soil cooling, significant differences were observed in the average fresh weight (P<0.05) and positive development of the roots, shoots, and leaves of lettuce. Janthinobacterium (8.142%), Rhodoplanes (1.991%), Arthrospira (1.138%), Flavobacterium (0.857%), Sphingomonas (0.790%), Mycoplana (0.726%), and Pseudomonas (0.688%) were the dominant bacterial genera present in cooled soil.

Numbers of dams that weaned at least one calf and were included in the first analysis were 37, 45, and 56 in the 1964, 1969, and 1974 data sets, respectively. Respective numbers of dams that weaned three calves and were included in a second analysis were 6, 8, 8, 22, 33, and 33 in the 1953, 1954, 1959, 1964, 1969, and 1974 experiments. Individual feed consumption was measured at 28-d intervals from the time females were placed on the experiment at 240 d of age until three calves were weaned or the dams had reached 5 yr of age. Residual feed intake (RFI) and residual BW gain (RG) of heifers that subsequently became dams were determined based on ADG and DMI from 240 d of age to first calving. Various measures of cow efficiency were calculated on either a life cycle or actual lifetime basis using ratios of progeny and dam weight outputs to progeny and dam feed inputs. The correlation between RFI and DMI was large and positive (r = 0.67; P < 0.0001), and RG was highly correlated with ADG (r = 0.75; P < 0.0001). Correlations of RFI with cow efficiency ratios that included  weight, carcass weight, or weight of trimmed wholesale cuts as measures of output ranged from -0.05 (P > 0.10) to -0.17 (P < 0.10), indicating that heifers with better (i.e., more negative) RFI values tended to become slightly more efficient cows. Correlations of RG with life cycle and actual lifetime cow efficiency ratios ranged from 0.08 (P > 0.10) to 0.23 (P < 0.05), demonstrating that heifers with better (i.e., more positive) values for RG were somewhat more efficient as cows. The correlations were stronger when cow salvage value was included in the measures of cow efficiency. Correlations of DMI and mid-test metabolic BW (MMW) with life cycle cow efficiency ratios that did not include cow salvage value as output ranged from -0.15 (P < 0.10) to -0.22 (P < 0.01). Correlations of DMI and MMW with actual lifetime cow efficiency ratios varied from -0.20 (P < 0.05) to -0.36 (P < 0.001). Therefore, smaller heifers that consumed less feed had superior cow efficiency ratios.

The electrical conductivity perpendicular to the pressing direction is higher than that parallel to the pressing direction, 12.85 and 6.46 S cm at 773 K for SnSe:Bi 8% sample, respectively, while thermal conductivity perpendicular to the pressing direction is higher than that parallel to the pressing direction, 0.81 and 0.60 W m K at 773 K for SnSe:Bi 8% sample, respectively. We observed a bipolar conducting mechanism in our samples leading to n- to p-type transition, whose transition temperature increases with Bi concentration.

Most dryers are convective type in which hot air is used for reduction of product moisture content. Effect of adding a desiccant unit to a re-circulating convective dryer on thin layer drying kinetics of corn kernels is reported here. The influence of the desiccant unit, drying temperature and flow rate on drying time, moisture diffusivity coefficient and reactivation  were investigated. The experiments were conducted at air temperatures of 50, 60 and 70 °C and flow rates of 1, 1.4 and 1.8 kg/min with and without the desiccant unit. Results showed that the use of the desiccant wheel decreased drying time by 9.75% and increased drying rate by 7.85%. Application of a Logarithmic model for fitting the data, while being simple, resulted in good statistical indexes (R and RMSE). Moisture diffusivity coefficient was obtained to be in the 3.47258 × 10 to 8.18826 × 10 m/s range, while activation  varied between 14.2931 and 17.6770 kJ/mol on the average. Therefore, utilization of the desiccant unit accelerates moisture extraction from corn samples.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293782>Effect of corn residue  method with ruminally undegradable protein supplementation on performance of growing calves and fiber digestibility.</a></h1><p>Two experiments evaluated the effects of corn residue  method on animal performance and diet digestibility. Experiment 1 was designed as a  ×  + 1 factorial arrangement of treatments using 60 individually fed crossbred steers (280 kg [SD 32] initial BW; = 12). Factors were the corn residue  method (high-stem and conventional) and supplemental RUP at  concentrations (0 and 3.3% diet DM). A third  method (low-stem) was also evaluated, but only in diets containing supplemental RUP at 3.3% diet DM because of limitations in the amount of available low-stem residue. Therefore, the 3  methods were compared only in diets containing supplemental RUP. In Exp. , 9 crossbred wethers were blocked by BW (42.4 kg [SD 7] initial BW) and randomly assigned to diets containing corn residue harvested 1 of 3 ways (low-stem, high-stem, and conventional). In Exp. 1, steers fed the low-stem residue diet had greater ADG compared with the steers fed conventionally harvested corn residue ( = 0.03; 0.78 vs. 0.63 kg), whereas steers fed high-stem residue were intermediate ( > 0.17; 0.69 kg), not differing from either conventional or low-stem residues. Results from in vitro OM digestibility suggest that low-stem residue had the greatest ( < 0.01) amount of digestible OM compared with the other  residue  methods, which did not differ ( = 0.32; 55.0, 47.8, and 47.1% for low-stem, high-stem, and conventional residues, respectively). There were no differences in RUP content (40% of CP) and RUP digestibility (60%) among the 3 residues ( ≥ 0.35). No interactions were observed between  method and the addition of RUP ( ≥ 0.12). The addition of RUP tended to result in improved ADG (0.66 ± 0.07 vs. 0.58 ± 0.07 for supplemental RUP and no RUP, respectively; = 0.08) and G:F (0.116 ± 0.006 vs. 0.095 ± 0.020 for supplemental RUP and no RUP, respectively; = 0.02) compared with similar diets without the additional RUP. In Exp. , low-stem residue had greater DM and OM digestibility and DE ( < 0.01) than high-stem and conventional residues, which did not differ ( ≥ 0.63). Low-stem residue also had the greatest NDF digestibility (NDFD; < 0.01), whereas high-stem residue had greater NDFD than conventional residue ( < 0.01). Digestible  was greatest for low-stem residue ( < 0.05) and did not differ between high-stem and conventional residues ( = 0.50). Reducing the proportion of stem in the bale through changes in the  method increased the nutritive quality of corn residue.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370294>Comparative Grain Yield, Straw Yield, Chemical Composition, Carbohydrate and Protein Fractions, In Vitro Digestibility and Rumen Degradability of Four Common Vetch Varieties Grown on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.</a></h1><p>Four varieties of common vetch, including three improved varieties (Lanjian No. 1, Lanjian No. , and Lanjian No. 3) and one local variety (333A), were evaluated for varietal variations in grain yield, straw yield and straw quality attributes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Crops were harvested at pod maturity to determine grain yield, straw yield,  index, and potential utility index (PUI). Straw quality was determined by measuring chemical composition, carbohydrate and protein fractions, in vitro gas production and in situ ruminal degradability. Results showed a significant effect ( < 0.01) of variety on the grain yield [875.-1255 kg dry matter (DM)/ha], straw yield (3154-5556 kg DM/ha),  index (15.6-28.7%) and PUI (53.3-63.%). Variety also had a significant effect on chemical composition, carbohydrate and protein fractions ( < 0.05) except non-structural carbohydrates and rapidly degradable sugars. Significant differences ( < 0.05) were observed among the varieties in potential gas production [188-234 mL/g DM], in vitro organic matter (OM) digestibility (43.7-54.% of OM), and metabolizable  (6.40-7.92 MJ/kg DM) of straw. Significant differences ( < 0.001) were also observed among the varieties in rapidly degradable DM fraction and effective DM degradability of straw; however, no difference was observed in other DM degradation parameters and neutral detergent fiber degradation parameters. In conclusion, based on straw yield and quality, Lanjian No. 1 has the greatest potential among the tested varieties as a crop for supplementing ruminant diets for smallholder farmers on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773871>RGB-Colored Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) Thin-Film Solar Cells with Minimal Efficiency Loss Using Narrow-Bandwidth Stopband Nano-Multilayered Filters.</a></h1><p>Colorful Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) (CIGSSe) thin-film solar cells were achieved by integrating a narrow-bandwidth stopband filter (NBSF) on a CIGSSe cell. The full range of visible color of NBSF could be realized by depositing one-dimensional nano-multilayers of alternating high-index (AlO) and low-index (SiO) films while controlling the thickness of each layer and the number of stacked layers. Particularly, high-purity red, green, and blue (RGB) colors were generated on black CIGSSe cells with minimal  efficiency drop, showing power conversion efficiency (PCE) losses for the red and green CIGSSe cells of 4. and 1.%, respectively, with no reduction in the PCE of the blue CIGSSe cell. The minimal drop in the  efficiency was attributed to the antireflection effect of the NBSF and the low overlap between the reflectance spectrum of NBSFs with a narrow stopband and the absorption spectrum of CIGSSe. The esthetic value could be further enhanced through the color variation of the RGB NBSF with viewing angle, so-called pearl-like colors. The synergetic effect of minimal efficiency loss, full color realization, and the pearl-like color change of the newly developed NBSFs can make CIGSSe cells applicable to building-integrated photovoltaics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29879832>Potential of four corn varieties at different  stages for silage production in Malaysia.</a></h1><p>Apart from various climatic differences, corn  stage and varieties are two major factors that can influence the yield and quality of corn silage in the tropics. A study was conducted to determine the optimum  stage of four corn varieties for silage production in Malaysia.Corn was harvested at four growth stages; silking, milk, dough, and dent stages from four varieties; Sweet Corn hybrid 926, Suwan, breeding test line (BTL) 1 and BTL . Using a split plot design, the treatments were then analysed based on the plant growth performance, yield, nutritive and feeding values followed by a financial feasibility study for potential commercialization.Significant differences and interactions were detected across the parameters suggesting varying responses among the varieties towards the  stages. Sweet Corn was best harvested early in the dough stage due to high dry matter (DM) yield, digestible nutrient, and  content with low fibre portion. Suwan was recommended to be harvested at the dent stage when it gave the highest DM yield with optimum digestible nutrient and  content with low acid detergent fibre. BTL 1 and BTL  varieties can either be harvested at dough or dent stages as the crude protein, crude fibre, DM yield, DM content, digestible nutrient and  were not significantly different at either stage. Further financial analysis showed that only Sweet Corn production was not financially feasible while Suwan had the best financial appraisal values among the grain varieties.In conclusion, only the grain varieties tested had the potential for silage making according to their optimum  stage but Suwan is highly recommended for commercialization as it was the most profitable.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29292700>Monolayer CS as a metal-free photocatalyst with high carrier mobility and tunable band structure: a first-principles study.</a></h1><p>Producing hydrogen fuel using suitable photocatalysts from water splitting is a feasible method to  solar . A desired photocatalyst is expected to have suitable band gap, moderate band edge position, and high carrier mobility. By employing first-principles calculations, we explore a α-CS monolayer as a metal-free efficient photocatalyst. The α-CS monolayer shows good energetic, dynamic, and thermal stabilities and is insoluble in water, suggesting its experimental practicability. Monolayer and bilayer α-CS present not only appropriate band gaps for visible and ultraviolet light absorption but also moderate band alignments with water redox potentials in pH neutral water. Remarkably, the α-CS monolayer exhibits high (up to 8453.19 cm Vs for hole) and anisotropic carrier mobility, which is favorable to the migration and separation of photogenerated carriers. In addition, monolayer α-CS experiences an interesting semiconductor-metal transition by applying uniaxial strain and external electric field. Moreover, α-CS under certain strain and electric field is still dynamically stable with the absence of imaginary frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the graphite (0 0 1) surface is a potential substrate for the α-CS growth with the intrinsic properties of α-CS maintaining. Therefore, our results could pave the way for the application of α-CS as a promising photocatalyst.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336029>Photothermal Conversion Material Derived from Used Cigarette Filters for Solar Steam Generation.</a></h1><p>Solar steam generation by photothermal materials has recently emerged as a new and feasible approach to effectively  solar  in a variety of applications. This work reports an efficient heat localization material based on the renewable cellulose acetate cigarette filters and a reduced graphene oxide coating (RGO-CF) as the light-to-heat conversion layer for solar steam generation. RGO-CF possessed an aligned structure with superhydrophilic nature, lower thermal conductivity (0.0733 Wm  K ), and broad light adsorption (≈100 %). These characteristics enable rapid water transportation and excellent light-to-heat conversion by the resulting RGO-CF with an  conversion efficiency of 94 % under stimulated solar illumination (1 kW m ), which demonstrates that RGO-CF is a promising photothermal conversion material for solar steam generation. Such strategy for preparation of photothermal materials not only reduces the fabrication cost but also provides a fundamental guidance for the practical application of renewable polymer resources from used cigarette filters.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In recent years, the -harvesting triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has attracted increasing attentions due to its sustainability, flexibility, and versatility. However, achieving both high electric output and flexibility at the same time remains to be a challenge. In this work, we reported a corona charging enhanced flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (EF-TENG) to  mechanical  from human motions. The EF-TENG relied on the repeated contacts between a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanocomposite electret and a nanofibers/AgNWs electrode on arrayed silicone pyramids. When the EF-TENG (3.5 × 3.5 cm) was pressed, the open-circuit voltage ( V), the short-circuit current ( I), and the power density could reach 275 V, 9.5 μA, and 802.31 mW/m, respectively. The V of the EF-TENG was improved by 244% compared to the device of which the electret was not corona charged. Major factors that affected the electric output of the EF-TENG were discussed, including the height of the pyramids, the configuration of the pyramids array, and the properties of the electret nanocomposite. The EF-TENG only had an overall thickness of 1.3 mm and a weight of 1.7 g, making it especially suitable to be attached onto human body for harvesting mechanical  from biomechanical motions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671778>Live Traps for Adult Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs.</a></h1><p>Surveillance for detection of the brown marmorated stink bug, , is reliant on sticky panels with aggregation pheromone, which are low cost, but very inefficient (est. 3%). Trapping for adults was conducted in Italy with novel live (or lethal) traps consisting of aggregation pheromone-baited cylinders with a wind vane, with the upwind end covered by mesh and the downwind end sealed by a removable entry-only mesh cone, admitting the attracted bugs. The novel traps caught up to 15-times more adult  than identically-baited sticky panels in two weeks of daily checking (n = 6 replicates) (the new live traps were, in Run 1, 5-, 9-, 15-, 13-, 4-, 12-, -fold; and in Run , 7-, 1-, 3-, 7-, 6-, 6-, and 5-fold better than sticky traps, daily). The maximum catch of the new traps was 96 live adults in one trap in 24 h and the average improvement was ~7-fold compared with sticky panels. The rotating live traps, which exploit a mesh funnel facing the plume downwind that proved useful for collecting adults, could also be used to kill bugs. We expect that commercially-available traps could replace the crude prototypes we constructed quickly from local materials, at low cost, as long as the principles of a suitable plume structure were observed, as we discuss. The traps could be useful for the sterile insect technique, supporting rearing colonies, or to kill bugs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30795502>Electrostatic MEMS Vibration  Harvesters inside of Tire Treads.</a></h1><p>An electret electrostatic MEMS vibration  harvester for tire sensors mounted inside of the tire tread is reported.

In this work, we present a flexible touch pad capable of detecting the contact location of an object and generating substantial  simultaneously based on the coupling of triboelectric effects and electrostatic induction. The touch pad consists of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) thin film, multiple Aluminum (Al) electrodes and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) layers, which can be achieved through low cost, simplified and scalable fabrication process. Different from the conventional multi-pixel-based positioning sensor (i.e., large array of sensing elements and electrodes), the analogue method proposed here is used to implement the positioning function with only four electrodes. Position location can achieve a detecting resolution of as small as 1.3 mm (the size of locating layer is 7.5 cm × 7.5 cm). For the  harvesting part, a multilayer structure is designed to provide higher current output. The open circuit voltage of the device is around 420 V and the short circuit current can reach up to 6.26 µA with current density of 0.25 µA/cm². The maximum output power obtained is approximately 10 mW, which is 0.4 mW/cm².

A randomized block design with 83 treatments and two replicates was adopted. Four annual harvests were performed (2012-2015) and dry matter yield (DMY, t.ha.year) was evaluated. Individual and combined analyses of variance for DMY revealed significant effects for genotypes, harvests, and for the genotype x  interaction at the probability levels of 1 and 5%. Genotypes indicated by the YC and PP methods are associated with higher stability and lower DMY. The weighting of KP with YC and PP was highly effective in associating stability with DMY. The LB and ANN methods showed strong agreement with each other and produced similar classifications as to phenotypic stability, and so we recommend using one or the other.

However, the status of PAHs in winter wheat grains from the areas influenced by coal combustion in China was still not clear. During  season, the winter wheat grains were collected from agricultural fields surrounding coal-fired power plants located in Shaanxi and Henan Provinces. This study found that the mean concentrations of 15 priority PAHs ranged from 69.58 to 557.0μgkg. Three-ring PAHs (acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene) were dominant in the grains, accounting for approximately 70-81% of the total PAHs. The bioaccessibility of low molecular weight (LMW, -3 ring) PAHs (51.1-52.8%), high molecular weight (HMW, 4-6 ring) PAHs (19.8-27.6%) and total PAHs (40.9-48.0%) in the intestinal condition was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that (37.4-38.6%; 15.6-22.5%; 30.7-35.5%) in the gastric condition, respectively. Based on total PAHs, the values of incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for children, adolescents, adults and seniors were all higher than the baseline value (10) and some even fell in the range of 10-10, which indicated that most grains from the areas affected by coal combustion possessed considerable cancer risk. The present study also indicated that the children were the age group most sensitive to PAHs contamination. The pilot research provided relevant information for the regulation of PAHs in the winter wheat grains and for the safety of the agro-products growing in the PAHs-contaminated areas.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Since light incidence is limited to the surface, water depth can affect microalgal growth in HRAP. To investigate the effect of water depth on microalgal growth, a mixed microalgal culture constituting three major strains of microalgae including  sp.,  sp., and  sp. (CSS), was grown at different water depths (20, 30, and 40 cm) in the HRAP, respectively. The HRAP with 20cm of water depth had about 38% higher biomass productivity per unit area (6.16 ± 0.33 g·m⁻²·d⁻¹) and required lower nutrients and  consumption than the other water depths. Specifically, the algal biomass of HRAP under 20c m of water depth had higher settleability through larger floc size (83.6% settleability within 5 min). These results indicate that water depth can affect the harvesting process as well as cultivation of microalgae. Therefore, we conclude that water depth is an important parameter in HRAP design for mass cultivation of microalgae.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31260244>Dynamic Analysis to Enhance the Performance of a Rotating-Disk-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator by Injected Gas.</a></h1><p>A rotating-disk-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) generating electrical  from wind usually includes a propeller. TENGs are widely used because their high frequency of rotation allows them to generate a relatively high output current. Deep analysis of the gas flow in a TENG is essential to improve its  conversion efficiency. However, previous studies have isolated the propeller and the TENG as separate entities that  wind  and generate electrical , respectively. Most studies focused on each entity because considering both the dynamics and the TENG operation together is an intricate process. This paper introduces a dynamic analysis of the gas flow by dividing it into four vertical and horizontal directions and carrying out a COMSOL simulation to verify the pressure on the propeller and the flow of the gas. The electrical outputs are measured while varying the height and angle of the inlet and the number of wings on the propeller. After optimization, the P-TENG generated a high output power density of 283.95 mW/m, which can light up 205 light-emitting diodes and drive a commercial small electronic appliance.

It is a novel, natural, low-kilojoule, cost-effective texture-modifying ingredient in functional food products. Yet, the cultivar with the most optimal nutrient content and the preferred  times are as yet unknown. For this reason, mucilage from three  (Algerian, Morado and Gymno-Carpo) and one  (Robusta) cultivar were investigated to determine their nutrient content over six months. Nutrients that contribute  (10. kJ/g) were low. The mineral content was high (ash 17.7/100 g), particularly calcium (3.0 g/100 g) and phosphorous (109.5 mg/kg). Low insoluble acid-detergent fibre (1.4 g/kg) and neutral-detergent fibre (.1 g/kg) values indicated that mucilage was mostly soluble fibre. Calcium oxalate crystals were not detected in dried mucilage.  powders had higher protein, extractable fat and potassium content, while  mucilage powders had higher polyunsaturated (Linoleic and α-Linolenic acid) fat content.  Robusta mucilage, harvested after the fruit  (February) had the lowest  content and the highest mineral and protein content. Mucilage powders were highly soluble, low-kilojoule and mineral-rich.

We study the  efficiency data transmission problem in IoT sensors that use capacitors to  wireless  while considering the  cost for running security algorithms.  harvesting with capacitors has the characteristic that the  harvesting rate varies over time, and it is getting slower and slower as the capacitor gets more and more wireless . This observation will result in a trade-off for data transmission in two ways: (1) dividing data into more number of packets, thus the sensors can receive wireless  at a higher harvesting rate, but it will result in extra  consumption; () dividing data into less numbers of packets-in this way, the sensor cannot utilize the high harvesting rate, but the extra  cost is less. We studied two sets of this problem where the low-power sensors can  enough wireless  or not, and give algorithms to transmit all the data or as much data as possible, respectively, while taking into account extra cost.

The textile is based on highly-stretchable conductive ecoflex fiber modified with multiwall carbon nanotube and polyaniline (PANI) derivatives (acting as one electrode). The surface of the fiber is twined with varnished wire (acting as the other electrode). Upon applied deformation of stretching or bending, the sensing-textile can  the mechanical  and output electric signals through the triboelectrification effect between PANI and varnished wire. After being attached on the human body, the triboelectric output of the sensing-textile can be used to monitor body motion, including finger bending and body stretching. Interestingly, the triboelectric output of the sensing-textile is significantly dependent on the atmosphere, which can actively distinguish different gas species in the environment. The sensitivity, stability and selectivity against ethanol, ammonia, acetone and formaldehyde are high. The response against 400 ppm ethanol vapor at room temperature is up to 54.73%. The current density is .1 × 10 A m, and the power density is 4. × 10 W m. During both the motion detecting and gas sensing processes, no external electricity power is needed. The triboelectric signal can be treated as not only the sensing signal but also the power source for driving the device. The working mechanism is based on surface-triboelectric coupling effect.

This will motivate enhanced forest  rates and whole tree  to supply the increasing biomass demand. Negative nutrient budgets for certain timberland areas where geogenic nutrient supply cannot cope with harvesting rates will be one consequence. A spatially explicit analysis for a U.S. timberland area of 33,570 km reveals that for a minimum nutrient loss and supply scenario, negative nutrient budgets occur in 17, 20, 16, and almost 94% of the studied areas for Ca, K, Mg, and P, respectively. For a maximum nutrient loss (considering intensive harvesting) and supply assumptions, the affected areas increase to 50, 57, 45 and 96% for Ca, K, Mg, and P, respectively. In general, atmospheric nutrient deposition is of minor importance for the high weathering supply cases. Increasing global woody biomass demand may cause additional pressure on forested ecosystems, enlarging negative nutrient budget areas. If woody biomass demand rises, strategies to counterbalance nutrient gaps might be needed, for example, by preparing harvested areas with rock products, designed to replenish growth limiting nutrients, and/or implementing forest management strategies to minimize nutrient export.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271026>Enhancing the Performance of Textile Triboelectric Nanogenerators with Oblique Microrod Arrays for Wearable  Harvesting.</a></h1><p>The rapid development of wearable electronics urgently requires a wearable -harvesting technology that can convert mechanical  from body movements into electricity. In this paper, a novel structure with an oblique microrod array is employed to fabricate a high-performance textile-based wearable triboelectric nanogenerator (WTNG). The contact area of WTNGs can be efficiently enhanced when the oblique poly(dimethylsiloxane) microrods are forced to bend uniformly and slide along one direction during the working condition. The oblique microrod structure enables the WTNG to generate a short-circuit current density and an open-circuit voltage reaching 3.24 μA/cm and 1014. V, respectively. The maximum peak power density of a WTNG reached 211.7 μW/cm. Meanwhile, 48 red light-emitting diodes were simultaneously lit up by tapping a WTNG. Furthermore, the WTNG can be dressed on an elbow to continuously   from human motions as a sustainable power source. This work develops an efficient approach for enhancing the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators and paves a promising way to power wearable electronics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29364649>Architectonics: Design of Molecular Architecture for Functional Applications.</a></h1><p>The term architectonics has its roots in the architectural and philosophical (as early as 1600s) literature that refers to "the theory of structure" and "the structure of theory", respectively. The concept of architectonics has been adapted to advance the field of molecular self-assembly and termed as molecular architectonics. In essence, the methodology of organizing molecular units in the required and controlled configurations to develop advanced functional systems for materials and biological applications comprises the field of molecular architectonics. This concept of designing noncovalent systems enables to focus on different functional aspects of designer molecules for biological and nonbiological applications and also strengthens our efforts toward the mastery over the art of controlled molecular self-assemblies. Programming complex molecular interactions and assemblies for specific functions has been one of the most challenging tasks in the modern era. Meticulously ordered molecular assemblies can impart remarkable developments in several areas spanning , health, and environment. For example, the well-defined nano-, micro-, and macroarchitectures of functional molecules with specific molecular ordering possess potential applications in flexible electronics, photovoltaics, photonic crystals, microreactors, sensors, drug delivery, biomedicine, and superhydrophobic coatings, among others. The functional molecular architectures having unparalleled properties are widely evident in various designs of Nature. By drawing inspirations from Nature, intended molecular architectures can be designed and developed to  various functions, as there is an inexhaustible resource and scope. In this Account, we present exquisite designer molecules developed by our group and others with an objective to master the art of molecular recognition and self-assembly for functional applications. We demonstrate the tailor-ability of molecular self-assemblies by employing biomolecules like amino acids and nucleobases as auxiliaries. Naphthalenediimide (NDI), perylenediimide (PDI), and few other molecular systems serve as functional modules. The effects of stereochemistry and minute structural modifications in the molecular designs on the supramolecular interactions, and construction of self-assembled zero-dimensional (OD), one-dimensional (1D), and two-dimensional (2D) nano- and microarchitectures like particles, spheres, cups, bowls, fibers, belts, helical belts, supercoiled helices, sheets, fractals, and honeycomb-like arrays are discussed in extensive detail. Additionally, we present molecular systems that showcase the elegant designs of coassembly, templated assembly, hierarchical assembly, transient self-assembly, chiral denaturation, retentive helical memory, self-replication, supramolecular regulation, supramolecular speciation, supernon linearity, dynamic pathway complexity, supramolecular heterojunction, living supramolecular polymerization, and molecular machines. Finally, we describe the molecular engineering principles learnt over the years that have led to several applications, namely, organic electronics, self-cleaning, high-mechanical strength, and tissue engineering.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31566271>Revealing the Cooperative Relationship between Spin, , and Polarization Parameters toward Developing High-Efficiency Exciplex Light-Emitting Diodes.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies to reveal the cooperative relationship between spin, , and polarization through intermolecular charge-transfer dipoles to  nonradiative triplets into radiative singlets in exciplex light-emitting diodes are reported. Magneto-photoluminescence studies reveal that the triplet-to-singlet conversion in exciplexes involves an artificially generated spin-orbital coupling (SOC). The photoinduced electron parametric resonance measurements indicate that the intermolecular charge-transfer occurs with forming electric dipoles (D →A ), providing the ionic polarization to generate SOC in exciplexes. By having different singlet-triplet  differences (ΔE ) in 9,9'-diphenyl-9H,9'H-3,3'-bicarbazole (BCzPh):3',3'″,3'″″-(1,3,5-triazine-,4,6-triyl)tris(([1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carbonitrile)) (CN-T2T) (ΔE = 30 meV) and BCzPh:bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)--methyl-pyrimidine (B3PYMPM) (ΔE = 130 meV) exciplexes, the SOC generated by the intermolecular charge-transfer states shows large and small values (reflected by different internal magnetic parameters: 274 vs 17 mT) with high and low external quantum efficiency maximum, EQE (21.05% vs 4.89%), respectively. To further explore the cooperative relationship of spin, , and polarization parameters, different photoluminescence wavelengths are selected to concurrently change SOC, ΔE , and polarization while monitoring delayed fluorescence. When the electron clouds become more deformed at a longer emitting wavelength due to reduced dipole (D →A ) size, enhanced SOC, increased orbital polarization, and decreased ΔE can simultaneously occur to cooperatively operate the triplet-to-singlet conversion.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper innovatively proposes a stretchable nanocomposite nanogenerator with good transparency that can be conformally attached to the human body to  biomechanical  and monitor physiological signals. The work reports an innovative device that uses sprayed silver nanowires as transparent electrodes and sandwiches a nanocomposite of piezoelectric BaTiO and polydimethylsiloxane as the sensing layer, which exhibits good transparency and mechanical transformability with stretchable, foldable, and twistable properties. The highly flexible nanogenerator affords a good input-output linearity under the vertical force and the sensing ability to detect lateral stretching deformation up to 60% strain under piezoelectric mechanisms. Furthermore, the proposed device can effectively  touch energies from the human body as a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator. Under periodic contact and separation, a maximum output voltage of 105 V, a current density of 6.5 μA/cm, and a power density of 102 μW/cm can be achieved, exhibiting a good power generation performance. Owing to the high conformability and excellent sensitivity of the nanogenerator, it can also act as a self-powered wearable sensor attached to different parts of the human body for real-time monitoring of the human physiological signals such as eye blinking, pronunciation, arm movement, and radial artery pulse. The designed nanocomposite nanogenerator shows great potential for use in self-powered e-skins and healthcare monitoring systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155262>Optimal  timing for brown midrib forage sorghum yield, nutritive value, and ration performance.</a></h1><p>Forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a viable alternative to corn silage (Zea mays L.) in double cropping rotations with forage winter cereals in New York due to a later planting date and potentially earlier  date of forage sorghum than is typical for corn silage. Our objective was to determine whether  of brachytic dwarf brown midrib forage sorghum can take place before the currently recommended soft dough  time while maintaining dry matter (DM) yield, forage nutritive value, and total mixed ration performance. Seven trials were conducted on  research farms in central New York from 2014 to 2017. Forage sorghum received 1 of  fertilizer N rates at planting (112 and 224 kg of N/ha). Stands were harvested at boot, flower, milk, and soft dough stages. Forage samples were analyzed for nutritive value and substituted for corn silage in a typical dairy total mixed ration at varying amounts using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. Timing of  affected yield and forage nutritive value for each individual trial and across trials, and the effects were independent of N fertilizer application rate. Averaged across trials, yield ranged from 10.7 Mg of DM/ha for the boot stage to 13.5, 15., and 15.8 Mg of DM/ha for the flower, milk, and soft dough stages, respectively. For individual trials, yield either remained constant with  beyond the flower stage (4 trials), or beyond the milk stage (1 trial), whereas for  trials yield increased up to the soft dough stage. At the later  stages, DM, starch, and nonfiber carbohydrates were increased, whereas crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and 30-h neutral detergent fiber digestibility were decreased. Without adjusting for DM intake, substitution of corn silage by forage sorghum harvested at the soft dough stage resulted in stable predicted metabolizable  allowable milk, whereas the reduced starch content of earlier harvested sorghum resulted in less metabolizable  allowable milk with greater substitution of corn silage for sorghum. Forage sorghum can be harvested as early as the flower or milk stage without losing DM yield, allowing for timely planting of forage winter cereal in a double cropping rotation. However,  supplementation in the diet is needed to make up for reduced starch concentrations with  of sorghum at flower and milk growth stages.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Microbial oxidation in unsaturated soils is the only known biological process that removes CH from the atmosphere, but so far, bacteria that can grow on atmospheric CH have eluded all cultivation efforts. In this study, we have isolated a pure culture of a bacterium, strain MG08 that grows on air at atmospheric concentrations of CH [1.86 parts per million volume (p.p.m.v.)]. This organism, named , is globally distributed in soils and closely related to uncultured members of the upland soil cluster α. CH oxidation experiments and C-single cell isotope analyses demonstrated that it oxidizes atmospheric CH aerobically and assimilates carbon from both CH and CO Its estimated specific affinity for CH (a ) is the highest for any cultivated methanotroph. However, growth on ambient air was also confirmed for  and , close relatives with a lower specific affinity for CH, suggesting that the ability to utilize atmospheric CH for growth is more widespread than previously believed. The closed genome of  MG08 encodes a single particulate methane monooxygenase, the serine cycle for assimilation of carbon from CH and CO, and CO fixation via the recently postulated reductive glycine pathway. It also fixes dinitrogen and expresses the genes for a high-affinity hydrogenase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, suggesting that atmospheric CH oxidizers  additional  from oxidation of the atmospheric trace gases carbon monoxide (0. p.p.m.v.) and hydrogen (0.5 p.p.m.v.).Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

As mannitol is among the most important osmotic adjustment substances in fungal resistance, this study sampled mycelia of strains V23 and VH3 treated at 0°C for 0, , 4, 8, and 10 h to analyze changes in intracellular mannitol content by high-performance anion chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HAPEC-PAD). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis was applied to assess differences in the transcript levels of genes associated with mannitol metabolism under low-temperature stress. A mannitol solution was added to cultures of  fruiting bodies, and effects on the hypothermic resistance of these organs were explored by evaluating variations in sensory properties during cryogenic storage after . The results suggested that in the initial stage of low-temperature treatment, intracellular mannitol was largely catabolized as an  storage material and the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in synthetic reactions was inhibited. However, low-temperature resistance was induced with further treatment, with activation of mannitol synthesis and inhibition of degradation; the cells accumulated mannitol, leading to osmoregulation. No significant elongation of  fruiting bodies during storage at 4°C was observed, and these organs tended to shrink and collapse. The sensory quality of mannitol-treated fruiting bodies was much better than that of control fruiting bodies.

The compound partially epimerizes to ( R)-5-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→)-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy]naringenin () when heated at different temperatures (80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 °C) for a prolonged period in a phosphate buffer at pH 5. The fractional conversion model predicted the decrease in the concentration of compound 1 the best. The activation  of the conversion reaction was calculated as 99.16 kJ mol. Prolonged heating resulted not only in formation of compound  but eventually a decrease in its concentration and the formation of another conversion product, ( E)-'-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→)-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy]-4',6',4-trihydroxychalcone (3).

Genetic constituents, high-fat and high- dietary habits, and a sedentary lifestyle are three major factors that contribute to high risk of T2D. Several studies have reported gut microbiome dysbiosis as a factor in rapid progression of insulin resistance in T2D that accounts for about 90% of all diabetes cases worldwide. The gut microbiome dysbiosis may reshape intestinal barrier functions and host metabolic and signaling pathways, which are directly or indirectly related to the insulin resistance in T2D. Thousands of the metabolites derived from microbes interact with the epithelial, hepatic and cardiac cell receptors that modulate host physiology. Xenobiotics including dietary components, antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs strongly affect the gut microbial composition and can promote dysbiosis. Any change in the gut microbiota can shift the host metabolism towards increased   during diabetes and obesity. However, the exact mechanisms behind the dynamics of gut microbes and their impact on host metabolism at the molecular level are yet to be deciphered. We reviewed the published literature for better understanding of the dynamics of gut microbiota, factors that potentially induce gut microbiome dysbiosis and their relation to the progression of T2D.

Nitrous oxide (NO) is a potent greenhouse gas, and this paper addresses a knowledge gap concerning soil NO emissions over the possible "hot spot" of land use conversion from established pasture to the biofuel crop . The work aims to quantify the impacts of this land use change on NO fluxes using three different cultivation methods. Three replicates of four treatments were established:  (Mxg) planted without tillage; Mxg planted with light tillage; a novel seed-based  hybrid planted with light tillage under bio-degradable mulch film; and a control of uncultivated established grass pasture with sheep grazing. Soil NO fluxes were recorded every  weeks using static chambers starting from preconversion in April 2016 and continuing until the end of October 2017. Monthly soil samples were also taken and analysed for nitrate and ammonium. There was no significant difference in NO emissions between the different cultivation methods. However, in comparison with the uncultivated pasture, NO emissions from the cultivated  plots were 550%-819% higher in the first year (April to December 2016) and 469%-485% higher in the second year (January to October 2017).

Obesity is associated with overactivation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in adult subjects, but the role of the ECS in the developmental origins of obesity is mostly unknown. The ECS consists of endocannabinoids, cannabinoid receptors (cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) and cannabinoid type- receptor (CB2)) and metabolising enzymes. We hypothesised that perinatal maternal HF diet would alter the ECS in a sex-dependent manner in white and brown adipose tissue of rat offspring at weaning in parallel to obesity development. Female rats received standard diet (9 %  content from fat) or HF diet (29 %  content from fat) before mating, during pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring were killed for tissue . Maternal HF diet induced early obesity, white adipocyte hypertrophy and increased lipid accumulation in brown adipose tissue associated with sex-specific changes of the ECS's components in weanling rats. In male pups, maternal HF diet decreased CB1 and CB2 protein in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In female pups, maternal HF diet increased visceral and decreased subcutaneous CB1. In brown adipose tissue, maternal HF diet increased CB1 regardless of pup sex. In addition, maternal HF diet differentially changed oestrogen receptor across the adipose depots in male and female pups. The ECS and oestrogen signalling play an important role in lipogenesis, adipogenesis and thermogenesis, and we observed early changes in their targets in adipose depots of the offspring.

In addition, fluoride-associated changes in oral community composition resulted in depletion of gene families involved in central carbon metabolism and   (-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, succinate dehydrogenase, and the glyoxylate cycle). In contrast, fluoride treatment did not induce a significant shift in gut microbial community composition or function in our mouse model, possibly due to absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Fluoride-associated perturbations thus appeared to have a selective effect on the composition of the oral but not gut microbial community in mice. Future studies will be necessary to understand possible implications of fluoride exposure for the human microbiome.  Fluoride has been added to drinking water and dental products since the 1950s. The beneficial effects of fluoride on oral health are due to its ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria that cause dental caries. Despite widespread human consumption of fluoride, there have been only two studies of humans that considered the effect of fluoride on human-associated microbial communities, which are increasingly understood to play important roles in health and disease. Notably, neither of these studies included a true cross-sectional control lacking fluoride exposure, as study subjects continued baseline fluoride treatment in their daily dental hygiene routines. To our knowledge, this work (in mice) is the first controlled study to assess the independent effects of fluoride exposure on the oral and gut microbial communities. Investigating how fluoride interacts with host-associated microbial communities in this controlled setting represents an effort toward understanding how common environmental exposures may potentially influence health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31474111>Rapid Water Harvesting and Nonthermal Drying in Humid Air by N-Doped Graphene Micropads.</a></h1><p>We demonstrate a novel nanotextured graphene micropad that can rapidly  water from air to generate microscale water droplets with the desired size in designated positions on demand by simply applying a negative electric bias of -1.5 to -15 V. More interestingly, the water droplets can be reversibly dried nonthermally with the pad at ambient temperature in humid air (∼85% RH) by applying a positive electric bias of +1.5 to +15 V. The harvesting and drying rates on the glass are .7 and 1.5 μm/s under biases of -15 and +15 V, respectively, but no apparent harvesting or drying activities are observed without the bias. The  consumption is minimal as there is no Joule current due to the insulative substrate. It is shown that substrate wettability and ions play an important role in enabling the fast water harvesting and nonthermal drying. Molecular modeling is developed to understand the harvesting and drying mechanisms at the atomic scale. The water harvesting/drying approach may be useful for many technological applications such as micro/nanolithography, 3D printing, MEMS, and biochemical and microfluid devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031578>Effects of growth stage and growing degree day accumulations on triticale forages: 1. Dry matter yield, nutritive value, and in vitro dry matter disappearance.</a></h1><p>The use of triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) in dairy-cropping systems has expanded greatly in recent years, partly to improve land stewardship by providing winter ground cover. Our objective was to establish relationships relating indices of nutritive value with growth stage or accumulated growing degree days >5°C for triticale forages grown in central Wisconsin. Replicated 3.7-m × 9.1-m plots were established following removal of corn for silage (fall 2015) and soybeans (fall 2016) and then harvested at various growth stages the following spring. Plants were assigned a numerical growth stage based on a linear staging system suitable for use as an independent regression variable. Response variables [e.g., dry matter (DM) yield, indices of nutritive value, and parameters from in vitro DM disappearance kinetics] were regressed on growth stage and growing degree days using linear, quadratic, cubic, or quartic models. For spring 2016, the mean DM yield at the boot stage (3,804 kg of DM/ha) was only 30% of that observed at the soft dough stage of growth (12,642 kg of DM/ha). Although yields were reduced during spring 2017, primarily due to spring flooding, the relationship between respective yields at these growth stages was similar (1,453 vs. 5,399 kg of DM/ha). Regressions of DM yield (kg/ha) on growth stage for 2016 were explained by a cubic model (Y = 0.0663x - 9.44x + 595x - 9,810) compared with a simple linear response for 2017 (Y = 103x - 3,024); in both cases, coefficients of determination were very high (R ≥ 0.934). Many nutritional and in vitro DM disappearance characteristics were affected by the juxtaposition and balance of  generally competing factors: (1) increased concentrations of structural plant fiber coupled with concurrent lignification as plants matured and () the accumulation of highly digestible carbohydrate during seed head development. A comparison of respective  yields between the boot and soft dough stages of growth for 2016 (,488 vs. 8,141 kg of total digestible nutrients/ha) and 2017 (1,033 vs. 3,520 kg of total digestible nutrients/ha) suggests that yields of  are greater at soft dough stage and are mostly driven by DM yield. An informed  management decision for lactating cows may still favor a boot-stage  because of superior nutritional characteristics, a need to plant double-cropped corn expeditiously, or both.  timing of triticale forages for other livestock classes would appear to be more flexible, but prioritizing a subsequent double crop may reduce the effects on DM yield to a secondary consideration.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

A minimal treatment time of 240 s at Ultraviolet-C dosage of .15 kJ/m was observed to provoke a considerable increase in bioactive compounds content, proportionated to treatment time. Although treatment led to temperature increase in the system reaching 39.33 °C due to heat generation by ultrasonic cavitation, the extractability and biosynthesis of phytochemicals were enhanced resulting in 90%, 30%, 60%, 20%, and 36% increases in lycopene, total phenols, vitamin C, hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities respectively. Results present the potential use of the combined non-thermal technologies as post- treatment to improve bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity during storage.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Probiotics and/or prebiotics could be a promising approach to improve insulin sensitivity by favourably modifying the composition of the gut microbial community, reducing intestinal endotoxin concentrations and decreasing  . The aim of the present review was to investigate the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics (a combination of probiotics and prebiotics) on insulin resistance in human clinical trials and to discuss the potential mechanisms whereby probiotics and prebiotics improve glucose metabolism. The anti-diabetic effects of probiotics include reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines via a NF-κB pathway, reduced intestinal permeability, and lowered oxidative stress. SCFA play a key role in glucose homeostasis through multiple potential mechanisms of action. Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors on L-cells by SCFA promotes the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY resulting in increased insulin and decreased glucagon secretion, and suppressed appetite. SCFA can decrease intestinal permeability and decrease circulating endotoxins, lowering inflammation and oxidative stress. SCFA may also have anti-lipolytic activities in adipocytes and improve insulin sensitivity via GLUT4 through the up-regulation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase signalling in muscle and liver tissues. Resistant starch and synbiotics appear to have favourable anti-diabetic effects. However, there are few human interventions. Further well-designed human clinical studies are required to develop recommendations for the prevention of type  diabetes with pro- and prebiotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682099>Tolerance and dose-response assessment of subchronic dietary ethoxyquin exposure in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).</a></h1><p>Ethoxyquin (EQ; 6-Ethoxy-,,4-trimethyl-1,-dihydroquinoline) has been used as an antioxidant in feed components for pets, livestock and aquaculture. However, possible risks of EQ used in aquafeed for fish health have not yet been characterized. The present study investigated the toxicity and dose-response of subchronic dietary EQ exposure at doses ranging from 41 to 9666 mg EQ/kg feed in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Feed at concentrations higher than 1173 mg EQ/kg were rejected by the fish, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth performance. No mortality was observed in fish exposed to any of the doses. A multi-omic screening of metabolome and proteome in salmon liver indicated an effect of dietary EQ on bioenergetics pathways and hepatic redox homeostasis in fish fed concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg feed. Increased  expenditure associated with an upregulation of hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation and induction and carbohydrate catabolic pathways resulted in a dose-dependent depletion of intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in liver histological sections, decreasing whole body lipid levels and altered purine/pyrimidine metabolism. Increased GSH and TBARS in the liver indicated a state of oxidative stress, which was associated with activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and glutathione-mediated detoxification processes. However, no oxidative DNA damage was observed. As manifestation of altered  metabolism, the depletion of liver intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles was considered the critical endpoint for benchmark dose assessment, and a BMDL10 of 243 mg EQ/kg feed was derived as a safe upper limit of EQ exposure in Atlantic salmon.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30272827>Synthesis of Particulate Hierarchical Tandem Heterojunctions toward Optimized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production.</a></h1><p>Photocatalytic hydrogen production using semiconductors is identified as one of the most promising routes for sustainable ; however, it is challenging to  the full solar spectrum in a particulate photocatalyst for high activity. Herein, a hierarchical hollow black TiO /MoS /CdS tandem heterojunction photocatalyst, which allows broad-spectrum absorption, thus delivering enhanced hydrogen evolution performance is designed and synthesized. The MoS nanosheets not only function as a cost-effective cocatalyst but also act as a bridge to connect two light-harvesting semiconductors into a tandem heterojunction where the CdS nanoparticles and black TiO spheres absorb UV and visible light on both sides efficiently, coupling with the MoS cocatalyst into a particulate photocatalyst system. Consequently, the photocatalytic hydrogen rate of the black TiO /MoS /CdS tandem heterojunction is as high as 179 µmol h per 20 mg photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation, which is almost 3 times higher than that of black TiO /MoS heterojunctions (57. µmol h ). Most importantly, the stability of CdS nanoparticles in the black TiO /MoS /CdS tandem heterojunction is greatly improved compared to MoS /CdS because of the formation of tandem heterojunctions and the strong UV-absorbing effect of black TiO . Such a tandem architectural design provides new ways for synthesizing particulate photocatalysts with high efficiencies.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the UC efficiency of solid materials is largely limited by low fluorescence quantum yields that originate from the aggregation of TTA-UC chromophores and also by severe back  transfer from the acceptor singlet state to the singlet state of the triplet donor in the condensed state. In this work, to overcome these issues, we introduce a highly fluorescent singlet  collector as the third component of donor-doped acceptor crystalline films, in which dual  migration, i.e., triplet  migration for TTA-UC and succeeding singlet  migration for transferring  to a collector, takes place. To demonstrate this scheme, a highly fluorescent singlet  collector was added as the third component of donor-doped acceptor crystalline films. An anthracene-based acceptor containing alkyl chains and a carboxylic moiety is mixed with the triplet donor Pt(II) octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) and the  collector ,5,8,11-tetra- tert-butylperylene (TTBP) in solution, and simple spin-coating of the mixed solution gives acceptor films of nanofibrous crystals homogeneously doped with PtOEP and TTBP. Interestingly, delocalized singlet excitons in acceptor crystals are found to diffuse effectively over the distance of ∼37 nm. Thanks to this high diffusivity, only 0.5 mol % of doped TTBP can  most of the singlet excitons, which successfully doubles the solid-state fluorescent quantum yield of acceptor/TTBP blend films to 76%. Furthermore, since the donor PtOEP and the collector TTBP are separately isolated in the nanofibrous acceptor crystals, the singlet back  transfer from the collector to the donor is effectively avoided. Such efficient singlet  collection and inhibited back  transfer processes result in a large increase of UC efficiency up to 9.0%, offering rational design principles toward ultimately efficient solid-state upconverters.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053265>Step-Economical Photoassisted Diversity-Oriented Synthesis: Sustaining Cascade Photoreactions in Oxalyl Anilides to Access Complex Polyheterocyclic Molecular Architectures.</a></h1><p>Atom- and step-economy in photoassisted diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) is achieved with a versatile oxalyl linker offering rapid access to complex alkaloid mimics in very few experimentally simple steps: (i) it allows for fast tethering of the photoactive core to the unsaturated pendants, especially important in the case of (hetero)aromatic amines-essentially a one-pot reaction with no isolation of intermediates; (ii) the α-dicarbonyl tether acts as a chromophore enhancer, extending the conjugation chain and facilitating the "" of the lower  photons for the primary and secondary photoreactions; (iii) it enhances the quantum yield of intersystem crossing (ISC), i.e., it is capable of sensitizing secondary photochemical processes in the cascade; and (iv) the tether forms an additional heterocyclic moiety, imidazolidine-4,5-dione, a known pharmacophore. The overall photoassisted cascade is an efficient complexity-building process as quantified by computed step-normalized complexity indices, leading to extended polyheterocyclic molecular architectures comparable in complexity to natural products such as paclitaxel while requiring only -4 simple synthetic steps from readily available chemical feedstock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29594308>Sunlight-charged heterojunction TiO and WO particle-embedded inorganic membranes for night-time environmental applications.</a></h1><p>A metal oxide-heterojunction photocatalyst is developed to  sunlight, store the  in electrons, and apply the stored  in water treatment. Light-absorbing nanoparticular and nanotubular TiO2 are hybridized with electron-storing WO3 at different weight ratios of TiO2 to WO3 (e.g., TW25 represents a composite of 25 wt% TiO2 and 75 wt% WO3). The ability of the TW composite to utilize the stored electrons is examined for the reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(vi)). In the photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests, irradiation using simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm-) leads to a rapid shift in the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the TW electrodes to the negative potential region (photocharging process). The termination of irradiation causes a gradual shift of the OCP to the positive potential region over 20 h (discharging process). Spiked Cr(vi) added to the solution with pre-photocharged TW electrodes is efficiently removed; the kinetics of this process depends on the TW composition (25, 50, or 75 wt%), TiO2 morphology (particular or tubular), initial Cr(vi) concentration (0.125 or 0.25 ppm), and whether the conditions are aerated or non-aerated. Based on this knowledge, TW composite-embedded inorganic membranes are synthesized and charged using sunlight. For Cr(vi) removal, single-pass and continuous circulation filtration systems are employed. The fraction of Cr(vi) removed from the circulation system is ∼30% in 4 h, which is 1.5 times that removed using the single-pass filtration system (∼20%). An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the TW membranes used for Cr(vi) removal reveals that Cr is not sorbed in the membrane. The W(vi) in WO3 is partially reduced to W(6-x)+ upon photocharging and is oxidized during the reduction of Cr(vi), leading to the co-existence of W6+ and W(6-x)+.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590126>Adipose tissue as a possible therapeutic target for polyphenols: A case for Cyclopia extracts as anti-obesity nutraceuticals.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a significant contributor to increased morbidity and premature mortality due to increasing the risk of many chronic metabolic diseases such as type  diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Lifestyle modifications such as  restriction and increased physical activity are highly effective first-line treatment strategies used in the management of obesity. However, adherence to these behavioral changes is poor, with an increased reliance on synthetic drugs, which unfortunately are plagued by adverse effects. The identification of new and safer anti-obesity agents is thus of significant interest. In recent years, plants and their phenolic constituents have attracted increased attention due to their health-promoting properties. Amongst these, Cyclopia, an endemic South African plant commonly consumed as a herbal tea (honeybush), has been shown to possess modulating properties against oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and obesity. Likewise, several studies have reported that some of the major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia spp. exhibit anti-obesity effects, particularly by targeting adipose tissue. These phenolic compounds belong to the xanthone, flavonoid and benzophenone classes. The aim of this review is to assess the potential of Cyclopia extracts as an anti-obesity nutraceutical as underpinned by in vitro and in vivo studies and the underlying cellular mechanisms and biological pathways regulated by their phenolic compounds.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, poor outdoor winter cultivation capacity currently limits deployment potential. In this study, 300 distinct algal strains were screened in saline medium to determine their cultivation suitability during winter conditions in Mesa, Arizona. Three strains, from the genera , and , were chosen following laboratory evaluations and grown outdoors in 1000 L raceway ponds during the winter. Strains were down-selected based on doubling time, lipid and carbohydrate amount, final biomass accumulation capacity, cell size and phylogenetic diversity. Algal biomass productivity and compositional analysis for lipids and carbohydrates show successful outdoor deployment and cultivation under winter conditions for these strains. Outdoor -yield biomass productivities ranged from .9 to 4.0 g/m/day over an 18 days winter cultivation trial, with maximum productivities ranging from 4.0 to 6.5 g/m/day, the highest productivities reported to date for algal winter strains grown in saline media in open raceway ponds. Peak fatty acid levels ranged from 9 to 26% percent of biomass, and peak carbohydrate levels ranged from 13 to 34% depending on the strain. Changes in the lipid and carbohydrate profile throughout outdoor growth are reported. This study demonstrates that algal strain screening under simulated outdoor environmental conditions in the laboratory enables identification of strains with robust biomass productivity and biofuel precursor composition. The strains isolated here represent promising winter deployment candidates for seasonal algal biomass production when using crop rotation strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28928974>The influence of water temperature on sockeye salmon heart rate recovery following simulated fisheries interactions.</a></h1><p>Selective  policies have been implemented in North America to enhance the conservation of Pacific salmon ( spp.) stocks, which has led to an increase in the capture and release of fish by all fishing sectors. Despite the immediate survival benefits, catch-and-release results in capture stress, particularly at high water temperatures, and this can result in delayed post-release mortality minutes to days later. The objective of this study was to evaluate how different water temperatures influenced heart rate disturbance and recovery of wild sockeye salmon () following fisheries interactions (i.e. exhaustive exercise). Heart rate loggers were implanted into Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to simulated catch-and-release events conducted at three water temperatures (16°C, 19°C and 21°C). The fisheries simulation involved chasing logger-implanted fish in tanks for 3 min, followed by a 1 min air exposure. Neither resting nor routine heart rate differed among temperature treatments. In response to the fisheries simulation, peak heart rate increased with temperature (16°C = 91.3 ± 1.3 beats min; 19°C = 104.9 ± .0 beats min and 21°C = 117 ± 1.3 beats min). Factorial heart rate and scope for heart rate were highest at 21°C and lowest at 16°C, but did not differ between 19°C and 21°C. Temperature affected the initial rate of cardiac recovery but not the overall duration (~10 h) such that the rate of  expenditure during recovery increased with temperature. These findings support the notion that in the face of climate change, efforts to reduce stress at warmer temperatures will be necessary if catch-and-release practices are to be an effective conservation strategy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31459496>Pure Piezoelectricity Generation by a Flexible Nanogenerator Based on Lead Zirconate Titanate Nanofibers.</a></h1><p>Lead zirconate titanate (PbZrTiO, PZT) alloys have been extensively studied to be used for piezoelectric nanogenerators to   from mechanical motions. In this study, PZT nanofiber-based nanogenerators were fabricated to test their true piezoelectric performance without the triboelectric effect. Aligned PZT nanofibers were fabricated by a sol-gel electrospinning process. The thickness, area, and orientation of the PZT textile made by electrospinning a PZT solution onto multipair metal wires or metal mesh were controlled to form a composite textile. After the calcination, the PZT textile mixed with polydimethylsiloxane was placed between two flexible indium-doped tin oxide-polyethylene naphthalate substrates. The performance parameters of the nanogenerators were investigated under the bending motion, which excludes the triboelectric effect. An assembled nanogenerator of an area of 8 cm and a thickness of 80 μm could generate an electrical output voltage of 1.1 V and a current of 1.4 μA under the bending strain. The piezoelectric voltage depended on the thickness of the PZT textile, whereas the piezoelectric current depended on both the thickness and the area of the PZT textile. The electrical performance of the device was significantly affected by the orientation of the PZT fiber and the bending direction. The output voltage and the output current were strain-dependent, whereas the total integrated charge was independent of the strain rate. The properties of the flexible nanogenerator could be quantified to verify the pure piezoelectric performance of the device.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015331>Phycobilisomes Harbor FNR in Cyanobacteria.</a></h1><p>Cyanobacterial phycobilisomes (PBSs) are photosynthetic antenna complexes that  light  and supply it to two reaction centers (RCs) where photochemistry starts. PBSs can be classified into two types, depending on the presence of allophycocyanin (APC): CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS. Because the accurate protein composition of CpcL-PBS remains unclear, we describe here its isolation and characterization from the cyanobacterium  sp. strain 6803. We found that ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase (or FNR), an enzyme involved in both cyclic electron transport and the terminal step of the electron transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis, is tightly associated with CpcL-PBS as well as with CpcG-PBS. Room temperature and low-temperature fluorescence analyses show a red-shifted emission at 669 nm in CpcL-PBS as a terminal  emitter without APC. SDS-PAGE and quantitative mass spectrometry reveal an increased content of FNR and CpcC2, a rod linker protein, in CpcL-PBS compared to that of CpcG-PBS rods, indicative of an elongated CpcL-PBS rod length and its potential functional differences from CpcG-PBS. Furthermore, we combined isotope-encoded cross-linking mass spectrometry with computational protein structure predictions and structural modeling to produce an FNR-PBS binding model that is supported by two cross-links between K of FNR and the N terminus of CpcB, one component in PBS, in both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS (cross-link 1), and between the N termini of FNR and CpcB (cross-link ). Our data provide a novel functional assembly form of phycobiliproteins and a molecular-level description of the close association of FNR with phycocyanin in both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS. Cyanobacterial light-harvesting complex PBSs are essential for photochemistry in light reactions and for balancing  flow to carbon fixation in the form of ATP and NADPH. We isolated a new type of PBS without an allophycocyanin core (i.e., CpcL-PBS). CpcL-PBS contains both a spectral red-shifted chromophore, enabling efficient  transfer to chlorophyll molecules in the reaction centers, and an increased FNR content with various rod lengths. Identification of a close association of FNR with both CpcG-PBS and CpcL-PBS brings new insight to its regulatory role for fine-tuning light  transfer and carbon fixation through both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport.Copyright © 2019 Liu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29662157>Pyroelectric  conversion with large  and power density in relaxor ferroelectric thin films.</a></h1><p>The need for efficient  utilization is driving research into ways to  ubiquitous waste heat.

However, much of the previous research on the topic has focused on the  efficiency of either food or  provision. Only recently, comprehensive analyses at the total agroecosystem level have been operationalized, studying long-term change in agroecosystem energetics in the course of the socio-ecological transition. We contribute to this line of research by offering an empirical assessment of agroecosystem energetics for the case of Austria, covering the period 1830-2010 at an annual resolution. We present a quantitative assessment of  inputs, outputs and internal  fluxes of Austria's agroecosystem, including crop production, livestock production and forestry, as well as  return on investment indicators. We identify three major periods: (1) "pre-industrial land-use intensification" (1830-1914) is characterized by moderate agricultural growth based on increased biomass recirculation, declining wood , and, probably, slightly declining  returns on investments. () From 1918 to 1985, "industrialization of land use and the green revolution" exhibits a substitution of labor by modern  inputs, while livestock continued to rely greatly on domestic biomass. (3) "Industrialized extensification and environmental awareness" (1986-2010) features increasing  efficiency due to declines in livestock numbers, a shift towards forestry, and a rising amount of final products from croplands at stable  inputs. We discuss these periods in the context of changes in both ecological impacts and social metabolism, and identify trade-offs among food and bioenergy provision.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

However, severe hydrological precipitation significantly impacts agricultural , and such influence becomes more apparent under the influence of climate change. Meanwhile, the major method of electricity generation (i.e., fossil fuel burning) has a negative impact on the environment. These inevitable threats are crucial and have to be dealt with for a society on the road towards sustainability. In the present study, an integrated evaluation of the WEF nexus was conducted for two areas with different levels of urbanization using empirical multiple linear regression in a simultaneous equation model (SEM). By incorporating the collected data into the SEM, the weighting coefficient of each identified variable was obtained, and the nexus implication was assessed in model simulation at different scenarios considering the population growth, agro-technology advancement,  structure improvement, and available water resources. In the simulated results, three observations were found: (1) the rural area is more sustainable than the urban one; () the sustainability for both the investigated areas is significantly subject to their water supply and demand; and (3) food production was found to have a less important effect on the sustainable development of the urban area. This study identified the key factors in the WEF nexus exploration, which are economically and environmentally important for resource allocation.

A specific model combined with ray and wave optics was built to numerically optimize the texture of the LM layers for light harvesting in photovoltaics cells and explore the optical principles in the light trapping. The LM layer texture is made of 2D periodic triangle structures. Both symmetric and asymmetric triangle structures were investigated. The results indicate that asymmetric structures possess the close performance compared with symmetric ones, and notably, on contrary to the symmetric structures, the light trapping abilities are much more insensitive to the bottom thicknesses of asymmetric structures. It will benefit the practical fabrication, since the precise bottom thickness control can be avoided. From the optimization results, 3 optimal structures are found. With the optimal LM layers, a thin active layer (165nm) device is able to produce the short circuit current intensities (Jsc) of around 21mA/cm, which is approximately equivalent to the Jsc of a thick active layer (800nm) device without LM layers. Meanwhile, about 23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement is achieved. On the other hand, active layer thickness also makes influence on the light trapping abilities. As the active layer thickness is increased from 165nm to 800nm, the Jsc only improves by about .4mA/cm, while the PCE enhancement is dropped from ~23% to ~11%. In consideration of the compromise between total device  output and PCE enhancement, as well as material cost reduction, the active layer with around 165nm should be an optimal thickness.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275045>Effects of air temperature before  on the concentration of human adiponectin in transgenic strawberry fruits.</a></h1><p>Transgenic ever-bearing strawberry (× Duch. 'HS 138') was cultivated in a closed plant production system to produce functional proteins that can enhance human immune functions. We investigated the effects of air temperature before  on fruit growth and the concentration of human adiponectin (hAdi) at  in transgenic strawberry. During the different stages of maturity (mature white and immature green stages), hAdi-expressing plants were exposed to four air temperature treatments (15, 20, 25, and 30°C) under 24-h illumination provided by fluorescent lamps. Fruits were harvested at the mature red stage. The number of days to the mature red stage decreased with increasing air temperature, being the least at 30°C. Fruit total soluble protein (TSP) concentration increased with decreasing air temperature, particularly at 15°C, whereas fruit hAdi concentration tended to be higher under the 30°C treatment than under any other of the temperature treatments. There was no significant relationship between fruit fresh weight at  time and hAdi concentration within treatments, nor between the number of days to  and hAdi or TSP concentration. Although there were no significant differences in fruit hAdi content among treatments, hAdi production rate was the highest at 30°C because of the shortest duration to . These results indicate that a higher air temperature promoted fruit maturation and accelerated the production of functional hAdi proteins in the fruit. For hAdi-expressing strawberry plants, exposure to 30°C may reduce  consumption (lighting and air conditioning) for functional protein production under controlled environments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265242>Methylammonium Lead Iodide Incorporated Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Nanofibers for Flexible Piezoelectric-Pyroelectric Nanogenerator.</a></h1><p>This work introduces a piezoelectric-pyroelectric nanogenerator (P-PNG) based on methylammonium lead iodide (CHNHPbI) incorporated electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers that are able to  mechanical and thermal energies. During the application of a periodic compressive contact force at a frequency of 4 Hz, an output voltage of ∼220 mV is generated. The P-PNG has a piezoelectric coefficient () of ∼19.7 pC/N coupled with a high durability (60 000 cycles) and quick response time (∼1 ms). The maximum generated output power density (∼0.8 mW/m) is sufficient to charge up a variety of capacitors, with the potential to replace an external power supply to drive portable devices. In addition, upon exposure to cyclic heating and cooling at a temperature of 38 K, a pyroelectric output current of 18. pA and a voltage of 41.78 mV were achieved. The fast response time of 1.14 s, reset time of 1.25 s, and pyroelectric coefficient of ∼44 pC/m K demonstrate a self-powered temperature sensing capability of the P-PNG. These characteristics make the P-PNG suitable for flexible piezoelectric-pyroelectric  harvesting for self-powered electronic devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982122>Quantifying Ecological Integrity of Terrestrial Systems to Inform Management of Multiple-Use Public Lands in the United States.</a></h1><p>The concept of ecological integrity has been applied widely to management of aquatic systems, but still is considered by many to be too vague and difficult to quantify to be useful for managing terrestrial systems, particularly across broad areas. Extensive public lands in the western United States are managed for diverse uses such as timber , livestock grazing,  development, and wildlife conservation, some of which may degrade ecological integrity. We propose a method for assessing ecological integrity on multiple-use lands that identifies the components of integrity and levels in the ecological hierarchy where the assessment will focus, and considers existing policies and management objectives. Both natural reference and societally desired environmental conditions are relevant comparison points. We applied the method to evaluate the ecological integrity of shrublands in Nevada, yielding an assessment based on six indicators of ecosystem structure, function, and composition, including resource- and stressor-based indicators measured at multiple scales. Results varied spatially and among indicators. Invasive plant cover and surface development were highest in shrublands in northwest and southeast Nevada. Departure from reference conditions of shrubland area, composition, patch size, and connectivity was highest in central and northern Nevada. Results may inform efforts to control invasive species and restore shrublands on federal lands in Nevada. We suggest that ecological integrity assessments for multiple-use lands be grounded in existing policies and monitoring programs, incorporate resource- and stressor-based metrics, rely on publicly available data collected at multiple spatial scales, and quantify both natural reference and societally desired resource conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617722>Dietary effects of commercial probiotics on growth performance, digestibility, and intestinal morphometry of broiler chickens.</a></h1><p>This study compared five commercially available probiotics vis-à-vis antibiotic growth promotant (AGP) supplementation and absence of feed additive based on efficiency, intestinal morphometry, and  digestibility in improving broiler chicken production. A total of 630 straight run (Cobb) day-old broiler chicks were distributed to seven treatments following a completely randomized design, with ten replicates per treatment and nine birds per replicate per cage. Dietary treatments consisted of basal diet in combination with the following: without probiotics and AGP supplementation (treatment 1); 75 ppm each of chlorotetracycline (CTC) and Zn bacitracin (treatment ); probiotic A, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 3); probiotic B, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 4); probiotic C, Enterococcus faecium (treatment 5); and probiotic D, Bacillus subtilis (treatment 6); probiotic E, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium spp., Pediococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. (treatment 7). At day 42,  digestibility was determined by fasting three randomly selected birds from each treatment for 12 h and then subjecting them to their corresponding dietary treatments. Excreta were collected and pooled after 24 h of feeding. Pooled excreta were weighed, oven-dried, and subjected to  analyses after 3-day collection. Apparent total tract metabolizable  was then computed. At day 47, three birds were randomly selected per treatment for intestinal morphometry (villi height and crypt depth) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Dietary supplementation using probiotics showed no significant effect on overall body weight, weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency, dressing percentage, mortality,  recovery, carcass quality parameters (e.g., meat to bone ratio and abdominal fat content), intestinal morphometry, and  digestibility.

Fumagillin, an inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase-, causes weight loss by reducing food intake, but with effects on weight that are superior to pair-feeding. Here, we show that feeding of rats on a high-fat diet supplemented with fumagillin (HF/FG) suppresses the aggressive feeding observed in pair-fed controls (HF/PF) and alters expression of circadian genes relative to the HF/PF group. Multiple indices of reduced  expenditure are observed in HF/FG but not HF/PF rats. HF/FG rats also exhibit changes in gut hormones linked to food intake, increased   by gut microbiota, and caloric spilling in the urine. Studies in gnotobiotic mice reveal that effects of fumagillin on  expenditure but not feeding behavior may be mediated by the gut microbiota. In sum, fumagillin engages weight loss-inducing behavioral and physiologic circuits distinct from those activated by simple caloric restriction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941343>Rational Design of Low-Band Gap Star-Shaped Molecules With ,4,6-Triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine as Core and Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives as Arms for Organic Solar Cells Applications.</a></h1><p>A series of D-A novel star-shaped molecules with ,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (TPTA) as core, diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives as arms, and triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives as end groups have been systematically investigated for organic solar cells (OSCs) applications. The electronic, optical, and charge transport properties were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) approaches. The parameters such as energetic driving force Δ , adiabatic ionization potential , and adiabatic electron affinity  were also calculated at the same level. The calculated results show that the introduction of different groups to the side of DPP backbones in the star-shaped molecules can tune the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs)  of the designed molecules. The designed molecules can provide match well with those of typical acceptors PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester). Additionally, the absorption wavelengths of the designed molecules show bathochromic shifts compared with that of the original molecule, respectively. The introduction of different groups can extend the absorption spectrum toward longer wavelengths, which is beneficial to  more sunlight. The calculated reorganization energies suggest that the designed molecules are expected to be the promising candidates for ambipolar charge transport materials except molecule with benzo[c]isothiazole group can be used as hole and electron transport material.

The current study provides a better understanding of the biochemical response of first- (n = 246) or second-parity (n = 127) sows during late gestation through lactation and assesses relationships with piglet production and dam reproductive performance. Plasma samples were collected from first- or second-parity dams at late gestation (110 d gestation [d110G]), d 1 post-farrowing (d1PF), and weaning (WN) then analyzed for various stress and protein metabolism compounds, including; creatine, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, creatinine, urea nitrogen, albumin, and lactate. Litter performance was measured as number of piglets nursed and piglet ADG. Post-weaning reproductive performance was assessed by measuring weaning-to-estrus interval (WEI) and subsequent ovulation rate collected at time of . Plasma creatine and CPK activity increased (P < 0.05) between d110G and d1PF. Plasma creatinine decreased (P < 0.05) from d110G through WN in first-parity dams, but remained similar between d110G and d1PF before declining (P < 0.05) at WN in second-parity dams. Plasma urea nitrogen increased (P < 0.05) over the course of the study and was negatively (P < 0.05) associated with piglet ADG at d110G and d1PF and with ovulation rate at d110G (P < 0.05). Similarly, plasma albumin increased (P < 0.05) in first-parity dams over the course of the study, whereas it plateaued (P < 0.05) at d1PF and remained similar (P > 0.10) through WN in second-parity dams. First-parity dams had less (P < 0.05) plasma lactate at d110G than at d1PF or WN. However, second-parity dams had increased (P < 0.05) plasma lactate at d110G and d1PF, then decreased (P < 0.05) levels at WN. Plasma lactate at WN was positively (P < 0.05) associated with WEI in first-parity dams, but negatively (P < 0.05) related to WEI at d1PF in second-parity dams. Plasma lactate levels at all time points were positively (P < 0.05) associated with ovulation rate in second-parity dams. The biochemical profile of these dams differed by parity and merits further investigations into these differences to identify methods to improve physiological response to lactation for improved animal welfare, production, and reproductive performance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635224>Suppressing methanogens and enriching electrogens in bioelectrochemical systems.</a></h1><p>Suppression of methanogens is considered as one of the main challenges in achieving the practical application of several types of bioelectrochemical system (BES). Feasibility of mixed culture as an inoculum in BES is mainly restricted by methanogenic population. Methanogens compete with electrogens (in bioanodes) or acetogens (in biocathodes) for substrate which results in diminishing Coulombic efficiency. Selection of particular inoculum pretreatment method affects the microbial diversity in anodic/cathodic microenvironments and hence the performance of BES. This review discusses various physical, chemical and biological pretreatment methods for suppressing the growth of methanogens. Selective microbial enrichment in anodic/cathodic biofilm can be promoted with bioaugmentation and/or applied external potential approach to  maximum Coulombs from the substrate. For field application of BES, physical pretreatment methods can be proposed with intermittent addition of chemical inhibitors and conversion of methane to electricity in order to make the process inexpensive along with recovering the maximum .Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of different forage species on blood glucose and insulin concentrations of horses throughout the grazing season. Research was conducted in July (summer) and September (fall) in St. Paul, MN. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), mixed perennial cool-season grasses (CSG), and teff (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) pastures were grazed by six horses (24 ±  years) that were randomly assigned to one of three forage types in a replicated Latin-square design. Jugular catheters were inserted 1 hour before the start of grazing and horses had access to pasture each day from 08:00 to 16:00 hours. Jugular venous blood samples were collected from each horse before being turned out (0 hours) and then at -hour intervals following turnout. Plasma and serum samples were collected and analyzed for glucose and insulin, respectively. Corresponding forage samples were taken by hand . Seasons were analyzed separately and data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with P ≤ .05. Teff generally had lower (P ≤ .05) equine digestible , crude protein, and NSC compared to the other forages. Differences in peak insulin were observed between horses grazing CSG and teff during the fall grazing (P ≤ .05). These results suggest grazing teff could lower the glucose and insulin response of some horses.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate alfalfa tissue variations in response to salt stress, comparative physiological and proteomic analyses were made of salt responses in the roots and shoots of the alfalfa.A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (-DE)-based proteomic technique was employed to identify the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) from salt-treated alfalfa roots and shoots of the salt tolerance cultivars Zhongmu No 1 cultivar, which was subjected to a range of salt stress concentrations for 9 days. In parallel, REL, MAD and HO contents, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes of shoots and roots were determinand.Twenty-seven spots in the shoots and 36 spots in the roots that exhibited showed significant abundance variations were identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. These DAPs are mainly involved in the biological processes of photosynthesis, stress and defense, carbohydrate and  metabolism, second metabolism, protein metabolism, transcriptional regulation, cell wall and cytoskeleton metabolism, ion transpor, signal transduction. In parallel, physiological data were correlated well with our proteomic results. It is worth emphasizing that some novel salt-responsive proteins were identified, such as CP12, pathogenesis-related protein , -induced protein, isoliquiritigenin '-O-methyltransferase. qRT-PCR was used to study the gene expression levels of the four above-mentioned proteins; four patterns are consistent with those of induced protein.The primary mechanisms underlying the ability of alfalfa seedlings to tolerate salt stress were photosynthesis, detoxifying and antioxidant, secondary metabolism, and ion transport.

Here, we report a next-generation TENG, which realizes constant current (crest factor, ~1) output by coupling the triboelectrification effect and electrostatic breakdown. Meanwhile, a triboelectric charge density of 430 mC m is attained, which is much higher than that of a conventional TENG limited by electrostatic breakdown.

Therefore, in 2014, alternative ready-to-use foods were developed. This trial aimed to assess the acceptability of the novel ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) as a snack or mixed with borbor (white rice porridge), compared with corn-soy blend plus plus (CSB++) and borbor fortified with micronutrient powder (MNP). The nonblinded, randomised 4 × 4 crossover trial recruited 95 children aged 9-23 months from communities in peri-urban Phnom Penh. Small quantities (100 g for porridges, 42 g for snack) of each food were offered for three consecutive days at testing sites (homes of health volunteers). Main outcomes were children's consumption, caregivers' assessment of children's preferences, and caregivers' ranking of the foods. Median percentage consumed of the test food servings ranged from 21 to 50% (p = 0.003). The odds of children consuming over 50% were greatest for borbor fortified with MNP versus RUSF snack (unadjusted OR = 6.79, CI = .80-16.47, p < 0.001). However, the median  children received when consuming the RUSF with borbor (57 kcals) or as a snack (48 kcals) was greater than with CSB++ (15 kcals) or borbor fortified with MNP (18 kcals; p < 0.001). Therefore, although children ate less RUSF, it provided approximately three times more kilocalories. Caregivers reported that their children had the highest preference for borbor fortified with MNP. Caregivers themselves ranked the novel RUSF snack highest. Thus, the innovative RUSF was considered sufficiently acceptable to proceed to an effectiveness trial.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31390522>Bipyridyl-Containing Cadmium-Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Oxidation of Benzylamine.</a></h1><p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted increased research attention in photocatalysis due to their great potential in light  and conversion.

However, a significant portion of fertilizers are lost, increasing agricultural cost, wasting  and polluting the environment, which are challenges for the sustainability of modern agriculture. To meet the demands of improving yields without compromising the environment, environmentally friendly fertilizers (EFFs) have been developed. EFFs are fertilizers that can reduce environmental pollution from nutrient loss by retarding, or even controlling, the release of nutrients into soil. Most of EFFs are employed in the form of coated fertilizers. The application of degradable natural materials as a coating when amending soils is the focus of EFF research. Here, we review recent studies on materials used in EFFs and their effects on the environment. The major findings covered in this review are as follows: 1) EFF coatings can prevent urea exposure in water and soil by serving as a physical barrier, thereby reducing the urea hydrolysis rate and decreasing nitrogen oxide (NO) and dinitrogen (N) emissions, ) EFFs can increase the soil organic matter content, 3) hydrogel/superabsorbent coated EFFs can buffer soil acidity or alkalinity and lead to an optimal pH for plants, and 4) hydrogel/superabsorbent coated EFFs can improve water-retention and water-holding capacity of soil. In conclusion, EFFs play an important role in enhancing nutrients efficiency and reducing environmental pollution.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We jointly optimize the resource including power and subcarrier allocation, to maximize the system transmission rate. The time-sharing strategy and Lagrange dual method are used to solve this optimization problem. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm has a larger transmission rate than other benchmark algorithms when ensuring each relay has no additional  supply. Specifically, the proposed algorithm improves the information transmission rate by .8%, 3.4% and 43% compared with other algorithms in the case of five relays when the source's power is equal to 0.5 W, respectively.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28833909>Negative emissions from stopping deforestation and forest degradation, globally.</a></h1><p>Forest growth provides negative emissions of carbon that could help keep the earth's surface temperature from exceeding °C, but the global potential is uncertain. Here we use land-use information from the FAO and a bookkeeping model to calculate the potential negative emissions that would result from allowing secondary forests to recover. We find the current gross carbon sink in forests recovering from harvests and abandoned agriculture to be -4.4 PgC/year, globally. The sink represents the potential for negative emissions if positive emissions from deforestation and wood  were eliminated. However, the sink is largely offset by emissions from wood products built up over the last century. Accounting for these committed emissions, we estimate that stopping deforestation and allowing secondary forests to grow would yield cumulative negative emissions between 2016 and 2100 of about 120 PgC, globally. Extending the lifetimes of wood products could potentially remove another 10 PgC from the atmosphere, for a total of approximately 130 PgC, or about 13 years of fossil fuel use at today's rate. As an upper limit, the estimate is conservative. It is based largely on past and current practices. But if greater negative emissions are to be realized, they will require an expansion of forest area, greater efficiencies in converting harvested wood to long-lasting products and sources of , and novel approaches for sequestering carbon in soils. That is, they will require current management practices to change.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31180212>Enhanced Near-Infrared-to-Visible Upconversion by Synthetic Control of PbS Nanocrystal Triplet Photosensitizers.</a></h1><p>Photon upconversion employing semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) makes use of their large and tunable absorption to  light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths as well as their small gap between singlet and triplet excited states to reduce  losses. Here, we report the highest QY (11.8%) thus far for the conversion of NIR to yellow photons by improving the quality of the PbS NC. This high QY was achieved by using highly purified lead and thiourea precursors. This QY is .6 times higher than from NCs prepared with commercially available lead and sulfide precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals two reasons for the enhanced QY: longer intrinsic exciton lifetimes of PbS NCs and the ability to support a longer triplet lifetime for the surface-bound transmitter molecule. Overall, this results in a higher efficiency of triplet exciton transfer from the PbS NC light absorber to the emitter and thus a higher photon upconversion QY.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30124048>Similarities and Differences between Thymine(6-4)Thymine/Cytosine DNA Lesion Repairs by Photolyases.</a></h1><p>Photolyases are ancient enzymes that  sunlight to repair DNA pyrimidine lesions such as pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone and cyclobutane dimers. Particularly, (6-4) photolyase ((6-4)PHR) plays an important role in maintaining genetic integrity by repairing thymine(6-4)thymine (T(6-4)T) and thymine(6-4)cytosine (T(6-4)C) photolesions. The majority of (6-4)PHR studies have been performed on the basis of the former's activity and assuming the equivalence of the two repair mechanisms, although the latter's activity remains poorly studied. Here, we describe investigations of the repair process of the T(6-4)C dimer using several computational methods from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to large quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approaches. Two possible mechanisms, the historically proposed azetidine four-member ring intermediate and the free NH formation pathways, were considered. The MD results predicted that important active site histidine residues employed for the repair of the T(6-4)C dimer have protonation states similar to those seen in the (6-4)PHR/T(6-4)T complex. More importantly, despite chemical differences between the two substrates, a similar repair mechanism was identified: His365 protonates NH, resulting in formation/activation mechanism of a free NH, inducing NH transfer to the 5' base, and ultimately leading to pyrimidine restoration. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable with a rate-limiting barrier of 20.4 kcal mol. In contrast, the azetidine intermediate is unfeasible, possessing an  barrier of 60 kcal mol; this barrier is similar to that predicted for the oxetane intermediate in T(6-4)T repair. Although both substrates are repaired with comparable quantum yields, the reactive complex in T(6-4)C was shown to be a 3' base radical with a lower driving force for back electron transfer combined with higher  barrier for catalysis. These results showed the similarity in the general repair mechanisms between the two substrates while emphasizing differences in the electron dynamics in the repair cycle.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28930347>A paper triboelectric nanogenerator for self-powered electronic systems.</a></h1><p>Paper, as one of the most important inventions of mankind, is still widely used in our daily life.

This generated electricity could directly light up 80 commercial white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) connected in series without any  storage process. The white LEDs powered by the P-TENG can provide sufficient illumination for reading printed text in darkness.

Despite ubiquity of triboelectric effects, a lot of mechanisms surrounding the relevant phenomena remain to be understood. Continued progress will rely on the development of rapid and reliable methods to probe accumulation and dynamics of static charges. Here, we demonstrate in-situ quantification of tribological charging with nanoscale resolution, that is applicable to a wide range of dielectric systems. We apply this method to differentiate between strongly and weakly charging compositions of industrial grade polymers. The method highlights the complex phenomena of electrostatic discharge upon contact formation to pre-charged surfaces, and directly reveals the mobility of surface charges. Systematic characterization of commercial polyethylene terephthalate samples revealed the compositions with the best antistatic properties and provided an estimate of characteristic charge density up to 5×10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; C/m&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

ZrO powders with tunable amounts of tetragonal, monoclinic and cubic polymorphs have been synthesized by introducing Ce and Er (from 0.5 to 10 mol % on an oxide basis) through hydrothermal method. The aim of this work is to investigate the role of rare earth (RE) ions rich of electrons (Er) and with entirely empty levels (Ce) in the ZrO matrix for the sun-driven photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. The samples have been characterized by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), N adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometry (XPS) and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) with  dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). With respect to the bare ZrO mainly containing monoclinic (m-) phase, an increasing amount of rare-earth (RE) dopant was found to improve the specific BET surface area and to stabilize the tetragonal (t-) or cubic (c-) polymorphs of ZrO at room temperature. XRD data confirmed that dopants were mainly inserted in the t-ZrO phase. The photocatalytic O evolution from water under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight illumination of the prepared samples have been correlated with their optical, structural and chemical properties. The effect of the dopant concentration on the chemical-physical and photocatalytic properties of the Er- and Ce-doped ZrO materials was elucidated. The samples with 5% of RE oxide were the most active, i.e., three times more than pure zirconia. Their superior photocatalytic activity was found to be mainly correlated to two factors: (i) an optimal surface concentration of RE ions of about 3.7%, which increased charge carriers separation in the photocatalysts surface due more superficial defects of the t-ZrO and a higher surface area, thus enhancing the reaction kinetics, (ii) a controlled amount of monoclinic vs. tetragonal (or cubic) polymorphs of zirconia with an optimum ratio of about 70/30 of t-ZrO/m-ZrO. Instead, the increased ability of the RE-doped ZrO to  visible light was found to have a secondary role on the photocatalytic activity of the Ce-doped ZrO material.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30043011>A spring-assisted hybrid triboelectric-electromagnetic nanogenerator for harvesting low-frequency vibration  and creating a self-powered security system.</a></h1><p>With the rapid development of portable electronics, exploring sustainable power sources is becoming more and more urgent. Utilizing a nanogenerator to  ambient mechanical  could be an effective approach to solve this challenge. In this work, a novel spring-assisted hybrid nanogenerator (HG) consisting of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an electromagnetic generator (EMG) was developed for harvesting low-frequency vibration . The results show that the TENG with a PTFE surface nanostructure has better output performance than that without the nanostructure. The effect of operating frequency on the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the TENG and EMG is systematically investigated. Under a  Hz operating frequency, the EMG and TENG are able to produce a peak power of about 57.6 mW with a resistive load of 2000 Ω and 1682 μW with a resistive load of 50 MΩ, respectively. The impedance matching between the TENG and EMG can be realized by using a transformer to reduce the impedance of the TENG. The charging performance of the HG is much better than that of the individual EMG or TENG. The HG enabled us to develop a self-powered safety system and to power LEDs, and drive some electronic devices. The present work provides a superior solution to improve the output performance of the HG for harvesting low-frequency vibration .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427012>Self-supported bimetallic Ni-Co compound electrodes for urea- and neutralization -assisted electrolytic hydrogen production.</a></h1><p>Hydrogen represents one of the most promising renewable  sources for next generation  systems, however, its large scale production is high cost and high .

Despite intensive efforts to develop high-efficiency solar steam generation devices, challenges remain in terms of the relatively low solar thermal efficiency, complicated fabrications, high cost, and difficulty in scaling up. Herein, a double-network hydrogel with a porous structure (p-PEGDA-PANi) is demonstrated for the first time as a flexible, recyclable, and efficient photothermal platform for low-cost and scalable solar steam generation. As a novel photothermal platform, the p-PEGDA-PANi involves all necessary properties of efficient broadband solar absorption, exceptional hydrophilicity, low heat conductivity, and porous structure for high-efficiency solar steam generation. As a result, the hydrogel-based solar steam generator exhibits a maximum solar thermal efficiency of 91.5% with an evaporation rate of 1.40 kg m h under 1 sun illumination, which is comparable to state-of-the-art solar steam generation devices. Furthermore, the good durability and environmental stability of the p-PEGDA-PANi hydrogel enables a convenient recycling and reusing process toward real-life applications.

This study investigated the effect of cassava varieties and their  times on starch liquefaction, saccharification, and fermentation. The genotype correlation of the starch properties was revealed for the most suitable cassava varieties. First, the starch content, amylose content, total reducing sugar from liquefaction and saccharification, pasting properties, and ethanol yields of six cassava varieties (Huay Bong 60, Hanatee, Kasetsart 50, Pirun 1, Pirun , and Rayong 11) at 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-month  times were evaluated. The amylose content increased significantly from the 6th to the 12th month but slightly decreased at the 15th month. It was observed that the starch content contributed to a more substantial influence on the change in peak viscosity than on the amylose content. Ethanol fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR5606 showed that the Rayong 11 variety at the 15-month  time provided the highest ethanol concentration of 104.7 ± 4.1 g L and an ethanol yield of 0.4 ± 0.1 g ethanol g reducing sugar, which corresponded to 74.5% of the theoretical yield.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30710216>A Tunable Resonance Cantilever for Cardiac  Harvesting.</a></h1><p> harvesting from cardiac motion is an attractive means to avoid the use of batteries in implantable sensors and pacemakers.

Here we describe how coordinated bioreactor, metabolic pathway, and protein engineering now suggest feasibility for the sustainable, solar-powered production of a storable fuel to complement our expanding photovoltaic and wind based capacities. The need to contain and  the gaseous products provides decisive solar bioreactor design advantages by limiting O exposure to prolific, but O-sensitive H producing enzymes-[FeFe] hydrogenases. CO supply and cell growth can also be limited so that most of the photosynthetic reduction capacity is directed toward H production. Yet, natural [FeFe] hydrogenases are still too O sensitive for technology implementation. We report the discovery of new variants and a new O tolerance mechanism that significantly reduce the sensitivity to O exposure without lowering H production rates or losing electrons to O reduction. Testing the improved hydrogenases with a biologically derived, light-dependent electron source provides evidence that this game changing technology has the potential for sustainable large-scale fuel production.Copyright © 2018.

The gold nanocrystal-decorated MoS2 nanosheets facilitate sufficiently enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting in the UV-visible region. Different Au nanostructures, such as Au nanoparticles and nanorods, were modified on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets to promote photoelectrochemical water decomposition. By spin-coating a synthetic gold-modified MoS2 hybrid photoanode on a FTO substrate, the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water oxidation was significantly enhanced, by  times (nanorods) and 3.5 times (nanoparticles) in the visible-infrared region; furthermore, the average optical resistance was reduced by a factor of two compared to the MoS2 photoanode without Au, and the photocurrent increases exponentially when the system bias was greater than 0.7 volts. The Au-MoS2 metal-semiconductor interface plays an important role in studying the surface plasmon interactions, charge transfer mechanism, and electric field amplification. This rational design for such a unique hybrid nanostructure explains the plasmon-enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Therefore, gut microbiota has become a potential target that can be manipulated to obtain optimal health. Probiotics have been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota, improve gut integrity, and restore the microbial shifts characteristic of obesity.

Thus, the purpose of this review is to present evidence from animal studies and human clinical trials demonstrating the effects of various probiotic strains and their potential efficacy in improving obesity and associated metabolic dysfunctions. Furthermore, the review discusses current gaps in our understanding of how probiotics modulate gut microflora to protect against obesity.

Biorefining of grass-clover occurred right after  in a production-scale twin-screw press. The twin-screw pressing separated the grass-clover into a pulp and a green juice. The green juice was fermented using lactic acid bacteria for protein precipitation and then decanted, and the precipitate was heat dried to constitute the green protein concentrate. From the same field, grass-clover was harvested 6 d later due to rainy weather and was prewilted before ensiling. The pulp and the grass-clover were ensiled in bales without additives. The production trial consisted of an incomplete 6 × 4 Latin square trial (3-wk periods; 12 wk total) including 36 lactating Holstein cows. The trial had 6 treatments in a  × 3 factorial design with  forage types (grass-clover silage and pulp silage) and 3 protein treatments (low protein, high protein with soybean meal, and high protein with a mixture of soybean meal and green protein). The trial was designed to test silage type, protein type, protein level, and the interaction between protein level and silage type. The forage:concentrate ratio was 55:45 in low protein total mixed rations (TMR) and 51:49 in high protein TMR. Low protein and high protein TMR were composed of 372 and 342 g/kg of DM of experimental silages, respectively, and green protein supplemented TMR was composed of 28.5 g/kg of DM of green protein. Silage type did not affect dry matter intake of cows. The average -corrected milk yield was 37.0 and 33.4 kg/d for cows fed pulp silage and grass-clover silage, respectively, resulting in an improved feed efficiency in the cows receiving pulp silage. Milk fat concentration was greater in milk from cows fed pulp silage, and milk protein concentration was lower compared with milk from cows fed grass-clover silage. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber was greater for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. Eating rate was greater, whereas daily eating duration was lower, for pulp silage diets compared with grass-clover silage diets. The partial substitution of soybean meal with green protein did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, or eating behavior. The in vivo digestibility of crude protein in green protein supplemented diets was lower compared with soybean meal diets. The results imply that extraction of protein from grassland plants can increase the value of the fiber part of grassland plants.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

For many years, maintenance  requirements have been assumed to be 20% greater in lactating compared with non-lactating beef cows. While not well established, maintenance  requirements are thought to be greatest in primiparous cows and to decline with age. Consequently, early weaning primiparous cow-calf pairs should improve overall efficiency, particularly in situations where mid-to-late lactation forage or feed nutritive value is low. The objective of this study was to determine the biological efficiency of early weaning and maintenance  requirements of lactating versus non-lactating primiparous cows. Experiments were conducted in two consecutive years using 90 primiparous cows and their calves (48 in yr 1, 42 in yr ). Pairs were randomly assigned to one of the six pens (8 pairs/pen yr 1, 7 pairs/pen yr ) and pens were randomly assigned to 1 of  treatments; (1) early weaning (130 d ± 15.4; EW, n = 6) and () traditional weaning (226 d ± 13.1; TW, n = 6). Late lactation cow and calf performance and feed consumption were measured for 92 d (yr 1) and 100 d (yr ). Cows were limit-fed to meet maintenance requirements, while calves were offered ad libitum access to the same diet in a creep-feeding area. Calves were not allowed access to the cows' feed. Cow feed intake, body condition score, body weight (BW), milk yield and composition, and calf body weight gain and creep feed intake were recorded. After accounting for lactation and retained , there was a trend for greater maintenance  requirements of lactating primiparous cows (P = 0.07). From the early weaning date to traditional weaning date, calf average daily gain (ADG) was greater (P < 0.01) for TW calves. Feed and  efficiency of the pair was improved for the TW system (P < 0.01). Greater ADG were reported for EW calves during the stocker period (P = 0.03), but there were no differences during the finishing period (P > 0.40). At , BW was greater (P = 0.02) and gain to feed ratio tended (P = 0.06) to be improved for TW calves. The increased TW calf performance offset the additional maintenance costs of their lactating dams, resulting in the TW system converting total feed  to kilograms of calf BW gain more efficiently.© The Author(s) 2019.

The success of waste management decisions directly lies in the accuracy and reliability of the data on which choices are based; many factors influence these data. Here, we examined the factors influencing domestic waste in rural areas of developing countries (RADIC), using both field surveys and by reviewing previous literature. The social factors included population, education and culture. There was a positive linear relationship between waste generation amount and population size (R = 0.9405). Environmental education, training and demonstration projects played a positive role in improving people's awareness of the benefits of recycling and reducing waste. Traditional and national cultures, consumption and living habits contributed to variations in the generation and composition of domestic waste. Generally, practices related to conservation of and reverence for nature and green consumption encourage people to reduce, reuse and recycle waste in their daily life. Economic factors included household income and expenditure,  and fuel structure, and types of industry that occurred in villages. A Kuznets inverted "U" curve relationship existed between domestic waste generation and people's income in rural areas of China. However, the waste generation rate had a linear relationship with the gross national income per capita in RADIC. The composition, bulk density and calorific value of domestic waste were variously affected by the  and fuel structure and the types of industry that occurred. The natural factors included geography and climate (including rainfall, humidity, temperature and  seasons). The moisture content of waste was directly influenced by rainfall and humidity. Temperature affected waste characteristics by influencing residential heating modes. The waste characteristics were also influenced by the mixing of agricultural and aquacultural waste into domestic waste in the harvesting season. In different geographies, significant differences of domestic waste characteristics were observed as a result of comprehensive effects caused by multiple factors. Other factors included the administrative levels of communities and survey methods. The characteristics of domestic waste in towns or central villages were similar with those in cities, but were different from those in common villages (the smallest type of community). The domestic waste sampled in households indicated a lower rate of generation and lower ash content than when the waste was sampled at transfer stations or dumping sites. Based on the above analysis, the factors influencing domestic waste must be considered in order to optimize the design of waste management strategies in the RADIC. Furthermore, it is valuable and important to obtain more accurate data about waste characteristics.Copyright © 2017.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of  as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino acids. Nineteen different amino acids were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino acids was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was -25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the volatile fatty acids (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554598>A comparative study between fungal pellet- and spore-assisted microalgae harvesting methods for algae bioflocculation.</a></h1><p>Fungi assisted microalgae bioflocculation is an emerging, efficient and cost-effective microalgal harvesting method, but no study has systematically evaluated and compared fungal spore-assisted (FSA) and fungal pellet-assisted (FPA) microalgal harvesting methods.

The transfer of GM corn byproducts from agricultural fields to nearby streams after  is significant and occurs well into the post- year. These corn leaves, stems, and cobs then become a detrital food source for organisms, such as shredders in the stream ecosystem. Considering that the nontarget effects of Bt corn have been observed in some terrestrial organisms, we assessed whether Bt toxins affect an important aquatic organism, juvenile F. rusticus crayfish. Juvenile crayfish were fed six distinct diet treatments: two varieties of Bt corn, two non-Bt controls of herbicide tolerant corn, and two controls: fish gelatin and river detritus. Juveniles were fed these diets while housed in flow-through artificial streams that received natural stream water from a local source. Specific growth rate and survivorship of the crayfish were measured throughout the study. Juveniles fed corn diets grew significantly less and had reduced survival compared with juveniles fed fish gelatin or river detritus diets. Furthermore, juveniles fed one Bt variety of corn (VT Triple Pro) exhibited significantly less growth than those fed one of the herbicide tolerant varieties (Roundup Ready ). Our study shows that corn inputs to streams may be detrimental to the growth and survivorship of juvenile crayfish and that certain Bt varieties may exacerbate these negative effects.

In study , 75 similar mice were fed the LF diet (LF) or the HF diet alone (HF) or in combination with up to 0.% MGO in water (HFM) and 0.067% (HFM-GL) or 0.% (HFM-GH) dietary genistein for 18 wk. Anthropometric and metabolic data were obtained in both studies to determine the effects of MGO and genistein on variables indicative of MetS.Body weight gain, fat deposits, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver were ameliorated by dietary genistein in both studies. The plasma MGO concentration in VHF-G mice was 52% lower than that in VHF mice. Moreover, the AGE concentrations in plasma, liver, and kidney of VHF-G mice were 73%, 52%, and 49%, respectively, lower than in the VHF group (study 1). Similarly, the concentrations of plasma MGO and AGE in plasma, liver, and kidney of HFM-GH mice were 33.5%, 49%, 69%, and 54% lower than in HFM mice (study ). Genistein inhibited AGE formation by trapping MGO to form adducts and upregulating the expressions of glyoxalase I and II and aldose reductase in liver and kidney to detoxify MGO in both studies.Our data demonstrate for the first time that genistein significantly lowers MGO and AGE concentrations in  mouse MetS models via multiple pathways.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768949>In vitro and in vivo assessment of the effect of initial moisture content and drying temperature on the feeding value of maize grain.</a></h1><p>1.

In contrast to the results from the in vitro digestibility, apparent ileal digestibility of starch and  decreased when the drying temperature was raised from 54 to 130°C, and this effect was more pronounced in maize grain harvested at high initial moisture content (36%). Ileal protein digestibility of maize grain decreased significantly when dried at the intermediate temperature (90°C) and with a high  moisture content (36%). Drying temperature and initial moisture content did not significantly affect AMEn. 3.

For instance, a UAV can be used to embed a flying base station providing an on-demand nomadic access to network services. A UAV can also be used to wirelessly recharge out-of-battery ground devices. In this paper, we aim to deal with both data collection and recharging depleted ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices through a UAV station used as a flying base station. To extend the network lifetime, we present a novel use of UAV with  harvesting module and wireless recharging capabilities. However, the UAV is used as an  source to empower depleted IoT devices. On one hand, the UAV charges depleted ground IoT devices under three policies: (1) low-battery first scheme; () high-battery first scheme; and (3) random scheme. On the other hand, the UAV station collects data from IoT devices that have sufficient  to transmit their packets, and in the same phase, the UAV exploits the Radio Frequency (RF) signals transmitted by IoT devices to extract and  . Furthermore, and as the UAV station has a limited coverage time due to its  constraints, we propose and investigate an efficient trade-off between ground users recharging time and data gathering time. Furthermore, we suggest to control and optimize the UAV trajectory in order to complete its travel within a minimum time, while minimizing the  spent and/or enhancing the network lifetime. Extensive numerical results and simulations show how the system behaves under different scenarios and using various metrics in which we examine the added value of UAV with  harvesting module.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30809012>Taming chlorophylls by early eukaryotes underpinned algal interactions and the diversification of the eukaryotes on the oxygenated Earth.</a></h1><p>Extant eukaryote ecology is primarily sustained by oxygenic photosynthesis, in which chlorophylls play essential roles. The exceptional photosensitivity of chlorophylls allows them to  solar  for photosynthesis, but on the other hand, they also generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. A risk of such phototoxicity of the chlorophyll must become particularly prominent upon dynamic cellular interactions that potentially disrupt the mechanisms that are designed to quench photoexcited chlorophylls in the phototrophic cells. Extensive examination of a wide variety of phagotrophic, parasitic, and phototrophic microeukaryotes demonstrates that a catabolic process that converts chlorophylls into nonphotosensitive 13,17-cyclopheophorbide enols (CPEs) is phylogenetically ubiquitous among extant eukaryotes. The accumulation of CPEs is identified in phagotrophic algivores belonging to virtually all major eukaryotic assemblages with the exception of Archaeplastida, in which no algivorous species have been reported. In addition, accumulation of CPEs is revealed to be common among phototrophic microeukaryotes (i.e., microalgae) along with dismantling of their secondary chloroplasts. Thus, we infer that CPE-accumulating chlorophyll catabolism (CACC) primarily evolved among algivorous microeukaryotes to detoxify chlorophylls in an early stage of their evolution. Subsequently, it also underpinned photosynthetic endosymbiosis by securing close interactions with photosynthetic machinery containing abundant chlorophylls, which led to the acquisition of secondary chloroplasts. Our results strongly suggest that CACC, which allowed the consumption of oxygenic primary producers, ultimately permitted the successful radiation of the eukaryotes throughout and after the late Proterozoic global oxygenation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455813>The complex structure of bile salt hydrolase from Lactobacillus salivarius reveals the structural basis of substrate specificity.</a></h1><p>The gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) plays a critical role in host lipid metabolism and  . Therefore, BSH is a promising microbiome target to develop new therapies to regulate obesity in humans and novel non-antibiotic growth promoters for food animals. We previously reported the 1.90 Å apo crystal structure of BSH from Lactobacillus salivarius (lsBSH). In this study, we soaked the lsBSH crystal with glycocholic acid (GCA), a substrate, and obtained a .10 Å structure containing complex of lsBSH bound to GCA and cholic acid (CA), a product. The substrate/product sits in the water-exposed cavity molded by Loops  and 3. While the glycine moiety of GCA is exposed into a highly polar pocket, the sterane core of GCA is stabilized by aromatic and hydrophobic interactions. Comparison of product binding with BSH from Clostridium perfringenes reveals a distinct orientation of the sterane core in the binding site. The stability of the substrate-lsBSH complex and the putative catalytic mechanism were explored with molecular dynamics simulations. Site-directed mutagenesis of lsBSH demonstrated that Cys2 and Asn171 are critical for enzymatic activity, while Tyr24, Phe65 and Gln257 contribute to the substrate specificity. Together, this study provides structural insights into BSH-substrate interaction, the mechanism of catalysis and substrate specificity, which facilitate rational design of BSH inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101422>Photosynthetic Bioelectronic Sensors for Touch Perception, UV-Detection, and Nanopower Generation: Toward Self-Powered E-Skins.</a></h1><p> self-sufficiency is an inspirational design feature of biological systems that fulfills sensory functions. Plants such as the "touch-me-not" and "Venus flytrap" not only sustain life by photosynthesis, but also execute specialized sensory responses to touch. Photosynthesis enables these organisms to sustainably  and expend , powering their sensory abilities. Photosynthesis therefore provides a promising model for self-powered sensory devices like electronic skins (e-skins). While the natural sensory abilities of human skin have been emulated in man-made materials for advanced prosthetics and soft-robotics, no previous e-skin has incorporated phototransduction and photosensory functions that could extend the sensory abilities of human skin. A proof-of-concept bioelectronic device integrated with natural photosynthetic pigment-proteins is presented that shows the ability to sense not only touch stimuli (down to 3000 Pa), but also low-intensity ultraviolet radiation (down to 0.01 mW cm ) and generate an electrical power of ≈260 nW cm . The scalability of this device is demonstrated through the fabrication of flexible, multipixel, bioelectronic sensors capable of touch registration and tracking. The polysensory abilities,  self-sufficiency, and additional nanopower generation exhibited by this bioelectronic system make it particularly promising for applications like smart e-skins and wearable sensors, where the photogenerated power can enable remote data transmission.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Because the synthesis of these polymer precursors generates toxic intermediates by utilizing petroleum-derived chemicals and corrosive catalysts, the development of alternative strategies for the bio-based production of MA has garnered significant interest. Plants produce organic carbon skeletons by harvesting carbon dioxide and  from the sun, and therefore represent advantageous hosts for engineered metabolic pathways towards the manufacturing of chemicals. In this work, we engineered Arabidopsis to demonstrate that plants can serve as green factories for the bio-manufacturing of MA. In particular, dual expression of plastid-targeted bacterial salicylate hydroxylase (NahG) and catechol 1,-dioxygenase (CatA) resulted in the conversion of the endogenous salicylic acid (SA) pool into MA via catechol. Sequential increase of SA derived from the shikimate pathway was achieved by expressing plastid-targeted versions of bacterial salicylate synthase (Irp9) and feedback-resistant 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate synthase (AroG). Introducing this SA over-producing strategy into engineered plants that co-express NahG and CatA resulted in a 50-fold increase in MA titers. Considering that MA was easily recovered from senesced plant biomass after , we envision the phytoproduction of MA as a beneficial option to add value to bioenergy crops.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has developed into a dedicated bioenergy crop. To improve the biomass production of switchgrass grown on different types of soil, abiotic stress tolerance traits are considered for its genetic improvement. Proline accumulation is a widespread response when plants are subjected to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold and salinity. In plants, P5CS gene encodes the key regulatory enzyme that plays a crucial role in proline biosynthesis. Here, we introduced the PuP5CS gene (from Puccinellia chinampoensis) into switchgrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic lines overexpressing the PuP5CS gene showed phenotypic advantages, in leaf width, internode diameter, internode length, tiller numbers and precocious flowering under normal conditions, and the transgenic lines displayed better regenerative capacity in forming more tillers after . Moreover, the PuP5CS gene enhanced the salt tolerance of transgenic switchgrass by altering a wide range of physiological responses. In accordance with the physiological results, histological analysis of cross sections through the leaf blade showed that the areas of bulliform cells and bundle sheath cells were significantly increased in PuP5CS-overexpressing leaves. The expression levels of ROS scavenging-associated genes in transgenic plants were higher than in control plants under salt stress. The results show that genetic improvement through overexpressing PuP5CS in switchgrass is feasible for enhancing plant stress tolerance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037768>Potential of macroalgae for biodiesel production: Screening and evaluation studies.</a></h1><p>Nowadays, biofuel production is a fast expanding industry and is facing a growing dilemma about a feedstock source capable of keeping up with demand. Recently, macroalgae have been attracting a wide attention as a source for biofuel. In the present study, ten macroalgae were collected and screened as biodiesel feedstocks. As a result of their high biomass production and relatively high lipid content, Ulva lactuca, Padina boryana and Ulva intestinalis showed the highest significant lipids and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) areal productivities among the studied species. Saturated fatty acids (SAFs) showed insignificant differences in the selected species, with noticeably significant higher polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content in U. lactuca by 4. and 3 times, with respect to P. boryana and U. intestinalis, respectively. The recorded increase in PUFAs was attributed to higher content of C16:4n-3, C18:3n-3 and C18:4n-3. By lipid fractionation, P. boryana showed significant higher concentration of neutral lipids (37.7 mg g CDW, representing 46.7% of total fatty acids) in comparison to U. lactuca and U. intestinalis, which showed 16% and 17% lower neutral lipid fractions, respectively. In addition, biodiesel characteristics of the studied macroalgae complied with that of international standards. Furthermore, oil-free residual biomass can be readily converted into fermentable sugars or biogas due to its high carbohydrates content, which adds to the economics of macroalgae as biofuel feedstock. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that macroalgae represent an attractive alternative renewable feedstock for biodiesel and other biofuels.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

Single-sired, beef steers (n = 56; start of trial BW 590 ± 36 kg) blocked (n = ) by weight and terminal implant were sorted into pairs (n = 14 per block) by weight. Pairs of steers were initially assigned to 0, 28, or 56 d of feeding. Within 28 or 56 d, pairs were assigned to M or A intake. Steers within a pair assigned to 56 d of feeding were randomly assigned to either 20 d of Z supplementation (90 mg/d per steer) with a 4 d withdrawal period prior to slaughter or to no ZH supplementation (C). Steers were housed and fed in individual pens. Weights of all non-carcass and carcass components were recorded at slaughter; carcasses were graded 24-h postmortem. Data were analyzed via a mixed model; the fixed effect was treatment combination with random effects of block and pair. Live growth data used  day as the repeated measure and animal as the subject. Single df contrasts were constructed for day 0 vs. day 28, day 0 vs. day 56, day 28 vs. day 56, M vs. A, and C vs. Z. Treatment impacted (P ≤ 0.05) live ADG; contrasts indicated A (1.33) was greater than M (0.14 kg), and Z (1.12) was greater than C (0.82 kg). Similarly, carcass ADG differences (P < 0.01) indicated A (1.04) was greater than M (0.36 kg), and Z (1.35) was greater than C (0.71 kg). Intake level altered BW and empty body weight (EBW); M cattle had reduced BW and EBW (P < 0.01, 585 and 540 kg) than A cattle (647 and 597 kg). Cattle fed at M had less carcass and internal cavity mass (P < 0.01, 359 and 79.4 kg) than A cattle (394 and 93.5 kg). Liver mass was reduced by M feeding (P < 0.01; M-5.03, A-6.69 kg) and Z treatment (P < 0.01; Z-5.64, C-6.06 kg). Moreover, mass of total splanchnic tissue was less (P < 0.01) for M cattle than A cattle (59.8 vs. 72.5 kg). Dressed carcass yield was greater (P < 0.01) for Z than C cattle (63.5 vs. 61.6%). Cattle fed at M had less 12th rib s.c. fat, lower numerical U.S. yield grades (P < 0.01; M-1.71 cm and 3.3, A-.46 cm and 4.3) and lower numerical Canadian yield grades (P < 0.01; 51.9 vs. 53.9% for M and A, respectively) than A cattle.

In this study, chestnut shell is proposed as a novel anode material with mesoporous and microporous structure prepared via a simple carbonization procedure followed by an activation process. The chemical activation process successfully modified the macroporous structure, created more mesoporous and microporous structure and decreased the O-content and pyridinic/pyrrolic N groups on the biomass anode, which were beneficial for improving charge transfer efficiency between the anode surface and microbial biofilm. The MFC with activated biomass anode achieved a maximum power density (23.6 W m) .3 times higher than carbon cloth anode (10.4 W m).

Early studies were undertaken to better understand the role of microbiota in carbohydrate digestion and utilization. These processes include polysaccharide degradation, glycan transport, glycolysis, and short-chain fatty acid production. Recent research has demonstrated that the intricate axis between gut microbiota and the host metabolism is much more complex. Gut microbiota&mdash;depending on their composition&mdash;have disease-promoting effects but can also possess protective properties.

However, it has been shown that only 19% of the mechanical  delivered by the bimetal during its snap is converted into electrical . To extract more  from the bimetallic strip and to increase the transduction efficiency, a new way to couple piezoelectric materials with bimetals has thus been explored through direct deposition of piezoelectric layers on bimetals. This paper consequently presents an alternative way to  heat, based on piezoelectric bimetallic strip heat engines and presents a proof of concept of such a system. In this light, different PZT (Lead zirconate titanate) thin films were synthesized directly on aluminium foils and were attached to the bimetals using conductive epoxy.

Herein, the effects of -methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (MNQ) on  and its mechanism were carried out by a series of methods. MNQ had a significant anti- effect with an MIC value of 5.0 µg/mL. The label-free protein profiling under different MNQ conditions identified a total of 3037 proteins in the control group and the treatment group. Among them, there were 129 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs, up-regulated > .0-fold or down-regulated < 0.5-fold,  < 0.05), 19 up-regulated proteins, 26 down-regulated proteins, and 67 proteins that were specific for the treatment group and another 17 proteins that were specific for the control group. Of these, 83 proteins were sub-categorized into 23 hierarchically-structured GO classifications. Most of the identified DEPs were involved in molecular function (47%), meanwhile 27% DEPs were involved in the cellular component and 26% DEPs were involved in the biological process. Twenty-eight proteins identified for differential metabolic pathways by KEGG were sub-categorized into 60 classifications. Functional characterization by GO and KEGG enrichment results suggests that the DEPs are mainly related to  generation (mitochondrial carrier protein, glycoside hydrolase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase), NADPH supply (enolase, pyruvate carboxylase), oxidative stress (catalase, glutathione synthetase), and pentose phosphate pathway (ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase and xylulose 5-phosphate). Three of the down-regulated proteins selected randomly the nitro-reductase family protein, mono-oxygenase, and cytochrome P450 were verified using parallel reaction monitoring. These findings illustrated that MNQ may inhibit  by disrupting the metabolic processes, especially in  metabolism and stimulus response that are both critical for the growth of the fungus.

AgTe nanowires (AgTe NWs) are considered as promising thermoelectric materials to fabricate flexible thermoelectric film and device because of their high Seebeck coefficient, but poor contact between the AgTe NWs results in low electrical conductivity. Generally, hot or cold pressing can increase the electrical conductivity between the AgTe NWs. However, these process tend to destroy the initial morphology of the AgTe NWs and/or cause only physical contact between the AgTe NWs. Herein, we report an approach to the room-temperature welding of AgTe NWs to enhance their contacts by facile combination of vacuum filtration and drop-coating methods. The obtained AgTe NWs film exhibits excellent Seebeck coefficient of -99.48 μV/K and high electrical conductivity of 15 335.05 S/m at room temperature, which gives the power factor of 151.76 μW m K. Surprisingly, an optimal Seebeck coefficient of -154.96 μV/K and electrical conductivity of 14 982.42 S/m can be obtained at 420 K, giving a power factor of 359.76 μW m K. Moreover, the electrical resistance of the AgTe NWs film was only 1.3 times of the initial electrical resistance after 1000 bending cycles, indicating good flexibility of the film. A finger-touch test is conducted by using the AgTe NWs film as thermoelectric power generator, which achieves a stable output voltage of about 0.52 mV, suggesting its great potential applications in self-powered flexible electronic devices.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31516083>A Paper-Based Biological Solar Cell.</a></h1><p>A merged system incorporating paperfluidics and papertronics has recently emerged as a simple, single-use, low-cost paradigm for disposable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic applications.

Cyanobacteria are among the most promising microbial platforms for the construction of photosynthetic cell factories. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria has enabled effective photosynthetic synthesis of diverse natural or non-natural metabolites, while commercialization of photosynthetic biomanufacturing is usually restricted by process and economic feasibilities. In actual outdoor conditions, active cell growth and product synthesis is restricted to narrow light exposure windows of the day-night cycles and is threatened by diverse physical, chemical, and biological environmental stresses. For biomass harvesting and bioproduct recovery,  and cost consuming processing and equipment is required, which further decreases the economic and environmental competitiveness of the entire process. To facilitate scaled photosynthetic biomanufacturing, lots of efforts have been made to engineer cyanobacterial cell properties required by robust & continual cultivation and convenient & efficient recovery. In this review, we specifically summarized recently reported engineering strategies on optimizing industrial properties of cyanobacterial cells. Through systematically re-editing the metabolism, morphology, mutualism interaction of cyanobacterial chassis cells, the adaptabilities and compatibilities of the cyanobacterial cell factories to the industrial process could be significantly improved. Cell growth and product synthesis of the tailored cyanobacterial cells could be expanded and maintained at night and in stressful environments, while convenient biomass harvesting could also be expected.

The proposed design exhibits an improved RF-DC conversion efficiency over a wide frequency range from 1. to 5 GHz. This frequency band is associated with several wireless communication services, for instance, ISM, WLAN, 5G, LTE, and GPS applications. The receiving planar ASDA exhibits circular polarization and has an average measured gain of 4.5 dBi from 1. to 5 GHz. To enable a wide operating bandwidth, the rectifier circuit is constituted by two architectures, designated A and B. Each scheme is designed to  power efficiently across a specific bandwidth. The optimal performance of both rectifiers are obtained using the nonlinear harmonic-balance simulations. The antenna⁻rectifier integration yields a compact rectenna with a high-efficiency performance over the intended bandwidth from 1. to 5 GHz for an input power of 9 dBm and terminal load resistance of 1 k Ω . The total measured RF-DC conversion efficiency is maintained above 30% across the entire frequency range with a peak value of 61% achieved at 1. GHz. In comparison with similar architectures, the proposed rectenna maintains a stable output efficiency despite the wide fluctuations in the input frequency and also has a minimum footprint size (58 × 55 mm  ).</p></html>
