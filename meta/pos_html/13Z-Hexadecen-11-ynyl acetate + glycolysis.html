Their metabolome is susceptible to differences in pre-analytical conditions and the impact of this is unclear. Participant-matched EDTA-plasma and serum samples were collected from 37 non-fasting volunteers and profiled using a targeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform ( = 151 traits). Correlations and differences in mean of metabolite concentrations were compared between reference (pre-storage: 4 °C, 1.5 h; post-storage: no buffer addition delay or NMR analysis delay) and four pre-storage blood processing conditions, where samples were incubated at (i) 4 °C, 24 h; (ii) 4 °C, 48 h; (iii) 21 °C, 24 h; and (iv) 21 °C, 48 h, before centrifugation; and two post-storage sample processing conditions in which samples thawed overnight (i) then left for 24 h before addition of sodium buffer followed by immediate NMR analysis; and (ii) addition of sodium buffer, then left for 24 h before NMR profiling. We used multilevel linear regression models and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to analyse the data. Most metabolic traits had high rank correlation and minimal differences in mean concentrations between samples subjected to reference and the different conditions tested, that may commonly occur in studies. However,  metabolites, histidine,  and diacylglycerol concentrations may be compromised and this could bias results in association/causal analyses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475290>Impaired energy metabolism of the taurine‑deficient heart.</a></h2><p>Taurine is a β-amino acid found in high concentrations in excitable tissues, including the heart. A significant reduction in myocardial taurine content leads to the development of a unique dilated, atrophic cardiomyopathy. One of the major functions of taurine in the heart is the regulation of the respiratory chain. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that taurine deficiency-mediated defects in respiratory chain function lead to impaired energy metabolism and reduced ATP generation. We found that while the rate of  was significantly enhanced in the taurine-deficient heart, glucose oxidation was diminished. The major site of reduced glucose oxidation was pyruvate dehydrogenase, an enzyme whose activity is reduced by the increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio and by decreased availability of pyruvate for oxidation to acetyl CoA and changes in [Mg2+]i. Also diminished in the taurine-deficient heart was the oxidation of two other precursors of acetyl CoA, endogenous fatty acids and exogenous . In the taurine-deficient heart, impaired citric acid cycle activity decreased both  oxidation and endogenous fatty acid oxidation, but reductions in the activity of the mitochondrial transporter, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, appeared to also contribute to the reduction in fatty acid oxidation. These changes diminished the rate of ATP production, causing a decline in the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio, a sign of reduced energy status. The findings support the hypothesis that the taurine-deficient heart is energy starved primarily because of impaired respiratory chain function, an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio and diminished long chain fatty acid uptake by the mitochondria. The results suggest that improved energy metabolism contributes to the beneficial effect of taurine therapy in patients suffering from heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27212436>Memory CD8(+) T Cells Require Increased Concentrations of  Induced by Stress for Optimal Function.</a></h2><p>How systemic metabolic alterations during acute infections impact immune cell function remains poorly understood. We found that  accumulates in the serum within hours of systemic bacterial infections and that these increased  concentrations are required for optimal memory CD8(+) T cell function in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, upon uptake by memory CD8(+) T cells, stress levels of  expanded the cellular acetyl-coenzyme A pool via ATP citrate lyase and promoted acetylation of the enzyme GAPDH. This context-dependent post-translational modification enhanced GAPDH activity, catalyzing  and thus boosting rapid memory CD8(+) T cell responses. Accordingly, in a murine Listeria monocytogenes model, transfer of -augmented memory CD8(+) T cells exerted superior immune control compared to control cells. Our results demonstrate that increased systemic  concentrations are functionally integrated by CD8(+) T cells and translate into increased glycolytic and functional capacity. The immune system thus directly relates systemic metabolism with immune alertness.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the underlying metabolic pathways can also contribute to improved production of biofuels. Using a metabolomics approach involving liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we investigated the metabolism of mixtures of the cellulosic hexose sugar (glucose) and hemicellulosic pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose) in the anaerobic soil bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Simultaneous feeding of stable isotope-labeled glucose and unlabeled xylose or arabinose revealed that,as expected, glucose was preferentially used as the carbon source. Assimilated pentose sugars accumulated in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) intermediates with minimal flux into . Simultaneous feeding of xylose and arabinose revealed an unexpected hierarchy among the pentose sugars, with arabinose utilized preferentially over xylose. The phosphoketolase pathway (PKP) provides an alternative route of pentose catabolism in C. acetobutylicum that directly converts xylulose-5-phosphate into acetyl-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, bypassing most of the PPP. When feeding the mixture of pentose sugars, the labeling patterns of lower glycolytic intermediates indicated more flux through the PKP than through the PPP and upper , and this was confirmed by quantitative flux modeling. Consistent with direct acetyl-phosphate production from the PKP, growth on the pentose mixture resulted in enhanced  excretion. Taken collectively, these findings reveal two hierarchies in clostridial pentose metabolism: xylose is subordinate to arabinose, and the PPP is used less than the PKP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662514>Understanding the Role of Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-Capsules (Chinese Medicine) for Treatment of Endometriosis in the Rat Model: Using NMR Based Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study is to identify the changes of metabolites in the rat endometriosis models treated with  (GZFLC), a classic Chinese medicinal formula, and to explore the effects of GZFLC on the serum levels of transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) and the mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) in the endometriotic tissues. Forty female Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group (Normal group), Model group, Danazol group, and GZFLC group. The serum levels of TGF-1 were measured using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of VEGF and GLUT-4 in the endometriotic tissue of the rat endometriosis models were measured using real-time quantitative PCR. The metabolites in urine were detected by H NMR method. Eight identified metabolites of the NMR resonance were involved in the  metabolism. Among the 8 metabolites, Lactate, , TMA, and Formate were downregulated with GZFLC. Citrate, TMAO, Taurine, and Hippurate were unregulated with GZFLC. The serum levels of TGF-1 in the Danazol and GZFLC groups were significantly higher than those of Normal group and significantly lower than the Model group. GZFLC treatment significantly decreased the GLUT-4 and VEGF mRNA expression levels in the endometriotic tissues of the endometriosis rats ( < 0.05). GZFLC significantly decreased the GLUT-4 mRNA expression levels in rats of GZFLC group compared with Danazol group. It is through regulating the metabolites changes of  or gluconeogenesis that GZFLC significantly affected the expression levels of TGF-1, GLUT-4, and VEGF of the model rats with endometriosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979840>Deep-Subsurface Pressure Stimulates Metabolic Plasticity in Shale-Colonizing  spp.</a></h2><p>Bacterial  strains become the dominant persisting microbial community member in produced fluids across geographically distinct hydraulically fractured shales.  is believed to be inadvertently introduced into this environment during the drilling and fracturing process and must therefore tolerate large changes in pressure, temperature, and salinity. Here, we used a  strain isolated from a natural gas well in the Utica Point Pleasant formation to investigate metabolic and physiological responses to growth under high-pressure subsurface conditions. Laboratory incubations confirmed the ability of  strain WG8 to grow under pressures representative of deep shale formations (21 to 48 MPa). Under these conditions, broad metabolic and physiological shifts were identified, including higher abundances of proteins associated with the production of extracellular polymeric substances. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production was associated with greater cell aggregation when biomass was cultured at high pressure. Changes in  central carbon metabolism under the same conditions were inferred from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography measurements, revealing large per-cell increases in production of ethanol, , and propanol and cessation of hydrogen production. These metabolic shifts were associated with carbon flux through 1,2-propanediol in response to slower fluxes of carbon through stage 3 of . Together, these results reveal the potential for bioclogging and corrosion (via organic acid fermentation products) associated with persistent  growth in deep, hydraulically fractured shale ecosystems, and offer new insights into cellular mechanisms that enable these strains to dominate deep-shale microbiomes. The hydraulic fracturing of deep-shale formations for hydrocarbon recovery accounts for approximately 60% of U.S. natural gas production. Microbial activity associated with this process is generally considered deleterious due to issues associated with sulfide production, microbially induced corrosion, and bioclogging in the subsurface. Here we demonstrate that a representative  species, frequently the dominant microbial taxon in hydraulically fractured shales, responds to pressures characteristic of the deep subsurface by shifting its metabolism to generate more corrosive organic acids and produce more polymeric substances that cause "clumping" of biomass. While the potential for increased corrosion of steel infrastructure and clogging of pores and fractures in the subsurface may significantly impact hydrocarbon recovery, these data also offer new insights for microbial control in these ecosystems.Copyright © 2019 Booker et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272823>Growth characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis KB290 in the presence of bile.</a></h2><p>Live Lactobacillus brevis KB290 have several probiotic activities, including immune stimulation and modulation of intestinal microbial balance. We investigated the adaptation of L. brevis KB290 to bile as a mechanism of intestinal survival. Strain KB290 was grown for 5 days at 37 °C in tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) broth supplemented with 0.5% sodium  (TYGA) containing 0.15%, 0.3%, or 0.5% bile. Growth was determined by absorbance at 620 nm or by dry weight. Growth was enhanced as the broth's bile concentration increased. Bile-enhanced growth was not observed in TYG broth or with xylose or fructose as the carbon source, although strain KB290 could assimilate these sugars. Compared with cells grown without bile, cells grown with bile had twice the cell yield (dry weight) and higher hydrophobicity, which may improve epithelial adhesion. Metabolite analysis revealed that bile induced more lactate production by , thus enhancing growth efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cells cultured without bile for 5 days in TYGA broth had a shortened rod shape and showed lysis and aggregation, unlike cells cultured for 1 day; cells grown with bile for 5 days had an intact rod shape and rarely appeared damaged. Cellular material leakage through autolysis was lower in the presence of bile than in its absence. Thus lysis of strain KB290 cells cultured for extended periods was suppressed in the presence of bile. This study provides new role of bile and sodium  for retaining an intact cell shape and enhancing cell yield, which are beneficial for intestinal survival.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To secrete them into the extracellular milieu, the parasites have at least two main specific membrane proteins, the pyruvate transporter and the aquaglyceroporins However, there are several other minor products from the  that must be excreted by the parasites and whose exit pathway until now remained elusive. As aquaglyceroporins from T. brucei (TbAQP1, 2, and 3) show a wide permeability profile for small solutes, we decided to evaluate if these proteins allow the passage of methylglyoxal, L-lactate, D-lactate and  molecules. We expressed heterologously TbAQP1, 2, and 3 in aquaglyceroporin-null yeast cells or in Xenopus laevis oocytes and demonstrated that these channels are permeable for methylglyoxal, L-lactate, D-lactate and . We further demonstrate that methylglyoxal is highly toxic for bloodstream forms of T. brucei, while L-lactate and D-lactate appear almost harmless. Additionally, we discuss all our findings in the light of the novel metabolic discoveries, putting in context the participation of TbAQP1, 2, 3, and other proteins in the excretion of unwanted metabolic end-products.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The utilization of nitrite instead of oxygen becomes a successful strategy for this strain to improve its performance in anaerobiosis; however, metabolic pathways of this strain underlying this adaptation, are partially known. The aim of this study was to provide an overview on proteomic changes of  DSM 20266T cultured under anaerobiosis and nitrite exposure. Thus, two different cultures of this strain, supplemented or not with nitrite, were  incubated in aerobiosis and anaerobiosis monitoring cell viability, pH, oxidation reduction potential and nitrite content. Protein extracts, obtained from cells, collected as nitrite content was depleted, were analyzed by 2DE/MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Results showed that DSM 20266T growth was significantly sustained by nitrite in anaerobiosis, whereas no differences were found in aerobiosis. Accordingly, nitrite content was depleted after 13 h only in anaerobiosis. At this time of sampling, a comparative proteomic analysis showed 45 differentially expressed proteins. Most differences were found between aerobic and anaerobic cultures without nitrite; the induction of glycolytic enzymes and glyoxylate cycle, the reduction of TCA enzymes, and  fermentation were found in anaerobiosis to produce ATP and maintain the cell redox balance. In anaerobic cultures the nitrite supplementation partially restored TCA cycle, and reduced the amount of glycolytic enzymes. These results were confirmed by phenotypic microarray that, for the first time, was carried out on cell previously adapted at the different growth conditions. Overall, metabolic changes were similar between aerobiosis and anaerobiosis NO-adapted cells, whilst cells grown under anaerobiosis showed different assimilation profiles by confirming proteomic data; indeed, these latter extensively assimilated substrates addressed at both supplying glucose for  or fueling alternative pathways to TCA cycle. In conclusion, metabolic pathways underlying the ability of  to adapt itself to oxygen starvation were revealed; the addition of nitrite allowed  to take advantage of nitrite to this condition, restoring some metabolic pathway underlying aerobic behavior of the strain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888065>Role of SCFAs in gut microbiome and  for colorectal cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>Increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with altered intestinal microbiota as well as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) reduction of output The energy source of colon cells relies mainly on three SCFAs, namely butyrate (BT), propionate, and , while CRC transformed cells rely mainly on aerobic  to provide energy. This review summarizes recent research results for dysregulated glucose metabolism of SCFAs, which could be initiated by gut microbiome of CRC. Moreover, the relationship between SCFA transporters and , which may correlate with the initiation and progression of CRC, are also discussed. Additionally, this review explores the linkage of BT to transport of SCFAs expressions between normal and cancerous colonocyte cell growth for tumorigenesis inhibition in CRC. Furthermore, the link between gut microbiota and SCFAs in the metabolism of CRC, in addition, the proteins and genes related to SCFAs-mediated signaling pathways, coupled with their correlation with the initiation and progression of CRC are also discussed. Therefore, targeting the SCFA transporters to regulate lactate generation and export of BT, as well as applying SCFAs or gut microbiota and natural compounds for chemoprevention may be clinically useful for CRCs treatment. Future research should focus on the combination these therapeutic agents with metabolic inhibitors to effectively target the tumor SCFAs and regulate the bacterial ecology for activation of potent anticancer effect, which may provide more effective application prospect for CRC therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913278>Increasing cell permeability of N-acetylglucosamine via 6-acetylation enhances capacity to suppress T-helper 1 (TH1)/TH17 responses and autoimmunity.</a></h2><p>N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) branching of Asn (N)-linked glycans inhibits pro-inflammatory T cell responses and models of autoimmune diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Metabolism controls N-glycan branching in T cells by regulating de novo hexosamine pathway biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, the donor substrate for the Golgi branching enzymes. Activated T cells switch metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic  and glutaminolysis. This reduces flux of glucose and glutamine into the hexosamine pathway, thereby inhibiting de novo UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and N-glycan branching. Salvage of GlcNAc into the hexosamine pathway overcomes this metabolic suppression to restore UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and N-glycan branching, thereby promoting anti-inflammatory T regulatory (Treg) over pro-inflammatory T helper (TH) 17 and TH1 differentiation to suppress autoimmunity. However, GlcNAc activity is limited by the lack of a cell surface transporter and requires high doses to enter cells via macropinocytosis. Here we report that GlcNAc-6- is a superior pro-drug form of GlcNAc. Acetylation of amino-sugars improves cell membrane permeability, with subsequent de-acetylation by cytoplasmic esterases allowing salvage into the hexosamine pathway. Per- and bi-acetylation of GlcNAc led to toxicity in T cells, whereas mono-acetylation at only the 6 > 3 position raised N-glycan branching greater than GlcNAc without inducing significant toxicity. GlcNAc-6- inhibited T cell activation/proliferation, TH1/TH17 responses and disease progression in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Thus, GlcNAc-6- may provide an improved therapeutic approach to raise N-glycan branching, inhibit pro-inflammatory T cell responses and treat autoimmune diseases such as MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25611149>Cerebrospinal fluid metabolomics implicate bioenergetic adaptation as a neural mechanism regulating shifts in cognitive states of HIV-infected patients.</a></h2><p>To identify prognostic surrogate markers for change in cognitive states of HIV-infected patients.Longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 98 HIV-infected patients identified by temporal change in cognitive states classified as normal, stably impaired, improving and worsening.The metabolic composition of CSF was analysed using H nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectroscopy that focused on energy metabolites. Metabolic biomarkers for cognitive states were identified using multivariate partial least squares regression modelling of the acquired spectra, combined with nonparametric analyses of metabolites with clinical features.Multivariate modelling and cross-validated recursive partitioning identified several energy metabolites that, when combined with clinical variables, classified patients based on change in neurocognitive states. Prognostic identification for worsening was achieved with four features that included no change in a detectable plasma viral load, elevated citrate and ; decreased creatine, to produce a model with a predictive accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 88% and 96% specificity. Prognosis for improvement contained seven features that included first visit age less than 47 years, new or continued use of antiretrovirals, elevated glutamine and glucose; decreased myo-inositol, β-glucose and creatinine to generate a model with a predictive accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 84%.These CSF metabolic results suggest that worsening cognitive status in HIV-infected patients is associated with increased aerobic , and improvements in cognitive status are associated with a shift to anaerobic .

The skin and adipose tissues were recently identified as additional major sites for parasite development. Glucose was the only carbon source known to be used by bloodstream trypanosomes to feed their central carbon metabolism, however, the metabolic behaviour of extravascular tissue-adapted parasites has not been addressed yet. Since the production of glycerol is an important primary function of adipocytes, we have adapted BSF trypanosomes to a glucose-depleted but glycerol-rich culture medium (CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc) and compared their metabolism and proteome to those of parasites grown in standard glucose-rich conditions (CMM_Glc). BSF were shown to consume 2-folds more oxygen per consumed carbon unit in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc and were 11.5-times more sensitive to SHAM, a specific inhibitor of the plant-like alternative oxidase (TAO), which is the only mitochondrial terminal oxidase expressed in BSF. This is consistent with (i) the absolute requirement of the mitochondrial respiratory activity to convert glycerol into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, as deduced from the updated metabolic scheme and (ii) with the 1.8-fold increase of the TAO expression level compared to the presence of glucose. Proton NMR analysis of excreted end products from glycerol and glucose metabolism showed that these two carbon sources are metabolised through the same pathways, although the contributions of the  and succinate branches are more important in the presence of glycerol than glucose (10.2% versus 3.4% of the excreted end products, respectively). In addition, metabolomic analyses by mass spectrometry showed that, in the absence of glucose, 13C-labelled glycerol was incorporated into hexose phosphates through gluconeogenesis. As expected, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of glycerol kinase expression abolished glycerol metabolism and was lethal for BSF grown in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc. Interestingly, BSF have adapted their metabolism to grow in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc by concomitantly increasing their rate of glycerol consumption and decreasing that of glucose. However, the glycerol kinase activity was 7.8-fold lower in CMM_Glyc/GlcNAc, as confirmed by both western blotting and proteomic analyses. This suggests that the huge excess in glycerol kinase that is not absolutely required for glycerol metabolism, might be used for another yet undetermined non-essential function in glucose rich-conditions. Altogether, these data demonstrate that BSF trypanosomes are well-adapted to glycerol-rich conditions that could be encountered by the parasite in extravascular niches, such as the skin and adipose tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29995973>Physiology and central carbon metabolism of the gut bacterium Prevotella copri.</a></h2><p>The human gut microbiota is a crucial factor for the host's physiology with respect to health and disease. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing of microbial gut communities revealed that Prevotella copri is one of the most important players in the gastrointestinal tract of many individuals. Because of the importance of this bacterium we analyzed the growth behavior and the central metabolic pathways of P. copri. Bioinformatic data, transcriptome profiling and enzyme activity measurements indicated that the major pathways are based on  and succinate production from fumarate. In addition, pyruvate can be degraded to  and formate. Electron transport phosphorylation depends on fumarate respiration with NADH and reduced ferredoxin as electron donors. In contrast to Bacteroides vulgatus, P. copri showed a more pronounced dependency on the addition of CO or bicarbonate for biomass formation, which is a remarkable difference between P. copri and Bacteroides spp. with important implication in the context of gut microbial competition. The analysis of substrate consumption and product concentrations from many P. copri cultures with different optical densities allowed a prediction of the carbon and electron flow in the central metabolism and a detailed calculation of growth yields as well as carbon and redox balances.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25541729>Pea fiber and wheat bran fiber show distinct metabolic profiles in rats as investigated by a 1H NMR-based metabolomic approach.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to examine the effect of pea fiber (PF) and wheat bran fiber (WF) supplementation in rat metabolism.

Urine and plasma samples were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics. PF significantly increased the plasma levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, and myo-inositol as well as the urine levels of alanine, hydroxyphenylacetate, phenylacetyglycine, and α-ketoglutarate. However, PF significantly decreased the plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, lactate, and pyruvate as well as the urine levels of allantoin, bile acids, and trigonelline. WF significantly increased the plasma levels of acetone, isobutyrate, lactate, myo-inositol, and lipids as well as the urine levels of alanine, lactate, dimethylglycine, N-methylniconamide, and α-ketoglutarate. However, WF significantly decreased the plasma levels of amino acids, and glucose as well as the urine levels of , allantoin, citrate, creatine, hippurate, hydroxyphenylacetate, and trigonelline.

In this study, we have used (1) H and (13) C NMR spectroscopy after injection of [1-(13) C]glucose and [1,2-(13) C] to examine neuronal and astrocytic metabolism in the early reperfusion phase after unilateral HI brain injury in 7-day-old rat pups, exploring the effects of HI on mitochondrial function and the potential protective effects of melatonin on brain metabolism. One hour after hypoxia-ischemia, astrocytic metabolism was recovered and  was normalized, whereas mitochondrial metabolism in neurons was clearly impaired. Pyruvate carboxylation was also lower in both hemispheres after HI. The transfer of glutamate from neurons to astrocytes was higher whereas the transfer of glutamine from astrocytes to neurons was lower 1 h after HI in the contralateral hemisphere. Neuronal metabolism was equally affected in pups treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg) immediately after HI as in vehicle treated pups indicating that the given dose of melatonin was not capable of protecting the neuronal mitochondria in this early phase after HI brain injury. However, any beneficial effects of melatonin might have been masked by modulatory effects of the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide on cerebral metabolism. Neuronal and astrocytic metabolism was examined by (13) C and (1) H NMR spectroscopy in the early reperfusion phase after unilateral hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and melatonin treatment in neonatal rats. One hour after hypoxia-ischemia astrocytic mitochondrial metabolism had recovered and  was normalized, whereas mitochondrial metabolism in neurons was impaired.

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are one of the critical events that modulate the immune response in neutrophils. When activated, neutrophil NADPH oxidases consume large quantities of oxygen to rapidly generate ROS, a process that is referred to as the oxidative burst. These ROS are required for the efficient removal of phagocytized cellular debris and pathogens. In chronic inflammatory diseases, neutrophils are exposed to increased levels of oxidants and pro-inflammatory cytokines that can further prime oxidative burst responses and generate lipid oxidation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). In this study we hypothesized that since 4-HNE can target  then this could modify the oxidative burst. To address this the oxidative burst was determined in freshly isolated healthy subject neutrophils using 13-phorbol myristate  (PMA) and the extracellular flux analyzer. Neutrophils pretreated with 4-HNE exhibited a significant decrease in the oxidative burst response and phagocytosis. Mass spectrometric analysis of alkyne-HNE treated neutrophils followed by click chemistry detected modification of a number of cytoskeletal, metabolic, redox and signaling proteins that are critical for the NADPH oxidase mediated oxidative burst. These modifications were confirmed using a candidate immunoblot approach for critical proteins of the active NADPH oxidase enzyme complex (Nox2 gp91phox subunit and Rac1 of the NADPH oxidase) and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in the metabolic regulation of oxidative burst. Taken together, these data suggest that 4-HNE-induces a pleiotropic mechanism to inhibit neutrophil function. These mechanisms may contribute to the immune dysregulation associated with chronic pathological conditions where 4-HNE is generated.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We found that effector memory CD4 T cells respond distinctly from other T cell subsets to limiting glucose and can maintain high levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in a nutrient-poor environment. Unlike naive (T) or central memory T (T) cells, effector memory T (T) cells fail to upregulate fatty acid synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and reductive glutaminolysis in limiting glucose. Interference of fatty acid synthesis in naive T cells dramatically upregulates IFN-γ, while increasing exogenous lipids in media inhibits production of IFN-γ by all subsets, suggesting that relative ratio of fatty acid metabolism to  is a direct predictor of T cell effector activity. Together, these data suggest that effector memory T cells are programmed to have limited ability to synthesize and metabolize fatty acids, which allows them to maintain T cell function in nutrient-depleted microenvironments.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Acanthamoeba, in immunocompetent patients, may cause a keratitis related to corneal microtrauma. These free-living amoebas easily adapt to the host environment and wield metabolic pathways such as the energetic and respiratory ones in order to maintain viability for long periods. The energetic metabolism of cysts and trophozoites remains mostly unknown. There are a few reports on the energetic metabolism of these organisms as they are mitochondriate eukaryotes and some studies under aerobic conditions showing that Acanthamoeba hydrolyzes glucose into pyruvate via . The aim of this study was to detect the energetic metabolic pathways with emphasis on anaerobic metabolism in trophozoites of three isolates of Acanthamoeba sp belonging to the T4 genotype. Two samples were collected in the environment and one was a clinical sample. The evaluation of these microorganisms proceeded as follows: rupture of trophozoites (7.5 × 10 parasites/ml) and biochemical analysis with high performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry. The anaerobic  was identified through the detection of glucose, pyruvate, and lactate. The protein catabolism was identified through the detection of fumarate, urea, and creatinine. The fatty acid oxidation was identified through the detection of , beta-hydroxybutyrate, and propionate. The detected substances are the result of the consumption of energy reserves such as glycogen and lipids. The anaerobic  and protein catabolism pathways were observed in all three isolates: one clinical and two environmental. This study represents the first report of energetic pathways used by trophozoites from different isolates of the T4 genotype Acanthamoeba.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25738455>-mediated changes in acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation control the early differentiation of embryonic stem cells.</a></h2><p>Loss of pluripotency is a gradual event whose initiating factors are largely unknown.

Importantly, modulation of  blocked histone deacetylation and differentiation in human and mouse embryonic stem cells. , a precursor of acetyl-CoA, delayed differentiation and blocked early histone deacetylation in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitors upstream of acetyl-CoA caused differentiation of pluripotent cells, while those downstream delayed differentiation. Our results show a metabolic switch causing a loss of histone acetylation and pluripotent state during the first hours of differentiation. Our data highlight the important role metabolism plays in pluripotency and suggest that a glycolytic switch controlling histone acetylation can release stem cells from pluripotency.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and  rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the lipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty acid remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic metabolism during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recently, a proteomic analysis of the constitutively active Nox2 complex, isolated from neutrophil fractions, highlighted the presence of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2). The purpose of this work was to study the relationship between PFK-2 and NADPH oxidase in neutrophils. Data have underlined a specific association of the active phosphorylated form of PFK-2 with Nox2 complex in stimulated neutrophils. In its active form, PFK-2 catalyzes the production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is the main allosteric activator of phosphofructo-1-kinase, the limiting enzyme in . Pharmacologic inhibition of PFK-2 phosphorylation and cell depletion in PFK-2 by a small interfering RNA strategy led to a decrease in the  rate and a reduction in NADPH oxidase activity in stimulated cells. Surprisingly, alteration of Nox2 activity impacted the  rate, which indicated that Nox2 in neutrophils was not only required for reactive oxygen species production but was also involved in supporting the energetic metabolism increase that was induced by inflammatory conditions. PFK-2 seems to be a strategic element that links NADPH oxidase activation and  modulation, and, as such, is proposed as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.-Baillet, A., Hograindleur, M.-A., El Benna, J., Grichine, A., Berthier, S., Morel, F., Paclet, M.-H.

The production of glycolate from glucose in  is generally carried out by  and glyoxylate shunt pathways, followed by reduction to glycolate. Glycolate accumulation was significantly affected by nitrogen sources and isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), which influenced carbon flux distribution between the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the glyoxylate shunt, however, the mechanism was unclear.Herein, we used RNA-Seq to explore the effects of nitrogen sources and ICDH knockout on glycolate production. The Mgly534 strain and the Mgly624 strain (with the ICDH deletion in Mgly534), displaying different phenotypes on organic nitrogen sources, were also adopted for the exploration. Though the growth of Mgly534 was improved on organic nitrogen sources, glycolate production decreased and  accumulated, while Mgly624 achieved a balance between cell growth and glycolate production, reaching 0.81 g glycolate/OD (2.6-fold higher than Mgly534). To further study Mgly624, the significant changed genes related to N-regulation, oxidative stress response and iron transport were analyzed. Glutamate and serine were found to increase the biomass and productivity respectively. Meanwhile, overexpressing the arginine transport gene  accelerated the cell growth rate and increased the biomass. Further, the presence of Fe also speeded up the cells growth and compensated for the lack of reducing equivalents.Our studies identified that ICDH knockout strain was more suitable for glycolate production.

Herein we tested the hypothesis that palmitoleic acid positively modulates glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes.For this, both differentiated 3 T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic acid (16:1n7, 200 μM) or palmitic acid (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg/kg/day) or oleic acid (18:1n9, 300 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for glucose uptake, oxidation, conversion to lactate and incorporation into fatty acids and glycerol components of TAG along with the activity and expression of lipogenic enzymes.Treatment of adipocytes with palmitoleic, but not oleic (in vivo) or palmitic (in vitro) acids, increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 mRNA levels and protein content. Along with uptake, palmitoleic acid enhanced glucose oxidation (aerobic ), conversion to lactate (anaerobic ) and incorporation into glycerol-TAG, but reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis from glucose and  and the activity of lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase. Importantly, palmitoleic acid induction of adipocyte glucose uptake and metabolism were associated with AMPK activation as evidenced by the increased protein content of phospho(p)Thr172AMPKα, but no changes in pSer473Akt and pThr308Akt. Importantly, such increase in GLUT4 content induced by 16:1n7, was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with compound C.In conclusion, palmitoleic acid increases glucose uptake and the GLUT4 content in association with AMPK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29044214>Limits of aerobic metabolism in cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Cancer cells exhibit high rates of  and glutaminolysis.  can provide energy and glutaminolysis can provide carbon for anaplerosis and reductive carboxylation to citrate. However, all these metabolic requirements could be in principle satisfied from glucose. Here we investigate why cancer cells do not satisfy their metabolic demands using aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. Based on the typical composition of a mammalian cell we quantify the energy demand and the OxPhos burden of cell biosynthesis from glucose. Our calculation demonstrates that aerobic growth from glucose is feasible up to a minimum doubling time that is proportional to the OxPhos burden and inversely proportional to the mitochondria OxPhos capacity. To grow faster cancer cells must activate aerobic  for energy generation and uncouple NADH generation from biosynthesis. To uncouple biosynthesis from NADH generation cancer cells can synthesize lipids from carbon sources that do not produce NADH in their catabolism, including  and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Finally, we show that cancer cell lines have an OxPhos capacity that is insufficient to support aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. We conclude that selection for high rate of biosynthesis implies a selection for aerobic  and uncoupling biosynthesis from NADH generation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26036577>The regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by autophagy in low-glycolytic hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>The glycolytic phenotype is a dominant metabolic phenomenon in cancer and is reflected in becoming aggressive. Certain hepatocellular carcinoma lack increased  and prefer to uptake  than glucose for metabolism. Autophagy plays a role in preserving energies and nutrients when there is limited external nutrient supply and maintains glucose level of blood though supporting gluconeogenesis in the liver. As the role of autophagy and gluconeogenesis in HCC following the glycolic activity was not clear, we cultured HCC cells with different glycolytic levels in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to induce autophagy and conducted the activity of gluconeogenesis. Both autophagy and gluconeogenesis were induced in low glycolytic HCC cells (HepG2). In glycolytic Hep3B cells, only autophagy without gluconeogenesis was induced upon starvation. When autophagy was blocked, the level of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was reduced in HepG2 cells and not in Hep3B. Altogether, we investigated contribution of hepatic gluconeogenesis to the metabolic phenotype of HCC cells and the role of autophagy as a potential mechanism regulating gluconeogenesis in low glycolytic HCC.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Batch cultures of the strain with H2/CO2 as a sole carbon source reached an  yield of 5.32 g/g dry cell weight after 240 h of incubation. Autotrophic metabolism was inhibited as glucose was added into the culture: the higher the glucose concentration the lower the autotrophic ability of the bacterium.

While hippocampal slices routinely have been used for electrophysiology studies, metabolic processes have mostly been studied in cerebral cortical slices. Few comparative characterization studies exist for acute hippocampal and cerebral cortical slices, hence, the aim of the current study was to characterize and compare glucose and  metabolism in these slice preparations in a newly established incubation design. Cerebral cortical and hippocampal slices prepared from 16 to 18-week-old mice were incubated for 15-90 min with unlabeled glucose in combination with [U-C]glucose or [1,2-C]. Our newly developed incubation apparatus allows accurate control of temperature and is designed to avoid evaporation of the incubation medium. Subsequent to incubation, slices were extracted and extracts analyzed for C-labeling (%) and total amino acid contents (µmol/mg protein) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Release of lactate from the slices was quantified by analysis of the incubation media. Based on the measured C-labeling (%), total amino acid contents and relative activity of metabolic enzymes/pathways, we conclude that the slice preparations in the current incubation apparatus exhibited a high degree of metabolic integrity. Comparison of C-labeling observed with [U-C]glucose in slices from cerebral cortex and hippocampus revealed no significant regional differences regarding glycolytic or total TCA cycle activities. On the contrary, results from the incubations with [1,2-C] suggest a higher capacity of the astrocytic TCA cycle in hippocampus compared to cerebral cortex. Finally, we propose a new approach for assessing compartmentation of metabolite pools between astrocytes and neurons using C-labeling (%) data obtained from mass spectrometry. Based on this approach we suggest that cellular metabolic compartmentation in hippocampus and cerebral cortex is very similar.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571714>A robust intracellular metabolite extraction protocol for human neutrophil metabolic profiling.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated ± PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Metaboanalyst. Cell number and number of scans (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110 metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates, carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and lipid-like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and , suggesting a redirection of glucose metabolism from  to the pentose phosphate pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent respiratory burst.

Biochemical cycles play important roles in maintaining flux and substrate availability for multiple pathways to supply cellular energy and contribute to dynamic stability. By understanding the cyclic and acyclic flows of matter through a network, we are closer to understanding how complex dynamic systems distribute flux along interconnected pathways. In this work, we have applied a cycle decomposition algorithm to a genome-scale metabolic model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to analyse how  supply affects the distribution of fluxes that sustain cellular activity. We examined the role of metabolic cycles which explain the down regulation of photosynthesis that is observed when cells are grown in the presence of .

Nevertheless, it is perplexing to see that only roughly 70 % of the carbon fed to the bacterial culture could be accounted for in the standard metabolic products. This low carbon recovery during fermentation occurred even though CO2 emission was effectively reduced by Rubisco-based engineered pathway.In this study, the heterologous expression of form I Rubisco was found to enhance the accumulation of pyruvate in Escherichia coli MZLF [E. coli BL21(DE3) Δzwf, Δldh, Δfrd]. This may be attributed to the enhanced glycolytic reaction supported by the increased biomass and the ethanol/ ratio. Besides, it was found that the transcription of arcA (encodes the redox-dependent transcriptional activators ArcA that positively regulates the transcription of pyruvate formate-lyase) was down-regulated in the presence of Rubisco. The enhanced accumulation of pyruvate also occurs when PrkA is co-expressed with Rubisco in E. coli MZLF. Furthermore, E. coli containing Rubisco-based engineered pathway has a distinct profile of the fermentation products, indicating CO2 was converted into fermentation products. By analyzing the ratio of total C-2 (2-carbon fermentation products) to total C-1 (1-carbon fermentation product) of MZLFB (MZLF containing Rubisco-based engineered pathway), it is estimated that 9 % of carbon is directed into Rubisco-based engineered pathway.Here, we report for the first time the complete profile of fermentation products using E. coli MZLF and its derived strains. It has been shown that the expression of Rubisco alone in MZLF enhances the accumulation of pyruvate.

In both α2M* and insulin-treated cells, the mRNA levels of SREBP1-c, SREBP2, fatty-acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, and Glut-1 were significantly increased together with their protein levels, except for SREBP2. Pretreatment of cells with α2M* antagonist antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78 blocks these α2M*-mediated effects, and silencing GRP78 expression by RNAi inhibits up-regulation of ATP citrate lyase and fatty-acid synthase. α2M* induces a 2-3-fold increase in lipogenesis as determined by 6-[(14)C]glucose or 1-[(14)C] incorporation into free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phosphatidylcholine, which is blocked by inhibitors of fatty-acid synthase, PI 3-kinase, mTORC, or an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRP78.

Lipogenesis is significantly affected by pretreatment of prostate cancer cells with fatostatin A, which blocks sterol regulatory element-binding protein proteolytic cleavage and activation.

In this study, we systematically surveyed and dynamically profiled the transcriptional activity of 22 lipogenic promoters aiming to delineate a picture how nitrogen starvation regulates lipogenesis in Y. lipolytica. These lipogenic promoters drive the expression of critical pathways that are responsible for the generation of reducing equivalents (NADPH), carbon backbones (acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, DHAP, etc.), synthesis and degradation of fatty acids.

Sensitivity to pH, CO or bicarbonate concentrations allows neutrophils to react to changes in their environment and to detect inflamed areas in the tissue. One important antimicrobial effector mechanism is the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are released during a programmed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent cell death, the so-called NETosis. Although several functions of neutrophils have been analyzed under acidic conditions, the effect of extracellular acidosis on NETosis remains mainly unexplored and the available experimental results are contradictory. We performed a comprehensive study with the aim to elucidate the effect of extracellular acidosis on ROS-dependent NETosis of primary human neutrophils and to identify the underlying mechanisms. The study was performed in parallel in a CO-bicabonate-buffered culture medium, which mimics  conditions, and under HEPES-buffered conditions to verify the effect of pH independent of CO or bicarbonate. We could clearly show that extracellular acidosis (pH 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5) and intracellular acidification inhibit the release of ROS-dependent NETs upon stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate  and immobilized immune complexes. Moreover, our findings suggest that the diminished NET release is a consequence of reduced ROS production and diminished  of neutrophils under acidic conditions. It was suggested previously that neutrophils can sense the border of inflamed tissue by the pH gradient and that a drop in pH serves as an indicator for the progress of inflammation. Following this hypothesis, our data indicate that an acidic inflammatory environment results in inhibition of extracellular operating effector mechanisms of neutrophils such as release of ROS and NETs. This way the release of toxic components and tissue damage can be avoided. However, we observed that major antimicrobial effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis and the killing of pathogens by neutrophils remain functional under acidic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27539851>Glucose-independent  Metabolism Promotes Melanoma Cell Survival and Tumor Growth.</a></h2><p>Tumors rely on multiple nutrients to meet cellular bioenergetics and macromolecular synthesis demands of rapidly dividing cells.

The chemical structure of the major polysaccharide was determined using a nuclear magnetic resonance technique, the formula being →6)-α-D-Gal-(1→4)-β-D-ManNAc3NAcA-(1→6)-α-D-Glc-(1→4)-β-D-ManNAc3NAcA-(1→3)-β-GalNAc-(1→. We detected 447 proteins in the matrix, of which the most abundant were the chaperonin GroL, the elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G, several enzymes of , and proteins of unknown function. The matrix also contained more than 20 hydrolases of various substrata, pathogenicity factors, and many intracellular proteins and enzymes. We also performed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis of the  RT5 matrix for the first time, providing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) profiles of the  RT5 biofilm matrix and biofilm biomass. The difference between the matrix and biofilm biomass spectra showed successful matrix extraction rather than simply the presence of cell debris after sonication. These data show the complexity of the biofilm matrix composition and should be essential for the development of new anti- biofilms and potential antibiofilm drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399037>Dropwort-induced metabolic reprogramming restrains YAP/TAZ/TEAD oncogenic axis in mesothelioma.</a></h2><p>Over the past decade, newly designed cancer therapies have not significantly improved the survival of patients diagnosed with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). Among a limited number of genes that are frequently mutated in MPM several of them encode proteins that belong to the HIPPO tumor suppressor pathway.The anticancer effects of the top flower standardized extract of Filipendula vulgaris (Dropwort) were characterized in "in vitro" and "in vivo" models of MPM. At the molecular level, two "omic" approaches were used to investigate Dropwort anticancer mechanism of action: a metabolomic profiling and a phosphoarray analysis.We found that Dropwort significantly reduced cell proliferation, viability, migration and in vivo tumor growth of MPM cell lines. Notably, Dropwort affected viability of tumor-initiating MPM cells and synergized with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed in vitro. Metabolomic profiling revealed that Dropwort treatment affected both /tricarboxylic acid cycle as for the decreased consumption of glucose, pyruvate, succinate and , and the lipid metabolism. We also document that Dropwort exerted its anticancer effects, at least partially, promoting YAP and TAZ protein ubiquitination.Our findings reveal that Dropwort is a promising source of natural compound(s) for targeting the HIPPO pathway with chemo-preventive and anticancer implications for MPM management.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25828364>Protein costs do not explain evolution of metabolic strategies and regulation of ribosomal content: does protein investment explain an anaerobic bacterial Crabtree effect?</a></h2><p>Protein investment costs are considered a major driver for the choice of alternative metabolic strategies. We tested this premise in Lactococcus lactis, a bacterium that exhibits a distinct, anaerobic version of the bacterial Crabtree/Warburg effect; with increasing growth rates it shifts from a high yield metabolic mode [mixed-acid fermentation; 3 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per glucose] to a low yield metabolic mode (homolactic fermentation; 2 ATP per glucose). We studied growth rate-dependent relative transcription and protein ratios, enzyme activities, and fluxes of L. lactis in glucose-limited chemostats, providing a high-quality and comprehensive data set. A three- to fourfold higher growth rate rerouted metabolism from  to lactate as the main fermentation product. However, we observed hardly any changes in transcription, protein levels and enzyme activities. Even levels of ribosomal proteins, constituting a major investment in cellular machinery, changed only slightly. Thus, contrary to the original hypothesis, central metabolism in this organism appears to be hardly regulated at the level of gene expression, but rather at the metabolic level. We conclude that L. lactis is either poorly adapted to growth at low and constant glucose concentrations, or that protein costs play a less important role in fitness than hitherto assumed.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121516>Metabolomic modulations of HepG2 cells exposed to bisphenol analogues.</a></h2><p>Bisphenol analogues including bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol S (BPS) share similar chemical structures and endocrine disrupting effects. Their effects on metabolisms, however, are so far only marginally understood. In this study, NMR-based metabonomic profiles of HepG2 cell culture media and PCR array were used to assess the metabolomics disturbances and gene expression levels of HepG2 in response to four BPs (BPA, BPAF, BPF, and BPS). The results indicated that BP analogues resulted in disturbances in 7-15 metabolites that were classified as amino acid (alanine, glutamine, glutamate), intermediates and end-products in the glycolysis (pyruvate) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (, lactate). Their rank in order according to the number of metabolites and pathways was BPF > BPA > BPAF > BPS. The common disrupted pathways (pyruvate metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism) indicated enhanced glycolysis. The following glucometabolic PCR array analysis suggested that although four BPs shared the capability of disrupting glucose metabolism, they may act through different mechanisms: BPAF has increased the pyruvate kinase (PKLR) expression level, which implied enhanced glycolysis that was agreed with NMR results. The other three BP analogues, however, decreased the expression level of glucokinase (GCK) that indicated glucose sensing impairment. Our results demonstrated the potential for using metabolomic and PCR array to understand the underlying action of mechanisms and identify the potential targets for future targeted risk assessment.Copyright © 2019.

The increase in multidrug-resistant TB poses formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. TB infection could easily yield false-positive results in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([F]FDG) PET imaging for cancer detection because of its high [F]FDG uptake. We describe the combined [F]FDG PET with fluorine-18-fluoroacetate ([F]FAC), a promising analog of carbon-11-, for targeting  and de novo lipogenesis, respectively, to determine the metabolic differences between chronic TB infection and acute infection.Six-month-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis to induce chronic TB infection, and Escherichia coli as well as Staphylococcus aureus to induce acute infection for an in-vivo imaging study. Eighteen days after inoculation for chronic TB infection and 5 days for acute infection, both [F]FDG and [F]FAC micro-PET were performed on the infected mice. Analysis of variance and the Tukey honest ad-hoc test were carried out to determine differences among treatment with different bacterial infections.TB infection showed much lower [F] FAC accumulation than acute infection. However, both TB infection and acute infection exhibited high [F]FAC accumulation.The marked metabolic differences in de novo lipogenesis and  in [F]FDG and [F]FAC uptakes in micro-PET imaging, respectively, help to differentiate chronic TB infection from acute infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810277>Enhanced Phenyllactic Acid Production in Escherichia coli Via Oxygen Limitation and Shikimate Pathway Gene Expression.</a></h2><p>3-Phenyllactic acid (PhLA) is useful as a start-up material in the pharmaceutical and biorefinery industries. To enhance the production of PhLA from glucose using recombinant Escherichia coli, the effects of glucose concentration and oxygen limitation on PhLA production are assessed in a fed-batch system using dissolved oxygen (DO)-stat method. The highest titer of PhLA (7.3 g L ) is observed with a high concentration of glucose and under oxygen-limited conditions (DO = 0 ppm). Under oxygen limitation, cell growth and the formation of  and l-phenylalanine (Phe) by-products after 72 h of cultivation are reduced by 30%, 70%, and 81%, respectively, as compared to that under high DO conditions (DO = 5 ppm). Gene expression levels are compared between low and high DO conditions by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Several genes in the  (gapA and pykA), pentose phosphate (tktA), and early shikimate pathways for PhLA biosynthesis (aroF, aroG, and aroH) are upregulated under oxygen limitation. The results suggest that oxygen limitation affects metabolism in the shikimate pathway at both metabolic and transcriptional levels and that controlling the DO level is critical for enhanced production of a variety of aromatic compounds through the shikimate pathway.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the role of NAA regarding their intermediary metabolism remains poorly understood. Two hypotheses were proposed regarding the fate of aspartate after being released by de-acetylation: (1) aspartate is metabolized in the mitochondria of oligodendrocyte lineage cells; (2) aspartate is released to the medium. We report here that aspartoacylase mRNA expression increases when primary rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) differentiate into mature cells in culture. Moreover, characterising metabolic functions of acetyl coenzyme A and aspartate from NAA catabolism in mature oligodendrocyte cultures after 5 days using isotope-labelled glucose after 5-days of differentiation we found evidence of extensive NAA metabolism. Incubation with [1,6-C]glucose followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography analyses of cell extracts and media in the presence and absence of NAA established that the  moiety produced by hydrolysis of NAA does not enter mitochondrial metabolism in the form of acetyl coenzyme A. We also resolved the controversy concerning the possible release of aspartate to the medium: aspartate is not released to the medium by oligodendrocytes in amounts detectable by our methods. Therefore we propose that: aspartate released from NAA joins the cytosolic aspartate pool rapidly and takes part in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which transports reducing equivalents from  into the mitochondria for ATP production and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle at a slow rate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601271>Metabolic perturbations in mutants of glucose transporters and their applications in metabolite production in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Most microorganisms have evolved to maximize growth rate, with rapid consumption of carbon sources from the surroundings. However, fast growing phenotypes usually feature secretion of organic compounds. For example, E. coli mainly produced  in fast growing condition such as glucose rich and aerobic condition, which is troublesome for metabolic engineering because  causes acidification of surroundings, growth inhibition and decline of production yield. The overflow metabolism can be alleviated by reducing glucose uptake rate.As glucose transporters or their subunits were knocked out in E. coli, the growth and glucose uptake rates decreased and biomass yield was improved. Alteration of intracellular metabolism caused by the mutations was investigated with transcriptome analysis and C metabolic flux analysis (C MFA). Various transcriptional and metabolic perturbations were identified in the sugar transporter mutants. Transcription of genes related to , chemotaxis, and flagella synthesis was downregulated, and that of gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle, alternative transporters, quorum sensing, and stress induced proteins was upregulated in the sugar transporter mutants. The specific production yields of value-added compounds (enhanced green fluorescent protein, γ-aminobutyrate, lycopene) were improved significantly in the sugar transporter mutants.The elimination of sugar transporter resulted in alteration of global gene expression and redirection of carbon flux distribution, which was purposed to increase energy yield and recycle carbon sources. When the pathways for several valuable compounds were introduced to mutant strains, specific yield of them were highly improved. These results showed that controlling the sugar uptake rate is a good strategy for ameliorating metabolite production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29988548>Regulation of the Immune Response by the Inflammatory Metabolic Microenvironment in the Context of Allotransplantation.</a></h2><p>Antigen challenge induced by allotransplantation results in the activation of T and B cells, followed by their differentiation and proliferation to mount an effective immune response. Metabolic fitness has been shown to be crucial for supporting the major shift from quiescent to active immune cells and for tuning the immune response. Metabolic reprogramming includes regulation of the balance between  and mitochondrial respiration processes. Recent research has shed new light on the functions served by the end products of metabolism such as lactate, , and ATP. At enhanced local concentrations, these metabolites have complex effects in which they not only induce T and B cell responses, cell mobility, and cytokine secretion but also favor the resolution of inflammation by promoting regulatory functions. Such mechanisms are instrumental in the context of the immune response in transplantation, not only to protect the graft and/or eliminate cells targeting it but also to maintain cell homeostasis . Metabolic adaptation thus plays an instrumental role on the outcome of the cellular and humoral responses. This, of course, raises the possibility of drugs that would interfere in these metabolic pathways to control the immune response but also highlights the risk that some drugs may perturb this metabolism and cell homeostasis and be deleterious for graft outcome. This review focuses on how metabolic alterations of the local immune microenvironment regulate the immune response and the impact of metabolic manipulation in allotransplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27369806>Utilization of metabonomics to identify serum biomarkers in murine H22 hepatocarcinoma and deduce antitumor mechanism of Rhizoma Paridis saponins.</a></h2><p>Murine H22 hepatocarcinoma model is so popular to be used for the preclinical anticancer candidate's evaluation. However, the metabolic biomarkers of this model were not identified. Meanwhile, Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS) as natural products have been found to show strong antitumor activity, while its anti-cancer mechanism is not clear. To search for potential metabolite biomarkers of this model, serum metabonomics approach was applied to detect the variation of metabolite biomarkers and the related metabolism genes and signaling pathway were used to deduce the antitumor mechanisms of RPS. As a result, ten serum metabolites were identified in twenty-four mice including healthy mice, non-treated cancer mice, RPS-treated cancer mice and RPS-treated healthy mice. RPS significantly decreased tumor weight correlates to down-regulating lactate, , N-acetyl amino acid and glutamine signals (p < 0.05), which were marked metabolites screened according to the very important person (VIP), loading plot and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) tests. For the analysis of metabolic enzyme related genes, RPS reversed the aerobic  through activating tumor suppressor p53 and PTEN, and suppressed FASN to inhibit lipogenesis. What's more, RPS repressed Myc and GLS expression and decreased glutamine level. The regulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR and HIF-1α/Myc/Ras networks also participated in these metabolic changes. Taken together, RPS suppressed ATP product made the tumor growth slow, which indicated a good anti-cancer effect and new angle for understanding the mechanism of RPS. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the utility of (1)H NMR metabolic profiles taken together with tumor weight and viscera index was a promising screening tool for evaluating the antitumor effect of candidates. In addition, RPS was a potent anticancer agent through inhibiting cancer cellular metabolism to suppress proliferation in hepatoma H22 tumor murine, which promoted the application of RPS in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The eukaryotic Plasmodium falciparumFNT is vital for the malaria parasite by its ability to release the larger l-lactate substrate as the metabolic end product of anaerobic  in symport with protons preventing cytosolic acidification. However, the molecular basis for substrate discrimination by FNTs has remained unclear. Here, we identified a size-selective FNT substrate filter region around an invariant lysine at the bottom of the periplasmic/extracellular vestibule. The selectivity filter is reminiscent of the aromatic/arginine constriction of aquaporin water and solute channels regarding composition, location in the protein, and the size-selection principle. Bioinformatics support an adaptation of the eukaryotic FNT selectivity filter to accommodate larger physiologically relevant substrates. Mutations that affect the diameter at the filter site predictably modulated substrate selectivity. The shape of the vestibule immediately above the filter region further affects selectivity. This study indicates that eukaryotic FNTs evolved to transport larger mono-acid substrates, especially l-lactic acid as a product of energy metabolism.© 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28650429>-mediated novel survival strategy against drought in plants.</a></h2><p>Water deficit caused by global climate changes seriously endangers the survival of organisms and crop productivity, and increases environmental deterioration. Plants' resistance to drought involves global reprogramming of transcription, cellular metabolism, hormone signalling and chromatin modification. However, how these regulatory responses are coordinated via the various pathways, and the underlying mechanisms, are largely unknown. Herein, we report an essential drought-responsive network in which plants trigger a dynamic metabolic flux conversion from  into  synthesis to stimulate the jasmonate (JA) signalling pathway to confer drought tolerance. In Arabidopsis, the ON/OFF switching of this whole network is directly dependent on histone deacetylase HDA6. In addition, exogenous acetic acid promotes de novo JA synthesis and enrichment of histone H4 acetylation, which influences the priming of the JA signalling pathway for plant drought tolerance. This novel  function is evolutionarily conserved as a survival strategy against environmental changes in plants. Furthermore, the external application of acetic acid successfully enhanced the drought tolerance in Arabidopsis, rapeseed, maize, rice and wheat plants. Our findings highlight a radically new survival strategy that exploits an epigenetic switch of metabolic flux conversion and hormone signalling by which plants adapt to drought.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916421>Protective potential of Averrhoa bilimbi fruits in ameliorating the hepatic key enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Diabetes is a mutifactorial disease which leads to several complications. Currently available drug regimens for management of diabetes have certain drawbacks. Need for safer and effective medicines from natural sources having potent antidiabetic activity. Averrhoa bilimbi Linn. (Oxalidaceae) is a medicinal plant and is reported to possess hypoglycemic activity.To investigate the antidiabetic potential of Averrhoa bilimbi fruit extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.Diabetes was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (40mg/kg body weight). The diabetic rats were treated orally with ethyl  fraction of A. bilimbi fruits (ABE) (25mg/kg body weight) and metformin (100mg/kg body weight) by intragastric intubation for 60days. After 60days, the rats were sacrificed; blood, liver and pancreas were collected. Several indices such as blood glucose, plasma insulin, toxicity markers and the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes were assayed. The phytochemicals present in the ABE was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.ABE significantly (p<0.05) reduced the level of blood glucose and hepatic toxicity markers and increased plasma insulin in diabetic rats. ABE modulated the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, significantly increased the activities of hexokinase (59%) and pyruvate kinase (68%) and reduced the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase (32%) and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (20%). The histological studies of the pancreas also supported our findings. The results were compared with metformin, a standard oral hypoglycemic drug. GC-MS analysis of ABE revealed the presence of 11 chemical constituents in the extract.ABE exerts its antidiabetic effect by promoting glucose metabolism via  and inhibiting hepatic endogenous glucose production via gluconeogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This approach was applied to Xue-Sai-Tong injection (XST) to reveal the action mechanism based on the metabolic response in an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat model by analyzing NMR profile. Partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) was used to compare metabolic profiles of serum samples and revealed nine metabolites altered by I/R injury could be restored to normal status (sham-operated group) under the therapy of XST.

Activated α-Macroglobulin (αM) signals through tumor Cell Surface GRP78 (CS-GRP78) to regulate tumor cell proliferation through multiple signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the αM/CS-GRP78 axis regulates acetyl-CoA synthesis and thus functions as an epigenetic modulator by enhancing histone acetylation in cancer cells. αM/CS-GRP78 signaling induces and activates glucose-dependent ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) and promotes -dependent Acetyl-CoA Synthetase (ACSS1) expression by regulating AKT pathways to acetylate histones and other proteins. Further, we show that  itself regulates ACLY and ACSS1 expression through a feedback loop in an AKT-dependent manner.

We observed that both 10 and 30 μg/L Pb increased the volume of mucus in the gut. At phylum level, the abundance of α-Proteobacteria decreased significantly and the abundance of Firmicutes increased significantly in the gut when treated with 30 μg/L Pb for 7 days.

Proteins involved in ,  metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, TCA cycle, glyoxylate cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, respiration, transportation, and stress response were found to be upregulated in △faa1△faa4 [Acot5s] as compared to the wild type.

Modified or controlled atmospheres (MAs or CAs) with higher or lower concentrations of atmospheric gases, mainly oxygen (O), carbon dioxide (CO), ozone (O), and nitric oxide (NO), provide a cost-effective method to kill target pests and protect stored products. In this review, the most recent discoveries in the field of MAs are discussed, with a focus on pest control as well as current MA technologies. Although MAs have been used for more than 30 years in pest control and play a role in storage pest management, the specific mechanisms by which insects are affected by and adapt to low O (hypoxia) and high carbon CO (hypercapnia) are not completely understood. Insect tolerance to hypoxia/anoxia and hypercapnia involves a decrease in aerobic metabolism, including decreased NADPH enzyme activity, and subsequently, decreases in glutathione production and catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase activities, as well as increases in carboxyl esterase and phosphatase activities. In addition, hypoxia induces energy and nutrient production, and in adapted insects,  and pyruvate carboxylase fluxes are downregulated, accompanied with O consumption and  production. Consequently, genes encoding various signal transduction pathway components, including epidermal growth factor, insulin, Notch, and Toll/Imd signaling, are downregulated. We review the changes in insect energy and nutrient sources, metabolic enzymes, and molecular pathways in response to modified O, CO, NO, and O concentrations, as well as the role of MAs in pest control.

As a new robust non-conventional yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica attracts more and more attention due to its potential for industrial applications. Previously, we obtained a succinic acid-producing strain through gene deletion of succinic acid dehydrogenase subunit encoding gene Ylsdh5, resulting in the strain of PGC01003. However, the recombinant strain produced large amount of acetic acid due to imbalance between  and TCA cycle which hindered the efficient production of succinic acid. PDH bypass was interfered to decrease the overflow of acetic acid and produce succinic acid under natural pH. Acetic acid was reduced to 4.6 g/L through heterologous expression of acetyl coenzyme A synthase from Salmonella enteric, which was 75.4% of the control strain. Deletion of CoA-transferase gene Ylach1 eliminated  formation and improved succinic acid production, and the resulting strain produced as high as 7.0 g/L succinic acid. Our study provides foundation for further construction of efficient cell factory of succinic acid production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31523509>Genome-resolved insights into a novel  symbiont of the Wheat Stem Sawfly (.</a></h2><p>Arthropods often have obligate relationships with symbiotic microbes, and recent investigations have demonstrated that such host-microbe relationships could be exploited to suppress natural populations of vector carrying mosquitos. Strategies that target the interplay between agricultural pests and their symbionts could decrease the burden caused by agricultural pests; however, the lack of comprehensive genomic insights into naturally occurring microbial symbionts presents a significant bottleneck. Here we employed amplicon surveys, genome-resolved metagenomics, and scanning electron microscopy to investigate symbionts of the wheat stem sawfly (), a major pest that causes an estimated $350 million dollars or more in wheat yield losses in the northwestern United States annually. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of two major haplotypes and life stages of wheat stem sawfly, we show a novel  species is ever-present and predominant, with phylogenomic analyses placing it as a member of the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Using state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies we were able to reconstruct a 714 Kb, 72.7%-complete  genome, which represents just the second draft genome from the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Functional annotation of the  genome indicated carbohydrate-metabolism involved PTS-mediated import of glucose and fructose followed by  to lactate, , and propionoate. The bacterium also encoded biosynthetic pathways for essential vitamins B2, B3, and B9. We identified putative  virulence genes: cardiolipin and chitinase. These results identify a previously undescribed symbiosis between wheat stem sawfly and a novel  sp., availing insight into their molecular relationship, and may yield new opportunities for microbially-mediated pest control strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29553298>Neuronal glucose metabolism is impaired while astrocytic TCA cycling is unaffected at symptomatic stages in the hSOD1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Although alterations in energy metabolism are known in ALS, the specific mechanisms leading to energy deficit are not understood. We measured metabolite levels derived from injected [1-C]glucose and [1,2-C] (i.p.) in cerebral cortex and spinal cord extracts of wild type and hSOD1 mice at onset and mid disease stages using high-pressure liquid chromatography, H and C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Levels of spinal and cortical CNS total lactate, [3-C]lactate, total alanine and [3-C]alanine, but not cortical glucose and [1-C]glucose, were reduced mostly at mid stage indicating impaired . The [1-C]glucose-derived [4-C]glutamate, [4-C]glutamine and [2-C]GABA amounts were diminished at mid stage in cortex and both time points in spinal cord, suggesting decreased [3-C]pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle. Lack of changes in [1,2-C]-derived [4,5-C]glutamate, [4,5-C]glutamine and [1,2-C]GABA levels indicate unchanged astrocytic C- metabolism. Reduced levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine in CNS suggest compensatory breakdown to refill TCA cycle intermediate levels. Unlabelled, [2-C] and [4-C]GABA concentrations were decreased in spinal cord indicating that impaired glucose metabolism contributes to hyperexcitability and supporting the use of treatments which increase GABA amounts. In conclusion, CNS glucose metabolism is compromised, while astrocytic TCA cycling appears to be normal in the hSOD1 mouse model at symptomatic disease stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28527624>Understanding aerobic/anaerobic metabolism in Caldibacillus debilis through a comparison with model organisms.</a></h2><p>Caldibacillus debilis GB1 is a facultative anaerobe isolated from a thermophilic aero-tolerant cellulolytic enrichment culture. There is a lack of representative proteomes of facultative anaerobic thermophilic Bacillaceae, exploring aerobic/anaerobic expression. The C. debilis GB1 genome was sequenced and annotated, and the proteome characterized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions while grown on cellobiose. The draft sequence of C. debilis GB1 contains a 3,340,752 bp chromosome and a 5,386 bp plasmid distributed over 49 contigs. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry was used with Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ) to compare protein expression profiles, focusing on energy production and conversion pathways. Under aerobic conditions, proteins in  and pyruvate fermentation pathways were down-regulated. Simultaneously, proteins within the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase, the electron transport chain, and oxygen scavenging pathways showed increased amounts. Under anaerobic conditions, protein levels in fermentation pathways were consistent with the generated end-products: formate, , ethanol, lactate, and CO. Under aerobic conditions CO and  production was consistent with incomplete respiration. Through a direct comparison with gene expression profiles from Escherichia coli, we show that global regulation of core metabolism pathways is similar in thermophilic and mesophilic facultative anaerobes of the Phylum Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

We studied the effect of ghrelin in human Sertoli cells (hSCs) metabolic phenotype. For that, hSCs were exposed to increasing concentrations of ghrelin (20, 100 and 500 pM) mimicking the levels reported in obese, normal weight, and severely undernourished individuals. The metabolite production/consumption was determined. The protein levels of key -related transporters and enzymes were assessed. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured. Mitochondrial complexes protein levels and mitochondria membrane potential were also measured. We showed that hSCs express the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. At the concentration present in the plasma of normal weight men, ghrelin caused a decrease of glucose consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential in hSCs, though LDH activity and lactate production remained unchanged, illustrating an alteration of glycolytic flux efficiency. Exposure of hSCs to levels of ghrelin found in the plasma of severely undernourished individuals decreased pyruvate consumption and mitochondrial complex III protein expression. All concentrations of ghrelin decreased alanine and  production by hSCs. Notably, the effects of ghrelin levels found in severely undernourished individuals were more pronounced in hSCs metabolic phenotype highlighting the importance of a proper eating behavior to maintain male reproductive potential. In conclusion, ghrelin acts as an energy status sensor for hSCs in a dose-dependent manner, showing an inverse association with the production of lactate, thus controlling the nutritional support of spermatogenesis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In mammalian cells the central precursor for lipid biosynthesis, cytosolic acetyl CoA (Ac-CoA), is produced by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) from mitochondria-derived citrate or by acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) from . It has been reported that ACLY is the primary enzyme involved in making cytosolic Ac-CoA in cells with abundant nutrients. However, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we have shown that ACLY is not essential for HCMV growth and virally induced lipogenesis. Instead, we found that in HCMV-infected cells glucose carbon can be used for lipid synthesis by both ACLY and ACSS2 reactions. Further, the ACSS2 reaction can compensate for the loss of ACLY. However, in ACSS2-KO human fibroblasts both HCMV-induced lipogenesis from glucose and viral growth were sharply reduced. This reduction suggests that glucose-derived  is being used to synthesize cytosolic Ac-CoA by ACSS2. Previous studies have not established a mechanism for the production of  directly from glucose metabolism. Here we show that HCMV-infected cells produce more glucose-derived pyruvate, which can be converted to  through a nonenzymatic mechanism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678919>Investigating the Central Metabolism of Clostridium thermosuccinogenes.</a></h2><p> is a thermophilic anaerobic bacterium able to convert various carbohydrates to succinate and  as main fermentation products. Genomes of the four publicly available strains have been sequenced, and the genome of the type strain has been closed. The annotated genomes were used to reconstruct the central metabolism, and enzyme assays were used to validate annotations and to determine cofactor specificity. The genes were identified for the pathways to all fermentation products, as well as for the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway. Notably, a candidate transaldolase was lacking, and transcriptomics during growth on glucose versus that on xylose did not provide any leads to potential transaldolase genes or alternative pathways connecting the C with the C/C metabolism. Enzyme assays showed xylulokinase to prefer GTP over ATP, which could be of importance for engineering xylose utilization in related thermophilic species of industrial relevance. Furthermore, the gene responsible for malate dehydrogenase was identified via heterologous expression in  and subsequent assays with the cell extract, which has proven to be a simple and powerful method for the basal characterization of thermophilic enzymes.

A metabolomics based approach provides potential for noninvasive identification of biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis, as well as dissection of molecular pathways of pathophysiological conditions. Here, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HNMR) -based metabolomic approach was used to profile fecal metabolites of 68 CRC patients (stage I/II=20; stage III=25 and stage IV=23) and 32 healthy controls (HC). Pattern recognition through principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied on 1H-NMR processed data for dimension reduction. OPLS-DA revealed that each stage of CRC could be clearly distinguished from HC based on their metabolomic profiles. Successive analyses identified distinct disturbances to fecal metabolites of CRC patients at various stages, compared with those in cancer free controls, including reduced levels of , butyrate, propionate, glucose, glutamine, and elevated quantities of succinate, proline, alanine, dimethylglycine, valine, glutamate, leucine, isoleucine and lactate. These altered fecal metabolites potentially involved in the disruption of normal bacterial ecology, malabsorption of nutrients, increased  and glutaminolysis. Our findings revealed that the fecal metabolic profiles of healthy controls can be distinguished from CRC patients, even in the early stage (stage I/II), highlighting the potential utility of NMR-based fecal metabolomics fingerprinting as predictors of earlier diagnosis in CRC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529131>Deletion of four genes in Escherichia coli enables preferential consumption of xylose and secretion of glucose.</a></h2><p>Overcoming carbon catabolite repression presents a significant challenge, largely due to the complex regulatory networks governing substrate catabolism, even in microbial cells. In this work, we have engineered an E. coli strain, which we have named X2G, that not only exhibits a reversed substrate preference for xylose over glucose, but also demonstrates an unusual ability to produce significant amounts of glucose. We obtained this non-intuitive phenotype by deleting four genes in upper central metabolism: ptsI, glk, pfkA, and zwf, which respectively encode Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system, glucokinase, the dominant isozyme of phosphofructokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The deletion of ptsI and glk blocks glucose uptake in E. coli, while the deletion of pfkA and zwf prevents the reassimilation of carbons through  and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, respectively. Our strain X2G is capable of converting 34% of the carbon it takes up as xylose into exported glucose. This corresponds to a glucose production rate of 1.4 ± 0.3 mmol/g/h at a specific growth rate of 0.25 ± 0.03 h, or about 1.8 ± 0.1 mM of glucose accumulated for every unit increase in OD. Despite a 22% decrease in xylose uptake rate, a 33% decrease in biomass yield, and a 52% decrease in  production rate relative to the wild-type, the intracellular flux profile and cofactor allocation of X2G remain largely unperturbed, as elucidated through C-metabolic flux analysis. Further quantification of the pool sizes of key intracellular metabolites revealed that glucose secretion by X2G is likely driven by the substantial accumulation of intracellular glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, glucose and fructose at levels greater than 20x of that in wild-type E. coli. Combined, our results shed light on the flexibility of central metabolism, and the opportunities this affords for producing value-added pentose- and hexose-derived products from lignocellulosic feedstocks.Copyright © 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Understanding mechanisms how organism responds to ischemia at global level is essential for the prevention and ischemic patient's treatment. In this study, we used a global cerebral ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion as an established animal model for ischemic stroke to investigate metabolic changes after 24 h reperfusion, when transitions occur due to the onset of delayed neuronal death. We also focused on the endogenous phenomenon known as ischemic tolerance by the pre-ischemic treatment. The experiments were carried out on blood plasma samples as easily available and metabolically reflecting the overall changes in injured organism. Our results imply that disturbed  pathway, as a consequence of ischemic injury, leads to the increased level of ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate) along with increased utilization of triacylglycerols in plasma of ischemic and ischemically preconditioned rats. Complementary to, a decreased level of glycolytic intermediates (lactate, pyruvate, ) with increased level of glucose was found in ischemic and preconditioned animals. The protective effect of ischemic preconditioning on metabolome recovery was demonstrated by significantly increased level of creatine compared to ischemic, non-preconditioned rats. We also document that acetoacetate, pyruvate, lactate, and leucine have the best discriminatory power between ischemic and control plasma. Conclusively, our results provide evidence that NMR spectra analysis can identify specific group of metabolites present in plasma with the capability for discrimination between individual groups of animals.

The patients were naive to ARSi treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone  and were referred during documented disease progression. Image-directed biopsy determined the presence or absence of prostate cancer at positive imaging sites.PET/CT imaging was performed with [18F]-FDHT and [18F]-FDG; select individual lesions were biopsied to correlate imaging phenotype with histologic findings.All metabolically active lesions were interpreted as [18F]-FDHT-positive (AR1) or [18F]-FDHT-negative (AR0) and as [18F]-FDG-positive (Glyc1) or [18F]-FDG-negative (Glyc0). Correlation was performed with overall survival for both individual lesion imaging phenotype as well as patient-specific imaging phenotype.The mean (SD) age of the 133 patients was 68 (8.6) years. Imaging phenotypes of 2405 PET/CT-positive lesions (median, 12.0 per patient) included 1713 (71.2%) AR1Glyc1, 386 (16.0%) AR1Glyc0, and 306 (12.7%) AR0Glyc1. On multivariate analysis, each phenotype had an independent negative impact effect on survival, most pronounced for AR0Glyc1 lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16; P < .001), followed by AR1Glyc1 lesions (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06; P < .001) and AR1Glyc0 lesions (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; P = .048). When sorted by lesion type, 4 patient-specific groups emerged: (1) concordant, with all AR1Glyc1 (34 patients [25.6%]); (2) AR predominant, with AR1Glyc1 and varying numbers of AR1Glyc0 (33 [24.8%]); (3) Glyc predominant, with AR1Glyc1 and varying numbers of AR0Glyc1 (40 [30.1%]); and (4) mixed, with AR1Glyc1 plus a mixture of varying numbers of AR1Glyc0 and AR0Glyc1 (26 [19.5%]).Heterogeneity of PET/CT imaging phenotype has clinical relevance on a lesion and individual patient level.

However, the metabolic pathway of starch-to-TAG conversion remains elusive because an enzyme that affects the starch degradation is unknown. Here, we isolated a new class of mutant bgal1, which expressed an overaccumulation of starch granules and defective photosynthetic growth. The bgal1 was a null mutant of a previously uncharacterized β-galactosidase-like gene (Cre02.g119700), which decreased total β-galactosidase activity 40% of the wild type. Upon nitrogen starvation, the bgal1 mutant showed decreased TAG accumulation mainly due to the reduced flux of de novo TAG biosynthesis evidenced by increased unsaturation of fatty acid composition in TAG and reduced TAG accumulation by additional supplementation of  to the culture media. Metabolomic analysis of the bgal1 mutant showed significantly reduced levels of metabolites following the hydrolysis of starch and substrates for TAG accumulation, whereas metabolites in TCA cycle were unaffected. Upon nitrogen starvation, while levels of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and acetyl-CoA remained lower, most of the other metabolites in  were increased but those in the TCA cycle were decreased, supporting TAG accumulation. We suggest that BGAL1 may be involved in the degradation of starch, which affects TAG accumulation in nitrogen-starved C. reinhardtii.

They depend on the mass transfer and fluid dynamics in the reactor, the feeding strategy, the cell-specific substrate uptake parameters, and the cell density. As high cell densities are only obtained at low specific growth rates, it is necessary to investigate the cellular responses to oscillations in particular under such conditions, an issue which is mostly neglected. Instead, the feed oscillations are often started directly after the batch phase, when the specific growth rate is close to the maximum. We show here that the cultivation mode before oscillations are started has a tremendous effect on the metabolic responses. In difference to cells, which were pre-grown under batch conditions at a high growth rate, Escherichia coli cells that were pre-grown under glucose limitation at a low growth rate accumulate short-chain fatty acids (, lactate, succinate) and -related amino acids to a higher extent in a two-compartment scale-down bioreactor. Thus, cells which enter oscillations from a lower specific growth rate seem to react more sensitive to oscillations than cells that are subjected to oscillations directly after a batch phase. These results are interesting in designing reliable scale-down systems, which better reflect large-scale bioprocesses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775470>Probing the metabolic network in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei using untargeted metabolomics with stable isotope labelled glucose.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics coupled with heavy-atom isotope-labelled glucose has been used to probe the metabolic pathways active in cultured bloodstream form trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms and regulatory actions underlying have not been fully elucidated. As a family of NAD dependent protein modifying enzymes, sirtuins (SIRT1-SIRT7) have multiple catalytic functions such as deacetylase, desuccinylase, demalonylase, demyristoylase, depalmitoylase, and/or mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase.

The results demonstrated that C. subellipsoidea subjected to the combination feeding of G (20 g/L) and SA (12 g/L) achieved the favorable biomass (5.22 g/L) and lipid content (52.16%). The resulting lipid productivity (388.96 mg/L/day) was 1.33- to 7.60-fold more than those of sole G or SA as well as other combinations of G and SA. Even though the total fatty acids of C. subellipsoidea cells treated with the optimal combination of G and SA showed no noticeable increment in comparison with sole G or SA, the proportion of monounsaturated C18:1 (over 48.69%) and the content of C18:3 (< 12%) were commendable in high-quality algal biodiesel production. Further, such fascinating lipid accumulation in C. subellipsoidea cells treated with G combining with SA might be attributed to that G promoted  as well as SA activated glyoxylate shunt and TCA cycle to synergistically provide sufficient acetyl-CoA precursors for lipid accumulation.

However, glucose is absolutely indispensable for normal development and recent studies have shed light on , the pentose phosphate pathway and metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons in the 7-day-old rat brain. Appropriately (13)C labeled glucose was used to distinguish between  and the pentose phosphate pathway during development. Experiments using (13)C labeled  provided insight into the GABA-glutamate-glutamine cycle between astrocytes and neurons. It could be shown that in the neonatal brain the part of this cycle that transfers glutamine from astrocytes to neurons is operating efficiently while, in contrast, little glutamate is shuttled from neurons to astrocytes. This lack of glutamate for glutamine synthesis is compensated for by anaplerosis via increased pyruvate carboxylation relative to that in the adult brain. Furthermore, compared to adults, relatively more glucose is prioritized to the pentose phosphate pathway than  and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. The reported developmental differences in glucose metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis may determine the ability of the brain at various ages to resist excitotoxic insults such as hypoxia-ischemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The protective role of arjunolic acid (AA; 2,3,23-trihydroxy olean-12-en-28-oic acid) is studied in the modulation of neutrophil functions in vitro by measuring the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Neutrophils were isolated from normal and acute MI mice to find out the efficacy of AA in reducing oxidative stress. Stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol-12-myristate-13- (PMA) resulted in an oxidative burst of superoxide anion (O2(-)) and enhanced release of lysosomal enzymes. The treatment of neutrophils with PMA induced phosphorylation of Ser345 on p47(phox), a cytosolic component of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, we observed activated ERK induced phosphorylation of Ser345 in MI neutrophils. Treatment with AA significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of P47(phox) and ERK in the stimulated controls and MI neutrophils. Oxidative phosphorylation activities in MI cells were lower than in control, while the  rates were elevated in MI cells compared to the control. In addition, we observed AA decreased intracellular oxidative stress and reduced the levels of O2(-) in neutrophils. This study therefore identifies targets for AA in activated neutrophils mediated by the MAPK pathway on p47(phox) involved in ROS generation.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094595>Hypoxia in astrocytic tumors and implications for therapy.</a></h2><p>Glioblastoma (GBM, Grade IV astrocytoma) is the most common and most aggressive of the primary malignant brain tumors in adults.

Here, we explored the role of the Csr system in the glucose- transition as a model of the -to-gluconeogenesis switch. Mutations in the Csr system influence the reorganization of gene expression after glucose exhaustion and disturb the timing of  reconsumption after glucose exhaustion. Analysis of metabolite concentrations during the transition revealed that the Csr system has a major effect on the energy levels of the cells after glucose exhaustion. This influence was demonstrated to result directly from the effect of the Csr system on glycogen accumulation. Mutation in glycogen metabolism was also demonstrated to hinder metabolic adaptation after glucose exhaustion because of insufficient energy. This work explains how the Csr system influences  fitness during the -gluconeogenesis switch and demonstrates the role of glycogen in maintenance of the energy charge during metabolic adaptation. Glycogen is a polysaccharide and the main storage form of glucose from bacteria such as  to yeasts and mammals. Although its function as a sugar reserve in mammals is well documented, the role of glycogen in bacteria is not as clear. By studying the role of posttranscriptional regulation during metabolic adaptation, for the first time, we demonstrate the role of sugar reserve played by glycogen in  Indeed, glycogen not only makes it possible to maintain sufficient energy during metabolic transitions but is also the key component in the capacity of cells to resume growth. Since the essential posttranscriptional regulatory system Csr is a major regulator of glycogen accumulation, this work also sheds light on the central role of posttranscriptional regulation in metabolic adaptation.Copyright © 2017 Morin et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766116>Examining  glycolytic pathways, catabolite repression, and metabolite channeling using Δ mutants.</a></h2><p> breakdowns glucose into essential building blocks and ATP/NAD(P)H for the cell, occupying a central role in its growth and bio-production. Among glycolytic pathways, the Entner Doudoroff pathway (EDP) is a more thermodynamically favorable pathway with fewer enzymatic steps than either the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMPP) or the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). However,  do not use their native EDP for glucose metabolism.Overexpression of  and  in  to enhance EDP activity resulted in only a small shift in the flux directed through the EDP (~20 % of  flux).

The downregulation of EMPP via the  deletion significantly decreased the growth rate, while EDP overexpression in the Δ mutant failed to improve its growth rates due to metabolic burden. However, the reorganization of  glycolytic strategies did reduce glucose catabolite repression. The Δ mutant in glucose medium was able to cometabolize  via the citric acid cycle and gluconeogenesis, while EDP overexpression in the Δ mutant repressed  flux toward gluconeogenesis. Moreover, C-pulse experiments in the Δ mutants showed unsequential labeling dynamics in  intermediates, possibly suggesting metabolite channeling (metabolites in  are pass from enzyme to enzyme without fully equilibrating within the cytosol medium).We engineered  to redistribute its native glycolytic flux. The replacement of EMPP by EDP did not improve  glucose utilization or biomass growth, but alleviated catabolite repression. More importantly, our results supported the hypothesis of channeling in the glycolytic pathways, a potentially overlooked mechanism for regulating glucose catabolism and coutilization of other substrates.

Under such conditions, cells exhibit a reduced capacity for photosynthesis but a higher growth rate, compared to phototrophic cultures. Better understanding of the down regulation of photosynthesis would enable more efficient conversion of carbon into valuable products like biofuels. In this study, Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) have been used with a genome scale model of C. reinhardtii to examine changes in intracellular flux distribution in order to explain their changing physiology. Additionally, a reaction essentiality analysis was performed to identify which reaction subsets are essential for a given growth condition. Our results suggest that exogenous  feeds into a modified tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which bypasses the CO2 evolution steps, explaining increases in biomass, consistent with experimental data. In addition, reactions of the oxidative pentose phosphate and  pathways, inactive under phototrophic conditions, show substantial flux under mixotrophic conditions. Importantly,  addition leads to an increased flux through cyclic electron flow (CEF), but results in a repression of CO2 fixation via Rubisco, explaining the down regulation of photosynthesis. However, although CEF enhances growth on , it is not essential-impairment of CEF results in alternative metabolic pathways being increased.

The parasites release two moles of lactic acid per mole of glucose as the anaerobic end product. However, the molecular identity of the Plasmodium lactate transporter is unknown. Here we show that a member of the microbial formate-nitrite transporter family, PfFNT, acts as a lactate/proton symporter in Plasmodium falciparum. Besides L-lactate, PfFNT transports physiologically relevant D-lactate, as well as pyruvate,  and formate, and is inhibited by the antiplasmodial compounds phloretin, furosemide and cinnamate derivatives, but not by p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS). Our data on PfFNT monocarboxylate transport are consistent with those obtained with living parasites.

The impact of different harvesting protocols (trypsinization and scraping) on recovery of intracellular metabolites was then assessed. The similarity and variation in the cell metabolome was investigated using H NMR metabolic profiling modeled using multivariate data analysis. The characterization and quantification of metabolites was performed to determine the passage-related and harvesting-dependent effects on impacted metabolic networks. The trypsinized RAW cells from lower passages gave higher intensities of most identified metabolites, including asparagine, serine and tryptophan. Principal component analysis revealed variation between cells from different passages and harvesting methods, as indicated by the formation of clusters in score plot. Analysis of S-plots revealed metabolites that acted as biomarkers in discriminating cells from different passages including , serine, lactate and choline. Meanwhile lactate, glutamine and pyruvate served as biomarkers for differentiating trypsinized and scraped cells. In passage-dependent effects,  and TCA cycle were influential, whereas glycerophospholipid metabolism was affected by the harvesting method. Overall, it is proposed that typsinized RAW cells from lower passage numbers are more appropriate when conducting experiments related to NMR metabolomics.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, glucose uptake and utilization is important for adipose tissue development in beef cattle, and increasing glucose utilization in intramuscular adipose tissue can increase carcass quality. Research from the 1980s demonstrated a lack of insulin sensitivity in isolated bovine adipocytes and adipose tissue explants incubated in vitro. Insulin did not stimulate glucose or  incorporation into fatty acids, nor did it increase concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in bovine adipose tissue incubated with exogenous glucose. Specific binding of [I] iodoinsulin and insulin degradation in bovine isolated adipocytes was low to non-detectable. These early studies indicated that insulin-dependent receptor-mediated signaling was less important in bovine adipose tissue than in adipose tissues of humans, swine, or laboratory species. More recent research demonstrated that glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) expression in muscle and adipose tissue declines markedly after birth in calves, indicating the development of insulin resistance as cattle transition from suckling to functional ruminants. Insulin resistance is important in dairy cattle, causing ketosis and fatty liver. Consistent with this, subcutaneous adipose tissue expression decreases 50% following parturition in dairy cattle, although expression of genes associated with insulin responsiveness (, , and ) is up-regulated by 21 d postpartum. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance in beef and dairy cattle would increase animal health and thereby improve productivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29154733>Metabolomic analysis of alterations in lipid oxidation, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in dairy goats caused by exposure to Aflotoxin B1.</a></h2><p>The purposes of this study were to investigate the systemic and characteristic metabolites in the serum of dairy goats induced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure and to further understand the endogenous metabolic alterations induced by it. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomic approach was used to analyse the metabolic alterations in dairy goats that were induced by low doses of AFB1 (50 µg/kg DM). We found that AFB1 exposure caused significant elevations of glucose, citrate, , acetoacetate, betaine, and glycine yet caused reductions of lactate, ketone bodies (, β-hydroxybutyrate), amino acids (citrulline, leucine/isoleucine, valine, creatine) and cell membrane structures (choline, lipoprotein, N-acetyl glycoproteins) in the serum. These data indicated that AFB1 caused endogenous metabolic changes in various metabolic pathways, including cell membrane-associated metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, , lipids, and amino acid metabolism.

HD patients exhibit various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction within neurons and peripheral tissues. Cardiolipin (Ptd2Gro) is a polyglycerophospholipid found exclusively in mitochondria and is important for maintaining mitochondrial function. We examined if altered Ptd2Gro metabolism was involved in the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with HD. Mitochondrial basal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, ATP coupling efficiency and rate of  were markedly diminished in Epstein-Barr virus transformed HD lymphoblasts compared to controls (CTRL). Mitochondrial supercomplex formation and Complex I activity within these supercomplexes did not vary between HD patients with different length of CAG repeats and appeared unaltered compared to CTRL. In contrast, in vitro Complex I enzyme activity in mitochondrial enriched samples was reduced in HD lymphoblasts compared to CTRL. The total cellular pool size of Ptd2Gro and its synthesis/remodeling from [(3)H]/[(14)C]oleate were unaltered in HD lymphoblasts compared to CTRL. In addition, the molecular species of Ptd2Gro were essentially unaltered in HD lymphoblasts compared to CTRL. We conclude that compared to CTRL lymphoblasts, HD lymphoblasts display impaired mitochondrial basal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, ATP coupling efficiency and rate of  with any pathological CAG repeat length, but this is not due to alterations in Ptd2Gro metabolism. We suggest that HD patient lymphoblasts may be a useful model to study defective energy metabolism that does not involve alterations in Ptd2Gro metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018546>Physiological, biomass elemental composition and proteomic analyses of Escherichia coli ammonium-limited chemostat growth, and comparison with iron- and glucose-limited chemostat growth.</a></h2><p>Escherichia coli physiological, biomass elemental composition and proteome acclimations to ammonium-limited chemostat growth were measured at four levels of nutrient scarcity controlled via chemostat dilution rate. These data were compared with published iron- and glucose-limited growth data collected from the same strain and at the same dilution rates to quantify general and nutrient-specific responses. Severe nutrient scarcity resulted in an overflow metabolism with differing organic byproduct profiles based on limiting nutrient and dilution rate. Ammonium-limited cultures secreted up to 35% of the metabolized glucose carbon as organic byproducts with  representing the largest fraction; in comparison, iron-limited cultures secreted up to 70 % of the metabolized glucose carbon as lactate, and glucose-limited cultures secreted up to 4% of the metabolized glucose carbon as formate. Biomass elemental composition differed with nutrient limitation; biomass from ammonium-limited cultures had a lower nitrogen content than biomass from either iron- or glucose-limited cultures. Proteomic analysis of central metabolism enzymes revealed that ammonium- and iron-limited cultures had a lower abundance of key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes and higher abundance of key  enzymes compared with glucose-limited cultures. The overall results are largely consistent with cellular economics concepts, including metabolic tradeoff theory where the limiting nutrient is invested into essential pathways such as  instead of higher ATP-yielding, but non-essential, pathways such as the TCA cycle.

For this purpose, it was required to modify previous metabolic models applied to lab-scale systems by incorporating the anaerobic utilisation of the TCA cycle and the aerobic maintenance processes based on sequential utilisation of polyhydroxyalkanoates, followed by glycogen and polyphosphate. The abundance of the PAO and GAO populations quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation served as the initial conditions of each biomass fraction, whereby the models were able to describe accurately the experimental data. The kinetic rates were found to change among the four different WWTPs studied or even in the same plant during different seasons, either suggesting the presence of additional PAO or GAO organisms, or varying microbial activities for the same organisms. Nevertheless, these variations in kinetic rates were largely found to be proportional to the difference in  uptake rate, suggesting a viable means of calibrating the metabolic model. The application of the metabolic model to full-scale sludge also revealed that different Accumulibacter clades likely possess different  uptake mechanisms, as a correlation was observed between the energetic requirement for  transport across the cell membrane with the diversity of Accumulibacter present. Using the model as a predictive tool, it was shown that lower  concentrations in the feed as well as longer aerobic retention times favour the dominance of the TCA metabolism over , which could explain why the anaerobic TCA pathway seems to be more relevant in full-scale WWTPs than in lab-scale systems.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Inhibition of vital transport processes is an unexploited means for developing novel antimalarial drugs. The recently discovered plasmodial lactate transporter, PfFNT, represents a promising new drug target since the parasite's energy generation by anaerobic  depends on the rapid secretion of lactate. Yet, membrane proteins, in particular those of malaria parasites, are notoriously difficult to produce and purify in the native, functional form hampering crystallization and biophysical studies. Here, we show synthesis of milligram quantities of correctly folded PfFNT in a cell-free system. Solubilized PfFNT maintained its oligomeric, largely SDS-resistant quaternary structure and appears suitable for setting up crystallization trials. After reconstitution into proteoliposomes, PfFNT was functional as a transporter for formate, , and lactate as determined by a light-scattering assay. Analysis of the accessibility of a protease cleavage site at the N-terminus revealed an even outside-in orientation of the total proteoliposomal PfFNT population that may be due to membrane curvature restrictions. Contrary to previous studies using heterologous expression in cell systems with oppositely oriented PfFNT, the proteoliposomes eventually allow for biophysical transport studies in the native, physiological direction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

RCB15 is a benzimidazole derivative that may be used against such diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of RCB15 on the alternative energetic pathways of Taenia crassiceps cysticerci. The cysticerci were in vitro exposed to albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO) or RCB15 at different concentrations during 24h. The cysticerci extract and the culture medium were analyzed through spectrophotometry and high performance liquid chromatography as to detect glucose, urea, creatinine and organic acids of the energetic metabolism. The drugs did not influence the protein catabolism. Fatty acids oxidation was enhanced through significantly higher  concentrations in the groups treated with RCB15 and ABZSO. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were decreased which indicates the use of fatty acids towards acetyl-CoA synthesis. There was a decrease in glucose uptake and pyruvate concentrations. The absence of lactate indicates the use of pyruvate in gluconeogenesis. Therefore it is possible to conclude that RCB15 enhanced the alternative energetic pathways of cysticerci in vitro exposed to different concentration, with emphasis on the fatty acids catabolism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Proliferation assays and a principle component analysis revealed a stringent difference between the fast and slow growing melanoma cells. Moreover, upon inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, glutamic acid and alanine were identified as the central difference in the conditional media. A supplementation of the media with glutamic acid and the combination with alanine significantly accelerated the proliferation, migration and invasion of early stage melanoma cells, but not metastatic cells.

Lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) can induce SC toxicity. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Pb and Cd alter lactate transport and production by SCs. Mouse SC line (15P-1 cells) were cultured in the absence and presence of lead  (PbAc, 1, 10, 20 and 30 μM) or cadmium chloride (CdCl, 0.5, 5, 10 and 15 μM) for 24 h. The results showed that PbAc exposure significantly decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and mRNA level, intracellular and extracellular lactate, and MCT4 and CD147 protein levels but increased MCT4 and CD147 mRNA levels. However, PbAc did not alter the glucose uptake, glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1) and 3 (GLUT3) mRNA expression of SCs. Thus, PbAc mainly decreased lactate production by inhibiting LDH activity. In CdCl-treated SCs, intracellular lactate content increased but extracellular lactate content decreased significantly, P < .05. The glucose uptake, LDH activity, and mRNA expression of GLUT1, GLUT3 and LDH, all significantly increased. But the mRNA and protein levels of MCT4 and CD147 significantly decreased. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of co-localizations of the MCT4-CD147 complex dose-dependently decreased in the cell membrane. Thus, CdCl may reduce lactate export by suppressing MCT4 and CD147 expression. These results suggest that PbAc and CdCl disrupt lactate production and transport in mouse SCs by disturbing  or inhibiting MCT4-CD147 transporter expression and co-localizations.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the latter case, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is responsible for pyruvate transport into mitochondrial matrix space. During chronological aging, yeast cells which lack the major structural subunit Mpc1 display a reduced lifespan accompanied by an age-dependent loss of autophagy. Here, we show that the impairment of pyruvate import into mitochondria linked to Mpc1 loss is compensated by a flux redirection of TCA cycle intermediates through the malic enzyme-dependent alternative route. In such a way, the TCA cycle operates in a "branched" fashion to generate pyruvate and is depleted of intermediates. Mutant cells cope with this depletion by increasing the activity of glyoxylate cycle and of the pathway which provides the nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA. Moreover, cellular respiration decreases and ROS accumulate in the mitochondria which, in turn, undergo severe damage. These acquired traits in concert with the reduced autophagy restrict cell survival of the mpc1∆ mutant during chronological aging. Conversely, the activation of the carnitine shuttle by supplying acetyl-CoA to the mitochondria is sufficient to abrogate the short-lived phenotype of the mutant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374702>Intense Pulsed Light: Friend or Foe?

In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying IPL application in the skin, we used an animal model of carcinogenesis obtained by chemical induction with 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- (TPA).Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were administered DMBA and/or TPA and treated with IPL. Skin was evaluated by histopathology and 2DE-blot-MS/MS analysis.Our data evidenced an inflammatory response and a metabolic remodeling of skin towards a glycolytic phenotype after chronic exposure to IPL, which was accomplished by increased oxidative stress and susceptibility to apoptosis. These alterations induced by IPL were more notorious in the DMBA sensitized skin. Keratins and metabolic proteins seem to be the more susceptible to oxidative modifications that might result in loss of function, contributing for the histological changes observed in treated skin.Data highlight the deleterious impact of IPL on skin phenotype, which justifies the need for more experimental studies in order to increase our understanding of the IPL long-term safety.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

After 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction, serum d-lactate levels reduced by 50% (P < 0.0001), and changes in d-lactate correlated with both changes in DNL-AUC and measures of insulin sensitivity.Baseline correlation of d-lactate with DNL and measures of insulin sensitivity and reduction in d-lactate after 9 days of isocaloric fructose restriction suggest that DNL and nonenzymatic glycation are functionally linked via intermediary  in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome and point to fructose as a key dietary substrate that drives both pathways.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26383902>Chemical scavenging of post-consumed clothes.</a></h2><p>Aiming toward the rectification of fiber grade PET waste accumulation as well as recycling and providing a technically viable route leading to preservation of the natural resources and environment, the post consumed polyester clothes were chemically recycled.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by the three PDHKs PkpA, PkpB and PkpC in carbon source utilization in the reference filamentous fungus , in order to unravel regulatory mechanisms which could prove useful for fungal biotechnological and biomedical applications. PkpA and PkpB were shown to be mitochondrial whereas PkpC localized to the mitochondria in a carbon source-dependent manner. Only PkpA was shown to regulate PDH activity. In the presence of glucose, deletion of  and  resulted in reduced glucose utilization, which affected carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and hydrolytic enzyme secretion, due to de-regulated  and TCA cycle enzyme activities. Furthermore, PkpC was shown to be required for the correct metabolic utilization of cellulose and . PkpC negatively regulated the activity of the glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase (ICL), required for  metabolism. In summary, this study identified PDHKs important for the regulation of central carbon metabolism in the presence of different carbon sources, with effects on the secretion of biotechnologically important enzymes and carbon source-related growth. This work demonstrates how central carbon metabolism can affect a variety of fungal traits and lays a basis for further investigation into these characteristics with potential interest for different applications.Copyright © 2018 Ries et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28550062>Engineering of the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis for Chitin-Dependent Hydrogen Production.</a></h2><p> is a hyperthermophilic archaeon that harbors a complete set of genes for chitin degradation to fructose 6-phosphate. However, wild-type  KOD1 does not display growth on chitin. In this study, we developed a  strain that can grow on chitin via genetic and adaptive engineering. First, a chitinase overproduction strain (KC01) was constructed by replacing the chitinase gene promoter with a strong promoter from the cell surface glycoprotein gene, resulting in increased degradation of swollen chitin and accumulation of -,'-diacetylchitobiose in the medium. To enhance -,'-diacetylchitobiose assimilation in KC01, genes encoding diacetylchitobiose deacetylase, exo-β-d-glucosaminidase, and glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase were also overexpressed to obtain strain KC04. To strengthen the glycolytic flux of KC04, the gene encoding Tgr (transcriptional repressor of glycolytic genes) was disrupted to obtain strain KC04Δt. In both KC04 and KC04Δt strains, degradation of swollen chitin was further enhanced. In the culture broth of these strains, the accumulation of glucosamine was observed. KC04Δt was repeatedly inoculated in a swollen-chitin-containing medium for 13 cultures. This adaptive engineering strategy resulted in the isolation of a strain (KC04ΔtM1) that showed almost complete degradation of 0.4% (wt/vol) swollen chitin after 90 h. The strain produced high levels of  and ammonium in the culture medium, and, moreover, molecular hydrogen was generated. This strongly suggests that strain KC04ΔtM1 has acquired the ability to convert chitin to fructose 6-phosphate via deacetylation and deamination and further convert fructose 6-phosphate to  via  coupled to hydrogen generation. Chitin is a linear homopolymer of β-1,4-linked -acetylglucosamine and is the second most abundant biomass next to cellulose. Compared to the wealth of research focused on the microbial degradation and conversion of cellulose, studies addressing microbial chitin utilization are still limited. In this study, using the hyperthermophilic archaeon  as a host, we have constructed a strain that displays chitin-dependent hydrogen generation. The apparent hydrogen yield per unit of sugar consumed was slightly higher with swollen chitin than with starch. As gene manipulation in  is relatively simple, the strain constructed in this study can also be used as a parent strain for the development and expansion of chitin-dependent biorefinery, in addition to its capacity to produce hydrogen.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113318>Follicular metabolic changes and effects on oocyte quality in polycystic ovary syndrome patients.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common complex and heterogeneous disorder, affecting up to 10% women at reproductive age.

Glucose is metabolized through fermentative , producing ethanol as its main end-product as well as some . Amoebal  markedly differs from the typical Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway present in human cells: (i) by the use of inorganic pyrophosphate, instead of ATP, as the high-energy phospho group donor; (ii) with one exception, the pathway enzymes can catalyze reversible reactions under physiological conditions; (iii) there is no allosteric regulation and sigmoidal kinetic behavior of key enzymes; and (iv) the presence of some glycolytic and fermentation enzymes similar to those of anaerobic bacteria. These peculiarities bring about alternative mechanisms of control and regulation of the PPi-dependent fermentative  in the parasite in comparison to the ATP-dependent and allosterically regulated  in many other eukaryotic cells. In this review, the current knowledge of the carbohydrate metabolism enzymes in E. histolytica is analyzed. Thermodynamics and stoichiometric analyses indicate 2 to 3.5 ATP yield per glucose metabolized, instead of the often presumed 5 ATP/glucose ratio. PPi derived from anabolism seems insufficient for PPi-; hence, alternative ways of PPi supply are also discussed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of control and regulation of the E. histolytica carbohydrate metabolism, analyzed by applying integral and systemic approaches such as Metabolic Control Analysis and kinetic modeling, contribute to unveiling alternative and promising drug targets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed 112 IDH1 wild-type (IDH1WT) versus 399 IDH1MUT low-grade glioma and 157 IDH1WT versus 9 IDH1MUT glioblastoma samples. In both glioma types, IDH1WT was associated with high expression levels of genes encoding enzymes that are involved in  and  anaplerosis, whereas IDH1MUT glioma overexpress genes encoding enzymes that are involved in the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In vitro, we observed that IDH1MUT cancer cells have a higher basal respiration compared to IDH1WT cancer cells and inhibition of the IDH1MUT shifts the metabolism by decreasing oxygen consumption and increasing . Our findings indicate that IDH1WT glioma have a typical Warburg phenotype whereas in IDH1MUT glioma the TCA cycle, rather than glycolytic lactate production, is the predominant metabolic pathway. Our data further suggest that the TCA in IDH1MUT glioma is driven by lactate and glutamate anaplerosis to facilitate production of α-KG, and ultimately D-2-HG.

In this study, effect of vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and  on antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor is investigated. IC  value of vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and  was recorded as 5, 11.3 and 115 mM, respectively. Vanillin was found as a very effective molecule, and it completely abolished antibiotic (undecylprodigiosin and actinorhodin) production at 1 mM concentration, while 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and  have little effect. Microscopic analysis with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that addition of vanillin inhibits mycelia formation and increases differentiation of S. coelicolor cells. Vanillin increases expression of genes responsible for sporulation (ssgA) and decreases expression of antibiotic transcriptional regulator (redD and actII-orf4), while it has no effect on genes related to the mycelia formation (bldA and bldN) and quorum sensing (scbA and scbR).

The above findings seem to relate to or indicate a shift to non-oxidative metabolic pathways in cancer. In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells may lose the ability to utilize aerobic respiration due to either defective mitochondria or hypoxia within the tumor microenvironments. Glucose was shown to be the major energy source in cancer cells where it utilizes aerobic /anaerobic  with the resultant lactic acid formation. The role of energetic modulations and use of glycolytic inhibitors on cancer/normal cell survival is not clearly established in the literature. We hypothesize that natural intermediates of  and the citric acid cycle will differentially and negatively impact the cancer phenotype in contrast to their no effects on the normal cell phenotype. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate six potential glycolytic modulators namely, Pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, Zn , sodium citrate, fructose diphosphate (FDP) and sodium bicarbonate at μM concentrations on growing A549 (lung cancer) and MRC-5 (normal; human lung fibroblast) cell lines with the objective of determining their influence on visual impact, cell metabolic activity, cell viability and end-point cell survival. Exposed and non-exposed cells were tested with phase-contrast micro-scanning, survival/death and metabolic activity trends through MTT-assays, as well as death end-point determinations by testing re-growth on complete media and T4 cellometer counts. Results showed that oxalic acid and Zn  both influenced the pH of the medium and resulted in differential massive cell debris within the exposure period. Pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate and FDP did not cause pH changes; however, they caused detectable cell disfigurement and loss of metabolic activity, viability and survival/ death end points with the resultant death of the A549 cell line. The MRC-5 cell line was differentially unaffected by exposure to pyruvic acid, sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, FDP and Zn , underwent complete recovery and remained both attached and healthy for 6 weeks upon subculture when transferred to a new complete medium. Oxalic acid did not show differential modulation with the consequent loss of survival and death of the MRC-5 cell line. Phase contrast, metabolic activity, cell counts as well as death end-point findings confirmed our hypothsis. These studies show the potential possibly for exploiting cellular metabolic differences in cancer control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928466>Metabolic positron emission tomography imaging of cancer: Pairing lipid metabolism with .</a></h2><p>The limitations of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in detecting some cancers has prompted a longstanding search for other positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to complement the imaging of  in oncology, with much attention paid to lipogenesis based on observations that the production of various lipid and lipid-containing compounds is increased in most cancers. Radiolabeled analogs of choline and  have now been used as oncologic PET probes for over a decade, showing convincingly improved detection sensitivity over FDG for certain cancers. However, neither choline nor  have been thoroughly validated as lipogenic biomarkers, and while acetyl-CoA produced from  is used in de-novo lipogenesis to synthesize fatty acids,  is also consumed by various other synthetic and metabolic pathways, with recent experimental observations challenging the assumption that lipogenesis is its predominant role in all cancers. Since tumors detected by  PET are also frequently detected by choline PET, imaging of choline metabolism might serve as an alternative albeit indirect marker of lipogenesis, particularly if the fatty acids produced in cancer cells are mainly destined for membrane synthesis through incorporation into phosphatidylcholines. Aerobic  may or may not coincide with changes in lipid metabolism, resulting in combinatorial metabolic phenotypes that may have different prognostic or therapeutic implications. Consequently, PET imaging using dual metabolic tracers, in addition to being diagnostically superior to imaging with individual tracers, could eventually play a greater role in supporting precision medicine, as efforts to develop small-molecule metabolic pathway inhibitors are coming to fruition. To prepare for this advent, clinical and translational studies of metabolic PET tracers must go beyond simply estimating tracer diagnostic utility, and aim to uncover potential therapeutic avenues associated with these metabolic alterations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28369109>Transcriptome analysis of Corynebacterium glutamicum in the process of recombinant protein expression in bioreactors.</a></h2><p>Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) is a favorable host cell for the production of recombinant proteins, such as important enzymes and pharmaceutical proteins, due to its excellent potential advantages. Herein, we sought to systematically explore the influence of recombinant protein expression on the transcription and metabolism of C. glutamicum.

A well-characterized tumor progression in Rip1-Tag2 mice undergoes five stages, involving normal, hyperplasia, angiogenic islets, tumorigenesis and invasive carcinoma. (1)H NMR based metabonomics was applied to identify potential biomarkers for monitoring pancreatic islet β cell tumor progression in Rip1-Tag2 mice. Multivariate analysis results showed the serum metabonome at hyperplasia stage shared the similar characteristics with the ones at normal stage as a result of slight proliferation of pancreatic islet β cells. At angiogenic islets stage, the up-regulated , disturbed choline and phospholipid metabolism composed the metabolic signature. In addition to the changes mentioned above, several metabolites were identified as early biomarkers for tumorigenesis, including increased methionine, citrate and choline, and reduced , taurine and glucose, which suggested the activated energy and amino acid metabolism. All the changes were aggravated at invasive carcinoma stage, coupled with notable changes in alanine, glutamate and glycine. Moreover, the distinct metabolic phenotype was found associated with the implanting of SV40 large T antigen in Rip1-Tag2 mice.

Stimulation of glucose transport is markedly impaired in cardiomyocytes exposed to free fatty acids (FFA). Deactivation of the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) by FFA contributes to glucose transport impairment, and could be corrected by chronic treatment with the phorbol ester TPA. However, TPA must have effects in addition to FAK reactivation to restore stimulated glucose transport. Chronic treatment with TPA improved basal and stimulated glucose transport in FFA-exposed, but not in control cardiomyocytes. Chronic FFA exposure induced the activation of PKCδ and PKCϵ. TPA markedly downregulated the expression of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ, suggesting that PKCδ or PKCϵ activation could contribute to inhibition of glucose transport by FFA. Rottlerin, a specific PKCδ inhibitor, improved glucose transport in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes; and PKCδ was reduced in the particulate fraction of FFA + TPA-exposed cardiomyocytes. TPA also activated Protein Kinase D 1(PKD1) in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes, as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 on Y916. Pharmaceutical inhibition of PKD1 only partially prevented the improvement of glucose transport by TPA. Chronic TPA treatment also increased basal and stimulated  and favored accumulation of lipid droplets in FFA-exposed cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, basal and stimulated glucose transport in cardiomyocytes is reduced by chronic FFA exposure, but restored by concomitant treatment with a phorbol ester. The mechanism of action of phorbol esters may involve downregulation of PKCδ, activation of PKD1 and a general switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism. J. Cell.

In an initial attempt to reduce  formation, the phosphate acetyltransferase gene (pta) from E. coli FB-04 was deleted, forming strain FB-04(Δpta). Unfortunately, FB-04(Δpta) exhibited a growth defect. Therefore, pta was replaced with a pta variant (pta1) from E. coli CCTCC M 2016009, forming strain FB-04(pta1). Pta1 exhibits lower catalytic capacity and substrate affinity than Pta because of a single amino acid substitution (Pro69Leu). FB-04(pta1) lacked the growth defect of FB-04(Δpta) and showed improved fermentation performance. Strain FB-04(pta1) showed a 91% increase in L-tryptophan yield in flask fermentation experiments, while  production decreased by 35%, compared with its parent FB-04. Throughout the fed-batch fermentation process,  accumulation by FB-04(pta1) was slower than that by FB-04. The final L-tryptophan titer of FB-04(pta1) reached 44.0 g/L, representing a 15% increase over that of FB-04. Metabolomics analysis showed that the pta1 genomic substitution slightly decreased carbon flux through  and significantly increased carbon fluxes through the pentose phosphate and common aromatic pathways. These results indicate that this strategy enhances L-tryptophan production and decreases  accumulation during the L-tryptophan fermentation process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26251955> as a Metabolic and Epigenetic Modifier of Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Metabolic networks are significantly altered in neoplastic cells.

Recently, the focus has shifted to cancer metabolism for the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, including HCC. In addition to conventional diagnostics, the measurement of enhanced tumor cell metabolism using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) for increased  or C-11  for fatty acid synthesis by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is well established for clinical management of HCC. Unlike tumors displaying the Warburg effect, HCCs vary substantially in terms of 18F-FDG uptake, which considerably reduces the sensitivity for tumor detection. Accordingly, C-11  has been proposed as a complementary radiotracer for detecting tumors that are not identified by 18F-FDG. In addition to HCC diagnosis, since the degree of 18F-FDG uptake converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) correlates well with tumor aggressiveness, 18F-FDG PET/CT scans can predict patient outcomes such as treatment response and survival with an inverse relationship between SUV and survival. The loss of tumor suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes plays an important role in promoting HCC development, and might be involved in the "metabolic reprogramming" of cancer cells. Mutations in various genes such as , , , and  are responsible for the development of HCC. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in cancer metabolism are deregulated in HCC, indicating that the modulation of genes/miRNAs might affect HCC growth or metastasis.

Redundancy in this complex metabolic network renders the rational engineering of cyanobacterial metabolism for the generation of biomass, biofuels and chemicals a challenge. Here we report the presence of a functional phosphoketolase pathway, which splits xylulose-5-phosphate (or fructose-6-phosphate) to  precursor acetyl phosphate, in an engineered strain of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis (ΔglgC/xylAB), in which glycogen synthesis is blocked, and xylose catabolism enabled through the introduction of xylose isomerase and xylulokinase. We show that this mutant strain is able to metabolise xylose to  on nitrogen starvation. To see whether  production in the mutant is linked to the activity of phosphoketolase, we disrupted a putative phosphoketolase gene (slr0453) in the ΔglgC/xylAB strain, and monitored metabolic flux using (13)C labelling;  and 2-oxoglutarate production was reduced in the light. A metabolic flux analysis, based on isotopic data, suggests that the phosphoketolase pathway metabolises over 30% of the carbon consumed by ΔglgC/xylAB during photomixotrophic growth on xylose and CO2. Disruption of the putative phosphoketolase gene in wild-type Synechocystis also led to a deficiency in  production in the dark, indicative of a contribution of the phosphoketolase pathway to heterotrophic metabolism. We suggest that the phosphoketolase pathway, previously uncharacterized in photosynthetic organisms, confers flexibility in energy and carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria, and could be exploited to increase the efficiency of cyanobacterial carbon metabolism and photosynthetic productivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27879277>Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 promotes metabolic reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Reprogramming of intracellular metabolism is common in liver cancer cells.

In this study, we reported that the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of EIF5A2 was upregulated in 59 of 105 (56.2%) HCC clinical samples (P = 0.015), and EIF5A2 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter survival time of patients with HCC (P = 0.021). Ectopic expression of EIF5A2 in HCC cell lines significantly promoted cell growth and accelerated glucose utilization and lipogenesis rates. The high rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion conferred by EIF5A2 revealed an abnormal activity of aerobic  in HCC cells. Several key enzymes involved in  including glucose transporter type 1 and 2, hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase liver type, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, phosphoglycerate mutase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A were upregulated by overexpression of EIF5A2. Moreover, EIF5A2 showed positive correlations with FASN and ACSS2, two key enzymes involved in the fatty acid de novo biosynthetic pathway, at both protein and mRNA levels in HCC. These results indicated that EIF5A2 may regulate fatty acid de novo biosynthesis by increasing the uptake of . In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that EIF5A2 has a critical role in HCC cell metabolic reprogramming and may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment.© The Author 2016.

As recently suggested, overflow metabolism can be understood in terms of proteome allocation, since fermentation has lower proteome cost for energy production than respiration. Here, we demonstrate that ArcA overexpression in aerobic conditions, results in downregulation of respiratory pathways and enhanced growth rates on glycolytic substrates of E. coli, coinciding with  excretion and increased carbon uptake rates. These results suggest that fermentation enables faster growth and demonstrate that fermentation on many glycolytic carbon sources is not limited by carbon uptake. Hence, these findings are difficult to reconcile with many alternative hypotheses that have been proposed for the origin of overflow metabolism and the growth rate dependence of fermentation and respiration, which are based on limited capacity of respiration or limitations in uptake rates and catabolic pathways. Instead, as suggested by increased lag phases of ArcA overexpression strains, respiratory energy metabolism may be related to a general preparatory response, observed for decreasing growth rates, but with limited advantages for maximizing steady-state growth rate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27701474>Staphylococcus aureus Tissue Infection During Sepsis Is Supported by Differential Use of Bacterial or Host-Derived Lipoic Acid.</a></h2><p>To thrive in diverse environments, bacteria must shift their metabolic output in response to nutrient bioavailability. In many bacterial species, such changes in metabolic flux depend upon lipoic acid, a cofactor required for the activity of enzyme complexes involved in , the citric acid cycle, glycine catabolism, and branched chain fatty acid biosynthesis. The requirement of lipoic acid for metabolic enzyme activity necessitates that bacteria synthesize the cofactor and/or scavenge it from environmental sources. Although use of lipoic acid is a conserved phenomenon, the mechanisms behind its biosynthesis and salvage can differ considerably between bacterial species. Furthermore, low levels of circulating free lipoic acid in mammals underscore the importance of lipoic acid acquisition for pathogenic microbes during infection. In this study, we used a genetic approach to characterize the mechanisms of lipoic acid biosynthesis and salvage in the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and evaluated the requirements for both pathways during murine sepsis. We determined that S. aureus lipoic acid biosynthesis and salvage genes exist in an arrangement that directly links redox stress response and  biosynthesis genes. In addition, we found that lipoic acid salvage is dictated by two ligases that facilitate growth and lipoylation in distinct environmental conditions in vitro, but that are fully compensatory for survival in vivo. Upon infection of mice, we found that de novo biosynthesis or salvage promotes S. aureus survival in a manner that depends upon the infectious site. In addition, when both lipoic acid biosynthesis and salvage are blocked S. aureus is rendered avirulent, implying an inability to induce lipoic acid-independent metabolic programs to promote survival. Together, our results define the major pathways of lipoic acid biosynthesis and salvage in S. aureus and support the notion that bacterial nutrient acquisition schemes are instrumental in dictating pathogen proclivity for an infectious niche.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365536>Zinc-dependent substrate-level phosphorylation powers Salmonella growth under nitrosative stress of the innate host response.</a></h2><p>The metabolic processes that enable the replication of intracellular Salmonella under nitrosative stress conditions engendered in the innate response of macrophages are poorly understood. A screen of Salmonella transposon mutants identified the ABC-type high-affinity zinc uptake system ZnuABC as a critical determinant of the adaptation of Salmonella to the nitrosative stress generated by the enzymatic activity of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase of mononuclear phagocytic cells. NO limits the virulence of a znuB mutant in an acute murine model of salmonellosis. The ZnuABC transporter is crucial for the glycolytic function of fructose bisphosphate aldolase, thereby fueling growth of Salmonella during nitrosative stress produced in the innate response of macrophages. Our investigations demonstrate that  mediates resistance of Salmonella to the antimicrobial activity of NO produced in an acute model of infection. The ATP synthesized by substrate-level phosphorylation at the payoff phase of  and  fermentation powers the replication of Salmonella experiencing high levels of nitrosative stress. In contrast, despite its high potential for ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation is a major target of inhibition by NO and contributes little to the antinitrosative defenses of intracellular Salmonella. Our investigations have uncovered a previously unsuspected conjunction between zinc homeostasis, glucose metabolism and cellular energetics in the adaptation of intracellular Salmonella to the reactive nitrogen species synthesized in the innate host response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30091382>Macrophages from the upper and lower human respiratory tract are metabolically distinct.</a></h2><p>The function and cell surface phenotype of lung macrophages vary within the respiratory tract. Alterations in the bioenergetic profile of macrophages may also be influenced by their location within the respiratory tract. This study sought to characterize the bioenergetic profile of macrophages sampled from different locations within the respiratory tract at baseline and in response to ex vivo xenobiotic challenge. Surface macrophages recovered from healthy volunteers by induced sputum and by bronchial and bronchoalveolar lavage were profiled using extracellular flux analyses. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured at rest and after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA), or 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ). Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were highly correlated for all macrophage samples. Induced sputum macrophages had relatively higher oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates and were largely reliant on . In contrast, bronchial fraction and bronchoalveolar macrophages depended more heavily on mitochondrial respiration. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed elevated LPS-induced cytokine responses. Unlike their autologous peripheral blood monocytes, lung macrophages from any source did not display bioenergetic changes following LPS stimulation. The protein kinase C activator PMA did not affect mitochondrial respiration, whereas the air pollutant 1,2-NQ induced marked mitochondrial dysfunction in bronchoalveolar and bronchial fraction macrophages. The bioenergetic characteristics of macrophages from healthy individuals are dependent on their location within the respiratory tract. These findings establish a regional bioenergetic profile for macrophages from healthy human airways that serves as a reference for changes that occur in disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130074>Loss of UCP2 impairs cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis by promoting a shift toward glucose utilization in brown adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was discovered in 1997 and classified as an uncoupling protein largely based on its homology of sequence with UCP1. Since its discovery, the uncoupling function of UCP2 has been questioned and there is yet no consensus on the true function of this protein. UCP2 was first proposed to be a reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulator and an insulin secretion modulator. More recently, it was demonstrated as a regulator of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which prompted us to investigate its role in the metabolic and thermogenic functions of brown adipose tissue. We first investigated the role of UCP2 in affecting the  capacity by evaluating the extracellular flux in cells lacking UCP2. We thereafter investigated the role of UCP2 in BAT thermogenesis with positron emission tomography using the metabolic tracers [C]- (metabolic activity), 2-deoxy-2-[F]-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG, glucose uptake) and 14(R,S)-[F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid [FTHA, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) uptake]. The effect of the β3-adrenoreceptor (ADRB3) selective agonist, CL316,243 (CL), on BAT FDG and FTHA uptakes, as well as C- activity was assessed in UCP2 and UCP2 mice exposed at room temperature or adapted to cold. Our results suggest that despite the fact that UCP2 does not have the uncoupling potential of UCP1, its contribution to BAT thermogenesis and to the adaptation to cold exposure appears crucial. Notably, we found that the absence of UCP2 promoted a shift toward glucose utilization and increased glycolytic capacity in BAT, which conferred a better oxidative/thermogenic activity/capacity following an acute adrenergic stimulation. However, following cold exposure, a context of high-energy demand, BAT of UCP2 mice failed to adapt and thermogenesis was impaired. We conclude that UCP2 regulates BAT thermogenesis by favouring the utilization of NEFA, a process required for the adaptation to cold.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

While the dynamics of metabolic flows during changes in available carbon sources have been estimated based on changes in metabolism-related gene expression, as well as on changes in the metabolome, the flux change itself has scarcely been measured because of technical difficulty, which has made conclusions elusive in many cases. Here, we used a monitoring system employing Vibrio fischeri luciferase to probe the intracellular metabolic condition in Escherichia coli Using a batch culture provided with a limited amount of glucose, we performed a time course analysis, where the predominant carbon source shifts from glucose to , and identified a series of sequential peaks in the luciferase activity (peaks 1 to 4). Two major peaks, peaks 1 and 3, were considered to correspond to the glucose and  consuming phases, respectively, based on the glucose, , and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the medium. The pattern of these peaks was changed by the addition of a different carbon source or by an increasing concentration of glucose, which was consistent with the present model. Genetically, mutations involved in  or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle/gluconeogenesis specifically affected peak 1 or peak 3, respectively, as expected from the corresponding metabolic phase. Intriguingly, mutants for the  excretion pathway showed a phenotype of extended peak 2 and delayed transition to the TCA cycle/gluconeogenesis phase, which suggests that peak 2 represents the metabolic transition phase.

They are the most abundant leucocytes in the peripheral blood, have a short lifespan and an estimated turnover of 10(10) to 10(11) cells per day. Neutrophils efficiently clear microbial infections by phagocytosis and by oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms. In 2004, a new neutrophil anti-microbial mechanism was described, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA, histones and anti-microbial peptides. Several microorganisms, bacterial products, as well as pharmacological stimuli such as PMA, were shown to induce NETs. Neutrophils contain relatively few mitochondria, and derive most of their energy from . In this scenario we aimed to analyse some of the metabolic requirements for NET formation. Here it is shown that NETs formation is strictly dependent on glucose and to a lesser extent on glutamine, that Glut-1, glucose uptake, and  rate increase upon PMA stimulation, and that NET formation is inhibited by the  inhibitor, 2-deoxy-glucose, and to a lesser extent by the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin. Moreover, when neutrophils were exposed to PMA in glucose-free medium for 3 hr, they lost their characteristic polymorphic nuclei but did not release NETs. However, if glucose (but not pyruvate) was added at this time, NET release took place within minutes, suggesting that NET formation could be metabolically divided into two phases; the first, independent from exogenous glucose (chromatin decondensation) and, the second (NET release), strictly dependent on exogenous glucose and .© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27555881>Elucidation of the co-metabolism of glycerol and glucose in Escherichia coli by genetic engineering, transcription profiling, and (13)C metabolic flux analysis.</a></h2><p>Glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel, has become a readily available and inexpensive carbon source for the production of high-value products. However, the main drawback of glycerol utilization is the low consumption rate and shortage of NADPH formation, which may limit the production of NADPH-requiring products. To overcome these problems, we constructed a carbon catabolite repression-negative ΔptsGglpK* mutant by both blocking a key glucose PTS transporter and enhancing the glycerol conversion. The mutant can recover normal growth by co-utilization of glycerol and glucose after loss of glucose PTS transporter. To reveal the metabolic potential of the ΔptsGglpK* mutant, this study examined the flux distributions and regulation of the co-metabolism of glycerol and glucose in the mutant.By labeling experiments using [1,3-(13)C]glycerol and [1-(13)C]glucose, (13)C metabolic flux analysis was employed to decipher the metabolisms of both the wild-type strain and the ΔptsGglpK* mutant in chemostat cultures. When cells were maintained at a low dilution rate (0.1 h(-1)), the two strains showed similar fluxome profiles. When the dilution rate was increased, both strains upgraded their pentose phosphate pathway,  and anaplerotic reactions, while the ΔptsGglpK* mutant was able to catabolize much more glycerol than glucose (more than tenfold higher). Compared with the wild-type strain, the mutant repressed its flux through the TCA cycle, resulting in higher  overflow. The regulation of fluxomes was consistent with transcriptional profiling of several key genes relevant to the TCA cycle and transhydrogenase, namely gltA, icdA, sdhA and pntA. In addition, cofactor fluxes and their pool sizes were determined. The ΔptsGglpK* mutant affected the redox NADPH/NADH state and reduced the ATP level. Redox signaling activated the ArcA regulatory system, which was responsible for TCA cycle repression.This work employs both (13)C-MFA and transcription/metabolite analysis for quantitative investigation of the co-metabolism of glycerol and glucose in the ΔptsGglpK* mutant. The ArcA regulatory system dominates the control of flux redistribution. The ΔptsGglpK* mutant can be used as a platform for microbial cell factories for the production of biofuels and biochemicals, since most of fuel molecule (e.g., alcohols) synthesis requires excess reducing equivalents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303954>Biochemical and kinetic characterization of the recombinant ADP-forming acetyl coenzyme A synthetase from the amitochondriate protozoan Entamoeba histolytica.</a></h2><p>Entamoeba histolytica, an amitochondriate protozoan parasite that relies on  as a key pathway for ATP generation, has developed a unique extended PPi-dependent glycolytic pathway in which ADP-forming acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (ACD; :CoA ligase [ADP-forming]; EC 6.2.1.13) converts acetyl-CoA to  to produce additional ATP and recycle CoA.

Hearts are perfused with buffer containing tracer [(13)C2,(2)H3], which forms M5 + M4 + M3 acetyl-CoA. The buffer may also contain one or two labeled substrates, which generate M2 acetyl-CoA (e.g. [(13)C6]glucose or [1,2-(13)C2]palmitate) or/and M1 acetyl-CoA (e.g. [1-(13)C]octanoate).

Here we hypothesized that chronic heavy drinking facilitates this energy substrate shift both for baseline and stimulation conditions. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of alcohol intoxication (0.75 g/kg alcohol vs placebo) on brain glucose metabolism during video stimulation (VS) versus when given with no stimulation (NS), in 25 heavy drinkers (HDs) and 23 healthy controls, each of whom underwent four PET-(18)FDG scans. We showed that resting whole-brain glucose metabolism (placebo-NS) was lower in HD than controls (13%, p = 0.04); that alcohol (compared with placebo) decreased metabolism more in HD (20 ± 13%) than controls (9 ± 11%, p = 0.005) and in proportion to daily alcohol consumption (r = 0.36, p = 0.01) but found that alcohol did not reduce the metabolic increases in visual cortex from VS in either group. Instead, VS reduced alcohol-induced decreases in whole-brain glucose metabolism (10 ± 12%) compared with NS in both groups (15 ± 13%, p = 0.04), consistent with stimulation-related glucose metabolism enhancement. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that heavy alcohol consumption facilitates use of alternative energy substrates (i.e., ) for resting activity during intoxication, which might persist through early sobriety, but indicate that glucose is still favored as energy substrate during brain stimulation. Our findings are consistent with reduced reliance on glucose as the main energy substrate for resting brain metabolism during intoxication (presumably shifting to  or other ketones) and a priming of this shift in HDs, which might make them vulnerable to energy deficits during withdrawal.Copyright © 2015 the authors 0270-6474/15/353248-08$15.00/0.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004884>Fermentation of glycerol by Anaerobium acetethylicum and its potential use in biofuel production.</a></h2><p>Growth of biodiesel industries resulted in increased coproduction of crude glycerol which is therefore becoming a waste product instead of a valuable 'coproduct'. Glycerol can be used for the production of valuable chemicals, e.g. biofuels, to reduce glycerol waste disposal. In this study, a novel bacterial strain is described which converts glycerol mainly to ethanol and hydrogen with very little amounts of , formate and 1,2-propanediol as coproducts. The bacterium offers certain advantages over previously studied glycerol-fermenting microorganisms. Anaerobium acetethylicum during growth with glycerol produces very little side products and grows in the presence of maximum glycerol concentrations up to 1500 mM and in the complete absence of complex organic supplements such as yeast extract or tryptone. The highest observed growth rate of 0.116 h is similar to that of other glycerol degraders, and the maximum concentration of ethanol that can be tolerated was found to be about 60 mM (2.8 g l ) and further growth was likely inhibited due to ethanol toxicity. Proteome analysis as well as enzyme assays performed in cell-free extracts demonstrated that glycerol is degraded via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is further metabolized through the lower part of  leading to formation of mainly ethanol and hydrogen. In conclusion, fermentation of glycerol to ethanol and hydrogen by this bacterium represents a remarkable option to add value to the biodiesel industries by utilization of surplus glycerol.© 2016 The Authors.

We have, therefore, characterized metabolic functions of primary oligodendrocyte precursor cell cultures at late stages of differentiation using isotope-labelled metabolites. We report that differentiated oligodendrocyte lineage cells avidly metabolize glucose in the cytosol and pyruvate derived from glucose in the mitochondria. The labelling patterns of metabolites obtained after incubation with [1,2-(13)C]glucose demonstrated that the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is highly active in oligodendrocytes (approximately 10% of glucose is metabolized via the PPP as indicated by labelling patterns in phosphoenolpyruvate). Mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses of metabolites after incubation of cells with [1-(13)C]lactate or [1,2-(13)C]glucose, respectively, demonstrated that anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation, which was thought to be exclusive to astrocytes, is also active in oligodendrocytes. Using [1,2-(13)C], we show that oligodendrocytes convert  into acetyl CoA which is metabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Analysis of labelling patterns of alanine after incubation of cells with [1,2-(13)C] and [1,2-(13)C]glucose showed catabolic oxidation of malate or oxaloacetate.

Here, we assess the key metabolic parameters of peripheral blood-derived human eosinophils using real-time extracellular flux analysis to measure extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate, and compare these parameters to human neutrophils. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that eosinophils and neutrophils have a similar glycolytic capacity, albeit with a minimal glycolytic reserve. However, compared to neutrophils, eosinophils exhibit significantly greater basal mitochondrial respiration, ATP-linked respiration, maximum respiratory capacity, and spare respiratory capacity. Of note, the glucose oxidation pathway is also utilized by eosinophils, something not evident in neutrophils. Furthermore, using a colorimetric enzymatic assay, we show that eosinophils have much reduced glycogen stores compared to neutrophils. We also show that physiologically relevant levels of hypoxia (O 3 kPa), by suppressing oxygen consumption rates, have a profound effect on basal and phorbol-myristate--stimulated eosinophil and neutrophil metabolism. Finally, we compared the metabolic profile of eosinophils purified from atopic and non-atopic subjects and show that, despite a difference in the activation status of eosinophils derived from atopic subjects, these cells exhibit comparable oxygen consumption rates upon priming with IL-5 and stimulation with fMLP. In summary, our findings show that eosinophils display far greater metabolic flexibility compared to neutrophils, with the potential to use , glucose oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. This flexibility may allow eosinophils to adapt better to diverse roles in host defense, homeostasis, and immunomodulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31470116>Engineering acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut for eco-friendly production of polyketides triacetic acid lactone in Yarrowia lipolytica.</a></h2><p>Acetyl-CoA is the central metabolic node connecting , Krebs cycle and fatty acids synthase.

Using the simplest polyketide triacetic acid lactone (TAL) as a testbed molecule, we demonstrate that  uptake pathway in oleaginous yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica) could function as an acetyl-CoA shortcut to achieve metabolic optimality in producing polyketides. We identified the metabolic bottlenecks to rewire  utilization for efficient TAL production in Y. lipolytica, including generation of the driving force for acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. The engineered strain, with the overexpression of endogenous acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), malic enzyme (MAE1) and a bacteria-derived cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), affords robust TAL production with titer up to 4.76 g/L from industrial glacier acetic acid in shake flasks, representing 8.5-times improvement over the parental strain. The -to-TAL conversion ratio (0.149 g/g) reaches 31.9% of the theoretical maximum yield. The carbon flux through this acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut exceeds the carbon flux afforded by the native glycolytic pathways. Potentially, acetic acid could be manufactured in large-quantity at low-cost from Syngas fermentation or heterogenous catalysis (methanol carbonylation). This alternative carbon sources present a metabolic advantage over glucose to unleash intrinsic pathway limitations and achieve high carbon conversion efficiency and cost-efficiency. This work also highlights that low-cost acetic acid could be sustainably upgraded to high-value polyketides by oleaginous yeast species in an eco-friendly and cost-efficient manner.Copyright © 2019 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

The relevance of these enzymes to the parasite ATP and PPi supply, respectively, are analyzed here.The recombinant enzymes were kinetically characterized and their physiological roles were analyzed by transcriptional gene silencing and further metabolic analyses in amoebae.Recombinant ACS showed higher catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) for  formation than for acetyl-CoA formation and high acetyl-CoA levels were found in trophozoites. Gradual ACS gene silencing (49-93%) significantly decreased the  flux without affecting the levels of glycolytic metabolites and ATP in trophozoites. However, amoebae lacking ACS activity were unable to reestablish the acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio after an oxidative stress challenge. Recombinant AcK showed activity only in the  formation direction; however, its substrate acetyl-phosphate was undetected in axenic parasites. AcK gene silencing did not affect  production in the parasites but promoted a slight decrease (10-20%) in the hexose phosphates and PPi levels.These results indicated that the main role of ACS in the parasite energy metabolism is not ATP production but to recycle CoA for  to proceed under aerobic conditions. AcK does not contribute to  production but might be marginally involved in PPi and hexosephosphate homeostasis.The previous, long-standing hypothesis that these enzymes importantly contribute to ATP and PPi supply in amoebae can now be ruled out.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, cardiotoxicity is of increasing concern, with a need to develop rational mechanism driven approaches for the early detection of cardiac dysfunction. We sought to interrogate changes in cardiac energy substrate usage during sunitinib treatment, hypothesising that these changes could represent a strategy for the early detection of cardiotoxicity. Balb/CJ mice or Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally for 4 weeks with 40 or 20 mg/kg/day sunitinib. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) was implemented to investigate alterations in myocardial glucose and oxidative metabolism. Following treatment, blood pressure increased, and left ventricular ejection fraction decreased. Cardiac [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET revealed increased glucose uptake after 48 hours. [11C]-PET showed decreased myocardial perfusion following treatment. Electron microscopy revealed significant lipid accumulation in the myocardium. Proteomic analyses indicated that oxidative metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction were among the top myocardial signalling pathways perturbed. Sunitinib treatment results in an increased reliance on , increased myocardial lipid deposition and perturbed mitochondrial function, indicative of a fundamental energy crisis resulting in compromised myocardial energy metabolism and function. Our findings suggest that a cardiac PET strategy may represent a rational approach to non-invasively monitor metabolic pathway remodeling following sunitinib treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25734688>Potential electron mediators to extract electron energies of RBC  for prolonged in vivo functional lifetime of hemoglobin vesicles.</a></h2><p>Developing a functional blood substitute as an alternative to donated blood for clinical use is believed to relieve present and future blood shortages, and to reduce the risks of infection and blood type mismatching. Hemoglobin vesicle (HbV) encapsulates a purified and concentrated human-derived Hb solution in a phospholipid vesicle (liposome). The in vivo safety and efficacy of HbV as a transfusion alternative have been clarified. Auto-oxidation of ferrous Hb in HbV gradually increases the level of ferric methemoglobin (metHb) and impairs the oxygen transport capabilities. The extension of the functional half-life of HbV has recently been proposed using an electron mediator, methylene blue (MB), which acts as a shuttle between red blood cells (RBC) and HbV. MB transfers electron energies of NAD(P)H, produced by RBC , to metHb in HbV. Work presented here focuses on screening of 15 potential electron mediators, with appropriate redox potential and water solubility, for electron transfer from RBC to HbV. The results are assessed with regard to the chemical properties of the candidates. The compounds examined in this study were dimethyl methylene blue (DMB), methylene green, azure A, azure B, azure C, toluidine blue (TDB), thionin , phenazine methosulfate, brilliant cresyl blue, cresyl violet, gallocyanine, toluylene blue, indigo carmine, indigotetrasulfonate, and MB. Six candidates were found to be unsuitable because of their insufficient diffusion across membranes, or overly high or nonexistent reactivity with relevant biomolecules. However, 9 displayed favorable metHb reduction. Among the suitable candidates, phenothiazines DMB and TDB exhibited effectiveness like MB did. In comparison to MB, they showed faster reduction by electron-donating NAD(P)H, coupled with showing a lower rate of reoxidation in the presence of molecular oxygen. Ascertaining the best electron mediator can provide a pathway for extending the lifetime and efficiency of potential blood substitutes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29848266>The Role of Diet Related Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Colorectal Cancer Metabolism and Survival: Prevention and Therapeutic Implications.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. CRC increased risk has been associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota, with decreased production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs produced in the human colon are the major products of bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary fiber and starch. While colonocytes use the three major SCFAs, namely , propionate and butyrate, as energy sources, transformed CRC cells primarily undergo aerobic . Compared to normal colonocytes, CRC cells exhibit increased sensitivity to SCFAs, thus indicating they play an important role in cell homeostasis. Manipulation of SCFA levels in the intestine, through changes in microbiota, has therefore emerged as a potential preventive/therapeutic strategy for CRC. Interest in understanding SCFAs mechanism of action in CRC cells has increased in the last years. Several SCFA transporters like SMCT-1, MCT-1 and aquaporins have been identified as the main transmembrane transporters in intestinal cells. Recently, it was shown that  promotes plasma membrane re-localization of MCT-1 and triggers changes in the glucose metabolism. SCFAs induce apoptotic cell death in CRC cells, and further mechanisms have been discovered, including the involvement of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, associated with mitochondria dysfunction and degradation. In this review, we will cover the current knowledge on the transport of SCFAs by CRC cells and their effects on CRC metabolism and survival. The impact of increasing SCFA production by manipulation of colon microbiota on the prevention/therapy of CRC will also be addressed.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089393>Metabolomics Analysis in Serum from Patients with Colorectal Polyp and Colorectal Cancer by H-NMR Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Colorectal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of CRC. In this report, we described the metabolic changes in the sera from patients with colorectal polyps and CRC by using the NMR-based metabolomics. 110 serum samples were collected from patients and healthy controls, including 40 CRC patients, 32 colorectal polyp patients, and 38 healthy controls. The metabolic profiles and differential metabolites of sera were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified from MSA. According to the pathway analysis and multivariate ROC curve-based exploratory analysis by using the relative concentrations of differential metabolites, we found abnormal metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers involved with the colorectal polyp and CRC. The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps. And the  and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC. The changed metabolism may promote cellular proliferation. In addition, we found that the rates of /glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively.

Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment.3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- (PMA). D. Brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative PCR (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. , fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA expressions.

It is well-known for its thermogenic and cell metabolism modulating effects. Based on methylxanthines' chemical structure, 8-(3-phenylpropyl)-1,3,7-triethylxanthine (PTX) is a novel adenosine antagonist with higher receptor affinity than caffeine. Therefore, we hypothesized that PTX metabolic effects could be stronger than those of caffeine. For that purpose, murine 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in the presence of increasing doses of PTX or caffeine (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μM) for 24 h. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Cell metabolites released to the culture medium were identified and quantified by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR). Cellular oxidative profile was also evaluated. Our results showed that PTX displayed no signs of cytotoxicity at all studied concentrations. When compared with caffeine, PTX increased glucose, pyruvate, and glutamine consumption, as well as lactate, alanine, and  production. Additionally, PTX decreased protein oxidation, thus protecting against oxidative stress-induced damage. These results illustrate that PTX is a stronger and less cytotoxic caffeine substitute with potential applications as metabolic modulator and a good candidate for novel drug design.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbohydrates produced by  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle play an important role in regulating turgor pressure. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis mutant, bzu1, isolated in a screen for elevated leaf temperature in response to drought stress, which displays smaller stomatal pores and higher drought resistance than wild-type plants. BZU1 encodes a known acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, ACN1, which acts in the first step of a metabolic pathway converting  to malate in peroxisomes. We showed that BZU1/ACN1-mediated -to-malate conversion provides a shunt that plays an important role in osmoregulation of stomatal turgor. We found that the smaller stomatal pores in the bzu1 mutant are a consequence of reduced accumulation of malate, which acts as an osmoticum and/or a signaling molecule in the control of turgor pressure within guard cells, and these results provided new genetic evidence for malate-regulated stomatal movement. Collectively, our results indicate that a peroxisomal BZU1/ACN1-mediated -malate shunt regulates drought resistance by controlling the turgor pressure of guard cells in Arabidopsis.Copyright © 2018 The Author.

The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is one of the newly discovered antimicrobial mechanisms. Although several immune functions have been analyzed under ATR exposure, the effect of ATR on NETs remains mainly unexplored. In the present study, we treated carp neutrophils using 5 μg/ml ATR and 5 μg/ml ATR combined with 100 nM rapamycin to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to clarify the effect of ATR on phorbol myristate  (PMA)-induced NETs. The results of the morphological observation and quantitative analysis of extracellular DNA and myeloperoxidase (MPO) showed that NETs formation were significantly inhibited by ATR exposure. Moreover, we found that in the NETs process, ATR downregulated the expression of the anti-apoptosis gene B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), increased the expression of the pro-apoptosis factors Bcl-2-Associated X (BAX), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinases (Caspase3, 9), and anti-autophagy factor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), decreased the expression of autophagy-related protein light chain 3B (LC3B) and glucose transport proteins (GLUT1, 4), disturbed the activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PKM), and hexokinase (HK) and limited reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, indicating that the reduced NETs release was a consequence of increased apoptosis and diminished ROS burst, autophagy and down-regulated  under ATR treatment. Meanwhile, rapamycin restored the inhibited autophagy and  and thus resisted the ATR-suppressed NETs. The present study perfects the mechanism theory of ATR immunotoxicity to fish and has a certain value for human health risk assessment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the applied stress and thus requires further analysis.A systematic review was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models.Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation.Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and function in skeletal muscle.Acadl: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long chain; Acadm: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, C-4 to C-12 straight chain; AIF: apoptosis-inducing factor; Akt: protein kinase B (PKB); AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF-4: activating transcription factor 4; ATM: ATM serine/threonine kinase; Bax: BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator; Bcl-2: B cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 2 apoptosis regulator; Bhlhe40: basic helix-loop-helix family member e40; BH3: Borane; Bim: bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death; Bok: Bcl-2 related ovarian killer; COX-IV: cytochrome c oxidase IV; cGMP: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate; c-myc: proto-oncogene protein; Cpt1b: carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B; Dr5: death receptor 5; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; ERK: extracellular regulated MAP kinase; Fas: Fas Cell surface death receptor; FDXR: Ferredoxin Reductase; FOXO3a: forkhead box O3; Gadd45a: growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha; GLS2: glutaminase 2; GLUT 1 and 4: glucose transporter 1(endothelial) and 4 (skeletal muscle); GSH: Glutathione; Hes1: hes family bHLH transcription factor 1; Hey1: hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1; HIFI-α: hypoxia-inducible factor 1, α-subunit; HK2: Hexokinase 2; HSP70: Heat Shock Protein 70; HO: Hydrogen Peroxide; Id2: inhibitor of DNA-binding 2; IGF-1-BP3: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3; IL-1β: Interleukin 1 beta; iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase; IRS-1: Insulin receptor substrate 1; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinases; LY-83583: 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione; inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase and of cGMP production; Mdm 2/ 4: Mouse double minute 2 homolog (mouse) Mdm4 (humans); mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; MURF1: Muscle RING-finger protein-1; MyoD: Myogenic differentiation 1; MyoG: myogenin; Nanog: Nanog homeobox; NF-kB: Nuclear factor-κB; NO: nitric oxide; NoxA: phorbol-12-myristate-13--induced protein 1 (Pmaip1); NRF-1: nuclear respiratory factor 1; Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; P21: Cdkn1a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (P21); P38 MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases; p53R2: p53 inducible ribonucleotide reductase gene; P66Shc: src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein C1; PERP: p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22; PGC-1α: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha; PGM: phosphoglucomutase; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; PKCβ: protein kinase c beta; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog; PTIO: 2-phenyl-4, 4, 5, 5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) has been used as a nitric oxide (NO) scavenger; Puma: The p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis; PW1: paternally expressed 3 (Peg3); RNS: Reactive nitrogen species; SIRT1: sirtuin 1; SCO2: cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein; SOD2: superoxide dismutase 2; Tfam: transcription factor A mitochondrial; TIGAR: Trp53 induced  repulatory phosphatase; TNF-a: tumor necrosis factor a; TRAF2: TNF receptor associated factor 2; TRAIL: type II transmembrane protein.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160120> Metabolism in Physiology, Cancer, and Beyond.</a></h2><p> and the related metabolism of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) confer numerous metabolic functions, including  production, lipid synthesis, and protein acetylation.

The metabolic transition from aerobic  to oxidative phosphorylation has been regarded as a hallmark of neuronal differentiation. Understanding what triggers metabolism reprogramming and how glucose metabolism directs NSC differentiation may provide new insight into the regenerative potential of the brain. TP53 inducible  and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) is an endogenous inhibitor of  and is highly expressed in mature neurons. However, its function in embryonic NSCs has not yet been explored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the precise roles of TIGAR in NSCs and the possible involvement of metabolic reprogramming in the TIGAR regulatory network. We observed that TIGAR is significantly increased during brain development as neural differentiation proceeds, especially at the peak of NSC differentiation (E14.5-E16.5). In cultured NSCs, knockdown of TIGAR reduced the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ngn1, and NeuroD1, and enhanced the expression of REST, suggesting that TIGAR is an important regulator of NSC differentiation. Furthermore, TIGAR enhanced the expression of lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and the mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) markers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor (NRF1), and MitoNEET during NSC differentiation. TIGAR can decrease lactate production and accelerate oxygen consumption and ATP generation to maintain a high rate of OXPHOS in differentiated NSCs. Interestingly, knockdown of TIGAR decreased the level of acetyl-CoA and H3K9 acetylation at the promoters of Ngn1, Neurod1, and Gfap. , a precursor of acetyl-CoA, increased the level of H3K9 acetylation and rescued the effect of TIGAR deficiency on NSC differentiation.

The annotated genome includes 2,130,987 bp, with 1777 protein-coding and 58 rRNA-coding genes. Genome sequence analysis revealed absence of genes encoding for: components of the PTS systems, enzymes of the TCA cycle, glyoxylate shunt and gluconeogensis. Genomic data revealed that A. schaalii is able to oxidize carbohydrates via , the nonoxidative pentose phosphate and the Entner-Doudoroff pathways. Besides, the genome harbors genes encoding for enzymes involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate,  and ethanol, which are found to be the end products of carbohydrate fermentation. The genome contained the gene encoding Type I fatty acid synthase required for de novo FAS biosynthesis. The plsY and plsX genes encoding the acyltransferases necessary for phosphatidic acid biosynthesis were absent from the genome. The genome harbors genes encoding enzymes responsible for isoprene biosynthesis via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Genes encoding enzymes that confer resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) were identified. In addition, A. schaalii harbors genes that protect the genome against viral infections. These include restriction-modification (RM) systems, type II toxin-antitoxin (TA), CRISPR-Cas and abortive infection system. A. schaalii genome also encodes several virulence factors that contribute to adhesion and internalization of this pathogen such as the tad genes encoding proteins required for pili assembly, the nanI gene encoding exo-alpha-sialidase, genes encoding heat shock proteins and genes encoding type VII secretion system. These features are consistent with anaerobic and pathogenic lifestyles. Finally, resistance to ciprofloxacin occurs by mutation in chromosomal genes that encode the subunits of DNA-gyrase (GyrA) and topisomerase IV (ParC) enzymes, while resistant to metronidazole was due to the frxA gene, which encodes NADPH-flavin oxidoreductase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31270376>Unraveling the effects of the gut microbiota composition and function on horse endurance physiology.</a></h2><p>An integrated analysis of gut microbiota, blood biochemical and metabolome in 52 endurance horses was performed.

Although a well-described phenomenon, research to date has only analyzed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission, and the mechanisms that initiate compromised neutrophil function post-injury are therefore poorly understood. Here, we analyzed pre-hospital blood samples acquired from 62 adult trauma patients (mean age 44 years, range 19-95 years) within 1 h of injury (mean time to sample 39 min, range 13-59 min). We found an immediate impairment in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13- (PMA) stimulation, which persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4-72 h). Reduced NET generation was accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species production, impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and a reduction in neutrophil glucose uptake and metabolism to lactate. Pre-treating neutrophils from healthy subjects with mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), whose circulating levels were significantly increased in our trauma patients, reduced NET generation. This mtDAMP-induced impairment in NET formation was associated with an N-formyl peptide mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of aerobic  and NET formation. Indeed, activation of AMPK via treatment with the AMP-mimetic AICAR significantly reduced neutrophil lactate production in response to PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that we also observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, the impairment in NET generation induced by mtDAMPs was partially ameliorated by pre-treating neutrophils with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken together, our data demonstrate an immediate trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil anti-microbial function and identify mtDAMP release as a potential initiator of acute post-injury neutrophil dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695623>Tracking Polymicrobial Metabolism in Cystic Fibrosis Airways:  Metabolism and Physiology Are Influenced by -Derived Metabolites.</a></h2><p>Due to a lack of effective immune clearance, the airways of cystic fibrosis patients are colonized by polymicrobial communities.

On the morning of day 42, after an 8-h fast, the birds fed basal diets were divided into 2 equal groups, and all birds in the 4 groups of 80 birds were transported according to the following protocols: 1) a 0.5-h transport of birds on basal diets (as a lower-stress control group), 2) a 3-h transport of birds on basal diets, and a 3-h transport of birds on basal diets supplemented with either 3) 600 or 4) 1,200 mg/kg GAA. The results revealed that dietary supplementation with GAA at 600 and 1,200 mg/kg for 14 D prior to slaughter did not affect growth performance, carcass traits, and most textural characteristics and chemical composition of the pectoralis major (PM) muscle (P > 0.05). In the GAA-free group, a 3-h transport increased the broiler live weight loss, elevated the plasma corticosterone concentration, decreased the plasma glucose concentration, muscle concentrations of ATP, creatine and energy charge value, increased the muscle AMP concentration and AMP/ATP ratio, and accelerated  metabolism, which resulted in inferior meat quality (lower pH and higher drip loss, P < 0.05). However, dietary addition of GAA at 1,200 mg/kg increased the mRNA expression of S-adenosyl-l-methionine: N-guanidino- methyltransferase in the liver and creatine transporter in both the liver and PM muscle. It also elevated muscle concentrations of creatine and phosphocreatine (P < 0.05), which helps improve meat quality by ameliorating the 3-h transport-induced muscle energy expenditure and delaying anaerobic  of broilers.© 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27134652>Co-production of hydrogen and ethanol by pfkA-deficient Escherichia coli with activated pentose-phosphate pathway: reduction of pyruvate accumulation.</a></h2><p>Fermentative hydrogen (H2) production suffers from low carbon-to-H2 yield, to which problem, co-production of ethanol and H2 has been proposed as a solution. For improved co-production of H2 and ethanol, we developed Escherichia coli BW25113 ΔhycA ΔhyaAB ΔhybBC ΔldhA ΔfrdAB Δpta-ackA ΔpfkA (SH8*) and overexpressed Zwf and Gnd, the key enzymes in the pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway (SH8*_ZG). However, the amount of accumulated pyruvate, which was significant (typically 0.20 mol mol(-1) glucose), reduced the co-production yield.In this study, as a means of reducing pyruvate accumulation and improving co-production of H2 and ethanol, we developed and studied E. coli SH9*_ZG with functional  production pathway for conversion of acetyl-CoA to  (pta-ackA (+)). Our results indicated that the presence of the  pathway completely eliminated pyruvate accumulation and substantially improved the co-production of H2 and ethanol, enabling yields of 1.88 and 1.40 mol, respectively, from 1 mol glucose. These yields, significantly, are close to the theoretical maximums of 1.67 mol H2 and 1.67 mol ethanol. To better understand the glycolytic flux distribution, glycolytic flux prediction and RT-PCR analyses were performed.The presence of the  pathway along with activation of the PP pathway eliminated pyruvate accumulation, thereby significantly improving co-production of H2 and ethanol. Our strategy is applicable to anaerobic production of biofuels and biochemicals, both of which processes demand high NAD(P)H.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25815843>Alternative fuels for cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Tumor metabolism is significantly altered to support the various metabolic needs of tumor cells. The most prominent change is the increased tumor  that leads to increased glucose uptake and utilization. However, it has become obvious that many non-glucose nutrients, such as amino acids, lactate, , and macromolecules, can serve as alternative fuels for cancer cells. This knowledge reveals an unexpected flexibility and evolutionarily conserved model in which cancer cells uptake nutrients from their external environment to fulfill their necessary energetic needs. Tumor cells may have evolved the ability to utilize different carbon sources because of the limited supply of nutrients in their microenvironment, which can be driven by oncogenic mutations or tumor microenvironmental stresses. In certain cases, these factors permanently alter the tumor cells' metabolism, causing certain nutrients to become indispensable and thus creating opportunities for therapeutic intervention to eradicate tumors by their metabolic vulnerabilities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28892251>Genomes of rumen bacteria encode atypical pathways for fermenting hexoses to short-chain fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Bacteria have been thought to follow only a few well-recognized biochemical pathways when fermenting glucose or other hexoses. These pathways have been chiseled in the stone of textbooks for decades, with most sources rendering them as they appear in the classic 1986 text by Gottschalk. Still, it is unclear how broadly these pathways apply, given that they were established and delineated biochemically with only a few model organisms. Here, we show that well-recognized pathways often cannot explain fermentation products formed by bacteria. In the most extensive analysis of its kind, we reconstructed pathways for glucose fermentation from genomes of 48 species and subspecies of bacteria from one environment (the rumen). In total, 44% of these bacteria had atypical pathways, including several that are completely unprecedented for bacteria or any organism. In detail, 8% of bacteria had an atypical pathway for  formation; 21% of bacteria had an atypical pathway for propionate or succinate formation; 6% of bacteria had an atypical pathway for butyrate formation and 33% of bacteria had an atypical or incomplete Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. This study shows that reconstruction of metabolic pathways - a common goal of omics studies - could be incorrect if well-recognized pathways are used for reference. Furthermore, it calls for renewed efforts to delineate fermentation pathways biochemically.© 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26567114>[(11)C] PET Imaging is not Always Associated with Increased Lipogenesis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Mice.</a></h2><p>Altered metabolism, including increased  and de novo lipogenesis, is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Radiolabeled nutrients, including glucose and , are extensively used for the detection of various tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). High signal of [(11)C] positron emission tomography (PET) in tumors is often considered to be associated with increased expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and increased de novo lipogenesis in tumor tissues. Defining a subset of tumors with increased [(11)C] PET signal and thus increased lipogenesis was suggested to help select a group of patients, who may benefit from lipogenesis-targeting therapies.To investigate whether [(11)C] PET imaging is truly associated with increased de novo lipogenesis along with hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed [(11)C] PET imaging in wild-type mice as well as two mouse HCC models, induced by myrAKT/Ras(V12) (AKT/Ras) and PIK3CA(1047R)/c-Met (PI3K/Met) oncogene combinations. In addition, we analyzed FASN expression and de novo lipogenesis rate in these mouse liver tissues.We found that while HCCs induced by AKT/Ras co-expression showed high levels of [(11)C] PET signal compared to normal liver, HCCs induced by PI3K/Met overexpression did not. Intriguingly, elevated FASN expression and increased de novo lipogenesis rate were observed in both AKT/Ras and PI3K/Met HCCs.Altogether, our study suggests that [(11)C] PET imaging can be a useful tool for imaging of a subset of HCCs. However, at molecular level, the increased [(11)C] PET imaging is not always associated with increased FASN expression or de novo lipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27927723>Coordinated activation of mitochondrial respiration and exocytosis mediated by PKC signaling in pancreatic β cells.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria play a central role in pancreatic β-cell nutrient sensing by coupling their metabolism to plasma membrane excitability and insulin granule exocytosis. Whether non-nutrient secretagogues stimulate mitochondria as part of the molecular mechanism to promote insulin secretion is not known. Here, we show that PKC signaling, which is employed by many non-nutrient secretagogues, augments mitochondrial respiration in INS-1E (rat insulinoma cell line clone 1E) and human pancreatic β cells. The phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-, accelerates mitochondrial respiration at both resting and stimulatory glucose concentrations. A range of inhibitors of novel PKC isoforms prevent phorbol ester-induced respiration. Respiratory response was blocked by oligomycin that demonstrated PKC-dependent acceleration of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Enhanced respiration was observed even when  was bypassed or fatty acid transport was blocked, which suggested that PKC regulates mitochondrial processes rather than upstream catabolic fluxes. A phosphoproteome study of phorbol ester-stimulated INS-1E cells maintained under resting (2.5 mM) glucose revealed a large number of phosphorylation sites that were altered during short-term activation of PKC signaling. The data set was enriched for proteins that are involved in gene expression, cytoskeleton remodeling, secretory vesicle transport, and exocytosis. Interactome analysis identified PKC, C-Raf, and ERK1/2 as the central phosphointeraction cluster. Prevention of ERK1/2 signaling by using a MEK1 inhibitor caused a marked decreased in phorbol 12-myristate 13--induced mitochondrial respiration. ERK1/2 signaling module therefore links PKC activation to downstream mitochondrial activation. We conclude that non-nutrient secretagogues act, in part,  PKC and downstream ERK1/2 signaling to stimulate mitochondrial energy production to compensate for energy expenditure that is linked to β-cell activation.-Santo-Domingo, J., Chareyron, I., Dayon, L., Galindo, A.

[F]FDG and [C]ACT PET were performed before and following irradiation (RT, 15Gy) for transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate xenografts. The underlying metabolomics alterations of tumor tissues were analyzed by using ex vivo NMR. The [F]FDG total lesion glucose (TLG) of the tumor significant increased in the RT group at Days 1 and 3 post-irradiation, compared with the non-RT group (p < 0.05). The [C]ACT maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) in RT (0.83 ± 0.02) and non-RT groups (0.85 ± 0.07) were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The ex vivo NMR analysis showed a 1.70-fold increase in glucose and a 1.2-fold increase in  in the RT group at Day 3 post-irradiation (p < 0.05). Concordantly, the expressions of cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthetase in the irradiated tumors was overexpressed at Day 3 post-irradiation (p < 0.05). Therefore, TLG of [F]FDG in vivo PET images can map early treatment response following irradiation and be a promising prognostic indicator in a longitudinal preclinical study.

Genetically resilient malaria parasites have evolved antimalarial drug-evasion mechanisms; meanwhile, the metabolic cross-talk between the malaria parasites and the host is of significance during the invasion. The intention of this work, therefore, is to propose a feasible method to discover the systematic metabolic phenotypes of mice invaded with artemisinin-sensitive or -resistant Plasmodium berghei K173 when compared with healthy mice. Biological samples, including plasma, liver, spleen, and kidney, of mice collected after euthanasia at day 7 were subjected to H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multivariable data analysis was utilized to estimate the metabolic characteristics of these samples from uninfected and infected mice. In contrast with healthy mice, both sensitive and resistant malaria-parasite-infected models displayed distinct metabolic profiles. Parasite invasion significantly changed the , Kreb's cycle, and amino acid metabolism in plasma and tissues. Decreased N, N-dimethylglycine and glycine levels in plasma from the artemisinin-sensitive P. berghei-infected group and increased lactate, lipid, and aspartate in the artemisinin-resistant P. berghei-infected group were observed, respectively. In the liver, the artemisinin-sensitive group up-regulated the glutamate level and down-regulated glutamine. Artemisinin-resistant parasite exposure decreased ethanol and allantoin levels. The levels of myo-inositol and valine in the spleen were increased due to artemisinin-sensitive P. berghei infection, together with decreased trimethylamine N-oxide, phosphocholine, β-glucose, and acetoacetic acid. In the artemisinin-resistant group, the spleen showed a remarkably increased phosphocholine content along with decreased dimethylglycine and arginine levels. In the kidney, artemisinin-sensitive P. berghei K173 caused increased lysine, glutamate, creatine, and 2-hydroxybutyrate as well as decreased ethanol. Artemisinin-resistant P. berghei led to low glycerophosphorylcholine and high , betaine, and hypoxanthine. Mutual and specific altered metabolites and, accordingly, metabolic pathways induced by the infection of artemisinin-sensitive or -resistant P. berghei were therefore screened out. This should be considered a preliminary study to establish a direct relationship with the host metabolic background and artemisinin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161329>Comparative metabolomics profiling of engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae lead to a strategy that improving β-carotene production by  supplementation.</a></h2><p>A comparative metabolomic analysis was conducted on recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain producing β-carotene and the parent strain cultivated with glucose as carbon source using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) based approach. The results showed that most of the central intermediates associated with amino acids, carbohydrates,  and TCA cycle intermediates (acetic acid, glycerol, citric acid, pyruvic acid and succinic acid), fatty acids, ergosterol and energy metabolites were produced in a lower amount in recombinant strain, as compared to the parent strain. To increase β-carotene production in recombinant strain, a strategy that exogenous addition of  (10 g/l) in exponential phase was developed, which could enhance most intracellular metabolites levels and result in 39.3% and 14.2% improvement of β-carotene concentration and production, respectively, which was accompanied by the enhancement of acetyl-CoA, fatty acids, ergosterol and ATP contents in cells. These results indicated that the amounts of intracellular metabolites in engineered strain are largely consumed by carotenoid formation. Therefore, maintaining intracellular metabolites pool at normal levels is essential for carotenoid biosynthesis. To relieve this limitation, rational supplementation of  could be a potential way because it can partially restore the levels of intracellular metabolites and improve the production of carotenoid compounds in recombinant S. cerevisiae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000496>The nutritional status of Methanosarcina acetivorans regulates glycogen metabolism and gluconeogenesis and  fluxes.</a></h2><p>Gluconeogenesis is an essential pathway in methanogens because they are unable to use exogenous hexoses as carbon source for cell growth. With the aim of understanding the regulatory mechanisms of central carbon metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the present study investigated gene expression, the activities and metabolic regulation of key enzymes, metabolite contents and fluxes of gluconeogenesis, as well as  and glycogen synthesis/degradation pathways. Cells were grown with methanol as a carbon source. Key enzymes were kinetically characterized at physiological pH/temperature. Active consumption of methanol during exponential cell growth correlated with significant methanogenesis, gluconeogenic flux and steady glycogen synthesis. After methanol exhaustion, cells reached the stationary growth phase, which correlated with the rise in glycogen consumption and glycolytic flux, decreased methanogenesis, negligible  production and an absence of gluconeogenesis. Elevated activities of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthetase complex and pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase suggested the generation of acetyl-CoA and pyruvate for glycogen synthesis. In the early stationary growth phase, the transcript contents and activities of pyruvate phosphate dikinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and glycogen synthase decreased, whereas those of glycogen phosphorylase, ADP-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase increased. Therefore, glycogen and gluconeogenic metabolites were synthesized when an external carbon source was provided. Once such a carbon source became depleted,  and methanogenesis fed by glycogen degradation provided the ATP supply. Weak inhibition of key enzymes by metabolites suggested that the pathways evaluated were mainly transcriptionally regulated. Because glycogen metabolism and /gluconeogenesis are not present in all methanogens, the overall data suggest that glycogen storage might represent an environmental advantage for methanosarcinales when carbon sources are scarce. Also, the understanding of the central carbohydrate metabolism in methanosarcinales may help to optimize methane production.© 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930214>A Comparison of the ATP Generating Pathways Used by S.

Typhimurium within infected host cells plays a fundamental role in virulence since it enables intracellular proliferation and dissemination and affects the innate immune response. An essential requirement for the intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium is the need to regenerate ATP. The metabolic route used to fulfil this requirement is the subject of the present study. For infection models we used human and murine epithelial and macrophage cell lines. The epithelial cell lines were mICc12, a transimmortalised murine colon enterocyte cell line that shows many of the characteristics of a primary epithelial cell line, and HeLa cells. The model macrophage cell lines were THP-1A human monocyte/macrophages and RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. Using a mutational approach combined with an exometabolomic analysis, we showed that neither fermentative metabolism nor anaerobic respiration play major roles in energy generation in any of the cell lines studied. Rather, we identified overflow metabolism to  and lactate as the foremost route by which S.

During the past 10 years, the use of stable isotopic tracers and network analysis have unveiled a number of metabolic pathways activated in cancer cells. Here, we review such pathways along with the particular tracers and labeling observations that led to the discovery of their rewiring in cancer cells. The list of such pathways comprises the reductive metabolism of glutamine, altered , serine and glycine metabolism, mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) induced reprogramming and the onset of  metabolism. Additionally, we demonstrate the critical role of isotopic labeling and network analysis in identifying these pathways. The alterations described in this review do not constitute a complete list, and future research using these powerful tools is likely to discover other cancer-related pathways and new metabolic targets for cancer therapy.Copyright © 2017 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Asexual reproduction of the parasite within its host cells is achieved by consecutive lytic cycles, which necessitates biogenesis of significant energy and biomass. Here we show that glucose and glutamine are the two major physiologically important nutrients used for the synthesis of macromolecules (ATP, nucleic acid, proteins, and lipids) in T. gondii, and either of them is sufficient to ensure the parasite survival. The parasite can counteract genetic ablation of its glucose transporter by increasing the flux of glutamine-derived carbon through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and by concurrently activating gluconeogenesis, which guarantee a continued biogenesis of ATP and biomass for host-cell invasion and parasite replication, respectively. In accord, a pharmacological inhibition of glutaminolysis or oxidative phosphorylation arrests the lytic cycle of the -deficient mutant, which is primarily a consequence of impaired invasion due to depletion of ATP. Unexpectedly, however, intracellular parasites continue to proliferate, albeit slower, notwithstanding a simultaneous deprivation of glucose and glutamine. A growth defect in the -impaired mutant is caused by a compromised synthesis of lipids, which cannot be counterbalanced by glutamine but can be restored by . Consistently, supplementation of parasite cultures with exogenous  can amend the lytic cycle of the glucose transport mutant. Such plasticity in the parasite's carbon flux enables a growth-and-survival trade-off in assorted nutrient milieus, which may underlie the promiscuous survival of T. gondii tachyzoites in diverse host cells. Our results also indicate a convergence of parasite metabolism with cancer cells.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597313>iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics reveals insights into metabolic and molecular responses of glucose-grown cells of Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus JA2.</a></h2><p>Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria thrive under diverse habitats utilising an extended range of inorganic/organic compounds under different growth modes. Although they display incredible metabolic flexibility, their responses and adaptations to changing carbon regimes is largely unexplored. In the present study, we employed iTRAQ-based global proteomic profiling and physiological studies to uncover the adaptive strategies of a phototrophic bacterium, Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus JA2 to glucose. Strain JA2 displayed altered growth rates, reduced cell size and progressive loss of pigmentation when grown on glucose compared to malate under photoheterotrophic condition. A ten-fold increase in the saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio of glucose-grown cells indicates a possible membrane adaptation. Proteomic profiling revealed extensive metabolic remodelling in the glucose-grown cells wherein signal-transduction, selective-transcription, DNA-repair, transport and protein quality control processes were up-regulated to cope with the changing milieu. Proteins involved in DNA replication, translation, electron-transport, photosynthetic machinery were down-regulated possibly to conserve the energy. /gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and pigment biosynthesis were also down-regulated. The cell has activated alternative energy metabolic pathways viz., fatty acid β-oxidation, glyoxylate, -switch and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. Overall, the present study deciphered the molecular/metabolic events associated with glucose-grown cells of strain JA2 and also unraveled how a carbon source modulates the metabolic phenotypes. SIGNIFICANCE: Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (APB) exhibit incredible metabolic flexibility leading to diverse phenotypes. They thrive under diverse habitat using an array of inorganic/organic compounds as carbon sources, yet their metabolic adaptation to varying carbon regime is mostly unexplored. Present study uncovered the proteomic insights of the cellular responses of strain JA2 to changing carbon sources viz. malate and glucose under photoheterotrophic conditions. Our study suggests that carbon source can also determine the metabolic fate of the cells and reshape the energy dynamics of APB. Here, for the first time study highlighted the plausible carbon source (glucose) mediated regulation of photosynthesis in APB. The study sheds light on the plausible cellular events and adaptive metabolic strategies employed by strain JA2 in presence of non-preferred carbon source. It also revealed new insights into the metabolic plasticity of APB to the changing milieu.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p></html>
