We found that in diffuse large -cell lymphoma, the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, patients with higher body mass index had significantly longer overall survival. Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma usually have worse outcomes than those with diffuse large -cell lymphoma. Nonetheless, the association between body mass index at diagnosis and survival in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma remains unclear.This retrospective study included 411 peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients from January 2010 to July 2017. Patients were stratified by body mass index into low body mass index (<24.0 kg/m2) and high body mass index (≥24.0 kg/m2) groups. We mainly used Cox modelling and the Kaplan-Meier method to evaluate survival and other variables.Multivariate analysis demonstrated that body mass index, international prognostic index and triglyceride level were independent prognostic factors of overall survival. Interestingly, patients with high body mass index had significantly longer overall survival (P < 0.01), with 69% of patients alive at 3 years versus 43% in the low body mass index group. Cox analysis showed reduced mortality in the high body mass index group compared with the low body mass index group (hazard ratio = 0.511, 95% CI, 0.309-0.846, P = 0.009). In addition, patients with high body mass index and low international prognostic index had the longest overall survival (P < 0.001).High body mass index at the time of diagnosis was associated with improved overall survival in Chinese peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, little is known about its direct impact on the liver.To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of AITC in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (commonly referred to as NAFLD).To establish a mouse and cellular model of NAFLD, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk, and AML-12 cells were treated with 200 μM palmitate acid for 24 h. For AITC treatment, mice were administered AITC (100 mg/kg/d) orally and AML-12 cells were treated with AITC (20 μmol/L).AITC significantly ameliorated HFD-induced weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation . Furthermore, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were markedly reduced in AITC-treated mice. Mechanistically, AITC significantly downregulated the protein levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and its lipogenesis target genes and upregulated the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as the upstream mediators Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα), in the livers of HFD-fed mice. AITC also attenuated the nuclear factor kappa  (NF-κ) signaling pathway. Consistently, AITC relieved palmitate acid-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation in AML-12 cells  through the Sirt1/AMPK and NF-κ signaling pathways. Importantly, further studies showed that the curative effect of AITC on lipid accumulation was abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Sirt1 or AMPKα in AML-12 cells.AITC significantly ameliorates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by activating the Sirt1/AMPK pathway and inhibiting the NF-κ pathway. Therefore, AITC is a potential therapeutic agent for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531343>Effect of Chronic Consumption of Sweeteners on Microbiota and Immunity in the Small Intestine of Young Mice.</a></h2><p>The consumption of sweeteners has increased as a measure to reduce the consumption of calories and thus combat  and diabetes. Sweeteners are found in a large number of products, so chronic consumption has been little explored. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of chronic sweetener consumption on the microbiota and immunity of the small intestine in young mice. We used 72 CD1 mice of 21 days old, divided into 3 groups: (i) No treatment, (ii) Group A (6 weeks of treatment), and (iii) Group  (12 weeks of treatment). Groups A and  were divided into 4 subgroups: Control (CL), Sucrose (Suc), Splenda® (Spl), and Svetia® (Sv). The following were determined: anthropometric parameters, percentage of lymphocytes of Peyer's patches and lamina propria, IL-6, IL-17, leptin, resistin, C-peptide, and TNF-. From feces, the microbiota of the small intestine was identified. The BMI was not modified; the mice preferred the consumption of Splenda® and Svetia®. The percentage of CD3 lymphocytes in Peyer's patches was increased. In the lamina propria, Svetia® increased the percentage of CD3 lymphocytes, but Splenda® decreases it. The Splenda® and Svetia® subgroups elevate leptin, C-peptide, IL-6, and IL-17, with reduction of resistin. The predominant genus in all groups was . The chronic consumption of sweeteners increases the population of lymphocytes in the mucosa of the small intestine.

Recently, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR)-derived glycoprotein profiles have emerged as potential biomarkers that reflect systemic inflammation in type 2 diabetes, , and other pathological processes. The aim of this work is to study plasma glycoprotein profiles as metabolic/inflammatory biomarkers underlying PCOS and its association with inflammation and . We used H-NMR spectroscopy to study five glycoprotein variables, namely GlycA, GlycB, and GlycF and the height-to-width (/) ratio of GlycA and GlycB, in 17 women with PCOS (9 non-obese and 8 obese), 17 control women (9 non-obese and 8 obese), and 19 healthy men (10 non-obese and 9 obese). / ratios of GlycA and GlycB, but not glycoprotein areas, were specifically associated with PCOS independently of . When considered as a whole, obese subjects presented higher GlycA, GlycB, and GlycF areas and higher / GlycA and GlycB ratios than their non-obese counterparts. All glycoprotein variables were associated with hsCRP, IL-6, and TNF-α, showing different correlations among PCOS, women, and men. Our present exploratory results suggest that H-NMR-derived glycoprotein profiles might serve as novel diagnostic markers of low-grade chronic inflammation in women with PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652933>The Expression/Methylation Profile of Adipogenic and Inflammatory Transcription Factors in Adipose Tissue Are Linked to -Related Colorectal Cancer.</a></h2><p> is well accepted as crucial risk factor that plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). More specifically, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in people with  could produce chronic inflammation and an altered profile expression of key transcription factors that promote a favorable microenvironment to colorectal carcinogenesis. For this, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between adipogenic and inflammatory transcription factors in VAT from nonobese, obese, and/or CRC patients. To test this idea, we studied the expression and methylation of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein type alpha (C/EBP-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated  cells (NF-κ) in VAT from non-obese control, non-obese CRC subjects, overweight/obese control, and overweight/obese CRC patients and their correlation with anthropometric and biochemical variables. We found decreased expression of C/EBP-α in overweight/obese CRC patients in comparison with overweight/obese control subjects. PGC-1α and NF-κ were overexpressed in CRC patients independently of the BMI. NF-κ promoter was hypomethylated in overweight/obese CRC patients when compared to overweight/obese control individuals. In addition, multiple significant correlations between expression, methylation, and biochemical parameters were found. Finally, linear regression analysis showed that the expression of C/EBP-α and NF-κ and that NF-κ methylation were associated with CRC and able to explain up to 55% of CRC variability. Our results suggest that visceral adipose tissue may be a key factor in tumor development and inflammatory state. We propose C/EBP-α, PGC-1α and NF-κ to be interesting candidates as potential biomarkers in adipose tissue for CRC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639604>Environmental exposure to perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate in relation to : A population-based study.</a></h2><p>Perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate are well-known thyroid disrupters and may contribute to changes in body weight. However, the associations between environmental exposure to these chemicals and -related outcomes remain unclear.We aim to examine the urinary levels of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate and their associations with  and abdominal  in the U.S.Here, we investigated the data of 16,265 adults aged 20-85 years from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2001-2014. Urinary levels of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate were measured by ion chromatography combined with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.  and abdominal  were defined by the body mass index and waist circumference, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations.Overall, 5794 (35.6%) cases of  and 9090 cases (55.9%) of abdominal  were observed among the participants. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, urinary nitrate was inversely associated with  (p = 0.0022 for trend), while urinary thiocyanate was positively related to  (p < 0.001 for trend). Compared with the lowest quartile, the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across increasing quartiles were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-1.08), 0.88 (0.75-1.03), and 0.74 (0.60-0.90) for urinary nitrate and 1.31 (1.16-1.48), 1.53 (1.36-1.73), and 1.73 (1.47-2.03) for urinary thiocyanate. Urinary perchlorate was not correlated with . Similar associations were also found between exposure to these chemicals and abdominal .A higher exposure to urinary nitrate was associated with a lower risk of , while a positive association was observed for urinary thiocyanate.

Diabetes mellitus was induced in fasting male Wistar rats by single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg /kg .w.) dissolved in citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Ten days after STZ injection, the diabetic rats were treated with enalapril (25 mg/l of drinking water) and/or paricalcitol (8 μg/kg .w. per os) dissolved in 5% DMSO daily for 4 weeks. The obtained data revealed that the treatment of diabetic Wistar rats with enalapril and/or paricalcitol led to significant decreases in the elevated serum urea, uric acid, creatinine, sodium and potassium levels; thereby reflecting the improvement of the impaired kidney function. The deteriorated kidney lipid peroxidation, GSH content and GST and catalase activities in diabetic rats were significantly ameliorated as a result of treatment with enalapril and/or paricalcitol. The elevated fasting and post-prandial serum glucose levels and the lowered serum insulin and C-peptide levels were also improved. The treatment with enalapril and paricalcitol in combination was the most potent in decreasing the elevated serum glucose levels. Moreover, the treatment of diabetic rats successfully prevented the diabetes-induced histopathological deleterious changes of kidney and islets of Langerhans of pancreas. In association, the immunohistochemically detected pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and apoptotic mediators, p53 and caspase-3, were remarkably decreased in kidney of diabetic rats as a result of treatment while the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that enalapril and paricalcitol alone or in combination can prevent STZ diabetes-induced nephropathy through amelioration of the glycemic state and antioxidant defense system together with the suppression of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. However, the treatment of diabetic rats with enalapril and paricalcitol in combination has no further significant improvement effects on renal function and damage when compared with enalapril or paclitaxel treated diabetic groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451058> Prevention Worksite Wellness Interventions for Health Care Workers: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p> Health care workers face elevated risk of  due to their unique work requirements.

Experimental and quasi-experimental studies published in English (between 2000 and 2018) that (a) were worksite interventions, () had intervention directed toward health care employees, and (c) reported weight-related outcomes were included. We excluded commercial weight loss studies. Two coders extracted data on the following: purpose, key study characteristics, design, type and dosage of intervention, outcome measure(s), attrition rate, and risk of bias. : Of the 51 studies included in this review, the majority (75%,  = 38) targeted diet and physical activity behaviors. The majority reported improved weight outcomes in favor of the intervention. Overall, moderate- to high-intensity behavioral strategies, using any mode of intervention delivery (phone, face-to-face, or Internet), delivered by a trained professional were effective in improving weight-related outcomes. Environmental strategies were effective in improving healthier habits. Self-directed strategies worked better for motivated employees. : Multicomponent interventions offered in health care settings may be successful in improving employee weight. Across study designs, several gaps in the reporting of intervention design, dosage, fidelity, and system-level outcomes were found. : Occupational health professionals should continue to be creative in developing multicomponent interventions (combining behavioral/educational, environmental, and organizational support) and use evidence guidance frameworks/tools to design an intervention and report dosage outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31473560>Application of screening methods for weight-loss compounds and identification of new impurities in counterfeit drugs.</a></h2><p>With the increasing prevalence of , the use of counterfeit drugs for weight loss is widespread owing to their easy and rapid availability. Since counterfeit weight-loss drugs are not prepared under the rigorous standard of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), they pose a risk to public health and cause significant side effects. To counteract the risk posed by counterfeit drugs, we investigated counterfeit weight-loss drugs seized by the Incheon Customs Services using UHPLC-PDA. Five of 23 confiscated samples with distinctive pink-coloured coating contained levothyroxine, sennoside A and , and phenolphthalein in amounts ranging from 0.03-132.40 mg/g. In addition, three unknown compounds in one of the adulterated samples containing phenolphthalein were structurally elucidated by several analytical techniques. Their accurate masses corresponded to molecular formula of CHO, CHO, and CHO, respectively. These compounds were identified as impurities, possibly produced during the synthesis of phenolphthalein or by improper removal during purification. These impurities were detected for the first time in counterfeit drugs.Copyright © 2019.

Previous studies show that whey protein (WP) and dietary fiber may separately reduce postprandial TG. However, few studies have investigated the long-term effects of WP and dietary fiber on postprandial TG. We aimed to investigate the separate and combined long-term effects of WP and dietary fiber from wheat bran on postprandial TG and markers of lipid metabolism in subjects with abdominal . We conducted a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel intervention study. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, 73 adults were randomized to receive 60 g/day of either WP hydrolysate or maltodextrin (MD) combined with high-fiber wheat bran products (HiFi; 30 g dietary fiber/day) or low-fiber refined wheat products (LoFi; 10 g dietary fiber/day). A high-fat meal test was conducted before and after the intervention. Sixty-five subjects were included in the final analyses. There were no differences between intervention groups in postprandial TG assessed as incremental area under the curve (iAUC). WP-LoFi had reduced postprandial TG assessed as total area under the curve (tAUC) and reduced fasting TG compared with all other groups, and reduced fasting apolipoprotein -48 compared with MD-LoFi. There were no changes in lipoprotein lipase activity. Total cholesterol and apolipoprotein -100 were reduced after WP intake compared with MD. Total cholesterol was increased after HiFi intake compared with LoFi. In conclusion, intake of WP in combination with low-fiber cereal products for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on postprandial TG tAUC and fasting TG, but not on postprandial TG iAUC in subjects with abdominal . Combining WP with high-fiber wheat bran products did not improve lipid profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31544118>Association of ABO blood types and novel  markers in healthy adolescents.</a></h2><p>Association of ABO blood type with body mass index (BMI) was explored in the past studies, but literature on association of novel  markerssuch as total body fat and lean body mass (LBM) is scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship of ABO blood types with novel  markers in normal adolescents.A cross-sectional study was done on 387 medical students. Bio-impedance analysis (BIA)-derived novel  markers such as body fat percent (BFP) and lean body mass (LBM) were recorded. Blood typing was done using slide-agglutination method. Mean and SD were calculated; analysis of variance and Chi-square (χ) correlation were used to determine the relationship between ABO blood types and  markers.Highest propensity for BFP and LBM was seen in blood groups AB and  (25.09 ± 8.92 and 44.45 ± 6.91) respectively. Highly significant ( < 0.001) differences were observed in the values of BFP and LBM in normal and obese participants across ABO blood types. Prevalence of  did not show significant relationship (χ = 2.069;  = 0.913) with ABO blood types.Unlike BMI, novel  markers (BFP and LBM) significantly differ across ABO blood groups in normal and obese population.

We evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI) on bleeding volume and transfusions in patients undergoing on-pump CABG.We investigated 1,050 patients, aged 24 years to 83 years, who underwent isolated, primary CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from September 2017 to July 2018. We recorded preoperative medical and laboratory coagulation parameters, intraoperative data, and postoperative bleeding volume for 24 hours following surgery. Primary endpoint was bleeding volume within 24 hours and transfusions after surgery. We analyzed the correlation between bleeding volume within 24 hours and transfusions after surgery and preoperative data with univariate and multivariate linear regression and logistic regression.Old age significantly increased postoperative transfusions (OR = 1.035 95% CI 1.013-1.058, P = .002), whereas higher BMI (OR = 0.897 95% CI 0.848-0.949, P < .001) and higher hemoglobin (HGB) (OR = 0.966 95% CI 0.954-0.978, P < 0.001) decreased postoperative transfusions.

However, little is known about its prevalence, specifically in low-income populations. The objective of this study was to estimate the extent of ACEs in a low-income, nonclinical, uninsured adult population and assess the relationship between ACEs and cardiovascular disease risk factors.This study leverages the OHIE's (Oregon Health Insurance Experiment) study population, uninsured adults who were randomly selected to apply for Medicaid, and data collected through in-person health screenings. We objectively measured , cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking, physical activity, and history of chronic disease were self-reported. Independent variables were the 10-item ACEs questions covering neglect, abuse, and household dysfunction. The sample consisted of 12 229 low-income, nonelderly uninsured adults who participated in the OHIE health screenings from 2009 to 2010. A total of 5929 (48%) returned a follow-up survey reporting ACEs in 2012. ACEs were more prevalent in low-income adults compared with previous estimates in a general clinical population, with notably high rates of emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and household dysfunction. ACEs were statistically associated with higher rates of , smoking, and physical inactivity, but not high cholesterol or diabetes mellitus. We detected a strong relationship between ACEs and a self-reported history of a hypertension diagnosis but no statistically significant differences in being hypertensive.This study design allowed us to assess the prevalence of ACEs among uninsured low-income adults and the association between ACEs and clinical indicators of cardiovascular disease risk that are difficult to ordinarily observe. Low-income adults have high rates of ACEs than previous prevalence estimates and ACEs were associated with higher rates of multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors. As states continue to expand Medicaid to the previously uninsured, providers may want to consider incorporating trauma-based approaches to care delivery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641635>Comparison of the Different PCOS Phenotypes Based on Clinical Metabolic, and Hormonal Profile, and their Response to Clomiphene.</a></h2><p>To compare the different polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) phenotypes based on their clinical, metabolic, hormonal profile, and their differential response to clomiphene.Prospective observational study.Infertility clinic, a government hospital.164 women with PCOS-related infertility.Sample population was divided into four phenotypes based on the NIH (National Institute of Health) consensus panel criteria.

Also, the response to clomiphene citrate was studied as presence or absence of ovulation.The prevalence of phenotypes A, , C, and D were 67.7%, 11%, 17.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. Phenotype A had significantly higher weight, body mass index, clinical, and biochemical hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, ovarian reserve parameters, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and more deranged lipid profile ( < 0.05). Clomiphene resistance was significantly more common in phenotype A ( < 0.05). No significant differences were noted in the waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and blood sugar values (fasting, 1-hour postprandial, 2-hour postprandial). Also, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), LH-FSH ratio, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different among various PCOS phenotypes.Full-blown PCOS (phenotype A) is at a higher risk of adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes as compared with the others, and phenotype D is the least severe phenotype.

Five strategies studied were: (a) no f/u ultrasound (US) but direct to fetal echocardiography (FE), () 1 f/u US and then FE if cardiac views were still suboptimal, (c) up to 2 f/u US and then FE if cardiac views were still suboptimal, (d) 1 f/u US and no FE, and (e) up to 2 f/u US and no FE. The models identified fetuses with major CHD in a theoretical cohort of 4,000,000 births. Outcomes related to neonatal mortality and neuro-developmental disability were calculated. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Base case, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation were performed.In our base-case models for all BMI groups, no f/u US and direct referral to FE led to the best outcomes, detecting 7%, 25%, and 82% more CHD for non-obese, obese, and Class III obese respectively, compared to the baseline strategy, 1 f/u US and no FE. However, no f/u US and direct referral to FE was over the $100,000/QALY threshold and therefore not cost-effective. The cost-effective strategy for all BMI groups was up to 1 f/u US and no FE. Both 2 f/u US and no FE and 2 f/u and FE were dominated (more costly and less effective), while 1 f/u and FE was over the cost-effectiveness threshold. 1 f/u US and no FE was the optimal strategy in 97%, 93%, and 86% of trials in Monte Carlo for the non-obese, obese, and Class III obese models respectively.For both non-obese and obese women, the optimal CHD screening strategy is no further US and immediate referral to FE; however, this strategy is not cost-effective. Considering costs, 1 f/u US and no FE is the preferred strategy. For both obese and non-obese women, Monte Carlo simulations were very clear that 1 f/u US and no FE was the optimal strategy. Both non-obese and obese women should be offered up to 1 f/u ultrasounds if fetal cardiac screening is not completed. This article is protected by copyright.

The most significant discoveries in hepatology have been that of hepatitis  virus in 1963 and hepatitis C virus in 1989, which have both been shown to be predominantly blood borne diseases. Hepatitis  and C infections result in long term carrier state and a high propensity to develop liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis  is the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer in Malaysia. Blood bank screening and public health preventive measures have reduced the disease burden significantly and an effective vaccination for hepatitis  is now incorporated in our National Immunisation Programme. Although no vaccine is available for hepatitis C, highly effective eradication therapies were introduced in 2011. These agents will significantly change the disease scenario across the world. A "new" disease was described in 1980, by Ludwig et al.-non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) disease. With the global epidemic of  and diabetes mellitus, NAFLD is set to increase exponentially across the world including in Malaysia. It will be the most important liver disease in the future, replacing hepatitis  and C infections.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597196>International trends in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence, 1978-2012.</a></h2><p>Primary liver cancer, the major histology of which is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. We comprehensively examine recent international trends of primary liver cancer and HCC incidence using population-based cancer registry data. Incidence for all primary liver cancer and for HCC by calendar time and birth cohort was examined for selected countries between 1978 and 2012. For each successive 5-year period, age-standardized incidence rates were calculated from Volumes V to XI of the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) series using the online electronic databases, CI5plus. Large variations persist in liver cancer incidence globally. Rates of liver cancer remain highest in Asian countries, specifically in the East and South-East, and Italy. However, rates in these high-risk countries have been decreasing in recent years. Rates in India and in most countries of Europe, the Americas, and Oceania are rising. As the population seroprevalence of hepatitis  virus (HBV) continues to decline, we anticipate rates of HCC in many high-risk countries will continue to decrease. Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is likely to bring down rates further in some high-rate, as well as low-rate, countries with access to effective therapies. However, such gains in the control of liver cancer risk are at risk of being reversed by the growing  and diabetes epidemics, suggesting diabetes treatment and primary prevention of  will be key in reducing liver cancer in the longer-term.

We aimed to evaluate the associations of race, genotype, prenatal factors, and postnatal factors with IMCL in early childhood.This study was a secondary analysis performed on the GUSTO birth cohort. Soleus muscle IMCL of 392 children at 4.5 years of age was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, of which usable imaging data were obtained from 277 children (137 Chinese, 87 Malays, and 53 Indians). Metabolic assessments (fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR) were performed at age 6.The mean IMCL level at 4.5 years was 0.481 ± 0.279% of water resonance (mean ± sd). Corroborating with results from adults, Indian children had the highest IMCL levels compared with Malay and Chinese children. Among the prenatal factors, the rate of gestational weight gain (GWG rate) was associated with offspring IMCL ( = 0.396 (0.069, 0.724); p = 0.018). Both race and GWG rate continued to be associated with offspring IMCL even after accounting for current offspring BMI. Postnatally, IMCL was associated with shorter breastfeeding duration ( = 0.065 (0.001, 0.128); p = 0.045) and conditional relative weight gain between ages 2 and 3 ( = 0.052 (0.012, 0.093); p = 0.012). The associations with postnatal factors were attenuated after adjusting for current offspring BMI. IMCL was positively associated with offspring BMI ( = 0.028 (0.012, 0.044); p = 0.001). IMCL levels were not associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR at age 6.This study provides evidence that IMCL accumulation occurs in early childhood and that developmental factors and race are associated with it. We also show that early childhood IMCL accumulation is well tolerated, suggesting that the adverse associations between IMCL and insulin resistance may emerge at older ages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559764>Dyslipidemia and Fat Distribution in Normal Weight Insulin Resistant Men.</a></h2><p>Although less common, insulin resistance and deranged lipids are also observed in normal weight individuals. Few studies have assessed body composition and lipid profiles in normal weight insulin resistant individuals.To assess differences in body composition and lipid profile in normal weight and overweight 40-60 years apparently healthy men with special reference to insulin resistance.Cross-sectional observational study in apparently healthy men (40-60 yrs) was performed. Anthropometry, body composition (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry scan), biochemical parameters (lipids, sugar and Insulin) were assessed. HOMA_IR was calculated. Subjects were grouped based on BMI and HOMA-IR for comparison.Of the 286 subjects 152 (53%) had BMI < 25 (group A) and 134 (47%) had BMI > 25 (group ). Homa-IR was more than 3 in 18% in and in 36% in . Group  had significantly higher fat, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, insulin and HOMA-IR. In subgroup analysis in group A, subjects with HOMA IR>3 (group A2) had significantly higher BMI, waist, TG, TG: HDL ratio, android and total fat and lower HDL as compared sub-group A1(HOMA IR<3) (p< 0.05). Mean BMI, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure were significantly higher in B2 than A2 group (p< 0.05). Although total, android and gynoid fat percentage were significantly higher in group B2, android to gynoid ratio was significantly higher in A2 (p< 0.05).No significant difference in lipids and fat distribution between insulin resistant and non-resistant subjects in overweight groups suggests that insulin resistance in overweight may be an extension of the pathological state related to . In contrast, significant differences in lipid and fat distribution in normal weight insulin resistant individuals may likely be due to a different mechanism.© Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571567>Surveillance Data of Eight Consecutive Flu Seasons in Sicily (Italy): What Have They Told Us?</a></h2><p>Influenza A and  outbreaks occur each year with different activity and molecular patterns. To date, knowledge of seasonal epidemiology remains a prerequisite not only to put in place the most effective immunization strategy against influenza but also to identify population groups at higher risk of developing serious complications. A retrospective analysis of influenza surveillance data from 2010 to 2018 aimed to explore the epidemiology of influenza in Sicily, at the primary care and hospital level. Overall, 6,740 patients with acute respiratory infection were tested, of which 3,032 (45.0%) were positive for influenza. The relative proportion of type A and  viruses markedly varied across seasons. Type A similarly spreads among children and adults, whereas type  was more commonly identified among pediatric population aged 5-9 years. The median age of confirmed influenza cases differed by health-care setting, increasing according to disease severity (range: 8-54 years). Among influenza-confirmed cases, more than 80% of hospitalized patients had an underlying medical condition. Cardiovascular disease, lung disease, diabetes, and  were some of the most frequent. Overall, patients admitted to an intensive care unit were more likely to have multiple comorbidities and being infected with influenza infection strongly increased the risk of severe clinical outcomes. Understanding of the epidemiology of influenza and the molecular features of circulating viruses is of paramount importance to optimize prevention and control strategies. Knowledge of predictors for the occurrence of severe forms of the disease may help to address adequate preventive measures to high-risk population groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469472>Is there a link between progranulin, , and parameters of the metabolic syndrome in children?

As a control, we determined progranulin in 23 normal-weight children.The progranulin concentrations did not differ significantly (P = .795) between obese and normal-weight children. Progranulin concentrations decreased significantly during and after the lifestyle intervention in children with and without decrease of BMI-SDS. There was no relationship between progranulin concentrations and pubertal stage or gender. Progranulin was not significantly associated with insulin resistance HOMA, parameters of the MetS or transaminases both in cross-sectional and longitudinal multiple linear regression analyses adjusted to multiple confounders. Progranulin was significantly, negatively related to age (-coefficient -1.24 ± .97, P = .012, r = .07).Our data do not support the hypothesis that progranulin is an important link between , insulin resistance, and MetS in childhood.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Nevertheless, the process of bone matrix mineralization is still an unsolved mystery. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder associated with genetic and environmental risk factors; however, the majority of genes associated with osteoporosis remain largely unknown. Several signaling pathways regulate bone mass; therefore, dysregulation of a single signaling pathway leads to metabolic bone disease owing to high or low bone mass. Parathyroid hormone, core-binding factor α-1 (Cbfa1), Wnt/β-catenin, the receptor activator of the nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) ligand (RANKL), myostatin, and osteogenic exercise signaling pathways play pivotal roles in the regulation of bone mass. The myostatin signaling pathway increases bone resorption by activating the RANKL signaling pathway, whereas osteogenic exercise inhibits myostatin and sclerostin while inducing irisin that consequentially activates the Cbfa1 and Wnt/β-catenin bone formation pathways. The aims of this review are to summarize what is known about osteoporosis-related signaling pathways; define the role of these pathways in osteoporosis drug discovery; focus light on the link between bone, muscle, pancreas, and adipose integrative physiology and osteoporosis; and underline the emerging role of osteogenic exercise in the prevention of, and care for, osteoporosis, , and diabetes.© 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456645>Preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy in patients without reflux symptoms undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: utility or futility?</a></h2><p>To evaluate the value of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) as a preoperative investigation in individuals without symptoms of Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) who will undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).After Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, patients scheduled for LSG were prospectively enrolled in the study between January 2016 and March 2018. Patients with symptoms of GERD were excluded from the study. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: individuals who underwent EGD before the surgery as a usual routine investigation (Group A), and individuals who were scheduled without preoperative EGD (Group ). Patient demographics, endoscopic findings, endoscopic biopsy results, and histopathological findings of the resected parts of the stomach after LSG were analyzed and recorded. Additionally, operative characteristics and outcomes, and follow up findings were recorded and analyzed with appropriate statistical methods.A total of 219 individuals without symptoms of GERD underwent LSG were enrolled. Group A included 111 individuals (25 males and 86 females). Group  comprised 108 individuals (20 males and 88 females). The mean age and mean Body Mass Index (BMI) were similar in both groups. From Group A, 86 out of 111 individuals (77.5%) had no pathology identified on EGD, while 21 individuals (18.9%) were found to have areas of gastric erythema and biopsies showed active gastritis. All LSG operations were performed without any major complication. After one year, all individuals were assessed for the presence of symptomatic GERD and no significant difference was found between the two groups.Preoperative EGD may not be mandatory for asymptomatic GERD individuals undergoing LSG as post-operative complications and early follow up for GERD symptoms are not significantly different.

HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with  and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR).We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2  Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources - Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and () the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of  and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (F1) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second  dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database.Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2  challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with F1-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and F1-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals' judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively. The MIMIC-III  dataset was successfully integrated for prediction with minimal configuration of the NLP2FHIR pipeline and machine learning models.The study demonstrated that the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping approach could effectively identify the state of  and multiple comorbidities using semi-structured discharge summaries. Our FHIR-based phenotyping approach is a first concrete step towards improving the data aspect of phenotyping portability across EHR systems and enhancing interpretability of the machine learning-based phenotyping algorithms.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the present study is to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of ATG7 in  development. Serum and liver samples from mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) were evaluated for metabolic profile data and ATG expressions during  development. We found that compared with other ATGs, ATG7 expression increased earlier with lower hepatic insulin sensitivity in the 4-wk HFD-fed mice. For  analyses, silencing ATG7 significantly up-regulated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of protein kinase  (Akt) and down-regulated phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in HepG2 cells. Replenishing PTEN to ATG7-silenced hepatocytes restored the phosphorylated Akt level. Furthermore, ATG7 silencing led to higher c-JUN expression, which transcriptionally reduced PTEN expression.

The resident-intruder paradigm was superimposed to trigger PS. In vivo left ventricular (LV) performance was evaluated by echocardiography and pressure-volume loops. Behaviour was indagated by elevated plus maze (EPM) and Y-maze. LV myocardium was assayed for apoptosis, fibrosis, vessel density and oxidative stress. Hippocampus was analyzed for volume, neurogenesis, GABAergic markers and astrogliosis. Cardiac and hippocampal BDNF and TrkB levels were measured by ELISA and WB. We investigated the pathogenetic role played by BDNF signaling in additional cardiac-selective TrkB (cTrkB) KO mice.When combined,  and PS jeopardized LV performance, causing prominent apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress and remodeling of the larger coronary branches, along with lower BDNF and TrkB levels. HFD/PS weakened LV function similarly in WT and cTrkB KO mice. The latter exhibited elevated LV ROS emission already at baseline. /PS augmented anxiety-like behaviour and impaired spatial memory. These changes were coupled to reduced hippocampal volume, neurogenesis, local BDNF and TrkB content and augmented astrogliosis.PS and  synergistically deteriorate myocardial structure and function by depleting cardiac BDNF/TrkB content, leading to augmented oxidative stress. This comorbidity triggers behavioral deficits and induces hippocampal remodeling, potentially via lower BDNF and TrkB levels.

Higher nonhuman primates are the only animals with retinal structure similar to humans, including the presence of a macula and fovea. However, few nonhuman primate models of genetic retinal disease are known. We identified a lineage of rhesus macaques with a frameshift mutation in exon 3 of the BBS7 gene c.160delG (p.Ala54fs) that is predicted to produce a non-functional protein. In humans, mutations in this and other BBS genes cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a ciliopathy and a syndromic form of retinitis pigmentosa generally occurring in conjunction with kidney dysfunction, polydactyly, , and/or hypogonadism. Three full- or half-sibling monkeys homozygous for the BBS7 c.160delG variant, at ages 3.5, 4 and 6 years old, displayed a combination of severe photoreceptor degeneration and progressive kidney disease. In vivo retinal imaging revealed features of severe macular degeneration, including absence of photoreceptor layers, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and retinal vasculature atrophy. Electroretinography in the 3.5-year-old case demonstrated loss of scotopic and photopic a-waves and markedly reduced and delayed -waves. Histological assessments in the 4- and 6-year-old cases confirmed profound loss of photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons across the posterior retina, with dramatic thinning and disorganization of all cell layers, abundant microglia, absent or displaced RPE cells, and significant gliosis in the subretinal space. Retinal structure, including presence of photoreceptors, was preserved only in the far periphery. Ultrasound imaging of the kidneys revealed deranged architecture, and renal histopathology identified distorted contours with depressed, fibrotic foci and firmly adhered renal capsules; renal failure occurred in the 6-year-old case. Magnetic resonance imaging obtained in one case revealed abnormally low total brain volume and unilateral ventricular enlargement. The one male had abnormally small testes at 4 years of age, but polydactyly and  were not observed. Thus, monkeys homozygous for the BBS7 c.160delG variant closely mirrored several key features of the human BBS syndrome. This finding represents the first identification of a naturally-occurring nonhuman primate model of BBS, and more broadly the first such model of retinitis pigmentosa and a ciliopathy with an associated genetic mutation. This important new preclinical model will provide the basis for better understanding of disease progression and for the testing of new therapeutic options, including gene and cell-based therapies, not only for BBS but also for multiple forms of photoreceptor degeneration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias, and meta-regression was used to select risk factors for comparison between Eastern and Western studies.A total of 13 risk factors were selected from 25 case-control studies in 7 geographically diverse countries. The strongest risk factors for both iCCA and eCCA were biliary cysts and stones, cirrhosis, hepatitis  and hepatitis C. Choledochal cysts inferred the greatest risk of both iCCA and eCCA with pooled ORs of 26.71 (95% CI 15.80-45.16) and 34.94 (24.36-50.12), respectively. No significant associations were found between hypertension and  for either iCCA or eCCA. Comparing Eastern and Western populations, there was a difference for the association of hepatitis  with iCCA (coefficient = -0.15195; 95% CI -0.278 to -0.025; p = 0.022).This is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of CCA risk factors to date. Some risk factors, such as diabetes, although less strong, are increasing globally and may be contributing to rising rates of this cancer.Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a cancer arising in the bile ducts inside (intrahepatic CCA) and connected to the liver (extrahepatic CCA). It is a very aggressive cancer: 95% of patients die within 5 years. CCA rates are increasing globally, but the causes of CCA are poorly understood. The few risk factors that are known account for only a minority of cases. In this study, we found that the strongest risk factors for both intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA are cysts and stones in the bile ducts, cirrhosis, and hepatitis  and C viruses. Some risk factors for CCA, such as diabetes, although less strong, are increasing globally and may be contributing to rising rates of CCA.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice , insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κ negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κ expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA. Together, our studies identify an important role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in maintaining hepatic homeostasis by ameliorating steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress  the NF-κ-FGF21 or SREBP1c-FGF21 pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic scheme for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.-Zhou, L., Li, Q., Chen, A., Liu, N., Chen, N., Chen, X., Zhu, L., Xia, ., Gong, Y., Chen, X.

We identified the expression of a G protein-coupled receptor, Gpr17, in the ARH and hypothesized that it contributes to the regulatory function of POMC neurons on metabolism.In order to test this hypothesis, we generated POMC neuron-specific Gpr17 knockout (PGKO) mice and determined their energy and glucose metabolic phenotypes on normal chow diet (NCD) and high-fat diet (HFD).Adult PGKO mice on NCD displayed comparable body composition and metabolic features measured by indirect calorimetry. By contrast, PGKO mice on HFD demonstrated a sexually dimorphic phenotype with female PGKO mice displaying better metabolic homeostasis. Notably, female PGKO mice gained significantly less body weight and adiposity (p < 0.01), which was associated with increased energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and respiratory quotient, while males did not have an overt change in energy homeostasis. Though PGKO mice of both sexes had comparable glucose and insulin tolerance, detailed analyses of liver gene expression and serum metabolites indicate that PGKO mice could have reduced gluconeogenesis and increased lipid utilization on HFD. To elucidate the central-based mechanism(s) underlying the better-preserved energy and glucose homeostasis in PGKO mice on HFD, we examined the electrophysiological properties of POMC neurons and found Gpr17 deficiency led to increased spontaneous action potentials. Moreover, PGKO mice, especially female knockouts, had increased POMC-derived alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin despite a comparable level of prohormone POMC in their hypothalamic extracts.Gpr17 deficiency in POMC neurons protects metabolic homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner during dietary and aging challenges, suggesting that Gpr17 could be an effective anti- target in specific populations with poor metabolic control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31564186>Joint Associations of  and NT-proBNP With the Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation in the ARIC Study.</a></h2><p>Background Circulating NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro--type natriuretic peptide) levels, a well-known indicator of atrial wall stress and remodeling, inversely correlate with body mass index. Both are strongly predictive of atrial fibrillation (AF). Their potential interaction in relation to incident AF, however, has not been explored. Methods and Results In total, 9556 participants of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who had 2 measurements of NT-proBNP and no baseline AF or heart failure were followed from 1996 to 1998 through 2016 for the occurrence of incident AF. Participants were categorized as obese (body mass index ≥30) and nonobese (body mass index <30) and by NT-proBNP levels (using the median of 68.2 pg/mL as the cutoff). Over a median follow-up of 18.3 years, we identified 1806 incident cases of AF. Analysis using multivariable Cox regression models showed that obese participants with high NT-proBNP levels at visit 4 had a higher adjusted risk of incident AF (hazard ratio: 3.64; 95% CI, 3.15-4.22) compared with nonobese individuals with low NT-proBNP levels. The association of  with AF risk was not modified by NT-proBNP levels (=0.46 for interaction). Increasing BNP among participants from 1990-1992 to 1996-1998 was associated with increased AF risk. After further adjustment for clinical risk factors and medications, results were similar. Conclusions Individuals who had both elevated body mass index and NT-proBNP and were free of clinically recognized heart failure were at higher risk of AF development. Those who experienced an increase in NT-proBNP levels between visits 2 and 4 were at higher risk of AF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604621>Preoperative skin antisepsis using chlorhexidine may reduce surgical wound infections in lower limb trauma surgery when compared to povidone-iodine - a prospective randomized trial.</a></h2><p>For the prevention of surgical wound infections (SSIs), local microorganism counts can be lowered by skin antisepsis prior to surgical incisions. Until now, it has been unclear which antiseptic is the most effective.This prospective randomized trial analyzed the efficacy of 2 frequently used agents in the reduction of postoperative wound complication rates after aseptic trauma surgery on the lower leg and foot. In the study, 279 consecutive participants were randomized; 112 received surgical skin preparations using chlorhexidine (CHX) (ChloraPrep; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and 167 received preparations with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) (Braunoderm; . Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). Primary clinical endpoints were SSIs and wound healing disorders (WHDs) within 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcome variables included demographic and perioperative risk factors for SSIs.Rates of WHDs and SSIs were significantly higher in the PVP-I treatment group, which experienced 9 SSIs and 12 WHDs (n = 21; 12.6%), compared to the CHX treatment group, which had 2 SSIs and 3 WHDs (n = 5; 4.5%) (P = .022). Perioperative risk factors for WHDs were  and longer surgery time, whereas SSIs were increased in participants with cardiovascular diseases and suction drainage. Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of complications of wound healing were 3.5 times higher for PVP-I than for CHX (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-11.2; P = .032).Preoperative skin antisepsis for trauma surgery of the lower leg and foot using CHX led to significantly fewer complications of wound healing when compared to PVP-I.Copyright © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

In this sense, this work aims to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota modulation, degree of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, inflammation, gut permeability, and body composition.This double-blind, randomized clinical trial will include adult outpatients with a diagnosis of NASH confirmed by biopsy with or without transient elastography. All patients will undergo a complete anamnesis to investigate their alcohol consumption, previous history, medications, nutritional assessment (dietary intake and body composition), sarcopenia, physical activity level and physical and functional capacity, cardiovascular risk, biochemical parameters for assessment of inflammatory status, lipid profile, hepatic function, gut permeability, and assessment of microbiota. These procedures will be performed at baseline and repeated after 24 weeks (at the end of the study). Through the process of randomization, patients will be allocated to receive treatment A or treatment . Both patients and researchers involved will be blinded (double-blind study).

Angiogenesis is initiated by the detachment of pericytes (PCs) from vessels in AT. This process is necessary for the development of AT in . The detachment is caused by excessive platelet-derived growth factor  (PDGF-) derived from M1-macrophages (Mφ) infiltrating obese AT. On the other hand, AT of tamoxifen-induced systemic PDGF receptor-β knockout mice showed decreased detachment of PCs from vessels in , thereby attenuating hypertrophy of AT mediated by neoangiogenesis, resulting in protection from the development of chronic AT inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. The selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibitor eplerenone (Ep) suppresses chronic inflammation in fat and the liver, improves glucose and lipid metabolism, and inhibits body weight and fat mass gain in mice fed a high-fat diet. As a novel mechanism, Ep increases energy expenditure and suppresses fat accumulation, thereby controlling the polarity of visceral AT Mφ from inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 dominant. In addition, Ep directly inhibits the activation of signals 1 and 2 of NLRP3-inflammasomes in Mφ, which is an inflammatory mechanism closely involved in the development of NASH. Thus, we propose novel therapeutic approaches to NASH. Inhibition of PDGF receptor-β signaling prevents AT hypertrophy by regulating AT angiogenesis, and MR inhibitors directly suppress chronic inflammation in the AT and liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h2><p>Evidence has proven that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor contributing to  by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the -associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, 1H-indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indole acrylic acid and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic acid, l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome.

A formative process evaluation was conducted to assess the viability of a model using free vouchers in two districts of Mozambique to deliver MNP and motivate adherence to recommendations regarding its use. The evaluation consisted of (a) an examination of programme outcomes using a cross-sectional survey among caregivers of children 6-23 months (n = 1,028) and () an ethnographic study to investigate delivery experiences and MNP use from caregiver perspectives (n = 59), programme managers (n = 17), and programme implementers (n = 168). Using a mixed methods approach allowed exploration of unexpected programme outcomes and triangulation of findings. The survey revealed that receiving a voucher was the main implementation bottleneck. Although few caregivers received vouchers (11.5%, CI [9.7, 13.6]), one-fourth received MNP by bypassing the voucher system (26.3%, CI [23.6, 29.0]). Caregivers' narratives indicated that caregivers were motivated to redeem vouchers but encountered obstacles, including not knowing where or how to redeem them or finding MNP were not available at the shop. Observing these challenges, many programme implementers redeemed vouchers and distributed MNP to caregivers. Virtually, all caregivers who received MNP reported ever feeding it to their child. This study's findings are consistent with other studies across a range of contexts suggesting that although programmes are generally effective in motivating initial use, more attention is required to improve access to MNP and support continued use.© 2019 The Authors.

The safety of its oral consumption in humans is also determined.Mice are given high-fat diets (HFD) for 8 weeks. Thereafter, AvoB or vehicle is administered orally twice weekly for 5 weeks. AvoB inhibits FAO which led to improved glucose tolerance, glucose utilization, and insulin sensitivity. AvoB's effects on metabolism under lipotoxic conditions are evaluated in vitro in pancreatic β-islet cells and C2C12 myotubes. AvoB inhibits FAO and increases glucose oxidation, resulting in lowering of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that improves insulin responsiveness in C2C12 myotubes and insulin secretion in INS-1 (832/13) cells, respectively. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in healthy human participants is conducted to assess the safety of AvoB consumption (50 mg or 200 mg per day for 60 days).

Recent studies suggest that altered alternative splicing and, consequently, appearance of aberrant splicing variants, is a common feature of most tumor pathologies. Moreover, spliceosome is considered an attractive therapeutic target in tumor pathologies, and the inhibition of SF3B1 (e.g., using pladienolide-) has been shown to exert antitumor effects. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the expression levels of selected splicing-machinery components in 261 PitNETs (somatotropinomas/non-functioning PitNETS/corticotropinomas/prolactinomas) and evaluated the direct effects of pladienolide- in cell proliferation/viability/hormone secretion in human PitNETs cell cultures and pituitary cell lines (AtT-20/GH3). Results revealed a severe dysregulation of splicing-machinery components in all the PitNET subtypes compared to normal pituitaries and a unique fingerprint of splicing-machinery components that accurately discriminate between normal and tumor tissue in each PitNET subtype. Moreover, expression of specific components was associated with key clinical parameters. Interestingly, certain components were commonly dysregulated throughout all PitNET subtypes. Finally, pladienolide- reduced cell proliferation/viability/hormone secretion in PitNET cell cultures and cell lines. Altogether, our data demonstrate a drastic dysregulation of the splicing-machinery in PitNETs that might be associated to their tumorigenesis, paving the way to explore the use of specific splicing-machinery components as novel diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic targets in PitNETs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31539069>Church-based interventions to address  among African Americans and Latinos in the United States: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Multilevel church-based interventions may help address racial/ethnic disparities in  in the United States since churches are often trusted institutions in vulnerable communities. These types of interventions affect at least two levels of socio-ecological influence which could mean an intervention that targets individual congregants as well as the congregation as a whole. However, the extent to which such interventions are developed using a collaborative partnership approach and are effective with diverse racial/ethnic populations is unclear, and these crucial features of well-designed community-based interventions.The present systematic literature review of church-based interventions was conducted to assess their efficacy for addressing  across different racial/ethnic groups (eg, African Americans, Latinos).In total, 43 relevant articles were identified using systematic review methods developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Task Force on Community Preventive Services. The extent to which each intervention was developed using community-based participatory research principles, was tailored to the particular community in question, and involved the church in the study development and implementation were also assessed.Although 81% of the studies reported significant results for between- or within-group differences according to the study design, effect sizes were reported or could only be calculated in 56% of cases, and most were small. There was also a lack of diversity among samples (eg, few studies involved Latinos, men, young adults, or children), which limits knowledge about the ability of church-based interventions to reduce the burden of  more broadly among vulnerable communities of color. Further, few interventions were multilevel in nature, or incorporated strategies at the church or community level.Church-based interventions to address  will have greater impact if they consider the diversity among populations burdened by this condition and develop programs that are tailored to these different populations (eg, men of color, Latinos). Programs could also benefit from employing multilevel approaches to move the field away from behavioral modifications at the individual level and into a more systems-based framework. However, effect sizes will likely remain small, especially since individuals only spend a limited amount of time in this particular setting.© The Author(s) 2019.

Leptin increases blood pressure acting both centrally in the dorsomedial hypothalamus and peripherally. Sites of the peripheral hypertensive effect of leptin have not been identified. We previously reported that leptin enhanced activity of the carotid sinus nerve, which transmits chemosensory input from the carotid bodies (CB) to the medullary centers, and this effect was abolished by non-selective blockers of transient receptor potential (Trp) channels. We searched our mouse CB transcriptome database and found that theTrpm7 channel was the most abundant Trp channel.  To examine if leptin induces hypertension acting on the CB Trpm7.  C57BL/6J (n=79), leptin receptor () deficient  mice (n=22), and LepRb-EGFP (n=4) mice were used. CB  and  gene expression was determined and immunohistochemistry was performed; CB glomus cells were isolated and Trpm7-like current was recorded. Blood pressure (BP) was recorded continuously in (1) leptin-treated C57BL/6J mice with intact and denervated CB; (2) leptin-treated C57BL/6J mice, which also received a non-selective Trpm7 blocker FTY720 administered systemically or topically to the CB area; (3) leptin-treated C57BL/6J mice transfected with  shRNA to the CB, and (4)  deficient obese  mice before and after expression in CB. Leptin receptor and Trpm7 co-localized in the CB glomus cells. Leptin induced a non-selective cation current in these cells, which was inhibited by Trpm7 blockers. Leptin induced hypertension in C57BL/6J mice, which was abolished by CB denervation, Trpm 7 blockers and  shRNA applied to CBs.  over-expression in CB of -deficient  mice demethylated the  promoter, increased  gene expression and induced hypertension.

The aim of this study was to propose an Extended CIAF (ECIAF) that combines the characterization of malnutrition due to undernutrition and excess weight, and apply it in six Argentine provinces.ECIAF excludes children not in anthropometric failure (group A) and was calculated from a percentage of children included in malnutrition categories : wasting only; C: wasting and underweight; D: wasting, stunting and underweight; E: stunting and underweight; F: stunting only; Y: underweight only; G: only weight excess; and H: stunting and weight excess.Cross-sectional study conducted in Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chubut, Jujuy, Mendoza and Misiones (Argentina).10 879 children of both sexes aged between 3 and 13·99.ECIAF in preschool children (3 to 4·99 years) was 15·1 %. The highest prevalence was registered in Mendoza (16·7 %) and the lowest in Misiones (12·0 %). In school children (5 to 13·99 years) ECIAF was 28·6 %. Mendoza also recorded the highest rate (30·7 %), while Catamarca and Chubut had the lowest values (27·0 %). In the whole sample, about 25 % of the malnutrition was caused by undernutrition and 75 % by excess weight.The ECIAF summarizes anthropometric failure by both deficiency and excess weight and it highlights that a quarter of the malnutrition in the Argentine population was caused by undernutrition, although there are differences between Provinces (P < 0·05).

These breast cancer patients were then individually matched by age to control female group (1:2 ratios of cases and controls). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated via multivariable logistic regression by setting normal BMI range (18.5-22.9) as the reference group.In premenopausal women, the risk of breast cancer of triple-negative subtype increased (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.27-2.02) in obese II (BMI ≥ 30) women and in underweight women, it was Luminal A (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.45) and HER2 express subtype (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-1.62) that showed increased risk of breast cancer.

Middle-age (fourth to fifth decade) group, female gender, and  (body mass index > 40) are the most commonly reported risk-factors for this rare entity. In this study, we present our single center experience of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea discussing important clinicoradiological aspects in preoperative evaluation and nuances in the endoscopic repair technique.   A retrospective study conducted for 43 spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea patients admitted between Jan 2011 to Jan 2018 at our tertiary care center. All patients underwent endoscopic repair of the defect depending upon their site of leak.   Mean age in our study was 36.7 ± 12.3 years (range: 9-62 years). Average BMI in males was found lower (28.7) as compared with females (32). Most common site of CSF leak was cribriform plate (   = 32, 74.4%) and Planum was found to be the least common site (   = 1, 2.3%) of CSF leak. Intraoperatively, 23 (53.5%) patients showed high-flow leak. Intrathecal injection of fluorescein dye was used to identify the site of CSF leakage in 15 cases (34.8%).

However, addressing the exposure of food outlets is increasingly considered as an important adult  prevention strategy. Our study investigates associations between baseline food environment types and change in BMI over time. Survey data were used from the Yorkshire Health Study (n=8,864; wave one: 2010-2012, wave two: 2013-2015) for adults aged 18-86. BMI was calculated using self-reported height (cm) and weight (kg). Restaurants, cafés, fast-food, speciality, convenience and large supermarkets were identified from the Ordnance Survey Point of Interest database within 1600m radial buffer of home postcodes. K-means cluster analysis developed food environment typologies based on food outlets and population density. Large supermarkets, restaurants, cafés, fast-food, speciality and convenience food outlets all clustered together to some extent. Three neighbourhood typologies were identified. However, multilevel models revealed that relative to cluster one all were unrelated to change in BMI (cluster 2, = -0.146 [-0.274, 0.566]; cluster 3, = 0.065 [-0.224, 0.356]). There was also little evidence of gender-based differences in these associations when examined in a three-way interaction. Policymakers may need to begin to consider multiple types of food outlet clusters, while further research is needed to confirm how these relate to changed BMI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A series of reactions are involved in this process, including increased release of proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors. Among the therapeutic tools available nowadays, physical exercise (PE) has a known hypoglycemic effect explained by complex molecular mechanisms, including an increase in insulin receptor phosphorylation, in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, in the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) pathway, with subsequent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), Rac1, TBC1 domain family member 1 and 4 (TBC1D1 and TBC1D4), in addition to a variety of signaling molecules, such as GTPases, Rab and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. These pathways promote greater translocation of GLUT4 and consequent glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and some of its isoforms, such as PKC-iota/lambda also seem to play a fundamental role in the transport of glucose. In this sense, the association between autophagy and exercise has also demonstrated a relevant role in the uptake of muscle glucose. Insulin, in turn, uses a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism, while exercise signal may be triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The objective of this review is to describe the main molecular mechanisms of IR and the relationship between PE and glucose uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515283>Probing the CB Cannabinoid Receptor Binding Pocket with AM6538, a High-Affinity Irreversible Antagonist.</a></h2><p>Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB) is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pain,  and -related metabolic disorders, and addiction. The crystal structure of human CB has been determined in complex with the stabilizing antagonist AM6538. In the present study, we characterize AM6538 as a tight-binding/irreversible antagonist of CB, as well as two derivatives of AM6538 (AM4112 and AM6542) as slowly dissociating CB antagonists across binding simulations and cellular signaling assays. The long-lasting nature of AM6538 was explored in vivo wherein AM6538 continues to block CP55,940-mediated behaviors in mice up to 5 days after a single injection. In contrast, the effects of SR141716A abate in mice 2 days after injection.

In a sample of 1818 participants (52% female, mean age 54±12 years) global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GL-PSS, n = 1218), systolic (GL-SSR, n = 1506), and early (GL-EDSR, n = 1506) and late diastolic strain rates (GL-LDSR, n = 1500) were derived from 2D speckle tracking analysis. From a subgroup of 323 individuals without any cardiovascular risk factor, sex- and age-specific reference values were computed. GL-PSS, GL-SSR, and GL-EDSR were associated with sex, GL-EDSR decreased and GL-LDSR increased with age. In the total sample, dyslipidemia was associated with altered GL-PSS, GL-SSR, and GL-EDSR in women but not in men, whereas  was associated with less favorable GL-PSS and GL-EDSR in either sex. Hypertension impacted more adversely on systolic and diastolic myocardial deformation in women compared to men (all p<0.01).The female myocardium appeared more vulnerable to high blood pressure and dyslipidemia when compared to men, while  was associated with adverse myocardial deformation in either sex.

Hypertension could have its origin in childhood and go undetected unless specially looked for during this period. With globalization bringing more lifestyle modifications, adolescents are exposed to multiple risk factors including , diet, academic stress, lack of physical work apart from hereditary risk factors. Early diagnosis of hypertension is an important strategy in its control, effective treatment and prevention of complications. This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Department of Paediatrics, Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, Sylhet during the period from January 2014 to June 2014. One thousand (1000) school children aged 12-16 years in Sylhet Metropolitan City were included according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were all school children aged 12-16 years in Sylhet Metropolitan City. School children aged under 12 or above 16 years and with any systemic disorder were excluded. This study showed that prevalence of hypertension in school going children of Sylhet city was 0.70% and there was a significant relationship of hypertension with the , family history of hypertension, dietary habit and physical activity.

This study examined the impact of prepregnancy BMI and GWG on early childhood neurodevelopment in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns study. Maternal prepregnancy weight was obtained by self-report, and GWG was assessed from participant medical charts. At child age 3 years, the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Intelligence were completed. Sex-stratified linear regression models assessed associations between prepregnancy BMI and pregnancy weight gain z-scores with child PDI and MDI scores, adjusting for covariates. Of 382 women, 48.2% were normal weight before pregnancy, 24.1% overweight, 23.0% obese, and 4.7% underweight. At 3 years, mean scores on the PDI and MDI were higher among girls compared to boys (PDI: 102.3 vs. 97.2, P = 0.0002; MDI: 92.8 vs. 88.3, P = 0.0001). In covariate-adjusted models, maternal  was markedly associated with lower PDI scores in boys [ = -7.81, 95% CI: (-13.08, -2.55), P = 0.004], but not girls. Maternal BMI was not associated with MDI in girls or boys, and GWG was not associated with PDI or MDI among either sex (all-P > 0.05).

Participation of FcγRIIB was interrogated in mice with global or endothelial cell-specific deletion of the receptor.  was induced by high fat diet (HFD) and BP was measured by radiotelemetry or tail cuff. The relative sialylation of the Fc glycan on mouse IgG, which influences IgG activation of Fc receptors, was evaluated by SNAlectin blotting. Effects of IgG on endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) were assessed in human aortic endothelial cells. IgG Fc glycan sialylation was interrogated in 3442 human subjects by mass spectrometry, and the relationship between sialylation and BP was evaluated. Effects of normalizing IgG sialylation were determined in HFD-fed mice administered the sialic acid precursor N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc).  Mice deficient in  cells were protected from -induced hypertension. Compared to IgG from control chow-fed mice, IgG from HFD-fed mice was hyposialylated, and it raised BP when transferred to recipients lacking IgG; the hypertensive response was absent if recipients were FcγRIIB-deficient. Neuraminidase (NA)-treated IgG lacking the Fc glycan terminal sialic acid also raised BP. In cultured endothelial cells, via FcγRIIB, IgG from HFD-fed mice and NAtreated IgG inhibited VEGF activation of eNOS by altering eNOS phosphorylation. In humans  was associated with lower IgG sialylation, and systolic BP was inversely related to IgG sialylation. Mice deficient in FcγRIIB in endothelium were protected from -induced hypertension. Furthermore, in HFD-fed mice, ManNAc normalized IgG sialylation and prevented -induced hypertension.  Hyposialylated IgG and FcγRIIB in endothelium are critically involved in obesityinduced hypertension in mice, and supportive evidence was obtained in humans. Interventions targeting these mechanisms, such as ManNAc supplementation, may provide novel means to break the link between  and hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464524> aqueous extract improves insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis in rodent model of fructose-induced metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p> Fructose consumption is associated with the development of  and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in human and animal models.

To address food access, in 2015 the Minneapolis Staple Foods Ordinance became the first policy requiring food stores to stock minimum quantities and varieties of 10 categories of healthy foods/beverages, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains and other staples, through licensing. This study examined whether: (a) stores complied, () overall healthfulness of store environments improved, (c) healthy customer purchases increased, and (d) healthfulness of home food environments improved among frequent small store shoppers.Data for this natural (or quasi) experiment were collected at four times: pre-policy (2014), implementation only (no enforcement, 2015), enforcement initiation (2016) and continued monitoring (2017). In-person store assessments were conducted to evaluate food availability, price, quality, marketing and placement in randomly sampled food retailers in Minneapolis (n = 84) and compared to those in a nearby control city, St. Paul, Minnesota (n = 71). Stores were excluded that were: supermarkets, authorized through WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), and specialty stores (e.g., spice shops). Customer intercept interviews were conducted with 3,039 customers exiting stores. Home visits, including administration of home food inventories, were conducted with a sub-sample of frequent shoppers (n = 88).Overall, findings indicated significant improvements in healthy food offerings by retailers over time in both Minneapolis and St. Paul, with no significant differences in change between the two cities. Compliance was low; in 2017 only 10% of Minneapolis retailers in the sample were fully compliant, and 51% of participating Minneapolis retailers met at least 8 of the 10 required standards. Few changes were observed in the healthfulness of customer purchases or the healthfulness of home food environments among frequent shoppers, and changes were not different between cities.This study is the first evaluation a local staple foods ordinance in the U.S. and reflects the challenges and time required for implementing such policies. .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505120>Effect of HIIT versus MICT on body composition and energy intake in dietary restrained and unrestrained adolescents with .</a></h2><p>High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has been suggested as an effective alternative to traditional Moderate Intensity Continuous Training (MICT) that can yield improvements in a variety of health outcomes. Yet, despite the urgent need to find effective strategies for the treatment of pediatric , only a few studies have addressed the impact of HIIT on eating behaviors and body composition. This study aimed to compare the effect of HIIT versus MICT on eating behaviors in adolescents with , and assess whether the participants' baseline dietary status is associated with the success of the intervention. Forty-three adolescents with  were randomly assigned to a 16-week MICT or HIIT intervention. Body composition and 24-hour ad libitum energy intake were assessed at baseline (T0) and at the end of the program (T1). Restrained eating, emotional eating and external eating were assessed using DEBQ at baseline. Both interventions led to significant weight, BMI, and FM% reductions, with better improvements in FM% in the HIIT group; whereas 24-hour ad libitum energy intake increased to a similar extent in both groups. HIIT provides better body composition improvements over MICT, despite a similar increase in energy intake. Restrained eaters experienced less weight loss and smaller BMI reductions compared to unrestrained eaters adolescents, with higher baseline cognitively restrained adolescents showed greater increased of their ad libitum energy intake. •HIIT favors better body composition improvements compared with MICT •Both MICT and HIIT increased ad libitum energy intake in adolescents with  •Weight loss achievement is better among unrestrained eaters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31446794>Physical activity in pre-school children: Trends over time and associations with body mass index and screen time.</a></h2><p> Pre-school years are important for adopting health behaviours; however, today's children seem to be overweight, present low physical activity (PA) levels and exceed screen time (ST) recommendations. To examine (a) time trends in PA in Greek pre-school children, () the associations among PA, body mass index (BMI) and ST and (c) potential PA differences between boys and girls. Data from five cross-sectional cohorts (2005 [ = 252]; 2008 [ = 212]; 2011 [ = 187]; 2014 [ = 194]; 2017 [ = 128]) were compared. PA was assessed using Omron HJ-720IT-E2 pedometers, whereas ST was reported by participants' parents. A 4-way ANOVA was applied on children's average week step counts. A significant association ( = 828.90,  < 0.001,  = 0.638) between ST and PA was revealed, with children that had ST < 1 hour/day presenting the higher PA levels and being the only ones that met PA recommendations (11,500 steps/day). Statistically significant PA differences, though of no practical importance, were found among cohorts. There were no significant PA differences between boys and girls or among BMI categories. Nevertheless,  prevalence was found to exist at alarming levels (24.5% in 2008-41.4% in 2017), and a large percentage of children (23.6% in 2008-63.3% in 2017) presented excessive ST (> 2 hours/day).

Despite recent developments in congenital adrenal hyperplasia -21OH D (CAH), several issues related to patient growth and final height remain unsolved. Debate still exist about the safety of long-term use of PD versus HC for treating children with CAH. The mechanism by which glucocorticoid therapy interferes with growth is complex and multifactorial. Relatively slight supra-physiologic levels may be enough to blunt growth velocity. An increased risk of developing  is another possible consequence of hyper-cortisolism in children with CAH.To evaluate the anthropometric and biochemical effects of long-term PD versus HC treatment in children with CAH-21OHD. A brief review of the literature is also reported.This retrospective study evaluated linear growth and biochemical data of thirty children with classic CAH (19 females and 11 males), who were on PD (n=22) or HC (n=8) treatment, since their first diagnosis. Clinical data included age, gender, duration of therapy, dose of HC and or equivalent dose of HC in the PD group, blood pressure, height (Ht) and weight. Ht-SDS and BMI were also calculated. Biochemical data included measurement of 17- OH progesterone, cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL, fasting glucose, and insulin concentrations. HOMA-IR was calculated. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured using high-resolution -mode ultrasonography. Thirty normal age matched children were used as controls for the anthropometric and CIMT data.The age of children and duration of treatment did not differ among the two treatment groups. After a mean of 6 years of treatment, the Ht-SDS and BMI did not differ between the three groups of children. The equivalent hydrocortisone dose of children on prednisone was significantly higher than the dose for the hydrocortisone group. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) of children on PD was slightly higher compared to those on hydrocortisone group. However, the BP of the 2 treatment groups was not different compared to control children. Fasting blood glucose, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), plasma TG, HDL, and cholesterol did not differ among the two treatment groups. LDL levels were significantly higher in the PD group versus the HC group. The mean CIMT did not differ among the two treatment groups but was significantly higher in the treated groups versus controls. There was a significant linear correlation between BMI-SDS and CIMT (r=0.37, p=0.047).Children with CAH-21OHD who were kept on PD therapy for 6.4±2.7 years, since the beginning of diagnosis, have maintained normal linear growth. No difference in BMI, HOMA-IR, or CIMT was detected among the two treated groups. The efficiency, safety and convenience of a single daily dose of PD could be a good and relatively safe alternative to HC for the continuing medical treatment of patients with CAH-21OHD. However, more prospective studies across childhood and adolescence are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630321>Body muscle-to-fat ratio gender-specific cut-off values for impaired insulin sensitivity in patients with treatment-naïve type 2 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that the body muscle-to-fat ratio (BMFR), measured using bioelectrical impedance, significantly correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity. We examined BMFR gender-specific cut-off values for impaired insulin sensitivity in treatment-naïve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.Subjects included 101 untreated T2DM patients (male, 66; female, 35). We performed a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp examination to measure the steady-state glucose infusion rate (M value) as an indicator of whole-body insulin resistance. We defined the M value divided by the steady-state serum insulin value as the M/I value. We defined the existence of insulin resistance using an M/I ratio <9.0. The optimal cut-off value for BMFR was calculated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.The cut-off value of the BMFR for insulin resistance was 2.75 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83, sensitivity 75%, and specificity 76%, P < 0.001) for males and 1.65 (AUC = 0.87, sensitivity 84%, and specificity 81%, P < 0.001) for females. Simple linear regression analysis showed that BMFR was significantly correlated with the M/I value in both genders (males,  = 0.77, P< 0.01; females,  = 0.83, P< 0.01).BMFR cut-off values for impaired insulin sensitivity in treatment-naïve T2DM patients were 2.75 for males and 1.65 for females.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554178>Correlation of Body Mass Index with Pelvis and Lumbar Spine Alignment in Sagittal Plane in Hemophilia Patients.</a></h2><p> Concern about weight gain among people has been high due to negative health consequences in addition to the increasing prevalence of the problem. Overweight and  also occur in patients with hemophilia. Analysis of literature shows that increased body weight might have a biomechanical effect on the spatial orientation of the pelvis and the lumbar spine. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between body mass index (BMI) and the parameters characterizing the alignment of the sacrum (SS, sacral slope), the pelvis (PT, pelvic tilt; PI, pelvic incidence) and the angle value of lumbar lordosis (LL, lumbar lordosis) assessed in the sagittal plane among patients with hemophilia.  A total of 49 patients were subjected to the study, 23 of whom met the inclusion criteria. Body weight and height were measured. Measurement of the angle values of indicators characterizing the position of the lumbar-pelvic complex was established based on X-ray imaging analysis.  Analysis of the correlation between the BMI and sacral, pelvic, and lumbar indicators evaluated in the sagittal plane in the study group of patients with hemophilia showed a correlation between BMI and SS ( = 0.48). SS values were significantly and positively related to PI ( = 0.6;  = 0.002) and LL ( = 0.46;  = 0.02). The results obtained indicate the BMI relationship with the setting of the sacrum in the sagittal plane (SS). After adjusting for the knee flexion contracture, the correlation on the border of significance ( = 0.73,  = 0.07) between the body mass index and the spatial orientation of the pelvis and the spine was revealed.  We hypothesize that increased body weight among people with hemophilia might have an effect on the positioning of the lumbosacral region. Therefore, it is believed that preventing  among people with hemophilia can contribute to a smaller number of intra-articular hemorrhages and better orthopedic condition of the limb joints, and thus could avoid changes in the lumbosacral region as well as their consequences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652837>Deregulated Lysophosphatidic Acid Metabolism and Signaling in Liver Cancer.</a></h2><p>Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide due to late diagnosis and scarcity of treatment options. The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis  or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of  and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661025>Association between cognitive impairment patient with solid cancer and insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>In an aging population, an increase in the number of elderly cancer patients with cognitive impairment is expected. The possible association between cancer and cognitive impairment is important to elucidate, because it can have a serious impact on quality of life. Here, we focused on glucose metabolism as a factor that links cancer and cognitive impairment.Thirteen subjects with solid cancers and cognitive impairment were recruited. As a control group, 14 subjects with cognitive impairment alone and 8 subjects with cancer alone were recruited. A Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and that of β-cell function (HOMA-) were used. In comparison with patients with solid cancer alone, those with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cancer and cognitive impairment had increased HOMA-IR values. Insulin resistance was increased in patients with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cognitive impairment and solid cancer than in patients without cognitive impairment; however, β-cell function was not affected. The present data indicated that elderly cancer patients with high HOMA-IR score may be at a relatively high risk for developing cognitive impairment.

DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as , urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and ) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κ. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose metabolism, hepatic enzymes activities, and a lipid profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511022>Atherogenic index of plasma is a novel and strong predictor associated with fatty liver: a cross-sectional study in the Chinese Han population.</a></h2><p>Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) has been reported to be an important predictor for coronary artery disease and .

Vitamin D can positively reverse many of these adverse effects and outcomes through blocking signaling mechanisms that predispose to cardiometabolic and metastatic disease. As an affordable natural agent, vitamin D can be used to counteract -induced inflammation, block early adipogenesis, enhance glucose uptake, counteract hyperleptinemia, ameliorate insulin resistance, and reduce hypertension.

However, the population impact is unclear, particularly for mild SA. We aimed to assess the current prevalence and the cardiovascular risk associates of SA in the general population. We performed home polygraphy and extensive clinical, sociodemographic, and cardiovascular assessment in 2205 eligible subjects from a population-based cohort. Successful polygraphy was obtained in 1809 subjects (mean age, 56.0; SD, 5.9 years; 52.3% women). The prevalence was 41.0%, 11.8%, and 6.5% for mild, moderate, and severe SA in men and 26.6%, 4.4%, and 1.2% in women. Male sex, age, increasing BMI, and snoring were independently associated with SA, whereas sleepiness or tiredness were not. Compared with those without SA, mild SA was associated with (age- and sex-adjusted OR; 95% CI): diabetes mellitus (2.40; 1.52-3.80), hypertension (1.76; 1.42-2.19), left ventricular hypertrophy (1.36; 1.03-1.79), arterial plaques (1.19; 0.94-1.52), and increased IL-6 (interleukin-6) levels (1.37; 1.10-1.72).

LP success can depend on the size and anatomy of the patient and the skill of the hematologist. The main objective was to determine the influence of body mass index (BMI) on LP outcomes.  Adults with lymphoid malignancies requiring LP were included prospectively over one year; hematology residents performed most procedures. A 22-gauge Quincke needle was employed. Comparison between non-traumatic vs. traumatic LPs according to BMI, CNS relapse, and residents' year was performed.  Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 31.5±15.57 years were included. Diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia- (74%), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-T (13%) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (13%). 227 LPs were performed, 121 (53.3%) successful, 98 (43.2%) traumatic, 11 (11.2%) TLPs were macroscopically detectable and 87 (88%) microscopic; 8 (3.5%) were dry-taps. Median time between punctures was 11 days (1-202). Median BMI was 25 (22.8-39.6). Main indication for LP was prophylactic (74.5%); 39.2% were performed by first-year, 35.2% by second-year, 19.6% by third-year hematology residents. No difference (p = 0.145) for a TLP was found among residents. A BMI ≥30 (p = 0.040), non-palpable intervertebral space (p = 0.001) and more than one attempt (p = 0.001) were significant for TLP.

While excess sugar has often been implicated in the dramatic increase in U.S. adult  over the past 30 years, an unexplained question is why the increase in  took place many years after the increases in U.S. sugar consumption. To address this, here we explain adult  increase as the cumulative effect of increased sugar calories consumed over time. In our model, which uses annual data on U.S. sugar consumption as the input variable, each age cohort inherits the  rate in the previous year plus a simple function of the mean excess sugar consumed in the current year. This simple model replicates three aspects of the data: (a) the delayed timing and magnitude of the increase in average U.S. adult  (from about 15% in 1970 to almost 40% by 2015); () the increase of  rates by age group (reaching 47%  by age 50) for the year 2015 in a well-documented U.S. state; and (c) the pre-adult increase of  rates by several percent from 1988 to the mid-2000s, and subsequent modest decline in  rates among younger children since the mid-2000s. Under this model, the sharp rise in adult  after 1990 reflects the delayed effects of added sugar calories consumed among children of the 1970s and 1980s.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

We here take the whole signalling network into account to identify how insulin and β-adrenergic stimulation in concert controls lipolysis in mature subcutaneous adipocytes obtained from non-diabetic and, in parallel, type 2 diabetic women. We report that, and show how, the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin can be fully explained by protein kinase  (PKB/Akt)-dependent activation of the phosphodiesterase PDE3B. Through the same PKB-dependent pathway β-adrenergic receptor signalling, via cAMP and PI3Kα, is anti-lipolytic and inhibits its own stimulation of lipolysis by 50%. Through this pathway both insulin and β-adrenergic signalling control phosphorylation of FOXO1. The dose-response of lipolysis is bell-shaped, such that insulin is anti-lipolytic at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations of insulin lipolysis was increasingly restored due to inhibition of PDE3B. The control of lipolysis was not altered in adipocytes from diabetic individuals. However, the release of fatty acids was increased by 50% in diabetes due to reduced reesterification of lipolytically liberated fatty acids. In conclusion, our results reveal mechanisms of control by insulin and β-adrenergic stimulation - in human adipocytes - that define a network of checks and balances ensuring robust control to secure uninterrupted supply of fatty acids without reaching concentrations that put cellular integrity at risk. Moreover, our results define how selective insulin resistance leave lipolytic control by insulin unaltered in diabetes, while the fatty acid release is substantially increased.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622041>Predictors of micronutrient powder sachet coverage and recent intake among children 12-23 months in Eastern Uganda.</a></h2><p>We evaluated predictors of micronutrient powder (MNP) sachet coverage and recent intake using data from a cross-sectional survey representative of children aged 12-23 months in Amuria district, Uganda.

However, PPI can be tokenistic, which may limit this potential. Furthermore, few studies report PPI processes and impact, particularly in doctoral research studies, which are seldom reported in peer-reviewed papers. The aim of this paper was to explore the impact of PPI on two health-related doctoral research studies and identify how PPI could be used meaningfully at this level.The PPI processes included (a) involvement of two 'Research Buddies' who informed the research design and ensured implementation of a booklet intervention was feasible for family carers, () data analysis workshops with 'Research Buddies' to identify emerging themes from practitioner interviews, (c) public and stakeholder involvement who informed data collection tool design, and the design of an intervention to help people with  who attend weight loss groups.The application of PPI enhanced both doctoral studies by assisting data analysis; problem solving and improving recruitment rates; improving the usability and appeal of data collection tools and interventions; and developing implementation strategies. Patient and public involvement was considered a rewarding experience for both researchers and PPI contributors.This paper demonstrates the value of PPI in doctoral research in relation to its impact on research processes, researchers and contributors. We also present recommendations on how PPI could be incorporated into future doctoral research, including resources required, planning PPI processes and involving PPI contributors in all stages of research.© 2019 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540318>The Anti- Effect of Polysaccharide-Rich Red Algae () Hot-Water Extracts in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Hamsters.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the anti- effect of a polysaccharide-rich red algae  hot-water extract (GHE) in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese hamsters. GHE contained 68.54% water-soluble indigestible carbohydrate polymers. Hamsters were fed with a HF diet for 5 weeks to induce , and then randomly divided into: HF group, HF with 3% guar gum diet group, HF with 3% GHE diet group, and HF with orlistat (200 mg/kg diet) group for 9 weeks. The increased weights of body, liver, and adipose in the HF group were significantly reversed by GHE supplementation. Lower plasma leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 levels were observed in the GHE+HF group compared to the HF group. GHE also increased the lipolysis rate and decreased the lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissues. GHE induced an increase in the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 in the livers. The decreased triglyceride and total cholesterol in the plasma and liver were also observed in obese hamsters fed a diet with GHE. These results suggest that GHE exerts a down-regulation effect on hepatic lipid metabolism through AMPK phosphorylation and up-regulation of PPARα and UCP-2 in HF-induced obese hamsters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31504360>Left ventricular mechanical dispersion in a general population: Data from the Akershus Cardiac Examination 1950 study.</a></h2><p>Increased left ventricular mechanical dispersion by 2D speckle tracking echocardiography predicts ventricular arrhythmias in ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. However, little is known about mechanical dispersion in the general population. We aimed to study mechanical dispersion in the general population and in diseases associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.The present cross-sectional study consists of 2529 subjects born in 1950 included in the Akershus Cardiac Examination (ACE) 1950 study. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was assessed from 17 strain segments, and mechanical dispersion calculated as the standard deviation of contraction duration of all segments. The cohort was divided according to the median value of mechanical dispersion, and multivariable linear regression models were performed with mechanical dispersion as the dependent variable. The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, , and diabetes (P < 0.01 for all) was significantly higher in subjects with supra-median mechanical dispersion. In a multivariable clinical model, CAD ( = 7.05), hypertension ( = 4.15; both P < 0.001), diabetes ( = 3.39), and  ( = 1.89; both P < 0.05) were independently associated with increasing mechanical dispersion. When echocardiographic indices were added to the multivariable model, CAD ( = 4.38; P < 0.01) and hypertension ( = 2.86; P < 0.001) remained significant in addition to peak early diastolic tissue velocity e' ( = -2.00), GLS ( = 1.68), and ejection fraction ( = 0.22; P < 0.001 for all).In a general middle-aged population, prevalent CAD and hypertension were associated with increasing mechanical dispersion, possibly indicating elevated risk of fatal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Albeit weaker, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, were also associated with increasing mechanical dispersion.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Among 350 patients (240 men and 110 women) with a mean age of 51.9 years (S.D.=13.5) MetS prevalence was 37.4%, significantly higher in female patients (63.6%) compared to male patients (25.4%). Increased waist circumference was present in 51.1%, low HDL in 50.6%, hypertension in 49.4%, hyperglycemia in 28.6% and 25.7% had hypertriglyceridemia. Except for hypertriglyceridemia, all criteria were more prevalent in female patients. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that female gender, outpatient treatment setting and the absence of substance use disorder were all significant predictors for MetS. Compared to data from the general population obtained by the 2013 National Health Survey Curaçao, this study showed significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in patients with SMI. Moreover, female patients had the highest prevalence of diabetes (28.2%),  (50.0%) and increased waist circumference (88.2%). This study demonstrates that African-Caribbean patients with SMI are at high-risk for MetS, especially female patients.

In our previous study, we found that yatein inhibited the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and CL1-5 cells by inducing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. To further uncover the effects and mechanisms of yatein-induced inhibition on A549 and CL1-5 cell growth, we evaluated yatein-mediated antitumor activity in vivo and the regulatory effects of yatein on cell-cycle progression and microtubule dynamics. Flow cytometry and western blotting revealed that yatein induces G/M arrest in A549 and CL1-5 cells. Yatein also destabilized microtubules and interfered with microtubule dynamics in the two cell lines. Furthermore, we evaluated the antitumor activity of yatein in vivo using a xenograft mouse model and found that yatein treatment altered cyclin /Cdc2 complex expression and significantly inhibited tumor growth. Taken together, our results suggested that yatein effectively inhibited the growth of A549 and CL1-5 cells possibly by disrupting cell-cycle progression and microtubule dynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488158>Phosphatidylcholine and its relation to apolipoproteins A-1 and  changes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a cohort study.</a></h2><p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant of the phospholipids, has several metabolic functions in organs such as the liver and the intestine, important structural- and signaling functions in biological membranes, and might have a role in the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), an operation known to ameliorate metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that serum PC, as a reflection of phospholipid metabolism, changes after RYGB, and that changes are related to weight loss and possibly to changes in glucose metabolism (reflected in the HbA1c-level) as well as to changes in serum Apo A1, Apo  and Apo /Apo A1 ratio.In a cohort of 220 RYGB patients, we studied changes in serum PC after RYGB in relation to serum Apo A1 and Apo , the main apolipoproteins in HDL- and LDL/VLDL-particles, respectively, up to 2 years following RYGB-surgery.Serum PC reached its lowest levels 3 months postoperatively to later rebound to preoperative levels 24 months after RYGB. No difference was seen between patients with or without type 2 diabetes. Serum Apo A1 showed a similar pattern whereas serum Apo  concentrations stayed low after the initial decrease after RYGB. As a result, the Apo  / Apo A1 ratio constantly decreased during follow-up. There was a strong positive correlation between PC and Apo A1, and between PC and Apo , but none between Apo A1 and Apo . After RYGB surgery, both PC and Apo A1, but not Apo , correlated positively to weight loss. In relation to total cholesterol, the molar ratio between serum PC and plasma cholesterol increased steadily after RYGB.We conclude that changes in PC and apolipoproteins after RYGB are highly dynamic, reflecting a large plasticity and capability of accommodating lipid metabolism including PC-, cholesterol- and apolipoprotein metabolism imposed by RYGB surgery, independent of glucose tolerance. We suggest that after RYGB and major weight loss, PC and Apo A1 might have a special role in the altered metabolism of lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495653>Impact of  on restoration of sagittal balance and clinical efficacy after posterior lumbar interbody fusion.</a></h2><p>To investigate the impact of  on the restoration of sagittal balance after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF).

A total of 183 patients who underwent PLIF for degenerative lumbar diseases between Jan 2015 and Dec 2015 were enrolled in this study. Based on their BMI, patients were divided into three groups: normal weight group (Group A), overweight group (Group ), and  group (Group C). Demographic data, intraoperative data, sagittal balance parameters, and clinical function scores were compared between each group. Correlation analysis was conducted between the BMI scores and each sagittal balance parameter. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the impact of each variable on clinical outcomes. All patients finished an average of 22.3 months follow-up. Group C had significantly higher blood loss and longer operations than Group A.

Among the various treatment methods proposed for MTrPs, Kinesio Taping (KT) is a non-invasive, painless, and less time-consuming method with fewer side effects that has become widely used as a therapeutic tool in a variety of prevention and rehabilitation protocols. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immediate and short-term efficacy of the space correction KT technique in patients with latent or active MTrPs in the upper trapezius muscle. Two parallel randomized sham-controlled trials were simultaneously executed: in trial A, ninety-seven participants with latent MTrPs were randomly assigned to either the KT (n = 51) or sham (n = 46) group; in trial , thirty-seven participants with active MTrPs were assigned to the KT (n = 20) or sham (n = 17) group. The primary outcome was pressure pain threshold (PPT) in the upper trapezius muscle, measured with algometry. Secondary outcomes included the active range of motion (ROM) of the cervical spine (lateral flexion and rotation), measured with a cervical ROM goniometer. In each trial, two-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the study effects on the outcome measures between the groups, with time serving as the intra-group factor (baseline, immediately, and 72 h after the application) and the intervention type (KT and sham) as the between-group factor. At 72 h, participants receiving KT did not show significant differences in PPT (trial A: mean difference -1.8 N; 95% CI: [-8.1, 4.4], trial : mean difference -1.2 N; 95% CI: [-7.4, 5.1]), cervical lateral flexion (trial A: mean difference 0.2 degrees; 95% CI: [-2.7, 3.1], trial : mean difference -2.4 degrees; 95% CI: [-8.4, 3.6]), and cervical rotation (trial A: mean difference 3.7 degrees; 95% CI: [-0.1, 7.5], trial : mean difference 1.4 degrees; 95% CI: [-5.7, 8.4]), compared to the sham groups.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the liver due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with liver fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced  and liver fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the liver tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the liver than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced fatty acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced , hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612372>'Shopping for a new body': descriptions of bariatric post-operative adjustment.</a></h2><p>Co-morbid conditions resulting from  cause 3.4 million deaths per year. Bariatric surgery has become a solution for . Post-operative psychosocial changes can be problematic and must not be neglected. Up to 74% of people with overweight or  have body image distortion or dissatisfaction, which may persist even after surgery and weight loss. The questions addressed by this research were: (a) what are the categories of open-ended responses from bariatric surgery patients about their experiences of post-operative adjustment? () Do the categories of response support previous quantitative findings of a retained obese identity after surgery?Herman's Dialogical Self Theory provides the basis for understanding the post-operative transition from "I-obese" to "I-ex-obese". Fifty-five bariatric surgery patients (18-30 months post-op) were asked to tell the investigator about their adjustment after surgery. Their open-ended responses were written down and analyzed using content analysis.Individual responses were analyzed and divided into four dominant categories: (a) shopping for a new body; () relationship transitions; (c) focus on the new body; and (d) cheating on the fat person inside.This study presents an opportunity to gain perspective on the physical and psychosocial adjustment after bariatric surgery. The information can be used to guide pre-op and post-op education and counseling efforts for patients.

All the current therapies are not optimal due to limited efficacy or safety; thus, there is a need for additional devices for the treatment of . This study aimed to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a biodegradable encapsulated Epitomee device for weight loss. The technology is based on absorbent pharmaceuticals polymers and bonding materials that self-expand in the stomach to create a pH-sensitive super absorbent gel structure for weight loss.A prospective, 12-week twice daily use of the encapsulated device in patients with body mass index of 27-40 kg m. Efficacy endpoints were the percent total body weight loss (%TBWL), proportion of participants with 5% TBWL and changes in cardio-metabolic markers. Safety analysis included evaluation of adverse events, laboratory and endoscopic findings.Overall, 52 patients completed the study. TBWL per intension-to-treat analysis was 3.68 ± 3.07% (3.23 ± 2.69 kg) and 4.52 ± 2.97% (3.95 ± 2.57 kg) per protocol. No device serious adverse effects reported. The most common adverse events were headache (18.1%), viral infection (11.5%), abdominal discomfort (10.1%), bloating (7.9%), nausea and constipation (5% each) and flatulence (4.3%). Endoscopy in 26 patients revealed mild, asymptomatic gastric/duodenal erythema without erosions in five patients.Twelve weeks of Epitomee capsules treatment combined with lifestyle counselling resulted in 3.68-4.52% of TBWL.

We decipher the impact of short-chain CAD (SCAD) on adiposity and insulin resistance. BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases () gene. Adiposity, lipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high-fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. -deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced  and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced  results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in liver that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl-CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic  lipogenesis. Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC-ε activity and increased protein kinase  (AKT) activation in liver and skeletal muscle. Additionally, -deficient mice displayed significantly higher expression of the endoplasmic chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, which was further associated with the AKT activation in the primary hepatocytes.

We explored how different body composition measurements are associated with intima media thickness (cIMT) and local stiffness in the common carotid artery, in a subsample of healthy, young women and men, from the Swedish Lifestyle, Biomarkers, and Atherosclerosis (LBA) Study.From the LBA study, a subsample of 220 randomly selected, self-reported healthy individuals, 18-25 years old, were collected for the automatized local stiffness measurements; arterial distensibility, Young's elastic modulus, and β stiffness index. Blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured using automatic blood pressure equipment. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, waist circumference was measured, and percentage of body fat assessed using an impedance body composition analyzer. The carotid artery was scanned by ultrasound and analyzed using -mode edge wall tracking. cIMT was measured and local stiffness measurements were calculated with carotid blood pressure, measured with applanation tonometry.No association was found between cIMT and body composition. Local carotid stiffness was associated with body composition, and women had less stiff arteries than men (p < 0.001). Of the local stiffness measurements, arterial distensibility had the strongest associations with body composition measurements in both women and men (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analyses showed that BMI in women and BMI and percentage of body fat in men had the highest impact on arterial distensibility (p < 0.01 in both women and men).Arterial distensibility was the local stiffness measurement with the strongest associations to different body composition measurements, in both women and men.

Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease in the context of , the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive oxygen species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive.

Here, we examined whether A2AR protects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In C57BL/6J mice, feeding a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD) resulted in significant weight loss, overt hepatic steatosis, and massive aggregation of macrophages in the liver compared with mice fed a chow diet. MCD feeding also significantly increased the numbers of A2AR-positive macrophages/Kupffer cells in liver sections although decreasing A2AR amount in liver lysates compared with chow diet feeding. Next, MCD-induced NASH phenotype was examined in A2AR-disrupted mice and control mice. Upon MCD feeding, A2AR-disruptd mice and control mice displayed comparable decreases in body weight and fat mass. However, MCD-fed A2AR-disrupted mice revealed greater liver weight and increased severity of hepatic steatosis compared with MCD-fed control mice. Moreover, A2AR-disupted mice displayed increased severity of MCD-induced liver inflammation, indicated by massive aggregation of macrophages and increased phosphorylation states of Jun-N terminal kinase (JNK) p46 and nuclear factor kappa  (NFκ) p65 and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6. In vitro, incubation with MCD-mimicking media increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced phosphorylation states of JNK p46 and/or NFκ p65 and cytokine mRNAs in control macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, but not primary hepatocytes. Additionally, MCD-mimicking media significantly increased lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation states of p38 and NFκ p65 in A2AR-deficient macrophages, but insignificantly decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation states of JNK p46 and NFκ p65 in A2AR-deficient hepatocytes. Collectively, these results suggest that A2AR disruption exacerbates MCD-induced NASH, which is attributable to, in large part, increased inflammatory responses in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505890>Effects of Exercise and Nutritional Intervention on Body Composition, Metabolic Health, and Physical Performance in Adults with Sarcopenic : A Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>People with sarcopenic  (SO) are characterized by both low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and high body fat (); they have greater risks of metabolic diseases and physical disability than people with sarcopenia or  alone.

Compounds 4a, 5a, 3b, 4b and 5b demonstrated anti-inflammatory IC50 values exceeding that of indomethacin. Compounds 3a and 4a showed IC50 lower than 10 μM as PL inhibitors. In conclusion, FQ and TFQ derivatives may unveil new antiobesity and anticancer agents in the future. Our research qualifies FQs and TFQs as promising candidates for the development of related α-dicarbonyl scavengers as therapeutic agents to protect cells against carbonyl stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31569380>Curcumin Attenuates Adipogenesis by Inducing Preadipocyte Apoptosis and Inhibiting Adipocyte Differentiation.</a></h2><p>Patients with metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The principal risk factor for development of metabolic syndrome is , defined as a state of pathological hyperplasia or/and hypertrophy of adipose tissue. The number of mature adipocytes is determined by adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of curcumin on adipogenesis and the underlying mechanism. To examine cell toxicity of curcumin, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with 0-50 µM curcumin for 24, 48, or 72 h, then cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The effect of curcumin on the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Curcumin-induced cell apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL assay and curcumin-induced caspase activation was measured by immunoblotting. The effect of curcumin on adipocyte differentiation was determined by measuring mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), expression of adipogenic transcription factors, and lipid accumulation. Results showed the viability of preadipocytes was significantly decreased by treatment with 30 µM curcumin, a concentration that caused apoptosis in preadipocytes, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, and caused activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3. A non-cytotoxic dose of curcumin (15 µM) inhibited MCE, downregulated the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, prevented differentiation medium-induced β-catenin downregulation, and decreased the lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In conclusion, our data show that curcumin can induce preadipocyte apoptosis and inhibit adipocyte differentiation, leading to suppression of adipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619344>Kidney After Intestinal Transplantation Using Two Different Living Donors: A First Case Report.</a></h2><p>We describe a unique case of a 53-year-old woman who underwent a nonrelated living donor kidney transplant 9 years after a previous small bowel transplant from her sister. The patient had suffered from short bowel syndrome secondary to volvulus after undergoing bariatric surgery for morbid . Her entire small bowel had to be resected emergently, but she also developed acute kidney failure at the time. This initial kidney injury associated with long-term exposure to calcineurin-inhibitor medication eventually led to end-stage renal disease. A successful kidney transplant from a different, nonrelated adult donor was performed. Of note, the unrelated kidney donor matched exactly the 2 HLA-A and HLA- antigens that the recipient had not matched with her sister. We discuss the unique HLA configuration between the patient and her 2 living donors, the absence of posttransplant rejection and posttransplant immunosuppressive therapy. To our knowledge this is the first published report of a successful kidney after a previous bowel transplant using (2 different) living donors.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, FVIIIs are neutralized if anti-FVIII-antibodies ("inhibitors") develop. Accumulating evidence suggests that pdFVIIIs with von Willebrand factor (VWF) are less immunogenic than rFVIIIs and that distinct rFVIIIs are differentially immunogenic. Since inhibitor development is T-helper-cell-dependent, HLA-class-II (HLAcII) molecules comprise an important early determinant.Use dendritic cell (DC)-protein processing/presentation assays with mass-spectrometric and peptide-proteomic analyses to quantify the DP-, DQ-, and DR-bound/FVIII-derived-peptides in individual HLAcII repertoires and compare the immunogenic potential of six distinct FVIIIs based on their measured peptide counts.Monocyte-derived-DCs from normal donors and/or PWHA were cultured with either: "Mix-rFVIII", a VWF-free equimolar mixture of a full-length (FL)-rFVIII (Advate®) and four distinct -domain-deleted (BDD)-rFVIIIs (Xyntha®, Novoeight®, Nuwiq®, and Afstyla®); a pdFVIII + pdVWF (Beriate®); Advate ± pdVWF; Afstyla ± pdVWF; and Xyntha + pdVWF.We showed that: (i) Beriate had a significantly lower immunogenic potential than Advate ± pdVWF, Afstyla - pdVWF, and Mix-rFVIII; (ii) distinct FVIIIs differed significantly in their immunogenic potential in that, in addition to "(i)", Afstyla + pdVWF had a significantly lower immunogenic potential than Beriate, while the immunogenic potential of Beriate was not significantly different from Xyntha + pdVWF; and (iii) rFVIIIs with pdVWF had a significantly lower immunogenic potential than the same rFVIIIs without pdVWF.Our results provide HLAcII peptidomic level explanations for several important clinical observations/issues including the differential immunogenicity of distinct FVIIIs and the role of HLAcII genetics in inhibitor development.© 2019 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672446>Predictive value of gastrointestinal hormones on weight loss.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery leads to profound and sustainable weight loss. Gastrointestinal hormones are involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, thus postoperative changes of their circulating levels may be mediating future weight loss. To investigate how the circulating concentrations of gastrointestinal hormones change in response to the most common types of bariatric operation and whether these changes can predict future weight loss.We measured circulating GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, glicentin, glucagon, major proglucagon fragment (MPGF), ghrelin, GIP, PYY after overnight fasting and/or after a mixed meal test (MMT) in: a) 14 subjects that have undergone either an adjustable gastric banding [AGB] (n = 9) or a Roux-en-Y bypass (RYGB) (n = 5) (Pilot study 1), ) 28 subjects that have undergone either a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 17) or a RYGB (n = 11) before and three, six and twelve months after surgery.In addition to the expected associations with GLP-1, the most robust increases were observed in postprandial levels of oxyntomodulin and glicentin three months after VSG or RYGB (but not after AGB) and are associated with degree of weight loss. Oxyntomodulin and glicentin levels at the third and sixth month postoperative visit are positively associated with feeling of satiety which may be underlying the observed associations with future weight loss.Beyond GLP-1, early postprandial changes in circulating oxyntomodulin and glicentin are predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery, possibly through regulation of satiety. Further studies should focus on underlying mechanisms, and their potential as attractive therapeutic tools against  and related comorbidities.Copyright © 2019.

AT1 (SLC6A19) is the major transporter of neutral amino acids at the intestinal epithelia and absorbs the bulk of the diet-derived neutral amino acids from the intestinal lumen. It also reabsorbs neutral amino acids in the renal proximal tubules. Mice lacking AT1 show cellular outcomes of protein restriction, such as high FGF21 levels and low mTORC1 activity. Moreover, they have improved glucose homeostasis and resist diet-induced . In this study, we investigated the relationship between protein restriction and dietary protein intake in C57Bl6/J wild-type () and SLC6A19-knockout (SLC6A19) mice. When SLC6A19 mice were fed diets containing 5%, 25%, or 52% of their total calories derived from protein, no differences in food intake or weight gain were observed. All essential amino acids significantly positively correlated with increasing dietary casein content in the  mice. The SLC6A19 mice showed reduced postprandial levels of essential amino acids in plasma, particularly following high-protein diets. Upon fasting, essential amino acids were the same in the  and SLC6A19 mice due to reduced amino acid catabolism. Bacterial metabolites originating from amino acid fermentation correlated with the dietary protein content, but showed a complex profile in the blood of the SLC6A19 mice. This study highlights the potential of SLC6A19 as a knock-out or inhibition target to induce protein restriction for the treatment of metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537613>Using Target Engagement Biomarkers to Predict Clinical Efficacy of MetAP2 Inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Target-engagement pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers are valuable tools in the prioritization of drug candidates, especially for novel, first-in-class mechanisms whose robustness to alter disease outcome is unknown. Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) is a cytosolic metalloenzyme that cleaves the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. Inhibition of MetAP2 leads to weight loss in obese rodents, dogs and humans. However, there is a need to develop efficacious compounds that specifically inhibit MetAP2 with an improved safety profile. The objective of this study was to identify a PD biomarker for selecting potent, efficacious compounds and for predicting clinical efficacy that would result from inhibition of MetAP2. Here we report the use of NMet14-3-3 for this purpose. Treatment of primary human cells with MetAP2 inhibitors resulted in an approx. 10-fold increase in NMet14-3-3 levels. Furthermore, treatment of diet-induced obese mice with these compounds reduced body weight (approx. 20%) and increased NMet14-3-3 (approx. 15-fold) in adipose tissues. The effects on target engagement and body weight increased over time and were dependent on dose and administration frequency of compound. The relationship between compound concentration in plasma, NMet14-3-3 in tissue, and reduction of body weight in obese mice was used to generate a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-efficacy model for predicting efficacy of MetAP2 inhibitors in mice. We also developed a model for predicting weight loss in humans using a target engagement PD assay that measures inhibitor-bound MetAP2 in blood. In summary, MetAP2 target engagement biomarkers can be used to select efficacious compounds and predict weight loss in humans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The application of target engagement pharmacodynamic biomarkers during drug development provides a means to determine the dose required to fully engage the intended target and an approach to connect the drug target to physiological effects. This work exemplifies the process of using target engagement biomarkers during preclinical research to select new drug candidates and predict clinical efficacy. We determine concentration of MetAP2 antiobesity compounds needed to produce pharmacological activity in primary human cells and in target tissues from an appropriate animal model and establish key relationships between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy, including the duration of effects after drug administration.

However, the diurnal rhythm of breastmilk GCs was not taken into account, and we therefore aimed to assess the associations between breastmilk GC rhythmicity at 1 month and growth and body composition at 3 months in infants.At 1 month postpartum, breastmilk GCs were collected over a 24-h period and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Body composition was measured using air-displacement plethysmography at 3 months. Length and weight were collected at 1, 2, and 3 months.In total, 42 healthy mother-infant pairs were included. No associations were found between breastmilk GC rhythmicity (area-under-the-curve increase and ground, maximum, and delta) and infant growth trajectories or body composition (fat and fat free mass index, fat%) at 3 months.This study did not find an association between breastmilk GC rhythmicity at 1 month and infant's growth or body composition at 3 months.

Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (△SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; =0.001) or in DBP (△DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (=0.018), months 12 (=0.007), and months 24 (=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all  values >0.05).

In order to prevent diabetes, early diagnosis of prediabetes is important. However, biomarkers for prediabetes diagnosis are still scarce. The hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip) is important in embryogenesis and is known to be a biomarker of several cancers. However, Hhip levels in subjects with diabetes are still unknown.In total, 314 participants were enrolled and divided into normal glucose tolerance (NGT;  75), impaired fasting glucose (IFG;  66), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT;  86), and newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD;  87) groups. Plasma Hhip levels were determined by an ELISA. The association between the Hhip and the presence of diabetes was examined by a multivariate linear regression analysis.There were significant differences in the body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-load 2-h glucose, hemoglobin A1c (A1C), C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels among the groups.

We measured physical activity over 5 consecutive days with accelerometers and recorded the food intake.A greater level of physical activity was associated with a lower weight status category (=-1.55; 95% CI: -2.02 to -1.08; P<.001), lower age (=-1.33; 95% CI: -1.72 to -0.93; P<.001) and greater energy expenditure (=0.02; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.03; P<.001). The overall physical activity in the sample was light (mean=589 cpm/day). Children with overweight and  spent less time engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity (P=.005) and more time engaged in sedentary activities (P=.005) compared to children with normal weight. All groups spent between 90 and 130minutes a day in sedentary activities, with a mean time spent that amounted to 15.5% of their time (excluding time spent sleeping). The adherence to European recommendations varied in association with sex (P=.010) and weight status (P=.038).Young children spent more than 100minutes a day engaged in sedentary activities.

In addition, obese patients are considered less favorable surgical candidates for decompression surgery in degenerative lumbar spinal canal stenosis and lower limb arthroplasty. The purpose was to assess disease characteristics of lumbar spinal canal stenosis as well as lower limb osteoarthritis, and to investigate surgical times based on body mass index (BMI) in lumbar decompressive surgery and lower limb arthroplasties.A total of 1161 patients with a diagnosis of lumbar canal stenosis (LCS), hip osteoarthritis (HOA) and knee osteoarthritis (KOA) were enrolled. The present investigation was conducted as a retrospective study using routinely collected data. All patients underwent primary decompressive surgery (laminoplasty: LAM) or lower limb arthroplasty (total hip arthroplasty: THA and total knee arthroplasty: TKA). All of the patients were divided into 3 groups based on BMI (kg/m) (Group A: ≤ 24.9; Group : 25-29.9; Group C: ≥ 30) within each disease category. To assess disease characteristics, age, gender, and BMI were evaluated for each disease category. Moreover, surgical times for LAM, THA and TKA were also assessed based on BMI classification.A total of 269, 470, and 422 patients were allocated to the HOA category, the KOA category, and the LCS category, respectively. The KOA category included the oldest patients and largest BMI, compared to the HOA and the LCS categories.

FH is caused by mutations in genes that regulate LDL catabolism, mainly the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein  (APOB) and gain of function of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the phenotype may be encountered in individuals not carrying the latter monogenic defects, in approximately 20% of these effects of polygenes predominate, and in many individuals no molecular defects are encountered at all. These so-called FH phenocopy individuals have an elevated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in comparison with normolipidemic individuals but this risk is lower than in those with monogenic disease. Individuals with FH are exposed to elevated LDL-C levels since birth and this explains the high cardiovascular, mainly coronary heart disease, burden of these subjects. However, recent studies show that this risk is heterogenous and depends not only on high LDL-C levels but also on presence of previous cardiovascular disease, a monogenic cause, male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL-cholesterol,  and elevated lipoprotein(a). This heterogeneity in risk can be captured by risk equations like one from the SAFEHEART cohort and by detection of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. High dose high potency statins are the main stain for LDL-C lowering in FH, however, in most situations these medications are not powered enough to reduce cholesterol to adequate levels. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors should also be used in order to better treat LDL-C in FH patients.Copyright © 2019.

In this regard, untreated children with familial hypercholesterolemia may serve as a human model to investigate the effect of elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol.We aimed to study the immunological and inflammatory pathways involved in early atherosclerosis by examining mRNA molecules in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from children with FH.We analyzed the level of 587 immune-related mRNA molecules using state-of-the-art Nanostring technology in PBMCs from children with (n=30) and without (n=21) FH, and from FH children before and after statin therapy (n=10).176 genes (30%) were differentially expressed between the FH and healthy children at P<0.05. Compared to healthy children, the dysregulated pathways in FH children included: T-cells (18/19); -cells (5/6); tumor necrosis factor super family (TNFSF) (6/8); cell growth, proliferation and differentiation (5/7); interleukins (5/9); toll-like receptors (2/5); apoptosis (3/7); and antigen presentation (1/7), where the ratio denotes higher expressed genes to total number of genes. Statin therapy reversed expression of thirteen of these mRNAs in FH children.FH children display higher PBMC expression of immune-related genes mapped to several pathways, including T- and -cells, and TNFSF than healthy children.

In this review, we focus on methanogenic Archaea, which rely on hydrogen for their metabolism and growth. On one hand, methanogenic Archaea in the gut are functional associates of the fermentative digestion of dietary fibers, favoring the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids and likely contributing to the weaning reaction during the neonatal window of opportunity. On the other hand, methanogenic Archaea trigger the activation of innate and adaptive responses and the generation of specific T and  cells in animals and humans. In mouse models, lung hypersensitivity reactions can be induced by inhaled methanogenic Archaea mimicking human professional exposure to organic dust. Changes in methanogenic Archaea of the microbiota are detected in an array of dysimmune conditions comprising inflammatory bowel disease, , malnutrition, anorexia, colorectal cancer, and diverticulosis. At the subcellular level, methanogenic Archaea are activators of the TLR8-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome, modulate the release of antimicrobial peptides and drive the production of proinflammatory, Th-1, Th-2, and Th-17 cytokines.

Clinico-epidemiological data of 1174 liver cancer patients from KFSH & RC during 2000 to 2014 and Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) between 2001-2015 with total of 5,796 cases was reviewed. Trends, patterns of occurrence and other prognostic factors of interest were sub-stratified by gender, age, stage, and grade.Temporal trends indicated a rising incidence of PHC from 2001 to 2014 in Saudi Arabia; from 323 cases in 2001 to 376 cases in 2015 as per SCR. A total of 2,779 new cases of PHC were seen at KFSH & RC between 1975 and 2014; the rate of PHC increased from 60 cases in 2004 to 80 cases in 2014. Majority of liver cancers were hepatocellular carcinomas (79.3%) followed by cholangiocarcinoma (11%), and hepatoblastoma (4.7%) with significantly higher incidence among males with a male to female ratio of 2:1 (p <0.01). The highest incidence by age was at 6th and 7th decade of life. Majority of patients were diagnosed in localized stage (44.6%) and had a past medical history (28.2%) of hepatitis (p < 0.001). The most common treatment for liver cancer at KFSH & RC was surgery (26.7%) followed by transplant (9.5%).Despite improvement in preventive measures, incidence rates of PHC has increased during the last decade with marked regional variation. Etiology of this escalating trend is multifactorial; predominantly, chronic infection with hepatitis  virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), heavy alcohol consumption, , diabetes, and tobacco smoking. This exponential increase may also be due to early detection and diagnosis due to expanding health care delivery in the Kingdom. Further studies are indicated to comprehend the rising trends at the molecular and genetic levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654447>Perceived social support mediates the association between attachment and cardiovascular reactivity in young adults.</a></h2><p>To understand the influence of social relationships on cardiovascular responses to stress, the present study investigated perceived affectionate support as a mediating variable explaining the association between specific attachment bonds (i.e., mother, father, partner, best friend) and cardiovascular reactivity (CVR). Utilizing a standardized stress testing protocol, 138 young adults completed measures of attachment and social support, with continuous cardiovascular measurements obtained using the Finometer Pro hemodynamic monitor. Results showed that the association between anxious and avoidant attachment and reactivity were mediated by perceived affectionate support; insecure attachment was linked to lower levels of perceived social support, which in turn was associated with lower CVR. For anxious attachment, this was noted only for mothers (SBP:  = -0.94, 95% CI [-1.94, -0.20]; DBP:  = -0.57, [-1.27, -0.10]), fathers (SBP:  = -0.72, [-1.42, -0.17]; DBP:  = -0.48, [-1.01, -0.13]), and best friends (SBP:  = -0.64, [-1.23, -0.18]; DBP:  = -0.40, [-0.81, -0.12]). For avoidant attachment, it was evident only for fathers (SBP:  = -0.70, [-1.33, -0.17]; DBP:  = -0.48, [-0.92, -0.15]) and partners (SBP:  = -0.78, [-1.64, -0.09]; DBP:  = -0.53, [-1.10, -0.11]). These findings suggest that insecure attachment is associated with lower levels of reactivity, which have been linked to negative health outcomes such as poor self-reported health, depression, and . Overall, this research expands on the support and relationship science literature by incorporating under-researched aspects of social relationships (i.e., specific attachment styles) and focusing on the mechanisms by which they are associated with physiological stress responses.© 2019 Society for Psychophysiological Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31532752>High-risk behaviors and demographic features: a cross-sectional study among Iranian adolescents.</a></h2><p>Background and objectives High-risk behaviors are considered to be a serious threat among adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of unhealthy and high-risk behaviors and their relationship with demographic features in adolescents living in Shiraz, Iran. Materials and methods The present descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted on 483 students in the 10th grade of high school. The data were collected using a demographic information form and a modified adolescents high-risk behaviors questionnaire. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using the test-retest method. Afterwards, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (IBM), version 22 and were analyzed using the chi-square (χ2) test, logistic regression analysis and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results High-risk health behaviors were significantly correlated to adolescents' gender, parents' occupations and education levels, length of residency in Shiraz and talking about important things with one's parents (p < 0.03). Gender predicted 52% of variance of bullying behaviors at school [Exp() = 0.502, p < 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.261-0.996]. In fact, most high-risk behaviors were associated with gender (p < 0.001). Indeed, bullying was mostly reported in boys, while being hopeless or sad, suicide attempts and appropriate weight loss behaviors were mostly reported among girls. Additionally, the frequency of smoking cigarettes and using hookahs was higher among girls compared to boys (23.1% for smoking cigarettes and 39.6% for using hookahs). However, no significant correlation was observed between gender and smoking cigarettes and using hookahs (p > 0.704 for smoking cigarettes and p > 0.118 for using hookahs). The most prevalent high-risk behaviors were physical fighting (51.1%), being sad or hopeless (35.2%), alcohol abuse (26.7%), overweight (14.7%) and  (8.1%) in both genders. Based on the results, only 26.5% of the adolescents had sufficient physical activity. Besides, the adolescents' weight scores were significantly correlated to eating green salads (p < 0.01), which was seen more among overweight adolescents. Conclusion The findings indicated that adolescents' gender and their parents' roles should be taken into consideration in designing health promotion programs, such as mental health and its related skills. This would eventually result in the prevention and reduction of unhealthy habits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506178>MicroRNA-96 regulates pancreatic β cell function under the pathological condition of diabetes mellitus through targeting Foxo1 and Sox6.</a></h2><p>To elucidate the potential function of microRNA-96 in protecting pancreatic β cell function under the pathological condition of T2DM and the underlying mechanism. Relative levels of microRNA-96 and genes associated with β cell function in the in vivo and in vitro T2DM and  models were detected by qRT-PCR. Insulin functions, including fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-%, glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance, were assessed in microRNA-96 KO mice and wild-type mice fed with normal diet or high-fat diet. Downstream targets of microRNA-96 were verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Finally, regulatory effects of microRNA-96 on proliferation and apoptosis of MIN6 cells were determined. MicroRNA-96 was upregulated in mice fed with high-fat diet, db/db mice, high-level glucose-treated cells, TNF-α-treated cells, pancreatic cells isolated from the  and T2DM patients. Increased fasting blood glucose and HOMA-IR, as well as decreased plasma insulin and HOMA-% were observed in microRNA-96 KO mice. IPGTT and IPITT results indicated that knockout of microRNA-96 led to pancreatic β cell dysfunction under the pathological condition of T2DM. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that microRNA-96 could bind Foxo1 and Sox6. MicroRNA-96 negatively regulated Foxo1 and Sox6 levels. Moreover, overexpression of microRNA-96 promoted proliferative ability and inhibited apoptosis in MIN6 cells. Relative levels of Pdx1, Nkx6.1, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 were upregulated in MIN6 cells overexpressing microRNA-96. Opposite results were obtained after knockdown of microRNA-96 in MIN6 cells. MicroRNA-96 is upregulated in pancreatic β cells under the pathological condition of T2DM. Overexpression of microRNA-96 promotes proliferative ability and inhibits apoptosis in pancreatic β cells through targeting Foxo1 and Sox6.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Low-dose antibiotics (LDA) have been widely used to enhance growth rate of pigs, providing a good animal model to study the underlying mechanism. In present study, 28 female piglets, weaned at 21 d, were randomly classified into two groups, receiving either a control diet or a diet supplemented with LDA for 4 weeks. The total bacterial load and intestinal microbiota were determined by qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS and RNA-seq were further used to determine the colonic SCFAs and transcriptomes. Results showed that LDA significantly increased growth rate and food intake. The F/ index, Methanosphaera species, and the pathway of "carbohydrate metabolism" were improved by LDA exposure, indicating the better carbohydrate degradation and energy utilization. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated the microbial community contributing to SCFAs production was enriched upon LDA exposure, associating with increased concentrations of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids (caproate, 2-methyl butyrate and 4-methyl valerate). A multivariate linear fitting model analysis highlighted that caproate was positively correlated with two genera (Faecalibacterium and Allisonella) and four differentially expressed genes (ZNF134, TBX5, NEU4 and SEMA6D), which were all significantly increased upon LDA exposure. Collectively, our study indicates that the growth-promoting effect of LDA exposure in early life is associated with the shifts of colonic microbiota to increase utilization of carbohydrates and energy, enhanced SCFAs production and colonic functions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Ghrelin, secreted from the stomach, potentially mediates negative energy states and neuroendocrine control of reproduction by acting through the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). GHSR is expressed in hypothalamic arcuate (ARC) Kisspeptin/Neurokinin  (Tac2)/Dynorphin (KNDy) neurons. Ghrelin is known to inhibit the M-current produced by KCNQ channels in other ARC neurons. In addition, we have shown 17-estradiol (E2) increases Ghsr expression in KNDy neurons 6-fold and increases the M-current in NPY neurons. We hypothesize that E2 increases GHSR expression in KNDy neurons to increase ghrelin sensitivity during negative energy states. Furthermore, we suspect ghrelin targets the M-current in KNDy neurons to control reproduction and energy homeostasis. We utilized ovariectomized (OVX) Tac2-EGFP adult female mice, pre-treated with estradiol benzoate (EB) or oil vehicle and performed whole-cell-patch-clamp recordings to elicit the M-current in KNDy neurons using standard activation protocols in voltage-clamp. Using the selective KCNQ channel blocker XE-991 (40 M) to target the M-current, oil- and EB-treated mice showed a decrease in the maximum peak current by 75.7 ± 13.8 pA (n=10) and 68.0 ± 14.7 pA (n=11), respectively. To determine the actions of ghrelin on the M-current, ghrelin was perfused (100 nM) in oil- and EB-treated mice resulting in the suppression of the maximum peak current by 58.5 ± 15.8 pA (n=9) and 59.2 ± 11.9 pA (n=9), respectively. KNDy neurons appeared more sensitive to ghrelin when pre-treated with EB, revealing that ARC KNDy neurons are more sensitive to ghrelin during states of high E2.© 2019 S.

Embelin has been identified as a small molecular inhibitor of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and has multiple biological activities, including antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antitumor effects. However, the effect of embelin in platelets remains unclear. Thus, this study investigated the antiplatelet mechanism of embelin. Our data revealed that embelin could inhibit platelet aggregation induced by various agonists, including the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Embelin, as well as the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220, markedly reduced PDBu-mediated phosphorylation of the PKC substrate, suggesting that embelin may be a PKC inhibitor for platelets. Embelin could block PKC downstream signaling and events, including the inhibition of protein kinase  and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, granule release, and glycoprotein IIbIIIa activation. Moreover, embelin could delay thrombus formation in the mesenteric microvessels of mice, but did not significantly affect the tail bleeding time. In conclusion, we demonstrated that embelin is a PKC inhibitor and possesses antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects. The further analysis is necessary to more accurately determine clinical therapeutic potential of embelin in all clinical thromboembolic events with disturbance of thrombocyte function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606880>Safety of Ipragliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Pooled Analysis of Phase II/III/IV Clinical Trials.</a></h2><p>Ipragliflozin is a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this pooled analysis was to characterise the safety profile of ipragliflozin based on safety data from published randomised controlled trials.Safety data from 12 randomised, phase II/III/IV placebo-controlled, parallel group, comparative studies of ipragliflozin in patients with T2DM were pooled. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were analysed for patients who had received at least one dose of ipragliflozin 50 mg (n = 1209) or placebo (n = 796) in studies lasting for up to 24 weeks. TEAEs of special interest and serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed, as well as abnormal laboratory test and vital sign measurements.The overall incidences of TEAEs and SAEs between the ipragliflozin and placebo groups were similar, 63.8% vs 59.3% and 2.5% vs 3.3%, respectively. The incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation was lower for ipragliflozin (3.6%) than placebo (6.5%). The incidences of TEAEs of special interest including those related to urinary tract infection, cardiovascular events, renal disorder, fracture, malignant tumours and hypoglycaemia were also similar between the groups. Genital infections were more frequent with ipragliflozin (2.4%) than placebo (0.6%), as were pollakiuria/polyuria (6.0% vs 2.0%), volume depletion (4.9% vs 1.8%) and skin/subcutaneous tissue disorders (7.7% vs 4.4%). There were no reported cases of diabetic ketoacidosis, fractures, lower-limb amputation or Fournier's gangrene in ipragliflozin-treated patients across the 12 studies.In randomised, placebo-controlled trials of patients with T2DM, ipragliflozin was well tolerated, with a similar overall incidence of TEAEs to placebo.

However, the link between -associated microbiota and gastric pathogenesis has not been clarified. We demonstrated that high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding causes intestinal metaplasia, which are precancerous lesions of the stomach, with augmented gastric leptin signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the precise role of leptin signaling in the altered microbiota composition and pathogenesis in the stomach during diet-induced .Male C57 BL/6 J, leptin receptor (Lepr)-mutated db/db, and gastrointestinal epithelium-specific Lepr conditional knockout (T3 -Lepr cKO) mice were fed a HFD or control diet. Gastrointestinal microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequences and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transplantation of gastric microbiota of HFD-fed mice was performed to evaluate metaplasia onset in recipient mice.One week of HFD caused severe microbial dysbiosis in the stomach. The microbiota changes were accompanied by increased gastric leptin, leading to the consequent development of intestinal metaplasia. Transplantation of gastric microbiota from HFD-fed mice induced intestinal metaplasia in recipient mice; however, only a limited effect on pathogenesis was noted. HFD-fed db/db mice did not show a decrease in microbial abundance. Moreover, T3 -Lepr cKO mice failed spontaneous , and suppressed decreased abundance of gastric microbiota and occurrence of intestinal metaplasia during HFD feeding similar to db/db mice.Gastric leptin signaling modulates the gastric microbiota community and regulates the pathogenesis in the gastric mucosa.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Methods The microarray dataset GSE9624 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (DELs) and messenger RNAs (DEMs) were isolated between the childhood  and non- tissue samples. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of isolated DEMs were performed. DELs and DEMs targeted miRNAs were predicted to construct a ceRNA regulatory network. Finally, critical lncRNAs were validated in another dataset. Results A total of 1257 differentially expressed RNAs were screened, including 28 lncRNAs and 1229 mRNAs. In addition, these RNAs were mainly involved in defense response, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, apoptosis, etc. Three lncRNAs (human leukocyte antigen complex 5 [HCP5], long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 839 [LINC00839] and receptor activity modifying protein 2 [RAMP2-AS1]) and two related miRNAs (hsa-miR-17-5p and hsa-miR-27a/-3p) were identified as key RNAs in childhood . Specifically, lncRNA HCP5 interacted with miR-17-5p and miR-27a/ to regulate nemo-like kinase (NLK) and Ras-related protein 2 (RRAS2) via the MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, four genes (RRAS2, NLK, bcl2/adenovirus E1B protein-interacting protein 3 [BNIP3] and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 [PMAIP1]) targeted by miRNAs were predicted as critical genes and might be novel diagnostic biomarkers of childhood .

Muscle mass secretes proteins called myokines that have relevant functions in the regulation of metabolism and health. This study was aimed to evaluate whether a very low-calorie ketogenic (VLCK) diet may modulate myokine levels, in addition to changes in body composition, compared to a standard, balanced low-calorie (LC) diet or bariatric surgery in patients with . Body composition, ketosis, insulin sensitivity and myokines were evaluated in 79 patients with overweight/ after a therapy to lose weight with a VLCK diet, a LC diet or bariatric surgery. The follow-up was 6 months. The weight loss therapies induced changes in myokine levels in association with changes in body composition and biochemical parameters. The effects on circulating myokine levels compared to those at baseline were stronger after the VLCK diet than LC diet or bariatric surgery. Differences reached statistical significance for IL-8, MMP2 and irisin.

Glucose levels were analysed by hexokinase method and insulin levels with electrochemiluminescence. Homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Liver biopsies were evaluated for histological components of NAFLD.A positive association between overall NAFLD activity score and HOMA-IR was found (rs=0.259, p=0.022). As per individual components, lobular inflammation and fibrosis stage were positively associated with HOMA-IR, glucose and insulin levels (p<0.05), and HOMA-IR was higher in patients with more inflammatory foci or higher stage of fibrosis. These findings were independent of age, BMI, triglyceride levels, diabetes status and sex (all, p<0.043). In a combined model, lobular inflammation, but not fibrosis, remained associated with HOMA-IR.In this group of obese subjects, a major contributing histological component of NAFLD to the relation between NAFLD severity and insulin resistance seems to be the grade of hepatic lobular inflammation.

HFD consumption during restricted time was significantly increased in corticostriatal neuron-specific GABAR-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, the GABAR agonist baclofen suppressed HFD intake during restricted time in wild-type mice but not in corticostriatal or dopaminergic neuron-specific GABAR-deficient mice. In contrast, there were no significant differences in food consumption among genotypes under ad libitum access to HFD. Thus, our data show that the mesolimbic system regulates food consumption under time-restricted but not ad libitum access to HFD and have identified a mechanism by which GABAR signaling suppresses binge-like eating of HFD.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

For analysis, subjects were divided into those with BMI < 30 Kg/m (subgroup A, n = 16) vs ≥30 Kg/m (subgroup , n = 16).Tissue dielectric constant at forearm and biceps decreased significantly (P < .001) with increasing depth from 0.5 to 1.5 to 2.5 mm but TDC values and their inter-side ratios did not differ between subgroups A and  at any measured site. Although correlations between TBW, ECW, and ICW were significant (P < .001), there was no dependence of TDC values on any of these parameters.Previously unknown TDC values for obese persons are provided and based on subgroup analyses suggest that skin TDC values in overweight and obese persons are not confounded by variables such as TBW and TBF. Further, since inter-side ratios and their SD's yielded thresholds for forearm and biceps similar to those established for women with normal BMI, use of these clinical inter-arm TDC ratios now is extended to include a wider BMI range.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Using unbiased mass spectrometry, we discover multiple serine phosphorylation sites in the MALT1 C terminus after T cell activation. Phospho-specific antibodies reveal that CBM-associated MALT1 is transiently hyper-phosphorylated upon TCR/CD28 co-stimulation. We identify a dual role for CK1α as a kinase that is essential for CBM signalosome assembly as well as MALT1 phosphorylation. Although MALT1 phosphorylation is largely dispensable for protease activity, it fosters canonical NF-κ signaling in Jurkat and murine CD4 T cells. Moreover, constitutive MALT1 phosphorylation promotes survival of activated  cell-type diffuse large  cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) cells addicted to chronic BCR signaling. Thus, MALT1 phosphorylation triggers optimal NF-κ activation in lymphocytes and survival of lymphoma cells.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

One theory, the 'hygiene hypothesis', involves dysregulated immunity arising after too few beneficial early life microbe exposures. Indeed, earlier studies have shown that gut microbe-immune interactions contribute to smoldering inflammation, adiposity, and weight gain. Here we tested a safe and well-established microbe-based immune adjuvant to restore immune homeostasis and counteract inflammation-associated  in animal models. We found that consuming  exotoxin subunit  (ctB) was sufficient to inhibit age-associated obesogenic outcomes in wild type mice, including reduced crown-like structures (CLS) and granulomatous necrosis histopathology in fat depots. Administration of cholera toxin reduced weight gain irrespective of age during administration; however, exposure during youth imparted greater slenderizing effects when compared with animals receiving ctB for the first time during adulthood. Beneficial effects were transplantable to other -prone animals using immune cells alone, demonstrating an immune-mediated mechanism. Taken together, we concluded that oral vaccination with cholera toxin  helps stimulate health-protective immune responses that counteract age-associated .Copyright: © 2019 Varian et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514755>Increased liver echogenicity and liver enzymes are associated with extreme , adolescent age and male gender: analysis from the German/Austrian/Swiss  registry APV.</a></h2><p>Childhood  is often associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease in pediatrics.This multi-center study analyzed liver echogenicity and liver enzymes in relation to , age, gender and comorbidities.

In this review, we discussed the participation of ROCK protein in cardiac hypertrophy, mainly through the modulation of leptin and insulin signaling pathways. Leptin plays a role in cardiovascular disease development and, through the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), promotes cardiac hypertrophy. ROCK protein, is regulated by small Rho-GTPases and has two isoforms with high homology. ROCK is able to activate the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway and modulate insulin signaling in the heart, participating in cardiac hypertrophy development of concentric and eccentric left ventricle growth. Although different types of stimulus can lead to morphologically antagonistic heart growth, physical exercise promotes improvements in hemodynamic function, emerging as a promising non-pharmacological tool to improve overall health. Leptin can activate ROCK in a pathological way, increasing MAPK activity and decreasing insulin signaling via insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) serine 307 residue phosphorylation, phosphatase and tensin homolog, and protein kinase Cβ2. In turn, physical exercise decreases leptin levels and positively modulates insulin signaling as well as increases ROCK-dependent IRS1 (Ser632/635) phosphorylation, improving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase  axis and promoting physiologic heart growth. Currently, there is a lack of studies about differences in ROCK isoforms, especially during exercise and/or . However, the understanding of its biological function and the complex mechanism underlying the distinct types of cardiac hypertrophy development can be a useful tool in the improvement and treatment of cardiovascular outcomes.Copyright © 2019.

The purpose of this state-of-the-art review was to update current information on deficiencies of vitamins and public health approaches to addressing them. Some stages of life present a higher risk of deficiency than others: risks are higher in pregnant women, children (from conception to young childhood), adolescents, the elderly, and all of the over 800 million people globally who are undernourished. At risk are approximately 125 million preschool children with vitamin A deficiency, as well as sub-populations at risk of deficiencies of folate, thiamin, vitamin B12, niacin, riboflavin, other  vitamins. and vitamin D.

Rosiglitazone is a synthetic ligand while 15-deoxy-Δ -prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ ) is the endogenous agonist of PPARγ. Reticulon 4B (Nogo-) is the detectable Nogo protein family member in the liver and secreted into circulation. Herein, we determined if rosiglitazone can alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis in mice.Wild type, hepatocyte-specific PPARγ or Nogo- knockout mice received intragastric administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and/or rosiglitazone, followed by determination of intrahepatic cholestasis and the involved mechanisms. Serum samples were collected from PBC patients and non-PBC controls to analyze cholestasis-related serum parameters.Rosiglitazone prevented wild type but not hepatocyte-specific PPARγ deficient mice from ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis by activating expression of bile homeostatic molecules, reducing hepatic necrosis, and correcting abnormal serum parameters and bile enterohepatic circulation. Nogo- deficiency had similar protections to rosiglitazone. ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis reduced 15d-PGJ but increased Nogo- in serum, and both were corrected by rosiglitazone. Nogo- deficiency in the liver boosted 15d-PGJ production, thereby activating expression of PPARγ and bile homeostatic molecules. Rosiglitazone and Nogo- deficiency also alleviated cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia. Furthermore, reduced 15d-PGJ and increased Nogo- in PBC patients' serum were determined, with a negative or positive correlation to classical cholestatic parameters. In addition, rosiglitazone reduced symptoms of the established intrahepatic cholestasis.Our study demonstrates that 15d-PGJ and Nogo are important biomarkers for intrahepatic cholestasis. Synthetic PPARγ ligands can be used for treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis and cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia potentially.This article is protected by copyright.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a flavin-dependent monoamine oxidase that can demethylate mono- and dimethylated histone lysines 4 and 9 (H3K4 and H3K9). The removal of methyl groups from the lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins was found to be an important regulatory factor of cell proliferation. However, its role has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we assessed LSD1-mediated cell cycle progression using a human endothelial cell model. The short hairpin RNA knockdown of LSD1 inhibits the G/M phase of cell cycle progression by checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) phosphorylation (S137). We observed elevated DNA damage, which was consistent with the increased detection of double-strand breaks as well as purines and pyrimidines oxidation, which accompanied the activation of ATR/ATRIP signaling by H2AXS139 phosphorylation. The irreversible pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 by 2-phenylcyclopropylamine (2-PCPA) inactivated its enzymatic activity, causing significant changes in heterochromatin and euchromatin conformation assessed by chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit A (CAF1A) and heterochromatin protein 1 isoform α and γ (HP1α/γ) immunofluorescence analysis.

Adipose tissue is now considered as an immune organ, at the crossroads between metabolism and immunity. Thus, this study investigates the effects of adzuki beans on  and gut microbiota in high fat diet-induced mice.In this study, adzuki bean hot water extract (AWE) is determined to have the most significant anti-adipogenic effect; it is able to inhibit lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reduces body weight and adipose tissue weight in a dose-dependent manner. AWE treatment also decreases M1-polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) while inducing M2-polarized ATMs. The number and size of fat vacuoles in liver lesions are significantly reduced, indicating that AWE could ameliorate steatosis in high fat diet-induced mice. The results also demonstrate that AWE-treated groups inhibit adipogenesis via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and reduce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α expression. Moreover, the studies confirm that AWE decreases  through modulating gut microbiota.The results demonstrate that AWE supplementation ameliorates high fat diet-induced  and gut microbiota composition and suggests that AWE may have the potential to be developed into a functional food to improve metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Whether this is true for conventional risk factors is unclear.An individual participant meta-analysis was used to associate the annualised progression of systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with future cardiovascular disease risk in 13 prospective cohort studies of the PROG-IMT collaboration ( = 34,072). Follow-up data included information on a combined cardiovascular disease endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death. In secondary analyses, annualised progression was replaced with average. Log hazard ratios per standard deviation difference were pooled across studies by a random effects meta-analysis. In primary analysis, the annualised progression of total cholesterol was marginally related to a higher cardiovascular disease risk (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07). The annualised progression of systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not associated with future cardiovascular disease risk. In secondary analysis, average systolic blood pressure (HR 1.20 95% CI 1.11 to 1.29) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.16) were related to a greater, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97) was related to a lower risk of future cardiovascular disease events.Averaged measurements of systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol displayed significant linear relationships with the risk of future cardiovascular disease events.

These pathological conditions make mitochondria of a particular interest in the regulation of cell function and death by both apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate mitochondria function, autophagy and apoptosis protein markers in the kidney from rat model of intra-abdominal  and renal damage induced by high sucrose diet. Mitochondria from sucrose fed (SF) kidney in the presence of pyruvate/malate generated hydrogen peroxide (HO) at a higher rate than from control (79.81 ± 4.98 vs 65.84 ± 1.95 pmol/min/mg protein). With succinate, the release of HO was significantly higher compared with pyruvate/malate and it remained higher in SF than in control mitochondria (146.4 ± 8.8 vs 106.1 ± 5.9 pmol/min/mg protein). However, cytochrome c release from SF kidney mitochondria was lower than from control. In addition, cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid was found increased in SF mitochondria due to the enhanced amount of both cardiolipin synthase and tafazzin. Cardiolipin was also found enriched with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids which are less susceptible to peroxidative stress involved in cytochrome c release. Furthermore, Beclin-1, LC3-, as autophagy protein markers, and caspase 9 as apoptosis protein marker, were found decreased in SF kidney. These results suggest that the decline of autophagy protein markers and the lack of apoptosis process could be a pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction leading to the progression of renal disease in SF rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514320>Serum Secretogranin III Concentrations Were Increased in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome and Independently Associated with Fasting Plasma Glucose Levels.</a></h2><p>Secretogranin III (SCG3) plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of secretory granules in endocrine cells, and thus affects glucose homeostasis by regulating insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia are hallmarks of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the role of SCG3 in MetS remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum SCG3 levels and metabolic parameters in subjects with and without MetS. This was a case control study, and 295 subjects were recruited. Serum SCG3 concentrations were compared between groups. Associations between SCG3 levels and clinico-metabolic parameters were also examined. We found serum SCG3 levels were higher in the MetS group than non-MetS group (122.6 ± 79.2 vs. 90.6 ± 58.5 nmol/L,  = 0.009). Specifically, elevated SCG3 levels were found in subjects with high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, central , or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, MetS was an independent factor of serum SCG3 levels in multivariate linear regression analyses. Moreover, FPG, free fatty acids, and waist circumference were positively associated with serum SCG3 concentrations after adjusting for insulin levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, serum SCG3 concentrations were higher in subjects with MetS and were independently associated with FPG levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31492623>Immune Regulation of Metabolic Homeostasis by Helminths and Their Molecules.</a></h2><p>Since time immemorial, humans have coevolved with a wide variety of parasitic helminths that have contributed to shape their immune system. The recent eradication of helminth infections in modern societies has coincided with a spectacular rise in inflammatory metabolic diseases, such as , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and type 2 diabetes. Landmark studies in the emerging field of immunometabolism have highlighted the central role of the immune system in regulating metabolic functions, notably in adipose tissue, liver, and the gut. In this review we discuss how helminths, which are among the strongest natural inducers of type 2 immunity, and some of their unique immunomodulatory molecules, may contribute to the maintenance of tissue-specific and whole-body metabolic homeostasis and protection against -associated meta-inflammation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional study of data recorded from 1992 to 2016, we assessed the association between body mass index and blood pressure levels among adolescent immigrants, aged 16 to 19 years, of Ethiopian origin, and their secular trend of overweight and . Adolescents of Ethiopian origin were classified as Israeli-born (n=16 153) or immigrants (N=23 487), with stratification by age at immigration. Adolescents whose fathers were at least 3 generations in Israel (n=277 789) served as a comparative group. Hypertensive-range blood pressure values adjusted for age, sex, and height served as outcome. Among adolescents of Ethiopian origin, overweight and  (body mass index ≥85th percentile), increased by 2.5 and 4-fold in males and females, respectively, during the study period, compared with a 1.5-fold increase among native Israeli-born males and females. The odds for hypertensive-range measurements increased with the length of residence in Israel: 7.3%, 10.6%, and 14.4% among males who immigrated at ages 12 to 19, 6 to 11.9, and 0 to 5.9 years, respectively; and 11.5%, 16.7%, and 19.3%, respectively, among females. Israeli-born Ethiopians had a significantly higher risk for hypertensive-range measurements at any body mass index level compared with native Israeli-born examinees, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health status. In conclusion, among Ethiopian Israeli adolescents, abnormal blood pressure correlates directly with the time-lapse since immigration.

We examined demographics, weight classifications, yearly weight gain from age 9 years onward, PSG data (apnea-hypopnea index), and tonsil size. We performed a mixed-effect linear regression model to test whether the velocity of weight gain was increased in obese patients with severe OSA when compared to those without severe OSA.This study included 166 obese adolescents, 105 with and 61 without severe OSA. The average age was 14 years and was predominately male (57%) and Hispanic (44%). The regression analysis found that the yearly change in weight among obese adolescents with severe OSA was significantly higher than those without ( = 1.4, standard error = 0.50, P = .005, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-2.4). For the group with severe OSA, weight increased 6.5 kg every year before their PSG, whereas for those without, weight increased 5.1 kg per year.The rate of weight gain over time is an important predictor of severe OSA in obese adolescents.3b Laryngoscope, 2019.© 2019 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669171>Hormonal regulation of visfatin gene in avian Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells.</a></h2><p>Visfain has been extensively studied in mammals and has been shown to play an important role in  and insulin resistance. However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1.2, 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and 2.45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin  for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and -related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin , and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin , and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or . CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin , and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin  treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.Copyright © 2019.

In Europe, about one-third of all refugees are children, an increasing number of which are travelling alone. There are often no systematic medical health assessments for these refugee children on entry in reception countries despite the fact that they are recognised as an at-risk population due to increased burden of physical and mental health conditions. We aimed to perform a systematic review of the literature to describe the health status of refugee children on entering reception countries.A systematic search of published literature was conducted using the terms refugee, immigrant or migrant, medical or health, and screening.Of the 3487 potentially relevant papers, 53 population-based studies were included in this review. This systematic review showed that refugee children exhibit high estimated prevalence rates for anaemia (14%), haemoglobinopathies (4%), chronic hepatitis  (3%), latent tuberculosis infection (11%) and vitamin D deficiency (45%) on entry in reception countries. Approximately one-third of refugee children had intestinal infection. Nutritional problems ranged from wasting and stunting to .Refugee children entering reception countries should receive comprehensive health assessments based on the outcomes of this systematic review, national budgets, cost-effectiveness and personal factors of the refugees. The health assessment should be tailored to individual child health needs depending on preflight, flight and postarrival conditions.A paradigm shift that places focus on child health and development will help this vulnerable group of children integrate into their new environments.122561.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Previous studies have suggested an association between light exposure at night (LAN) and , an important risk factor of atherosclerosis, although it remains unclear whether LAN associates with progression of atherosclerosis. To evaluate the longitudinal association between bedroom LAN intensity and progression of carotid atherosclerosis, light intensity in the bedroom at baseline and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) at baseline and follow-up were measured in 989 elderly participants (945 at baseline and 780 at a median follow-up time of 34 months). The mean age of the participants was 71.4 ± 6.9 years. The average mean and maximal carotid IMT at baseline were 0.88 ± 0.15 and 1.10 ± 0.32 mm, respectively. The median intensity of bedroom LAN was 0.68 lx (IQR, 0.07-3.29). In multivariable analysis adjusted for potential confounders, the highest LAN group exhibited a significant increase in mean carotid IMT (adjusted β, 0.028; 95% CI, 0.005-0.052; P = 0.019) compared with the lowest LAN quartile group. A similar relationship was found between LAN and maximal carotid IMT (adjusted β, 0.083; 95% CI, 0.037-0.129; P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found a clear and significant association between bedroom LAN intensity and progression of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis, which was independent of known risk factors for atherosclerosis, including age, , smoking, economic status, hypertension, and diabetes.

It is a complex metabolic disorder associated with many serious complications and high morbidity. Rice bran is a nutrient-dense by product of the rice milling process. Asia has the world's highest rice production (90% of the world's rice production); therefore, rice bran is inexpensive in Asian countries. Moreover, the high nutritional value of the rice bran suggests its potential as a food supplement promoting health improvements, such as enhancing brain function, lowering blood pressure, and regulating pancreatic secretion. The present study evaluated the anti- effect of rice bran in rats with high-energy diet (HED)-induced . Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into one of five diet groups ( = 10 per group) and fed the following for eight weeks: Normal diet with vehicle treatment, HED with vehicle, rice bran-0.5X (RB-0.5X) (2% wt/wt rice bran), RB-1.0X (4% wt/wt rice bran), and RB-2.0X (8% wt/wt rice bran). Rice bran (RB-1.0X and RB-2.0X groups) markedly reduced , including body weight and adipocyte size. In addition, treating rats with HED-induced  using rice bran significantly reduced the serum uric acid and glucose as well as the liver triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). Furthermore, administration of an HED to obese rats significantly affected hepatic lipid homeostasis by increasing phosphotidylcholine (PC; 18:2/22:6), diacylglycerol (DG; 18:2/16:0), DG (18:2/18:1), DG (18:1/16:0), cholesteryl ester (CE; 20:5), CE (28:2), TG (18:0/16:0/18:3), and glycerol-1-2-hexadecanoate 3-octadecanoate. However, the rice bran treatment demonstrated an anti-adiposity effect by partially reducing the HED-induced DG (18:2/18:1) and TG (18:0/16:0/18:3) increases in obese rats. In conclusion, rice bran could act as an anti- supplement in rats, as demonstrated by partially reducing the HED-induced DG and TG increases in obese rats, and thus limit the metabolic diseases associated with  and the accumulation of body fat and hepatic lipids in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630401>Epidemiology, clinical features, and associated factors in 78 cases of lichen planus on black skin.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of lichen planus (LP) is mostly autoimmune, while psychological and infectious factors are recognized to trigger or aggravate the disease.

Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human , apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human . Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in .Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31479091>Epicardial, paracardial and perivascular fat quantity, genes expression and serum cytokines in coronary artery disease and diabetes.</a></h2><p> and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common disorders that increase cardiovascular (CV) risk and lead to coronary artery disease (CAD).The aim of our study was to assess a link between epicardial fat volume (EFV) and paracardial fat volume (PFV), relative expressions of several genes in EF, PF and perivascular fat (PVF) and corresponding serum cytokines in patients with CAD in relation to DM.   Patients and methods: Sixty-six consecutive patients (33 with DM) with multivessel CAD were included.

Children aged 6-17 years were invited to use COFIT over three days for recording all instances of eating in addition to maintaining written food records (FR). Spearman's correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the intake of macronutrients and micronutrients estimated using the image-based dietary assessment and the FR method. Intra-class correlation coefficients were used to estimate reliability between dietitians. In the final analysis, 23 children (mean age: 10.47 ± 0.47 years) with complete data obtained using two dietary assessment methods were included. Reliability among dietitians was high. Most assessments of macronutrients and micronutrients revealed moderate correlations between the two methods (range: 0.27-0.94); moreover, no significant differences in nutrients assessments were observed between the two methods, except for energy and fat. The average difference in energy intake between the methods was 194 kcal/day. Most limits of agreement were within an acceptable range. The Bland-Altman plots showed robust agreement with minimum bias. The limitation was the small sample size and not dividing the population into children and teenagers since the two groups may have different food consumption habits.

Increased levels of specific liver enzymes in the peripheral blood are typical findings in horses diagnosed with EMS. Current management of EMS is based on caloric restriction and increased physical activity. However, new potential treatment options are arising such as the transplantation of autologous adipose stem cells (ASC). However, cytophysiological properties of ASC derived from EMS horses are impaired which strongly limits their therapeutic potential. We hypothesized, that in vitro pharmacotherapy of those cells with 5-azacytidine (AZA) and resveratrol (RES) before their clinical application can reverse the aged phenotype of those cells and improve clinical outcome of autologous therapy. A 9 year old Dutch Warmblood Horse used for driving, was presented with severe , insulin resistance. After EMS diagnosis, the animal received three intravenous injections of autologous, AZA/RES treated ASCs at weekly intervals.

The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models to explore the potential connection between HCC risk and MS. Cumulative incidences were plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves.After a 45,668.0 person-year follow-up (76.0±30.8 months) of 6,564 subjects who were seropositive for hepatitis  surface antigen (HBsAg), 89 incident HCC cases were identified. MS as a whole was independently associated with a 2-fold increased HCC risk (HR, 2.25, 95%CI: 1.41-3.60) after adjusting for age (in 1-year increment), gender, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, liver cirrhosis and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels. Subjects with 3 or more factors and those with one or two factors had adjusted increased HCC risks of 2.12-fold (95%CI: 1.16-3.89) and 1.28-fold (95%CI:0.74-2.22), respectively, in comparison to those without any metabolic factors. Central  and type 2 diabetes were associated with significantly increased HCC risk, whereas this association was not observed in obese subjects (95%CI: 0.73-3.44).MS as a whole, central  and type 2 diabetes were independently associated with increased HCC risk in a population with HBV infection in mainland China.MS may be a risk factor for HCC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465899>Ambient air pollution and lipid profile: Systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Ambient air pollution (AAP) is recognized a cardiovascular risk factor and lipid profile dysregulation seems to be one of the potential mediators involved. However, results from epidemiologic research on the association between exposure to AAP and altered lipid profile have been inconsistent. This study aims to systematically review and meta-analyse epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to ambient air pollutants (particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, back carbon) and lipid profile parameters (Total cholesterol; High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol; TG-Triglycerides) or dyslipidaemia. Systematic electronic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases (last search on 24th May 2019) using keywords related to the exposure (ambient air pollutants) and to the outcomes (lipid profile parameters/dyslipidaemia). Qualitative and quantitative information of the studies were extracted and fixed or random-effects models were used to obtain a pooled effect estimate per each pollutant/outcome combination. 22 studies were qualitatively analysed and, from those, 3 studies were quantitatively analysed. Particulate matters were the most studied pollutants and a considerable heterogeneity in air pollution assessment methods and outcomes definitions was detected. Age,  related measures, tobacco consumption, sex and socioeconomic factors were the most frequent considered variables for confounding adjustment in the models. In a long-term exposure scenario, we found a 3.14% (1.36%-4.95%) increase in TG levels per 10 μg/m PM increment and a 4.24% (1.37%-7.19%) increase in TG levels per 10 μg/m NO increment. No significant associations were detected for the remaining pollutant/outcome combinations. Despite the few studies included in the meta-analysis, our study suggests some epidemiologic evidence supporting the association between PM and NO exposures and increased TG levels. Due to the very low level of evidence, more studies are needed to clarify the role of lipid profile dysregulation as a mediator on the AAP adverse cardiovascular effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, the risk of erosive esophagitis among obese individuals without -related metabolic unhealthiness, a condition referred to as "metabolically healthy obese (MHO)", remains unclear. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) categories and the development of erosive esophagitis in a cohort of metabolically healthy individuals.We conducted a cohort study of 14,725 asymptomatic adults free of erosive esophagitis and metabolic abnormalities, who underwent repeated health checkups including screening endoscopy. A metabolically healthy state was defined as having no metabolic syndrome components and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance <2.5. The presence of erosive esophagitis was determined using endoscopy.During 81,385.2 person-years of follow-up, 1,865 participants developed erosive esophagitis (incidence rate, 22.9 per 1,000 person-years). The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident erosive esophagitis comparing overweight (BMI 23.0-24.9) and obese (≥25) with normal-weight participants (18.5-22.9) were 1.12 (1.00-1.25) and 1.29 (1.14-1.47), respectively.

Although hepatitis  and C viral infections are still the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the introduction of effective antiviral drugs may control or cure them in the near future. In contrast, the burden of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing for decades, and 25 to 30% of the general population in Korea is estimated to have NAFLD. Over 10% of NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and HCC. NASH is currently the second leading cause to be placed on the liver transplantation list in the United States. NAFLD is associated with , type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. The pathophysiology is complex and associated with lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and insulin resistance. The only proven effective treatment is weight reduction by diet and exercise. However, this may not be effective for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Therefore, effective drugs are urgently needed for treating these conditions. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved for the treatment of NASH. Many pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new drugs for the treatment of NASH. Some of them are in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials. Here, pharmacologic therapies in clinical trials, as well as the basic principles of drug therapy, will be reviewed, focusing on pathophysiology.Copyright © 2019 Yeungnam University College of Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660582>Circulating β-cell-specific CD8+ T cells restricted by high risk HLA class I molecules show antigen experience in children with and at risk of type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoreactive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are implicated in the destruction of insulin-producing β-cells. The HLA-*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin  (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of maqui on the onset and development of the obese phenotype and insulin resistance was investigated in high fat diet-induced obese mice supplemented with a lyophilized maqui berry. Maqui-dietary supplemented animals showed better insulin response and decreased weight gain but also a differential expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, multilocular lipid droplet formation and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). These changes correlated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate response element binding protein  (), the sterol regulatory binding protein 1c () and Cellular repressor of adenovirus early region 1A-stimulated genes 1 () and an improvement in the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) signaling.

Estrogen replacement protects against postmenopausal  but increases the risks of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of long-term treatment of raloxifene (RAL), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the features of estrogen deficiency-induced  and explored the involvement of canonical and non-canonical Wnt regulation in vivo and in vitro.Adult female rats received bilateral OVX and divided into 5 groups: (1) Sham, (2) OVX, (3) OVX + E: OVX rats were administered with E (50 μg/kg, s.c., 3 times/week), (4) OVX + RAL: OVX rats were treated with RAL (gavage, 1 mg/kg/day) suspended in 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), (5) OVX + CMC: 0.8% CMC as vehicle control. All treatments were given for 8 weeks beginning at 1 week after OVX. In 3 T3-L1 cells, the effects of RAL on adipogenesis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation were evaluated.Treatment with RAL significantly decreased body weight, visceral fat pad mass, adipocyte size and plasma levels of glucose but increased plasma adiponectin. RAL reduced the elevation of HIF-1α, VEGF-A and proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1 and TNF-α) expression by inhibition of NF-κ p65 and JNK cascades in retroperitoneal WAT. This anti-inflammatory capacity of RAL may result from upregulation of secreted frizzle-related protein 5 (SFRP5), an adipokine that repressed Wnt5a signaling. Furthermore, RAL inhibited adipogenic factors such as PPAR-γ, C/EBP-α, and FABP4, and preserved canonical Wnt10b/β-catenin protein expression. In 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, RAL (20 μM) diminished lipid accumulation and inhibited adipogenic factors accompanied with the induction of β-catenin, which were effectively reversed by the β-catenin inhibitor IWR-1-endo. In addition, RAL reduced LPS-induced NF-κ p65 and p-Iκ expression as well as TNF-α secretion. Suppression of SFRP5 by small interfering RNA significantly abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of RAL.Distinct activation of canonical β-catenin on inhibition of adipogenesis and non-canonical SFRP5 on suppression of WAT inflammation may contribute to the beneficial effects of RAL. Therefore, this study provides a rationale for the therapeutic potential of RAL for postmenopausal .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31555811>Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 interacts with PGC1α and modulates thermogenic fat activation.</a></h2><p>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are enzymes that regulate the evolutionarily-conserved process of arginine methylation. It has been reported that PRMTs are involved in many metabolic regulatory pathways. However, until now, their roles in adipocyte function, especially browning and thermogenesis, have not been evaluated. Even though Prmt1 adipocyte-specific deleted mice (Prmt1fl/flAQcre) appeared normal at basal level, following cold exposure or β-adrenergic stimulation, impaired induction of the thermogenic program was observed in both the interscapular brown adipose tissue and inguinal white adipose tissue of Prmt1fl/flAQcre mice compared to littermate controls. Different splicing variants of Prmt1 have been reported. Among them, PRMT1V1 and PRMT1V2 are well-conserved between humans and mice. Both variants contribute to the activation of thermogenic fat, with PRMT1V2 playing a more dominant role. Mechanistic studies using cultured murine and human adipocytes revealed that PRMT1V2 mediates thermogenic fat activation through PGC1α, a transcriptional coactivator that has been shown to play a key role in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our data are the first to demonstrate that PRMT1 plays a regulatory role in thermogenic fat function. These findings suggest that modulating PRMT1 activity may represent new avenues to regulate thermogenic fat and mediate energy homeostasis. This function is conserved in human primary adipocytes, suggesting that further investigation of this pathway may ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies against human  and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608562>The Janus Face of Cereals: Wheat-Derived Prebiotics Counteract the Detrimental Effect of Gluten on Metabolic Homeostasis in Mice Fed a High Fat/High Sucrose Diet.</a></h2><p>Cereals are important sources of carbohydrates, but also contain nutrients that could impact adiposity. We analyzed the contribution of gluten on  and the effects of prebiotics -arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)- that can be extracted from gluten-containing cereals.Mice were fed a control diet, Western diet (WD, consisting of high fat/high sucrose), or WD with 5% gluten. Prebiotics were tested in the WD with gluten. Gluten did not increase body weight or intestinal permeability and had a minor effect on ileal inflammation. Gluten decreased the expression of browning markers in the fat, and increased the triglycerides synthesis in the muscle. AXOS decreased body weight and adiposity in fat pads muscle and liver compared to the WD plus gluten. AXOS promoted gluten cleavage by the induction of prolyl endopeptidase that was translated into a reduction of gluten immunogenic peptides. Gluten had minor effects on cecal microbiota composition, whereas prebiotics increased Bifidobacterium, Butyricicoccus, Prevotella and Parasutterella, all negatively correlated to the cecal content of gluten peptides.While gluten may affect metabolic homeostasis, these effects are lessened when gluten is consumed along with cereal-derived fibers.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF-) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf- in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF- expression in PVAT.

However, there is little information about the molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal absorption of siphonaxanthin. In this study, we aimed to elucidate how siphonaxanthin is transported across the intestinal epithelium using differentiated Caco-2 cells (dCaco-2 cells), recombinant proteins, and an animal model. Siphonaxanthin was taken up by dCaco-2 cells, a model of intestinal epithelial cells, and its uptake linearly increased up to at least 6 h. Pharmacological inhibition of Nieman-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), but not that of scavenger receptor class  type 1 (SR-B1), significantly suppressed siphonaxanthin uptake by dCaco-2 cells. Results from an in vitro binding assay suggested that the N-terminal domain of NPC1L1, which is an extracellular domain of NPC1L1, binds with siphonaxanthin. Moreover, pretreatment with ezetimibe, an inhibitor of NPC1L1, significantly decreased the plasma level of siphonaxanthin following oral administration in mice. Considered together, we concluded that NPC1L1 promotes siphonaxanthin transport across the intestinal epithelium.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653610>The Effect of Metabolic Syndrome on the Occurrence of Restenosis After Carotid Endarterectomy.</a></h2><p>The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The effect of MetS on clinical outcome in patients with cerebrovascular disease remains largely unknown because conflicting results have been published. This study aimed to determine the influence of MetS on the occurrence of restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).All patients who underwent CEA between June 2003 and December 2014 in two tertiary academic referral centres in The Netherlands were included. MetS was defined if three or more of the following criteria were present: hypertension, , high fasting serum blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, or low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of ipsilateral restenosis after index surgery. The secondary outcome measure was (all cause) mortality during follow up. For the primary analysis, missing data were multiply imputed using multivariable imputation by chained equations. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to perform an adjusted analysis on the multiply imputed data sets.A total of 1668 CEA procedures (in 1577 patients) were performed. The presence or absence of MetS could not be determined in 263 patients because of missing data. There was no significant difference in freedom from restenosis in the MetS group vs. the no-MetS group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.23; p = .10) or in all cause mortality (HR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94-1.54; p = .14).This study shows that MetS does not predict restenosis after CEA. Also, the presence of MetS did not influence patient survival negatively.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier .V.

A distinction can be made in an early and late onset type. The disease seems to have a predisposition for certain descends. Since the first publication of Blount's disease, different hypotheses on the aetiology are proposed but no consensus exists. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the available hypotheses on the aetiology of Blount's disease since its first description and assessment of the available level of evidence, the quality of evidence and the occurrence of bias supporting these individual hypotheses. A systematic search according to the PRISMA statement was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library using a broad combination of terminology to ascertain a complete selection. Proper MESH search criteria were formulated and the bibliographic search was limited to English and Dutch language articles. Articles with no mention of aetiology or a disease related to Blount's were excluded. Level of evidence and types of bias were assessed. Thirty-two articles that discuss the aetiology of Blount's disease were selected. A variety of hypotheses was postulated in these articles with most research in the field of increased mechanical pressure (, early walking age) and race (descend). Blount's disease most likely has a multifactorial origin with influence of genetic and racial predisposition, increased mechanical pressure on the growth plate as a consequence of  or early walking age and possibly also nutrition. However, the exact aetiology remains unclear, the probable explanation is that multifactorial factors are all contributing to the development of Blount's disease. Histological research has shown that a disorganization of bone and cartilage structures on the medial side of the proximal tibial physis is present in patients with Blount's disease. Based on the available evidence on the aetiology of Blount's disease, we conclude that it is multifactorial. Most papers focus only on one hypotheses of Blount's disease occurrence and all are characterized as low level of evidence. There seems to be a preference for certain descends. Further research on especially genetic predisposition is needed to provide more insight in this factor of Blount's disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31496244>Identification of Novel Urolithin Metabolites in Human Feces and Urine after the Intake of a Pomegranate Extract.</a></h2><p>Urolithins are bioactive gut microbiota metabolites of ellagic acid. Here, we have identified four unknown urolithins in human feces after the intake of a pomegranate extract. The new metabolites occurred only in 19% of the subjects. 4,8,9,10-Tetrahydroxy urolithin, (urolithin M6R), was unambiguously identified by H NMR, UV, and HRMS. Three metabolites were tentatively identified by the UV, HRMS, and chromatographic behavior, as 4,8,10-trihydroxy (urolithin M7R), 4,8,9-trihydroxy (urolithin CR), and 4,8-dihydroxy (urolithin AR) urolithins. Phase II conjugates of the novel urolithins were detected in urine and confirmed their absorption, circulation, and urinary excretion. The production of the new urolithins was not specific of any of the known urolithin metabotypes A and . The new metabolites needed a bacterial 3-dehydroxylase activity for their production, and this is a novel feature as all the previously known urolithins maintained the hydroxyl at 3 position. The ability of production of these "R" urolithins can be considered an additional metabolic feature for volunteer stratification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602927>[Cloning and characterization of a monoterpene synthase gene from Tripterygium wilfordii].</a></h2><p>Tripterygium wilfordii is a medicinal plant commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,and with pharmacological activities in anti-tumor and  treatment. The known active ingredients in T. wilfordii are mainly terpenoids,but with very low content. Therefore,the analysis of the biosynthesis pathway of terpenoids in T. wilfordii has become a research hotspot to solve the problem of its resources. Terpenoid synthase( TPS) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the formation of a wide variety of terpenoid skeletons. In this study,a gene fragment with an ORF of 1 785 bp was cloned from T. wilfordii. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using NCBI's BLASTP,ProtParam and Interpro online tools and MEGA 6.0 software. The response of this gene to methyl jasmonate was also detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR,and its catalytic function was verified by prokaryotic expression and in vitro enzymatic assay. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence encoded by this gene had both N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain of TPS,as well as the DDxx D conserved domain of the class I of TPS family. And Tw MTS gathered together with TPS- subfamily in the Neighbor-Joining Tree constructed with known homologous TPSs. The results of RT-PCR showed that 50 μmol·L-1 MeJA 12 h could increase the expression of Tw MTS to 735 times in the control group at 12 h,and 1 644 times at 24 h. In addition,in vitro enzymatic reaction results showed that Tw MTS can catalyze the production of β-citronellol with GPP as substrate,indicating that Tw MTS was a monoterpene synthase. The above results provided a new element for the synthetic biology database of T. wilfordii terpenoids,and laid the foundation for future biosynthesis research.</p></html>
